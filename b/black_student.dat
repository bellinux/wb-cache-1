5|$|Following the 1968 NUSAS {{conference in}} Johannesburg, {{many of its}} members {{attended}} a July 1968 conference of the University Christian Movement at Stutterheim. There, the black African members decided to hold a December conference to discuss {{the formation of an}} independent <b>black</b> <b>student</b> group. The South African Students' Organisation (SASO) was officially launched at a July 1969 conference at the University of the North; there, the group's constitution and basic policy platform were adopted. The group's focus was on the need for contact between centres of <b>black</b> <b>student</b> activity, including through sport, cultural activities, and debating competitions. Though Biko played a substantial role in SASO's creation, he sought a low public profile during its early stages, believing that this would strengthen its second level of leadership, such as his ally Barney Pityana. Nonetheless, he was elected as SASO's first president; Pat Matshaka was elected vice president and Wuila Mashalaba elected secretary. Durban became its de facto headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1909, the Red & <b>Black</b> <b>student</b> {{newspaper}} has {{a weekly}} circulation of 1,250 copies. The student staff handles {{all aspects of}} the production, including writing, editing, graphic design, layout, and advertising sales. The Red & Black features local and national news, student opinion, and college athletics coverage. During the 1860s, students published a satirical newspaper called The Bogus Tract.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the school}} {{integrated}} racially (sometime around 1970), <b>black</b> <b>students</b> had protested against verbal abuse used against <b>black</b> <b>students</b> by the principal, a white person; white teachers giving failing grades to black students; and the calling of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> [...] "nigger" [...] and [...] "nigra".|$|R
50|$|In 1965, thirty-five <b>black</b> <b>students</b> {{enrolled}} in the previously all-white New Kent school. More than a hundred additional <b>black</b> <b>students</b> enrolled each year in 1966 and 1967. The newly enrolled <b>black</b> <b>students</b> reported harassment by their white peers, to which teachers and administrators turned a blind eye.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{research}} by Eric Hanushek, John Kain, and Steven Rivkin {{has shown that}} the level of achievement by <b>black</b> <b>students</b> is adversely affected by higher concentrations of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> in their schools.

5|$|Higginbotham {{transferred}} to Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1945. On {{the day that}} Higginbotham entered Antioch, one other <b>black</b> <b>student</b> was also admitted, Coretta Scott, who would later become Coretta Scott King after marrying Martin Luther King Jr.. At Antioch, Higginbotham served {{as the head of}} the college chapter of the NAACP. During a conference of Ohio State collegiate NAACP chapters, Higginbotham successfully advocated for legislation to lower the voting age to 18. Higginbotham earned his B.A. in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also {{explored}} {{this issue}} in Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation (2010). He said that segregated black schools had featured teachers, counselors, and others of the same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of many public schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A <b>black</b> <b>student</b> trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as trying to leave the minority group.|$|E
5|$|Student {{activism}} became {{common in}} the 1960s, reflecting the various social and political events of the time period. Vietnam War protests were common in downtown Bowling Green and on campus. In 1969, a <b>Black</b> <b>Student</b> Union formed to encourage unity, scholarship, leadership, culture and political awareness of African Americans students. The majority of student activism at BGSU was peaceful and Bowling Green was the only public college or university in Ohio to remain open {{in the spring of}} 1970, following the Kent State shootings during anti-war protests.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore some of the factors White {{educators}} need to teach <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> effectively. It examined what role the race of the teachers may play in Black students' academic success and whether White teachers are able and willing to meet the educational needs of <b>Black</b> <b>students.</b> Eight White teachers were interviewed. In this study, race is defined as a grouping of individuals who display the same phenotypic skin color by which people in the United States identify themselves and are identified by others. Today's reality is that more and more <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> are being taught by White teachers in public schools even where <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> are a majority. There are still marked disparities in the academic achievement between <b>Black</b> and White <b>students.</b> The gap between the academic achievement of White and <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> in public secondary schools is increasing. White teachers have not been properly prepared by their pre-service education programs and in-service training to teach <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> effectively. White teachers recognized that their preparation and training for teaching came out of their own cultural background for the traditional students, either White students or students who conform to mainstream Eurocentric standards, and that they are not being held responsible and accountable for the productive academic achievement of the <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> they teach. White teachers did not identify with their <b>Black</b> <b>students,</b> and they dealt with <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> from their "White privilege" perspective. This study revealed the presence of racism in the public school and that the race of the teacher did affect the achievement of <b>Black</b> <b>students.</b> It pointed out that White teachers fear the <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> they teach. White teachers need to be antiracist educators. They must understand racism and how different forms of racism affect their belief systems and their philosophies of teaching. Also they should know and understand how these forms of racism affect the academic achievement of the <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> they teach. The concept of "customer" being applied to teaching <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> might encourage White teachers to be more responsive, accountable and productive in teaching <b>Black</b> <b>students...</b>|$|R
50|$|Hanushek et al. {{also found}} that {{achievement}} levels of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> (but not of white or Hispanic students) appeared to be systematically lowered {{in the presence of}} large concentrations of other <b>black</b> <b>students</b> in their school. They found this effect to be especially pronounced among the highest-achieving <b>black</b> <b>students.</b> These results, in their view, underscore the importance of school integration.|$|R
40|$|A {{case study}} of <b>black</b> college <b>students</b> at a {{predominantly}} white liberal arts college is employed to question continuing assumptions in sociological research that blacks represent social, cultural, and economic homogeneity and that intraracial relations are close and without con¯ict. The article examines {{the extent to which}} <b>black</b> <b>students</b> feel close to other <b>black</b> <b>students</b> on campus, rely on one another for need satisfaction and social interaction, and share similar values, experiences, and attitudes. The authors ®nd that the odds of closeness are signi®cantly reduced for biracial <b>students,</b> for <b>black</b> <b>students</b> from low SES backgrounds, and for <b>black</b> <b>students</b> from predominantly white backgrounds. Among biracial students and those from predominantly white environments, social distance re-¯ects their overall distance from the larger black community and is a function of their lack of ªracial awareness. º The social distance of low SES students appears speci®c to the community of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> within the college and is not expressed toward the larger black community. Moreover, feelings of distance appear to be driven by perceived social, cultural, and economic differences from other <b>black</b> <b>students...</b>|$|R

5|$|Further student protests, {{including}} {{hunger strike}} and more barricades of Hamilton Hall and the Business School {{during the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, were aimed at convincing the university trustees to divest all of the university's investments in companies that were seen as active or tacit supporters of the apartheid regime in South Africa. A notable upsurge in the protests occurred in 1978, when following {{a celebration of the}} tenth anniversary of the student uprising in 1968, students marched and rallied in protest of university investments in South Africa. The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the <b>Black</b> <b>Student</b> Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U.S. university.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the attitudes of}} <b>Black</b> and White <b>students</b> in academically gifted programs to determine if attitudes of <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> toward giftedness and toward their peers in programs for the gifted are {{a factor in the}} under-representation of <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> in gifted programs. Sixty-five students in ninth grade in a Richmond, Virginia, school for the gifted, who had attended a regular public school program for the gifted the year before, were surveyed, with usable responses from 15 <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> and 33 White students. Survey results indicated that {{there were no significant differences}} in attitudes of Black and White gifted students toward giftedness and toward people in programs for the gifted. All <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> and 97 % of White students were pleased to be identified as academically gifted. The majority of all students enjoyed programs for the gifted and felt that they were worthwhile. All the <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> and 85 % of White students felt they learned a lot from their classes for the gifted. While a small percentage of <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> indicated more negative attitudes by peers, this was offset by more White students who felt left out of activities by their friends and who were teased about being in the gifted program. The paper concludes with suggestions for including more <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> in programs for the academically gifted. An appendix contains comments by gifted <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> and bar graphs depicting responses by <b>Black</b> and White <b>students</b> on each questionnaire item. (JDD) ***************e.

One reason for the decline in the percentage of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> is the move of black people to suburbs; they did so due to a perception that public schools there have a higher quality than those in DISD, as well as general desires for higher quality housing and lower crime environments. Another reason was the growth in charter schools which take students who would otherwise attend DISD schools; in 2010 5,900 <b>black</b> <b>students</b> attending charter schools in the area lived in the DISD boundaries. Other reasons for the decline in the percentage of <b>black</b> <b>students</b> included a perception that DISD has moved its focus away from <b>black</b> <b>students</b> and towards Hispanic students, and the fact that many Hispanics have moved into traditionally black neighborhoods.|$|R
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>students</b> are alarmingly {{underrepresented}} in participation in study abroad experiences.

Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are regarded as sanctuaries for <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> with emphasis on their commitment to providing low-income <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> with positive and nurturing educational experiences. As such, HBCUs {{are believed to be}} positioned to assist in overcoming the barriers to participation in study abroad for <b>Black</b> <b>students.</b> However, because they receive significantly less resources, they are limited in their ability to provide adequate programming and initiatives. In this conceptual paper, student engagement and marginality and mattering theories are used to explore strategies and recommendations for ways that HBCUs can both enhance their programs and increase overall engagement of <b>Black</b> <b>students</b> in study abroad...|$|R
