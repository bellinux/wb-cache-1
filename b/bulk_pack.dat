40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} mean package size and manufacturer-recommended serving size of sweet {{beverages}} available in four high-income countries: Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand. DESIGN: Cross-sectional surveys. SETTING: The two largest supermarket chains {{of each country}} in 2012 / 2013. SUBJECTS: Individual pack size (IPS) drinks (n 891) and <b>bulk</b> <b>pack</b> size (BPS) drinks (n 1904). RESULTS: For all IPS drinks, the mean package size was larger than the mean serving size (mean (sd) = 412 (157) ml and 359 (159) ml, respectively). The mean (sd) package size of IPS drinks was significantly different for all countries (range: Australia= 370 (149) ml to New Zealand= 484 (191) ml; P< 0 · 01). The mean (sd) package size of Dutch BPS drinks (1313 (323) ml) was significantly smaller compared with the other countries (New Zealand= 1481 (595) ml, Australia= 1542 (595) ml, Canada= 1550 (434) ml; P< 0 · 01). The mean (sd) serving size of BPS drinks was significantly different across all countries (range: Netherlands= 216 (30) ml to Canada= 248 (31) ml; P< 0 · 00). New Zealand had the largest package and serving sizes of the countries assessed. In all countries, {{a large number of}} different serving sizes were used to provide information on the amount appropriate to consume in one sitting. CONCLUSIONS: At this point there is substantial inconsistency in package sizes and manufacturer-recommended serving sizes of sweet beverages within and between four high-income countries, especially for IPS drinks. As consumers do factor serving size into their judgements of healthiness of a product, serving size regulations, preferably set by governments and global health organisations, would provide consistency and assist individuals in making healthier food choices...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} a numerical simulation of a two-dimensional Eden model with random-size particles. In the present model, the particle radii are generated from a Gaussian distribution with mean μ {{and standard deviation}} σ. First, we have examined the <b>bulk</b> <b>packing</b> fraction for the Eden cluster and investigated {{the effects of the}} standard deviation and the total number of particles N_T. We show that the <b>bulk</b> <b>packing</b> fraction depends on the number of particles and the standard deviation. In particular, for the dependence on the standard deviation, we have determined the asymptotic value of the <b>bulk</b> <b>packing</b> fraction in the limit of the dimensionless standard deviation. This value is larger than the packing fraction obtained in a previous study of the Eden model with uniform-size particles. Secondly, we have investigated the packing fraction of the entire Eden cluster including the effect of the interface fluctuation. We find that the entire packing fraction depends on the number of particles while it is independent of the standard deviation, in contrast to the <b>bulk</b> <b>packing</b> fraction. In a similar way to the <b>bulk</b> <b>packing</b> fraction, we have obtained the asymptotic value of the entire packing fraction in the limit N_T→∞. The obtained value of the entire packing fraction is smaller than that of the bulk value. This fact suggests that the interface fluctuation of the Eden cluster influences the packing fraction.

In this regime, the <b>bulk</b> <b>packing</b> fraction (away from the top free surface and the bottom plate boundary) remains constant as a function of depth z, of the pile. The velocity profile in the direction of flow vx(z) scales with height of the pile H, according to vx(z) ∝Hα, with α= 1. 52 ± 0. 05.

Specifically, if the size of the square pattern is smaller than the characteristic grain size the hexagonally packed microdomains form a single-crystal oriented along the edges of the pattern and with "edge-boundaries" located preferentially at the perimeter of the pattern. If the size of the pattern is comparable with the natural bulk period of the copolymer, the packing symmetry changes from hexagonal to square. In this case the ordering induced by the pattern edges becomes dominant allowing the square lattice to be more stable than the hexagonal one...|$|R

While {{empirical}} predictions of the flow rate, based on scaling laws, have existed {{for more than a}} century (Hagen 1852, translated in [1] - Beverloo et al. [2]), recent advances have be made on the understanding of the control parameters of the flow. In particular, using continuous modeling together with a mu(I) granular rheology seem to be successful in predicting the flow rate for large numbers of beads at the aperture (Staron et al. [3], [4]). Moreover Janda et al. [5] have shown that the packing fraction at the outlet plays an important role when the number of beads at the apeture decreases. Based on these considerations, we have studied experimentally the discharge flow of a granular media from a rectangular silo. We have varied two main parameters: the angle of the hopper, and the <b>bulk</b> <b>packing</b> fraction of the granular material by using bidisperse mixtures. We propose a simple physical model to describe the effect of these parameters, considering a continuous granular media with a dilatancy law at the outlet.
