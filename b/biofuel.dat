40|$|This report {{reviews the}} current status of second {{generation}} <b>biofuels.</b> First generation <b>biofuels</b> continue to be substantially subsidized, and this has contributed to the increasing use of such fuel. However, recent studies claim that the future of <b>biofuels</b> lies in second generation <b>biofuels,</b> in particular biochemical ethanol made from cellulose. Thus, in this report we ask the following three questions: How far is second generation <b>biofuels</b> from being a competitive GHG abatement technology? Is it likely that first generation <b>biofuels</b> will bridge the development of second generation <b>biofuels?</b> Should trade policy be used to protect domestic infant second generation <b>biofuels</b> industry from import of low cost first generation <b>biofuels</b> from developing countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} national, {{regional and}} international <b>biofuels</b> policies and strategies to assess whether these policies promote or undermine the development of <b>biofuels</b> sector in Africa. Despite having a huge comparative advantage in land, labour and good climatic conditions favourable for the growing of energy crops, few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have included <b>biofuels</b> strategies in their energy or national development policies. Further results show that while developed countries commit huge financial resources for research, technology development {{and the provision of}} tax-incentives to both producers and consumers, there is little government support for promoting <b>biofuels</b> in Africa. Although the consequences of <b>biofuels</b> on food supply remain uncertain, the mandatory blending of <b>biofuels</b> with fossil fuels by industrialized countries will create demand for land in Africa for the growing of energy crops for <b>biofuels.</b> This paper urgently calls upon national governments in Sub-Saharan Africa to develop appropriate strategies and regulatory frameworks to harness the potential economic opportunities from <b>biofuels</b> sector development, while protecting the environment and rural communities from the adverse effects of land alienation from the mainstream agriculture towards the growing of energy crops for <b>biofuels</b> at the expense of traditional food crops. <b>Biofuels</b> Energy policies Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
