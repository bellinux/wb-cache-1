The newly developed displacement dependent semi-active hydraulic damper (DSHD) is a kind of hydraulic damper to reduce the structural response. The DSHD is a fixture connecting the brace and the structure. At a seismic loading, the DSHD is functioned to dissipate the energy at the transition of bracing from the tensile constraint to the compressive constraint or in reverse. When a structure suffers a large seismic excitation, the overflow function is triggered to prevent the failure of a <b>bracing</b> <b>member.</b> That is, at the stress in the linked brace reaching a certain value, it will start the opening of the overflow valve maintaining an aptotic pressure for confining the bracing deformation within the design value.

Slender steel structural elements widely used in bridge superstructures and braced substructures to resist these loads are built primarily for tension, however, and can buckle under compressive loads.

Efficiency of using BRBs in enhancing the strength and stiffness of a structural frame is compared with that of Ordinary Concentrically Bracing system (OCBs) under various fire scenarios. The proposed numerical model is verified by a series of full-scale fire tests carried out on an 8 -storey structure at Cardington. The results indicate that the vertical movement of heated (buckled) column in the structural frame with BRBs is lesser than that with OCBs.

Also, BRB elements can perform better in redistributing the load sustained by heated columns without any buckling occurrence in the <b>bracing</b> <b>member,</b> in comparisons to the ordinary system.

In the incremental dynamic analysis, after plotting the IDA diagrams of the accelerograms, the collapse diagrams in the limit states are determined. These diagrams yield that for a constant knee length with reduced moment of inertia, the probability of collapse in limit states heightens and also for a constant knee moment of inertia with increasing length, the probability of collapse in limit states increases.|$|E

In this study, a variety of post reinforcement methods were investigated in order to strengthen the lateral resisting force of the post installed on an embankment.

Twelve shake table tests were performed on full-scale single storey frames, each containing a pair of identical <b>brace</b> <b>members.</b> The experimental programme examined the behaviour of <b>brace</b> <b>members</b> with four different square and rectangular hollow cross-sections {{and a range of}} gusset plate connection details. The aim of the experimental {{study was to determine the}} influence of brace and gusset plate properties on CBF response from serviceability to ultimate limit states, including collapse. Consequently, all test frames were subjected to three levels of seismic excitation: (i) low-level excitation to examine elastic frame response, (ii) medium-level excitation to examine brace buckling and yielding effects, and (iii) high-level excitation to induce brace fracture. A detailed set of data on the seismic response of CBFs with realistic <b>brace</b> <b>members</b> and connections were obtained from the tests. The experiments were conducted under representative dynamic response conditions as opposed to the conventional idealised quasi-static loading procedures employed in previous experimental investigations of CBF behaviour. The results faithfully capture the behaviour of brace-gusset plate test specimens with different non-dimensional brace slenderness, brace cross-section slenderness, connection types and gusset plate detailing. The response variables measured in each test included the shaking table and frame accelerations and displacements, brace elongation and axial force, and <b>brace</b> <b>member</b> and gusset plate strains. The experimental observations include elastic frame vibration properties, acceleration and drift demands, ultimate failure modes and ductility capacity. The brace-gusset plate test specimens remained elastic at low-level excitations, brace buckling and yielding occurred in all medium-level excitation tests, while specimens exhibited brace fracture under high-level excitation. Fracture did not occur in the gusset plate connections irrespective of whether these were designed using a conventional design method with a Standard Linear Clearance (SLC), or a balanced design with an Elliptical Clearance (EC). However, the balanced design approach showed more uniform distribution of plastic strains and led to higher brace ductility capacities when compared to the conventional design method.

These devices utilize the yielding of mild-steel plates, like Added Damping and Stiffness (ADAS) elements. The proper selection of design parameters of these devices has an important effect on the structural inelastic behavior. One of these parameters is ratio of the <b>bracing</b> <b>member</b> stiffness to the damper devise stiffness (B/D). Previous studies recommended that a B/D ratio of about 2 be used for the design of the ADAS elements in all stories of the buildings. In this paper, it is shown that using a fixed amount of B/D ratio for all stories may not lead to the uniform distribution of ductility. Therefore, the employment of such a B/D distribution does not guarantee the optimum use of dampers in the nonlinear range of behavior. Here, a method based on the concept of uniform distribution of deformation is implemented to optimize the dynamic response of building frames with bracing members and ADAS devices subjected to several strong ground motion records considering non-fixed B/D ratio in different stories. The results of nonlinear dynamic analyses for several buildings with different heights show that a B/D ratio more than 2 is needed in the upper stories, whereas a ratio less than 2 is needed in the lower stories for optimum dynamic behavior of the building...|$|E

The non-linear numerical models of the frame presented by the authors have been validated against the experimental results. These validated models have been examined under both quasi-static and dynamic impact loads with operational pre-loading applied.

Performance of the structure is largely dependent {{on the ability of}} the key dissipative components, in this case the diagonal <b>bracing</b> <b>members,</b> to undergo significant inelastic deformations. Whilst many earlier studies have examined the hysteretic response of <b>bracing</b> <b>members,</b> comparatively less attention has been given to the ultimate behaviour and failure conditions. There are also significant uncertainties in existing models for predicting the ductility capacity of braces owing to their semi-empirical nature as well as the scatter of test results. This research project examines the cyclic behaviour of tubular braces made of a familiar structural material, carbon steel, and an increasing popular alternative structural material, stainless steel, which is known for its high tensile ductility. As part of the current study, laboratory tests were performed on hot-rolled carbon steel, cold-formed carbon steel and cold-formed austenitic stainless steel hollow section members and materials coupon cut from them. A total of 24 tensile coupon tests, 62 cyclic material tests and 16 cyclic member tests were conducted. Strain-life relationships of the materials under low and extremely low cycle fatigue regimes were established from the results of the cyclic material tests. These data were also used for calibrating material cyclic hardening models, which were incorporated in numerical models of hollow section members. These models, verified against the results of the cyclic member tests from this study and other research programmes, were employed in parametric studies to investigate the influence of member geometry and material properties on the behaviour of the <b>bracing</b> <b>members.</b> Although the three materials exhibit similar strain-life relationships, cold-formed stainless steel members perform better in terms of displacement ductility and energy dissipation, which is due to the cyclic hardening and higher post-yield stiffness of the stainless steel material.

40|$|The {{traditional}} design {{method of}} gusset plates neglects the frame deformation 2 ̆ 7 s effect, {{which could lead}} to under designing the gusset plate. The traditional design method only considers the stress caused by the <b>bracing</b> <b>member</b> in tension, which creates tension and shear stresses in the gusset plate, however, the deformation of the column and beam connected to the gusset plate introduce compressive stresses, potentially increasing the stress in the gusset plate. The following factors are studied using finite element method: (a) the relative stiffness between the beam, the column and the bracing element, and (b) the configuration of the gusset plate. Two gusset plate configurations and two beam and column cross sections were used to compare the results. To determine the increase caused by the frame deformation two approaches were used; approach I ignores frame deformation while approach II takes into consideration the effects of frame deformation. This study concludes that factor b, the configuration of the gusset plate, has the greatest impact on the increase of stress {{at the end of the}} weld. Additionally, factor a, the relative stiffness between the beam to bracing element and column to bracing element, has a slightly less significant impact on the gusset plate stress than the configuration of the gusset plate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} summarizes both {{experimental and}} analytical {{studies on the}} seismic response of conventional steel concentrically braced frame systems of the type widely used in North America, and preliminary studies of an innovative hybrid braced frame system: the Strong-Back System. The research work is part of NEES small group project entitled "International Hybrid Simulation of Tomorrow's Braced Frames. " In the experimental phase, {{a total of four}} full-scale, one-bay, two-story conventional braced frame specimens with different <b>bracing</b> <b>member</b> section shapes and gusset plate-to-beam connection details were designed and tested at the NEES@Berkeley Laboratory. Three braced frame specimens were tested quasi-statically using the same predefined loading protocol to investigate the inelastic cyclic behavior of code-compliant braced frames at both the global and local level. The last braced frame specimen was nearly identical to one of those tested quasi-statically. However, it was tested using hybrid simulation techniques to examine the sensitivity of inelastic behavior on loading sequence and to relate the behavior observed to different levels of seismic hazard. Computer models of the test specimens were developed using two different computer software programs. In the software framework OpenSees fiber-based line elements were used to simulate global buckling of members and yielding and low-cycle fatigue failure at sections. The LS-DYNA analysis program was also used to model individual struts and the test specimens using shell elements with adaptive meshing and element erosion features. This program provided enhanced ability to simulate section local buckling, strain concentrations and crack development. The numerical results were compared with test results to assess and refine and the ability of the models to predict braced frame behavior. A series of OpenSees numerical cyclic component simulations were then conducted using the validated modeling approach. Two hundred and forty pin-ended struts with square hollow structural section shape were simulated under cyclic loading to examine the effect of width-to-thickness ratios and member slenderness ratios on the deformation capacity and energy dissipation characteristics of brace members. The concept of a hybrid system, consisting of a vertical elastic truss or strong-back, and a braced frame that responds inelastically, is proposed herein to mitigate the tendency of weak-story mechanisms to form in conventional steel braced frames. A simple design strategy about member sizing of the proposed Strong-Back System is provided in this study. To assess the ability of the new Strong-Back System to perform well under seismic loading, a series of inelastic analyses were performed considering three six-story hybrid braced frames having different bracing elements, and three six-story conventional brace frames having different brace configurations. Monotonic and cyclic quasi-static inelastic analyses and inelastic time history analyses were carried out. The braced frame system behavior, <b>bracing</b> <b>member</b> force-displacement hysteresis loops, and system residual drifts were the primary response quantities examined. These indicated that the new hybrid system was able to achieve its design goals. Experimental results show for the same loading history that the braced frame specimen using round hollow structural sections as brace members has the largest deformation capacity among the three types of bracing elements studied. Beams connected to gusset plates at the column formed plastic hinges adjacent to the gusset plate. The gusset plates tend to amplify the rotation demands at these locations and stress concentrations tended to result in early fractures of the plastic hinges that form. To remedy this problem, pinned connection details used in the last two specimens; these proved to prevent failures at these locations under both quasi-static and pseudo-dynamic tests. Failure modes observed near the column to base plate connections in all of the specimens suggest the need for further study. Both OpenSees and LS-DYNA models developed in this study predict the global braced frame behavior with acceptable accuracy. In both models, low-cycle fatigue damage models were needed to achieve an acceptable level of fidelity. Shell element models were able to predict local behavior and the mode of failures with greater but not perfect confidence. OpenSees analysis results show that the proposed hybrid braced frames would perform better than conventional braced frames and that the story deformations are more uniform.

40|$|Cast modular {{components}} {{have been}} under development for earthquake resistant steel structures. These concepts {{take advantage of the}} versatility in geometry afforded with the casting process to create components specifically configured for ductile behavior. Two systems were developed as part of this dissertation research: (1) the Cast Modular Ductile Bracing system (CMDB); (2) the Floating Brace system (FB). The CMDB system makes use of cast components introduced at the ends and the center of the brace to produce a special bracing detail with reliable strength, stiffness and deformation capacity. The system takes advantage of the versatility in geometry offered by the casting process to create configurations that eliminate non-ductile failure modes in favor of stable inelastic deformation capacity. This thesis presents analytical research performed to determine the buckling strength and buckling direction of the bracing element based on the geometries of the cast components. Limiting geometries are determined for the cast components to control the buckling direction. Design formulas for buckling strength are proposed. The Floating Brace system is a new lateral bracing concept developed for steel special concentric braced frames. The concept uses a set of special plate details {{at the end of the}} brace to create a stiff, strong and ductile lateral bracing system. The plates are arranged such that some provide direct axial support for high initial stiffness and elimination of fatigue issues for daily service wind loads. The remaining plates are oriented transverse to the brace and thus provide ductile bending response for the rare earthquake event, in which the axial plates become sacrificial. The main <b>bracing</b> <b>member</b> and cast pieces remain elastic or nearly elastic. Thus, following the seismic event, the plates can be replaced. In this thesis, analytical studies using nonlinear finite element analysis are performed to determine the optimum: (a) relative strength of the end connection to the brace; and (b) ratio of strength between axial and transverse plates. Design equations are provided. Prototypes for each concept were developed. Castings were created. Large scale laboratory physical testing was performed as experimental verification (proof of concept) for the two systems...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a test program {{on a wide}} range of concrete-filled cold-formed stainless steel tubular T-joints fabricated from square hollow section (SHS) and rectangular hollow section (RHS) <b>brace</b> and chord <b>members.</b> A total of 27 tests was performed. The chord member of the test specimen was filled with concrete along its full length. Both high strength stainless steel (duplex and high strength austenitic) and normal strength stainless steel (AISI 304) specimens filled with nominal concrete cylinder strength of 30  MPa were tested. The axial compression force was applied to the top end of the <b>brace</b> <b>member,</b> which was welded to the center of the chord member. Local buckling failure of <b>brace</b> <b>member</b> was the main failure mode observed during the tests. Hence, the axial compression force was then applied by means of a steel bearing plate to avoid failure of <b>brace</b> <b>member.</b> The failure modes of chord face failure and chord side wall failure as well as crushing of the concrete infill were observed. All the tests were performed by supporting the chord member of the specimen along its entire length to apply the pure concentrated force without any bending moment. The test results were also compared with design rules for carbon steel tubular structures, which is the only existing design guideline for concrete-filled tubular joints. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the current design rules are quite conservative for the test specimens. It is also recommended that the contribution of stainless steel tubes should be included in the design rules since it has significant effects on the ultimate bearing capacity of concrete-filled stainless steel tubular T-joints. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
