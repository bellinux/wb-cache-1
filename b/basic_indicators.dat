The <b>basic</b> <b>indicator,</b> standard and internal measurement approaches (IMA) have been used to asses the capital requirement levels needed to cover the operational risk. The IMA is implemented using the loss distribution methodology (LDA). The capital at risk is computed from the loss distribution that aggregates, using Monte-Carlo simulations, the frequency and loss size distributions, fitted to the empirical data, for each business line and event type pair. Even though IMA is more costly and difficult to implement, it has, in some circumstances, considerable rewards in terms of capital requirements. operational risk, <b>basic</b> <b>indicator</b> approach, standardized approach, internal measurement approach, loss distribution methodology, Monte-Carlo simulation...|$|R
