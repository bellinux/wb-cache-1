5|$|A larger demonstration, the 8N, {{took place}} two months later. It was {{attended}} <b>by</b> <b>nearly</b> {{half a million}} people.

Journalist Jorge Lanata explained the polarization was because the government and its supporters thought they were engaged in a revolution, and this justified being against freedom of the press and other public rights. Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina said the demonstrators belonged to a class that was against social justice, and compared the demonstrations to a coup d'état. A similar view was held by Kirchner's loyalists.|$|E
