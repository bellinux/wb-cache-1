5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted <b>B-pillar,</b> wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E
25|$|The North American Regal {{weighs about}} 13 pounds {{more than an}} {{equivalent}} Opel Insignia due to increased structural support in the <b>B-pillar</b> necessary to meet U.S. rollover standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of front-hinged front doors and rear-hinged rear doors {{allows for a}} design without the <b>B-pillar,</b> creating a large opening for entering and exiting the vehicle {{as seen in the}} above photo.|$|E
50|$|The styling of the B-Max {{continues}} the Ford Kinetic Design theme, and has rear sliding doors with no <b>B-pillars.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... 2005: Sidemarker lights {{change from}} orange to clear. Black trim applied to <b>B-pillars</b> of all models and C-pillars of hatchbacks.|$|R

25|$|The third {{generation}} (2007–2016) {{was based on}} the Volvo P3 platform, sharing general styling and much of the interior in front of the <b>b-pillar</b> with the second generation Volvo S80. It has been marketed since 2007 as the V70 and the XC70, a crossover model.|$|E
25|$|In some cars, an {{additional}} feature was the so-called opera light that was {{mounted on the}} outside of the <b>B-pillar</b> or C-pillar and lit up when the exterior lights were turned on. (See 1980s Lincoln Town Car, 1979-91 Mercury Grand Marquis, or high-end models of the 1988-1990 Oldsmobile 88).|$|E
25|$|Several concept {{cars have}} {{featured}} suicide doors, {{such as the}} Lincoln C, a hatchback with no <b>B-pillar</b> and rear suicide doors, or the Carbon Motors Corporation E7, a police car with rear suicide doors designed to aid officers getting handcuffed passengers {{in and out of}} the back seat. The Kia Naimo, an electric concept car, also has rear suicide doors.|$|E
50|$|Because {{there is}} no roof {{connection}} between the A- and <b>B-pillars,</b> the A-pillars of a convertible automobile have to be stronger and even thicker.|$|R
5000|$|The New Drophead (3) had steel to the <b>B-pillars,</b> and alloy {{from there}} back, apart from steel inner rear guards. (89 mph), 0-60 mph: 19.7 seconds) ...|$|R

25|$|During its {{production}} from 1967 to 1970, the Rebel was {{available as a}} six-passenger four-door sedan, and two-door hardtop, and a four-door station wagon with an optional third row seat for two more passengers. In addition, a two-door sedan (coupé) with a thin <b>B-pillar</b> and flip out rear side windows was available in 1967 only, and a convertible was offered in 1967 and 1968.|$|E
25|$|The second-generation Taurus shared {{all of its}} {{mechanical}} parts with the first-generation Ford Taurus, yet its exterior and interior were nearly completely redesigned. However, its exterior still strongly resembled that of the first-generation Taurus, leading many to falsely believe that the second-generation was simply a facelift of the first-generation Taurus. This is partially true, however, as the wagon model, from the <b>B-pillar</b> {{to the rear of}} the car, was a carryover from the first generation. The second generation of Taurus proved to be very popular, selling 410,000 units in its first year, becoming the best selling car in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the inside}} of the car there were {{virtually}} no changes, but changes to the exterior included a switch to a power mast antenna, mudflaps on all models, and the addition of headlight washers on P-types. All <b>B-pillar</b> and nose badges for cars sold in North America read [...] "Celica Supra" [...] and only P-types were available in two-tone color schemes.|$|E
5000|$|For 1973, the Custom 500, Galaxie sedan, LTD, and station wagons {{were given}} an all-new body. [...] In {{response}} to federal regulations, the front ends were fitted with large 5 mph bumpers; they would be fitted to the rear for 1974. Two-door hardtops were also redesigned with thick <b>B-pillars</b> and fixed rear quarter windows. Four-door and wagon models were marketed as [...] "pillared hardtops"; while still wearing frameless door glass, they were reinforced with thin metal <b>B-pillars.</b> To deal with the added weight, only V8 engines were available (for {{the first time since}} 1940).|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 40) The {{influence of}} lateral visibility from the vehicle cabin on safety was evaluated {{by examining the}} differences in lane-change crashes of four-door and two-door body styles of the same vehicle models. These two vehicle styles were used because <b>B-pillars</b> on four-door models are farther forward, and thus nearer the fore-aft position of the driver. (Furthermore, the <b>B-pillars</b> on two-door models can be narrower, and some two-door models have no <b>B-pillars</b> at all.) To control for driver differences between these two body styles, going-straight-ahead crashes were used for comparison. The analysis used 2000 - 2003 North Carolina crash data, and considered the crash experience of four-door and two-door body styles for the same 10 vehicles for model years 1995 and newer. The main finding is that four-door body styles {{are more likely to}} be involved in lanechange crashes than are two-door body styles of the same vehicle models. This finding suggests that lateral visibility out of the vehicle cabin affects safety...|$|R
5000|$|A three-door commercial-use [...] "Van" [...] was added, {{with unique}} {{bodywork}} from the <b>B-pillars</b> back. Slightly taller than its sedan counterparts, like them the Life Van was also available {{with the full}} automatic transmission.|$|R
2500|$|Inside, Ebony leather {{with red}} {{stitching}} accents dominate, while the seats, {{steering wheel and}} armrests feature microfiber suede accents. The headrests have an embossed Centennial Edition logo and the steering wheel hub carries the same [...] "Louis Chevrolet 100" [...] graphic found on the car's <b>B-pillar</b> and wheel center caps. Arguably the most subtle variation to be found {{is seen in the}} signature crossed-flags exterior badge, which sees the traditional fleur-de-lis element replaced with [...] "100" [...] in all Centennial Edition cars.|$|E
2500|$|For 1963, model designations {{were changed}} {{once again with}} the 400 now called 440. A new hardtop (no <b>B-pillar)</b> coupe body design debuted, whose steel roof was {{designed}} to mimic {{the appearance of a}} closed convertible top. This was a one-model-year-only design with a thin profile, clean lines, stamped faux-convertible ribs, and a textured finish. A special top-of-the-line model called the 440-H was equipped with sports-type features including individually adjustable reclining front bucket seats and a center console, as well as a more powerful [...] version of Rambler's stalwart [...] inline-6 engine.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1967 model year, all of AMC's {{intermediates}} {{took the}} Rambler Rebel name. They {{were of a}} completely new design from the predecessor models. The new Rebels were bigger and rode on a longer [...] wheelbase allowing for more passenger space and cargo capacity. The new styling featured sweeping rooflines with more glass area, {{as well as a}} smooth, rounded [...] "coke-bottle" [...] body design. The Rebel was now available not only in 4-door sedan, 4-door station wagon, and 2-door hardtop versions, but also for 1967 as 2-door sedan (coupé) with a thin <b>B-pillar</b> and flip out rear side windows, as well as a convertible.|$|E
50|$|A {{key feature}} driving {{the use of}} the tall body design was the upward {{movement}} of the H-point (hip point). As with the first-generation Ford Focus, the seats of the Five Hundred were positioned relatively high from the floor, providing an upright seating position and improved visibility, access, and egress. In addition, the rear seat was positioned higher than the front seats. While visibility was one factor behind the higher seating position, safety was another as well. Under the front seats, a hydroformed cross-car steel beam is welded in between the <b>B-pillars</b> (directly below an identical beam above the <b>B-pillars),</b> designed as part of a side-impact safety design derived from Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) from Volvo.|$|R
50|$|A unibody {{construction}} helps lower {{center of}} gravity, compared to previous truck-based GM SUVs, {{reduces the risk}} of rollover accidents. Much of the Acadia's structure is reinforced with high-strength steel, including a steel cross-car beam welded across the floor between the <b>B-pillars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Equipment levels {{ranged from}} the lowest spec L (less chrome, body colored bumpers and <b>B-pillars),</b> via the LX, GL, GF, and GL II {{to the top of}} the line GF II, which {{featured}} a sports interior, radial tires, and available two-tone paint.|$|R
2500|$|Completely {{redesigned}} and now sharing {{design features}} with the XV10 series Toyota Windom and styling cues with the LS 400, {{the model was}} renamed the ES 300 to reflect the half-liter increase in engine displacement to 3.0-liters. The second-generation ES was significantly larger and more curvaceous than its predecessor, gaining [...] in length and [...] of width. On the front fascia, the ES gained projector headlamps in a curved housing and a three-slat grille with the Lexus emblem moved above on the hood. The side profile featured an invisible <b>B-pillar</b> and frameless-window doors. The rear deck lid featured an integrated spoiler effect similar to the flagship LS 400, improving the ES model's aerodynamics, now rated [...]|$|E
2500|$|The new more {{aerodynamic}} body {{looked a}} bit more plain than its sharp predecessor, but the fastback shape echoed Giugiaro's original design. The headlights were square, there was more glass than on the SS20 (but with a broad <b>B-pillar)</b> and the larger rear glass hatch (still not a proper hatch) now offered better access to a much more usable luggage space. The rear seat folded; some versions even offered a remote opening mechanism and heated rear window. The SS40 {{was also the first}} Cervo to offer automatic transmission, a two-speed. This all reflected a steady move away from the original [...] "mini Gran Turismo" [...] concept towards a much softer [...] "Personal Car".|$|E
2500|$|The 1979 {{model year}} saw {{moderate}} upgrades to the Concord. Front-end styling changed appreciably with a [...] "waterfall" [...] grille {{with a fine}} chrome vertical bar treatment, quad rectangular headlights atop slim, wide clear parking and signal lights, and lighter aluminum bumpers were new for 1979. The D/L sedan was given a new vinyl roof design which extended only over the rear passenger compartment was complemented by chrome trim that overlaid the <b>B-pillar</b> and wrapped over the vinyl roof at its leading edge. A thin trim piece at the roof's edge simulated a convertible's fold-down hinge point. The D/L package, now the middle trim level, was extended to the hatchback, which was given a brushed aluminum Targa-like roof band and a half-vinyl roof to differentiate it from the base model hatchback.|$|E
50|$|Hatchback {{body style}} was dropped after 1991 model. The Corsica {{received}} an extensively updated interior {{with a standard}} driver's side airbag and cup holders. Front seatbelts were moved from {{the doors to the}} <b>B-pillars.</b> The taillights received a redesign, from smooth to ridged.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the fuel crisis, 1973 saw major change to the Mercury line. In various forms, all Mercury cars were given 5-mph bumpers. The full-size line was given a major restyling; while Ford (and later Lincoln) 2-doors would be given <b>B-pillars,</b> all two-door Mercurys would remain true hardtops.|$|R
50|$|Continental EditionOffered in 2010 and 2011 was the Continental Edition package; {{available}} {{as an option}} only on the Signature Limited trim. The package added Continental badging, chrome 17-inch wheels and accents to the <b>B-pillars.</b> On the interior, the Continental name was embroidered on the front seats and front floor mats.|$|R
2500|$|The AM/FM antenna was {{integrated}} into the front windshield rather than a typical external mast antenna. There was a key lock on the gas tank door (in lieu of a remote release) and the hatch and rear bumper were black regardless of paint color {{on the rest of}} the car. The P-types were available with an optional rear sunshade above the hatch glass. The lights in the rear featured a reverse light in the center and the door handles opened the doors by pulling sideways. The front nose badge and <b>B-pillar</b> only read [...] "Supra" [...] for the first several months of production, but were changed to read [...] "Celica Supra" [...] midway through the model year. L-types had front and rear mudflaps but P-types of this year did not.|$|E
2500|$|Based on the AMC Concord, the 1980 AMC Eagle was {{introduced}} in August 1979 and available as a four-door sedan and station wagon, {{as well as a}} coupe. Standard equipment included power steering and power front disk and rear drum brakes, as well as 15-inch wheels with fiberglass belted radial whitewall tires. The Eagle came base and upscale Limited trims, both of which carried the same features as the Concord DL and Limited, respectively. A sports package was available only on the 2-door and wagon models featuring in addition to [...] "Sport" [...] emblems the following items: Durham Plaid fabric seat trim, leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, P195/75R15 Tiempo steel belted radial tires, sport fog lamps, halogen highbeam headlamps, dual black remote mirrors, 4X4 sport graphics, black bumpers with nerf strips, black lower body moldings, blackout grille, taillamp paint treatment, side tape stripes, and black moldings on the windshield, rear window, door frames, and <b>B-pillar.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 and 1990, a new {{trim level}} to the Electra was offered: the Park Avenue Ultra. The Ultra was {{essentially}} an upgrade to the Electra Park Avenue line, and featured a standard leather trimmed interior with dual 20-way electric front seats (shared with Cadillac's restyled 1989 Sixty Special), lower-body accent exterior paint treatment, distinctive thick-padded vinyl top with limousine-style rear-window surround (available only on Ultra), simulated burled elm trim on the doors and instrument panel, unique aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakes, chromed <b>B-pillar</b> moldings, specific grille and tail lamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel, electronic instrumentation, padded glove-compartment door, unique interior door panel trim, {{and a variety of}} otherwise minor changes. With its long list of standard equipment, the Park Avenue Ultra carried a higher base price than Cadillac's Sedan de Ville. [...] The Park Avenue Ultra did not gain much popular recognition, however, until the following generation of Park Avenue where the [...] "Ultra" [...] badge offered even more features.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{improved}} the Camry's safety {{by increasing the}} XV40's structural rigidity. This has been achieved {{through the application of}} ultra high-tensile steel, which is hot-stamped to the Camry's roof, A- and <b>B-pillars,</b> and rocker panels. The structure of the front seat mounts were designed to transfer side collision impact loads across the car.|$|R
25|$|In 2016, the 85kWh {{and later}} 90kWh battery was {{discontinued}} from all markets. A glass roof with no horizontal roof bar between the <b>B-pillars</b> {{was introduced in}} late 2016. Before adding an all-glass roof option for the Model S, possible roof options was: body colored roof, a black painted roof, or the panoramic sunroof.|$|R
