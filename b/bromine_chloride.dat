The reaction of HO 2 − with ClO 2 is fast (1. 6 × 105 M − 1 s− 1) and buffers do not affect the rate of the reaction.

Preliminary studies were conducted under ideal laboratory conditions. In nitrogen-free buffer at pH 6. 0, BrCl found to be {{two to three times}} as effective as chlorine in inactivating more than 5 logs of poliovirus. Furthermore, BrCl retained its disinfecting ability over a wide range of pH. The primary sit 8 of action of BrCl on poliovirus was the virus protein; and infectious RNA was recovered from poliovirus in which more than 3 logs of virus had been inactivated by 0. 3 mg/l of BrCl. <b>Bromine</b> <b>chloride</b> was less affected than chlorine by the presence of interfering compounds such as NH 4 Cl and glycine, added to the water. Under simulated field conditions in the laboratory, a 5 mg/l dose of BrCl inactivated more than 5 logs of poliovirus in sewage effluent whereas the equivalent dose of chlorine inactivated only 2 logs. Disinfection of wastewater by BrCl and chlorine was also studied under field operating conditions by using a model chlorine contact chamber at a sewage treatment plant to treat large volumes activated sludge sewage effluent. An 8 mg/l dose of BrCl was determined to be more effective than an equivalent dose of chlorine in inactivating more than 4 logs of several types of human enteric viruses added to the effluent as well as viruses naturally present in sewage. BrCl was shown to require a shorter contact time and resulted in unstable residuals as compared to chlorine. <b>Bromine</b> <b>chloride</b> was also shown to be equally effective in inactivating human enteric viruses and coliform bacteria. Chlorine was more effective in inactivating human enteric viruses and coliform bacteria. Chlorine was more effective in inactivating coliform bacteria than viruses.

Additional studies demonstrated that residual BrCl was less toxic than residual chlorine for fish.

40|$|<b>Bromine</b> <b>chloride</b> (BrCl) was {{evaluated}} {{as an alternative}} to chlorine as a disinfectant of water and waste water by comparing the efficiency of these two chemicals to inactivate type 1 poliovirus seeded in various aqueous solutions. In a nitrogen-free buffer at pH 6. 0, the minimum concentration of BrCl required to effectively inactivate poliovirus (4 -log reduction after 15 min at 25 °C) was 0. 15 mg/l, whereas 0. 3 mg/l of chlorine was required to accomplish the same effect. The virus inactivating efficiency of BrCl was not interfered within the range of pH 6 to 1 O. Furthermore, the addition of various concentrations of glycine and NH 4 Cl to the nitrogen-free buffer solutions more effectively interfered with the virus inactivating properties of chlorine than BrCl. To simulate waste water disinfection, 1 to 5 mg/l of BrCl and chlorine were added to activated sludge treated sewage effluent seeded with poliovirus, mixed well, and titered after 15 min at 25 °C. The results show that the inactivating effects of 1, 2, and 3 mg/l dose of both chlorine and BrCl were equivalent and inefficient. However, at a dose of 5 mg/l, BrCl inactivated 5 logs of virus, whereas chlorine inactivated only 2 logs of virus. These results indicate that BrCl should be seriously considered as a potential alternative to chlorine as a disinfectant. U. S.

40|$|Aqueous phase halogen {{reactions}} play {{an important}} role in tropospheric ozone depletion that is observed during Arctic sunrise where <b>bromine</b> <b>chloride</b> is a key intermediate. The temperature dependencies of BrCl(aq) equilibration with BrCl 2 −, HOBr(aq), Br 2 (aq), Cl 2 (aq), HOCl(aq), Br−, and other species (Br 3 −, Br 2 Cl−, Cl 3 −, OBr− and OCl−) are determined as a function of [Cl −] concentration and pH. The kinetics of the very rapid BrCl(aq) hydrolysis are measured with the pulsed-accelerated-flow spectrometer. The reaction between ozone and Br− can lead to the generation of Br 2 (aq) and BrCl(aq) in darkness before polar sunrise and is potentially very important in the ozone depletion event. This reaction is specific-acid-assisted and is highly temperature dependent. A mechanism is proposed in which BrOOO− forms as a steady-state intermediate, which subsequently react with H+ and H 2 O to give HOBr and O 2. Both the water path rate constant and proton path rate constant are resolved. The chemistry of S(IV) is of concern in the ozone depletion process since Arctic aerosols contain sulfuric acid and S(IV) in solution can destroy HOBr and Br 2 (aq) by reducing them to Br−. The very rapid reactions of HOBr and Br 2 /Br 3 − with HSO 3 − are investigated. Mechanisms are proposed with the following common features: (1) the reactions proceed through Br + transfer to form a BrSO 3 − intermediate; and (2) BrSO 3 − hydrolyzes rapidly to yield Br− and HSO 4 −. Rate constants for the reactions between Br 2 /Br 3 − and HSO 3 − are resolved. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of several oxidation/reduction reactions of oxyhalogen species are presented. <b>Bromine</b> <b>chloride</b> (BrCl) catalyzes the decomposition of hypochlorous acid/hypobromous acid (HOCl/HOBr) mixtures. BrCl reacts with hypochlorite ion (OCl−) to form BrOCl, which hydrolyzes to chlorite (ClO 2 −) and bromide (Br −) ions. Bromite ion (BrO 2 −) is formed via HOBr disproportionation. Rapid reactions of HOCl/BrO 2 − and HOBr/ClO 2 − produce bromate (BrO 3 −) and chlorate (ClO 3 −) ions, respectively. The {{study of the}} HOCl/HOBr decomposition is enabled by the ion chromatography (IC). The preparation of HOCl/HOBr reaction mixtures for IC requires removal of HOCl and HOBr from the samples. Three dehalogenating species, phenol, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, and sulfite ion, enable ion chromatographic analysis. The reduction of BrO 2 − by sulfite ion (k = 3. 0 × 107 M− 1 s− 1) occurs through the OBr + transfer reaction to sulfite ion, with subsequent general-acid catalyzed hydrolysis of OBrSO 3 −. Conversely, ClO 2 − does not react with sulfite, and the reaction is not general-acid catalyzed. Chlorite and S(IV) react via an oxygen-atom transfer where k(ClO 2 −/SO 2) = 6. 26 × 106 M− 1 s − 1 and k(ClO 2 −/SO 3 H−) = 5. 5 M− 1 s− 1. The reaction of HOBr with nitrite ion (NO 2 −) proceeds by a bromine-atom transfer reaction. HOBr, NO 2 −, and H+ are in equilibrium with nitryl bromide, BrNO 2 (K = 2. 73 × 108 M − 2). BrNO 2 is detected spectrophotometrically where 2 ̆ 6 epsiv;(260 nm) = 956 M− 1 cm− 1. BrNO 2 reacts rapidly with NO 2 − (k = 6. 9 × 103 M− 1 s− 1) to form Br− and N 2 O 4 and can dissociate to form NO 2 + and Br − (k = 18 s− 1). Rapid reactions of N 2 O 4 and NO 2 + with water produce NO 3 − as a final product. Nitrite levels above 100 mM cause a suppression of the observed rate constant. This suggests that N 2 O 4 hydrolysis occurs by reversible heterolytic dissociation into NO 2 + and NO 2 −. ...|$|E

30|$|Ultra-high {{performance}} concrete {{is often}} used in underground waterproof projects, roads, bridges and seismic structures in harsh environmental conditions. The material is characterized by high strength, low absorbability, low water permeability and high freeze resistance, which results in high durability (Smarzewski and Barnat-Hunek 2013; Li and Liu 2016; Kang et al. 2016). This material has a low porosity and might be filled with a gaseous phase or liquid phase. The liquid phase contains water and various types of pollutants including salts, which penetrate the concrete through the interconnected pores (Koniorczyk et al. 2013). Therefore, knowledge about the wettability, absorptivity, frost resistance and salt resistance of a given UHPC formulation is extremely important when considering its durability. The frost resistance of fiber reinforced concrete is affected by its porosity, type of aggregate, fiber characteristics and environmental conditions; hence, the frost resistance of ultra-high performance concrete mixtures has been investigated by some researchers (Yun and Wu 2011). Chemrouk and Hamrat have shown that a water/cement ratio below 0.4 reduces the penetration of chlorides, decreases the risks of concrete spalling and rebar corrosion in reinforced concrete structures (Chemrouk and Hamrat 2002). UHPC is characterised by a maximum aggregate size of 8  mm. The water/binder ratio is frequently below 0.25 and highly reactive silica fume must {{be added to the}} mix. Workability can be ensured by applying large amounts of superplasticizer (2009). Fibers are added to the matrix as reinforcement to control cracking and to increase material ductility (Dinh et al. 2016; Abdallah et al. 2016; Bencardino et al. 2010; Abou El-Mal et al. 2015; Sorensen et al. 2014). The cracks in concrete generally occur over time due to a number of reasons. Cracks weaken the waterproofing capabilities and expose the microstructure to moisture, <b>bromine,</b> <b>chloride</b> and sulphates (Köksal et al. 2008; Song et al. 2005; Sivakumar and Santhanam 2007; Toutanji 1999). Thus, improving concrete properties is an important aim in concrete science (Nili and Afroughsabet 2012). Cracks occur in different sizes and at different stages of concrete exploitation; consequently, the use of different fibers with various lengths and varied characteristics are a good way to solve this problem. The interaction between the fibers and the concrete is more advantageous when two types of fibers are used (Yao et al. 2003; Dawood and Ramli 2010; Yang 2011). Concrete deterioration is associated with destructive chemical attacks and the impact of freezing and thawing (Chemrouk 2015; Bondar et al. 2015). Another factor that affects concrete durability is resistance to the ingress of aggressive ions (Afroughsabet and Ozbakkaloglu 2015). The most frequent sulphate salts are calcium sulphate (Ca 2 SO 4), sodium sulphate (Na 2 SO 4), potassium sulphate (K 2 SO 4) and magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4), the most aggressive salts of which are sodium sulphate and potassium sulphate (Chemrouk 2015). Not only does the growth of salt crystals in concrete pores generate stress leading to damage, but the growth of ice is another reason for concrete quality deterioration. Scherer (Scherer 1999) proved that the crystallization pressure of salt is low in large pores; on the other hand, the impact of freeze–thaw cycles is more evident in the small pores of UHPC. Nevertheless, few investigations of freezing-thawing resistance can be found for fiber reinforced concrete (Miao et al. 2002; Colombo et al. 2015). In practice, concrete degradation mechanisms are the combined results of mechanical stress, physical and chemical attacks (Miao et al. 2002). The resistance of concrete to freezing and thawing depends on the degree of saturation, system of pores, permeability and the water/binder ratio. High freezing-thawing resistance depends on low permeability and a low water/binder ratio (Colombo et al. 2015). For concrete with a high freezing-thawing resistance, the distance from the hydrated cement paste to an air void cannot exceed 0.2  mm. In addition, very small pores with diameters less than 0.3  mm are desirable (Yang et al. 2015). High strength concrete with a very low water/binder ratio generally has a low capillary porosity. Hence, the amount of water able to freeze is low enough and concrete can be damaged by frost action after long and continuous exposure to water (Guse and Hilsdorf 1998). However, the doubts regarding the frost resistance of high performance concretes have not been entirely removed (2009). The expansive reactions in concrete are related to the sulphates contained in ground water, sea water, soils and sewage. Sulphate attack is associated with the groundwater environment and the discharge of industrial wastewater (Çavdar 2014). Sulphate ions during penetration of the concrete may react with calcium hydroxide or with calcium aluminate hydrates. Severe damage, and in the end complete disintegration occur if sulphate solutions penetrate the hardened concrete. UHPC are often exposed to aggressive impacts from the environment, thus they must have high resistance to chemical corrosion, frost corrosion, weathering or the influence of aggressive water. In paper (Çavdar 2014), the flexural strength, compressive strength and modulus of dynamic elasticity of fiber reinforced mortar samples after 100 freeze–thaw cycles were reduced. Frost and salt resistance are considered to be significant features in evaluating concrete durability.|$|E
40|$|Graphite fibers {{intercalated}} with bromine, iodine monochloride, ferric chloride, and {{cupric chloride}} {{were subjected to}} stability tests under four environments which are encountered by engineering materials in the aerospace industry: ambient laboratory conditions, as would be experienced during handling operations and terrestrial applications; high vacuum, as would be experienced in space applications; high humidity, as would be experienced in marine applications; and high temperature, as would be experienced in some processing steps and applications. Monitoring {{the resistance of the}} fibers at ambient laboratory conditions revealed that only the ferric chloride intercalated fibers were unstable, due to absorption of water from the air. All four types of intercalated fibers were unstable, due to absorption of water from the air. All four types of intercalated fibers were stable for long periods under high vacuum. Ferric chloride, cupric chloride, and iodine monochloride intercalated fibers were sensitive to high humidity conditions. All intercalated fibers began to degrade above 250 C. The order of their thermal stability, from lowest to highest, was cupric <b>chloride,</b> iodine monochloride, <b>bromine,</b> and ferric <b>chloride.</b> Of the four types of intercalated fibers tested, the bromine intercalated fibers appear to have the most potential for application, based on environmental stability...|$|R
500|$|Chlorine is {{the second}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus similar to fluorine, bromine, and iodine, and are largely intermediate between those of the first two. Chlorine has the electron configuration 3s23p5, with the seven electrons {{in the third and}} outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between fluorine and bromine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than fluorine and more reactive than bromine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine, but a stronger one than <b>bromine.</b> Conversely, the <b>chloride</b> ion is a weaker reducing agent than bromide, but a stronger one than fluoride. It is intermediate in atomic radius between fluorine and bromine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties similarly continuing the trend from iodine to bromine upward, such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. (Fluorine is anomalous due to its small size.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{beneficial}} effects of hot springs {{have been known}} for centuries and treatments with sulphurous thermal waters are recommended {{in a number of}} chronic pathologies as well as acute recurrent infections. However, the positive effects of the therapy are often evaluated in terms of subjective sense of wellbeing and symptomatic clinical improvements. Here, the effects of an S-based compound (NaSH) and of a specific sulphurous thermal water characterized by additional ions such as sodium <b>chloride,</b> <b>bromine</b> and iodine (STW) were investigated in terms of cytokine release and anti-oxidant enzyme activity in primary human monocytes and in saliva from 50 airway disease patients subjected to thermal treatments. In vitro, NaSH efficiently blocked the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and counterbalanced the formation of ROS. Despite STW not recapitulating these results, possibly due to the low concentration of S-based compounds reached at the minimum non-toxic dilution, we found that it enhanced the release of IL- 10, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine. Notably, higher levels of IL- 10 were also observed in patients' saliva following STW treatment and this increase correlated positively with salivary catalase activity (r 2 = 0. 19, *p less than 0. 01). To our knowledge, these results represent the first evidence suggesting that S-based compounds and STW may prove useful in facing chronic inflammatory and age-related illness due to combined anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of benzoyl peroxide in anisole at 80 ° gave 10. 8 mol% methoxyphenyl benzoate, with an ortho:para ratio of 3 : 2. The inclusion of copper(II) benzoate in acetonitrile increased the yield to about 20 mol%. The yield and isomer distribution of methoxy-phenyl benzoate varied significantly with the temperature, and depended also upon the anisole:benzoyl peroxide:copper(II) benzoate ratio, and {{were influenced by}} deuterium at the ortho-or para- position. Kinetic analysis, using galvinoxyl, showed that copper(II) benzoate slightly increased {{the rate of the}} primary homolysis of benzoyl peroxide at 60 - 75 °, but the rate was slower than in the uncatalysed decomposition at 80 - 82 °. Visible spectroscopic analysis showed that benzoylperoxide reacted with copper(II) benzoate in acetonitrileto form a new species with a maximum absorption at 388 nm(E max ~ 256 000 M - 1 cm - 1). The rate of its formation wasproportional to the concentration of benzoyl peroxide, and increased with temperature. The preformed species could not oxygenate anisole effectively. The investigation was extended to halogenated anisoles, which gave high yields of methoxyphenyl benzoate, and to the polynuclear systems, naphthalene and methylnaphthalenes. The {{thermal decomposition}} of benzoyl peroxide in anisole was investigated in the presence of other additives, such as copper(II) chloride, copper(II) bromide, iodine, N-bromosuccinimide, <b>bromine,</b> and tin(IV) <b>chloride,</b> in acetonitrile. As another method of oxygenation, the benzoyl peroxide initiated reaction of halogenated aromatic compounds with acetate ions gave results which agreed with previous literature reports. This reaction could not be extended to anisole and highly fluorinated aromatic compounds. Perbenzoic acid was found to be an ineffective reagent for oxygenation of aromatic compounds, even in the presence of additives. <p...|$|R
40|$|Second-order rate {{constants}} {{have been}} determined for the bromination {{of the series}} CH(_ 2) C(X) CH(_ 2) C 1 (for -X = -H, -F, -CI and -Br) in 50 % by volume methanol-water and trifluoroacetic acid solvents. 2 -Halo substitution caused deactivation {{with respect to the}} unsubstituted allyl chloride, but enhanced reactivity was observed for the 2 -fluoro substituted olefin compared to the 2 -chloro and 2 -bromo substituted compounds. The above data were compared with the rate coefficients for the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a series of 2 -halopropenes. The difference in the scale of rate enhancement for the 2 -fluoro substituted olefins in the two reactions is discussed in terms of the relative contributions of the cyclic bromonium ion structure and of the classical open carbonium ion structure to the transition state for electrophilic addition to olefins. Second-order rate constants have been measured for the addition of <b>bromine</b> to allyl <b>chloride</b> and bromide and benzyl chloride and bromide in acetic acid-water and trifluoroacetic acid solvents. The relative rate enhancement for addition to allyl bromide in trifluoroacetic acid compared to allyl chloride was discussed in terms of solvent enhancement of the inductive effects of the halo substituents by hydrogen bonding, and compared to the rates of electrophilic substitution of bromine into the analogous aromatic compounds. The second-order rate constants for bromination of the two series CH(_ 2) =CH(CH(_ 2)) (_n- 2) OH and CH(_ 2) =CH(CH(_ 2)) (_n- 2) Br (where n = 3 to 6) were measured in acetic acid-water and trifluoroacetic acid solvents, Neighbouring group participation was not observed in the bromo-substituted series of olefins...|$|R
