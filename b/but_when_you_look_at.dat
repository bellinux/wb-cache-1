Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben {{and you look at}} Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] {{the fact that you can}} have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E

That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm {{just trying to make}} hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, {{because a lot of people}} dig it. A lot of people have hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E

500|$|Clair's {{beliefs and}} endeavors {{as a working}} wife and mother are wholeheartedly {{supported}} by her family. Additionally, when Clair is at work, Cliff willingly assumes traditionally female household responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. Both Clair's professional and personal lives operate alongside each other rather smoothly with little conflict. However, despite being a full-time lawyer, she is seldom shown {{at work in the}} courtroom; audiences see the character at home more often than anywhere else. According to Women Watching Television: Gender, Class, and Generation in the American Television Experience author Andrea L. Press, Clair's role demonstrates [...] "the hegemonic view that families need not change to accommodate working wives and mothers", believing that the show mostly depicts Clair at home to avoid exploring the everyday conflicts working women endure in their daily lives. One of the series' more political moments, Clair refuses to be exploited as [...] "the token black woman" [...] on a morning talk show discussing the Great Depression during the episode [...] "Mrs. Huxtable Goes to Kindergarten", a position she originally accepts under the impression that she would be appreciated for her experience as a lawyer. When Clair learns that her all-white male co-panelists only want to hear opinions {{from the perspective of a}} black woman, Clair delivers a speech that reads, [...] "I am also a human being, who is an attorney, a mother of five, and somewhat knowledgeable about history ... <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, this is all you see in me, a black woman?" ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{exhibition}} of Doherty's paintings titled, [...] "Art of the Albion", {{took place at}} the Galerie Chappe in Paris from 25 April to 25 May 2008. The exhibit caused controversy due to artworks made with Doherty's own blood. According to newspapers, anti-drug campaigners were enraged and accused Doherty of glamourising illegal substance abuse. Art experts were similarly unimpressed. David West, the owner of London's Decima gallery, for example, slammed his work: [...] "It's not got any artistic merit.

6000|$|... "No, {{certainly}} not. Nature is nature, and you cannot create another {{nature in}} imitation of it, {{any more than you}} can comprehend infinity. This is only art, the highest thing, in this particular direction, which the poor little creature man has been able to attain. You have doubtless heard the story of the old lady who said to the painter of these scenes, 'Oh, Mr. Turner, I never saw such lights and colours in nature as you paint!' 'No, don't you wish you could?' replied the artist. Now the old lady was perfectly right. You cannot put white quivering tropical heat on a canvas, but Turner dashes unnatural vermilion over his scene and the picture is not ridiculous; the effect of noonday heat is somehow produced. Look at those sunsets! In one sense they are failures, every one of them; but what a splendid audacity the man had, and what a genius, to attempt to portray nature in those special moments when it shines with a glory that seems unearthly, and not to have failed more signally! Failures they are, but nobler works than other men's successes. You are perfectly right, Connie, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a great picture do not forget to remember that art is long and life short. That is what the old lady didn't know, and what Turner should have told her instead of making that contemptuous speech." ...|$|E

5000|$|The town of Angola, Indiana {{has several}} {{locations}} where residents have {{claimed to have}} sighted specters. An old theatre sits on the town circle, and some residents claim that at midnight {{a man with a}} long red beard appears {{on the roof of the}} building pacing back and forth and cries aloud, [...] "Marie please come back to me, please."

6000|$|And lastly, {{what is that}} giant tree {{which almost}} fills {{the centre of the}} glen, towering with upright but {{branching}} limbs, and huge crown, thinly leaved, double the height of all the trees around? An ash? [...] Something like an ash in growth; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it through the glasses (indispensable in the tropic forest), you see that the foliage is more like that of the yellow horse-chestnut. And no British ash, not even the Altyre giants, ever reached to half that bulk. It is a Silk-cotton tree; a Ceiba {79d}--say, rather, the Ceiba of the glen; for these glens have a habit of holding each one great Ceiba, which has taken its stand at the upper end, just where the mountain-spurs run together in an amphitheatre; and being favoured (it may be supposed) by the special richness of the down- washed soil at that spot, grows to one of those vast air-gardens of creepers and parasites of which we have so often read and dreamed. [...] Such a one is this: but we will not go up to it now. This sketch shall be completed by the background of green and gray, fading aloft into tender cobalt: the background of mountain, ribbed and gullied into sharpest slopes by the tropic rains, yet showing, even where steepest, never a face of rock, or a crag peeping through the trees. [...] Up to the sky-line, a thousand feet aloft, all is green; and that, instead of being, as in Europe, stone or moor, is jagged and feathered with gigantic trees. How rich! you would say. Yet these West Indians only mourn over its desolation and disfigurement; and point to the sheets of gray stems, which hang like mist along the upper slopes. They look to us, on this 30th of December, only as April signs that the woodlands have not quite burst into full leaf. [...] But to the inhabitants they are tokens of those fearful fires which raged over the island during the long drought of this summer; when the forests were burning for a whole month, and this house scarcely saved; when whole cane-fields, mills, dwelling-houses, went up as tinder and flame in a moment, and the smoky haze from the burning island spread far out to sea. And yet where the fire passed six months ago, all is now a fresh impenetrable undergrowth of green; creepers covering the land, climbing up and shrouding the charred stumps; young palms, like Prince of Wales's feathers, breaking up, six or eight feet high, among a wilderness of sensitive plants, scarlet-flowered dwarf Balisiers, {81a} climbing fern, {81b} convolvuluses of every hue, and an endless variety of outlandish leaves, over which flutter troops of butterflies. How the seeds of the plants and the eggs of the insects have been preserved, who can tell? But there their children are, in myriads; and ere a generation has passed, every dead gray stem will have disappeared before the ants and beetles and great wood-boring bees who rumble round in blue-black armour; the young plants will have grown into great trees beneath the immeasurable vital force which pours all the year round from the blazing sun above, and all be as it was once more. In verity we are in the Tropics, where the so-called 'powers of nature' are in perpetual health and strength, and as much stronger and swifter, for good and evil, than in our chilly clime, as is the young man in the heat of youth compared with the old man shivering to his grave. Think over that last simile. If you think of it in the light which physiology gives, you will find that it is not merely a simile, but a true analogy; another manifestation of a great physical law.|$|E

It rather rarefies, and grows more inflammable, as the earthly particles diminish; and I have seen valor enough in a little fiery-hearted French dwarf, to have furnished out a tolerable giant.|$|R
