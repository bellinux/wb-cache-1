This {{study investigated the}} impact of wheat <b>bran,</b> <b>barley</b> or a control diet (α-cellulose) {{on the development of}} oxidative stress and inflammation in lean and obese Zucker rats. Methods Seven wk old, lean and obese male Zucker rats (n = 8 /group) were fed diets that contained wheat <b>bran,</b> <b>barley</b> or α-cellulose (control). After 3 months on these diets, systolic blood pressure was measured and plasma was analysed for glucose, insulin, lipids, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase and adipokine concentration (leptin, adiponectin, interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, TNFα, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) - 1, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) - 1). Adipokine secretion rates from visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue explants were also determined. Results Obese rats had higher body weight, systolic blood pressure and fasting blood lipids, glucose, insulin, leptin and IL- 1 β in comparison to lean rats, and these measures were not reduced by consumption of wheat <b>bran</b> or <b>barley</b> based diets.

Pigs (5 per treatment) were placed in metabolism cages that allowed total collections of feces and urine for 10 d after a 11 d adaptation period. Samples were analyzed for GE, ash and N. Digestibilities of GE, N and organic matter (OM) and N balance were calculated. The effects of diet and enzyme were evaluated by ANOVA.

Apparent total tract digestibilities of OM, N and GE of diets were affected by diet characteristics (P < 0. 001) {{in connection with a}} negative effect of NDF content (R = − 0. 97; P < 0. 001) and were increased (P < 0. 05) by enzyme addition (Enz) with + 0. 69, + 1. 68 and + 0. 76 % units for OM, N and GE digestibilities, respectively. Increases in DE value due to Enz averaged 0. 12 MJ per kg DM (15. 11 vs 14. 99 MJ/kg DM; P < 0. 001).

The matairesinol content was increased by using fermentation (from 7. 9 to 35. 4 % in pea fiber, from 33. 2 to 81. 5 % in lupine seeds, and from 5. 9 to 74. 9 % in <b>barley</b> <b>bran),</b> and in most cases a higher content of matairesinol was found in the SSF samples.
