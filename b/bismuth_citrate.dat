40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy plus postural change after dosing for Helicobacter pylori eradication in gastrectomized patients. We compared 76 gastric stump patients with H. pylori infection (GS group) with 50 non-gastrectomized H. pylori-positive patients who met the treatment indication (controls). The GS group was divided into GS group 1 and GS group 2. All groups were administered <b>bismuth</b> potassium <b>citrate</b> (220 mg), esomeprazole (20 mg), amoxicillin (1. 0 g), and furazolidone (100 mg) twice daily for 14 days. GS group 1 maintained a left lateral horizontal position for 30 min after dosing. H. pylori was detected using rapid urease testing and histologic examination of gastric mucosa before and 3 months after therapy. Mucosal histologic manifestations were evaluated using visual analog scales of the updated Sydney System. GS group 1 had a higher prevalence of eradication than the GS group 2 (intention-to-treat [ITT]: P= 0. 025; per-protocol [PP]: P= 0. 030), and the control group had a similar prevalence. GS group 2 had a lower prevalence of eradication than controls (ITT: P= 0. 006; PP: P= 0. 626). Scores for chronic inflammation and activity declined significantly (P< 0. 001) 3 months after treatment, whereas those for atrophy and intestinal metaplasia showed no significant change.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of time, temperature and organic matter on disinfectant efficacy. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) were used as organisms to represent Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, respectively, commonly found in poultry housing. Three independent experiments evaluated the effect of temperature, time, and organic matter on the efficacy of working concentrations of disinfectants against representative organisms found in commercial poultry housing. Quaternary ammonium, chlorhexidine, phenolic and binary ammonium based solutions represented disinfectants commonly used within the poultry industry. Results from these experiments indicated that long term storage of disinfectants will reduce their efficacy against SA. However, a reduction (p ? 0. 05) in efficacy was observed with the phenolic compound against ST at elevated temperatures. Following the inclusion of organic matter (OM), reduced (p ? 0. 05) efficacy of all disinfectants was observed in a dose dependent manner against both organisms, with the exception of the phenolic compound against SA. Fresh disinfectant performed better (p ? 0. 05) in the presence of OM than 30 wk old disinfectant. These results emphasize the need to use fresh disinfectants and that OM should be removed prior to disinfection. We also evaluated the effect of <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate,</b> lactose and citric acids on the development of necrotic enteritis in broilers. Clostridium perfringens? associated necrotic enteritis in poultry causes significant loss and increased morbidity in the industry.

Ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> with two antibiotics may provide an alternative 1 -week eradication regimen. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, parallel group, international, multicentre study compared ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> 400 mg b. d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b. d. for 2 weeks (RC) with ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> 400 mg b. d., clarithromycin 500 mg b. d. and metronidazole 400 mg b. d. for 1 week (RCM) for eradication of H. pylori in 350 patients with dyspepsia. RESULTS: Treatment with RC and RCM eradicated H. pylori (established by the combination of two negative results from two discrete 13 C-UBTs at nominal weeks 4 and 12) from 89 % (95 % CI: 84 - 94) and 92 % (95 % CI: 88 - 97) of the observed population, and from 78 % (95 % CI: 72 - 84) and 80 % (95 % CI: 75 - 86) of the intention-to-treat population. When established only by one negative 13 C-UBT result at least 28 days {{after the end of}} treatment, the respective intention-to-treat rates were 85 % (95 % CI: 79 - 90) and 88 % (95 % CI: 83 - 93).

40|$|Background : Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{is the main}} cause of gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcer disease, MALT lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma of the stomach. The reported prevalence of H. pylori in the adult population in Turkey is 67. 6 %– 81. 3 %. A national meta-analysis showed that the average H. pylori eradication rate with proton pump inhibitor-based triple regimens in Turkey had decreased from 84 % in 1997 to 55. 3 % in 2004, suggesting a need to evaluate alternative regimens. Materials and methods : The study was a prospective, single-center trial with a parallel group design. After the selection procedure, consecutive out-patients were assigned to one of six study groups using random sampling numbers. All patients received amoxicillin 1, 000 mg b. i. d. and clarithromycin 500 mg b. i. d. along with ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> 400 mg b. i. d., or omeprazole 20 mg b. i. d., or lansoprazole 30 mg b. i. d., or rabeprazole 20 mg b. i. d., or pantoprazole 40 mg b. i. d., or esomeprazole 40 mg b. i. d. for 14 days. Results : When we look at the eradication rates of the treatment groups, only two groups (ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> and rabeprazole groups) had eradication rates greater than 80 %, both at intention to treat and per protocol analyses.

METHODS: A comprehensive search of all published trials on H. pylori eradication therapy was carried out via an electronic database search, hand-searching and checking reference lists of pharmaceutical companies and other reviews. Full papers and abstracts in the English language which study currently advised eradication regimes were included. RESULTS: 770 study-arms were analysed. Mean eradication rates for bismuth based triple, proton pump inhibitor triple, quadruple and ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> combination therapies vary from 65 to 92 %. In case of nitroimidazole resistance, a drop in efficacy of up to 50 % was found for bismuth-based triple and proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapies.

40|$|Ranitidine <b>Bismuth</b> <b>Citrate</b> (RBC), {{recently}} developed to fight H. pylori, exhibits a triple action: anti-bacterial, antisecretive and mucosal-protective. Since less {{research has focused}} upon its mucosal protective action, we decided to study two parameters concerning that topic, i. e. the gastric mucosal blood flow and the adherent mucus gel thickness. Twenty rats were treated by gavage with either 25 mg/kg RBC or equal volume (1 ml) of drinking water; 60 min later, laparotomy was performed, the stomach opened along the greater curvature and gastric mucosal blood flow assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry. After this measurement, five - 20 mm long- fullthickness strips were sectioned from the stomach, mounted transversely on glass plates and viewed under a light microscopy using an eyepiece graticule (4 measurements/strip).

40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} shown that ranitidine bismuth citrate-based, clarithromycin-containing triple therapy achieves a higher eradication rate than proton pump inhibitor-based regimens {{in areas with}} a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance. Aim: To evaluate whether this higher efficacy of ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> over proton pump inhibitor can be extended to non-clarithromycin-containing regimens. Methods: Helicobacter pylori-positive dyspeptic patients were randomized to receive either ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate,</b> 400 mg, amoxicillin, 1000 mg, and metronidazole, 400 mg, or omeprazole, 20 mg, amoxicillin, 1000 mg, and metronidazole, 400 mg, each given twice daily for 1 week, H, pylori eradication was confirmed by 13 C-urea breath test 5 weeks later. The side-effects of the treatments were documented. Results: Two hundred and twenty-nine patients were eligible for analysis. By intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis, the eradication rates were 77 % and 79 %, respectively, in the ranitidine bismuth citrate-amoxicillin-metronidazole group and 77 % and 82 %, respectively, in the omeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole group (P = 0. 58 and P = 0. 65). However, patients in the omeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole group reported a significantly higher incidence of minor side-effects when compared {{to those in the}} ranitidine bismuth citrate-amoxicillin-metronidazole group (P = 0. 001). Conclusions: Ranitidine bismuth citrate-amoxicillin-metronidazole was equally as effective as omeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole triple therapy, and may be considered as an alternative non-clarithromycin-based regimen in the Chinese population. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims—To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the new Helicobacter pylori eradication regimen, ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> (RBC) and clarithromycin (CLAR) dual therapy, on duodenal ulcer healing and absence of ulcer recurrence during 24 weeks follow up (overall success).  Methods—Two hundred and thirty two H pylori positive patients with active duodenal ulcer received four weeks treatment with RBC 400 mg twice daily alone (RBC 400) (n= 82), or RBC 400 or 800 mg twice daily co-prescribed with clarithromycin 250 mg four times daily for 14 days, followed by 14 days of RBC 400 mg twice daily alone (RBC 400 +CLAR and RBC 800 +CLAR, respectively, n= 75 for each).  Results—The co-prescription regimens gave high H pylori eradication rates determined using two tests (CLOtest and 13 C-urea breath test) for the presence of the organism. These rates were 92 % and 81 % for RBC 400 +CLAR (n= 62) and RBC 800 +CLAR (n= 63) respectively, compared with 2 % for RBC 400 (n= 66) (p< 0. 001). With respect to overall success as estimated by life table analysis, RBC 400 +CLAR (89 %) and RBC 800 + CLAR (87 %) were significantly more effective than RBC 400 alone (51 %) (p< 0. 001). All regimens were safe and well tolerated. Trough plasma bismuth concentrations at week 4 were low (treatment medians less than 6. 6 ng bismuth/ml).  Conclusions—Ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> is a well tolerated and efficacious ulcer healing drug which, when co-prescribed with clarithromycin, affords effective H pylori eradication therapy and prevents ulcer relapse in most patients with duodenal ulcer. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and self-assembly of hierarchical architectures from nanoscale {{building blocks}} with unique morphology, orientation and dimension {{have opened up}} new opportunities to enhance their functional performances and remain a great challenge. This work represents tunable synthesis of various types of 3 D monodisperse in situ N-doped (BiO) (2) CO 3 hierarchical architectures composed of 2 D single-crystal nanosheets with dominant (001) facets by a one-pot template-free hydrothermal method from <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> and ammonia solution. Depending on the concentration of ammonia solution, the morphology of N-doped (BiO) (2) CO 3, including dandelion-like, hydrangea-like and peony flower-like microspheres, can be selectively constructed due to different self-assembly patterns of nanosheets. It was revealed that the ammonia played dual roles {{in the formation of}} N-doped (BiO) (2) CO 3 architectures. One is to hydrolyze <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate,</b> and the other is to behave as a nitrogen doping source. The in situ doped nitrogen substituted for oxygen in (BiO) (2) CO 3 and subsequently narrowed the band gap, making N-doped (BiO) (2) CO 3 visible light active. Due to the special nanosheets architectures, the prepared various N-doped (BiO) (2) CO 3 materials exhibited especially efficient photocatalytic activity and high durability for the removal of NO in air under both visible and UV light irradiation. Based on the direct observation of the growth process with respect to phase structure, chemical composition and morphological structure, a novel growth mechanism is revealed, which involves a unique multistep pathway, including reaction-nucleation, aggregation, crystallization, dissolution-recrystallization, and Ostwald ripening. The facile synthesis approach and the proposed growth mechanism could provide new insights into the design and controlled synthesis of inorganic hierarchical materials with new or enhanced properties...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{inducible}} isoform of {{nitric oxide}} synthase (iNOS) {{may be involved in}} the mucosal injury associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In contrast with iNOS, the inducible heme oxygenase 1  (HO- 1) is considered to act as a protective antioxidant system.  AIMS—To evaluate the effects of the known HO- 1 inducers, cadmium and bismuth salts, heme, and nitric oxide (NO) donors, on iNOS activity, and expression in the human intestinal epithelial cell line DLD- 1.  METHODS—iNOS activity was assessed by the Griess reaction and the radiochemical L-arginine conversion assay. iNOS mRNA and iNOS protein expression were determined by northern and western blotting, respectively.  RESULTS—Cytokine exposure led to induction of iNOS activity, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS protein expression. Preincubation of DLD- 1 cells with heme (1 - 50 µM) inhibited cytokine induced iNOS activity in a concentration dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was abolished by the HO- 1 specific inhibitor tin protoporphyrin. Preincubation with NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP 1 - 1000 µM) or S-nitroso-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP 1 - 1000 µM), or with the heavy metals cadmium chloride (10 - 40 µM), <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate,</b> or ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> (10 - 3000 µM) inhibited iNOS activity in a concentration dependent manner. Moreover, SNP and heme abolished cytokine induced iNOS protein as well as iNOS mRNA expression, whereas cadmium chloride did not modify iNOS protein expression.  CONCLUSIONS—Heme, the heavy metals cadmium and bismuth, as well as NO donors, are potent inhibitors of cytokine induced iNOS activity. Heme and NO donors act at the transcriptional level inhibiting iNOS mRNA expression. Such findings suggest the potential for interplay between the iNOS and HO- 1 systems, which may modulate the progress of IBD.    Keywords: inducible {{nitric oxide synthase}}; nitric oxide; colonic epithelial cells; cytokines; heme oxygenase- 1; bismuth citrat...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative {{organism}} that survives in {{the deep}} mucus layer and attaches to the gastric surface cells, {{is estimated to be}} present in up to one-half of the US population. Chronic H. pylori infection causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer diseases and even gastric cancer. Cure of the infection leads to healing of gastric inflammation, prevention of development of peptic ulcer, as well as accelerated healing of peptic ulcers, and prevention of ulcer recurrence. Treatment of H. pylori has undergone substantial evolution over the past decade. Despite the in vitro susceptibility, results from single or even dual drug therapy is typically unsatisfactory and the best therapy is yet to be defined. The best current therapies for H. pylori infection consist of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> and two antibiotics (triple therapies), or bismuth, tetracycline, metronidazole and a PPI (quadruple therapy). Clarithromycin {{is one of the most}} useful antimicrobials against H. pylori. It is an acid-stable macrolide with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, well absorbed with a wide tissue distribution and with mild side effects. Clarithromycin has a low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC 50) for H. pylori and its effect is potentiated by acid inhibition. When combined with a PPI or ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> and amoxicillin or metronidazole, eradication rates of more than 95 % can be achieved with susceptible organisms. However, the prevalence of primary and acquired clarithromycin resistance, which is due to mutations within a conserved loop of 23 S rRNA of H. pylori, is increasing. In practice, the presence of clarithromycin resistance usually implies reduced success when clarithromycin-containing regimes are used. There is a need for improved therapies for H. pylori where antibiotic resistance is less of a problem. 2000 © Ashley Publications Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Current therapies to heal peptic ulcers and {{eradicate}} Helicobacter pylori generally rely on {{a combination}} of antibacterial agents and anti-secretory drugs.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{method for}} {{the determination of}} Bi by direct injection nebulization inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (DIN-ICP-MS) in biological fluids is described. The detection limit for Bi is 9. 7 ng 1 - 1 (ca. 46 pmol dm- 3) with DIN compared with 17 ng 1 - 1 (ca. 81 pmol dm- 3) with conventional pneumatic nebulization (PN). The absolute amount detectable by DIN-ICP-MS is about two orders of magnitude lower for DIN compared with PN (0. 019 and 1. 70 pg, respectively). Sample wash-out times were greatly reduced using DIN owing to minimization of the memory effect for Bi. Using T 1 as an internal standard, good calibrations were obtained for Bi standards in 0. 14 mol dm- 3 nitric acid, serum and urine with comparable linearity between the matrices, and these {{were used for the}} determination of Bi in serum and urine samples from animals dosed with the antiulcer compound RBC (ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate).</b> This method is potentially useful in studies of the metabolism and biodistribution of Bi-containing drugs. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} remain {{useful for}} Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy. These include colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS), bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) and, most recently, ranitidine <b>bismuth</b> <b>citrate</b> (RBC). CBS appears {{to prevent the}} development of imidazole resistance when coadministered with nitroimidazoles.
