25|$|Omaveloxolone (RTA 408) is {{a second}} {{generation}} member of the synthetic oleanane triterpenoid compounds and currently in clinical development by Reata Pharmaceuticals. Preclinical {{studies have demonstrated that}} omaveloxolone possesses antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities and the ability to improve mitochondrial <b>bioenergetics.</b> Omaveloxolone is currently under clinical investigation for a variety of indications, including Friedreich’s ataxia, mitochondrial myopathies, immunooncology, and prevention of corneal endothelial cell loss following cataract surgery.|$|E
25|$|Nrf2 transcriptionally regulates {{multiple}} genes that play both {{direct and indirect}} roles in producing antioxidative potential {{and the production of}} cellular energy (i.e., adenosine triphosphate or ATP) within the mitochondria. Consequently, unlike exogenously administered antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E or Coenzyme Q10), which provide a specific and finite antioxidative potential, omaveloxolone, through Nrf2, broadly activates intracellular and mitochondrial antioxidative pathways, in addition to pathways that may directly increase mitochondrial biogenesis (such as PGC1α) and <b>bioenergetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{an essay}} {{regarding}} Goodwin’s conception by Margaret Boden in 1980, the next appearance of ‘cognitive biology’ as a phrase {{in the literature}} came in 1986 from a professor of biochemistry, Ladislav Kováč. His conception, based on natural principles grounded in <b>bioenergetics</b> and molecular biology, is briefly discussed below. Kováč’s continued advocacy has had a greater influence in his homeland, Slovakia, than elsewhere partly because several of his most important papers were written and published only in Slovakian.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to Serbia in 1919, his second phase was centered on metabolism. In this period, he published a physiology textbook in 1923, Fundamentals of physiology. In preface, he wrote that “he arranged the subject matter based on one leading idea: that circulation of matter and energy is the basic phenomenon of life, and that all physiological functions are subordinated to it.” He also researched <b>bioenergetics</b> and an effect of the temperature and asphyxia induced numbness on living organisms. His major work from this phase is the two-volume Homeothermy and thermoregulation from 1938.|$|E
25|$|The {{biochemical}} {{reactions that}} occur in living organisms are collectively known as metabolism. Among {{the most important of}} its mechanisms is the anabolism, in which different DNA and enzyme-controlled processes result in the production of large molecules such as proteins and carbohydrates from smaller units. <b>Bioenergetics</b> studies the sources of energy for such reactions. An important energy source is glucose, which can be produced by plants via photosynthesis or assimilated from food. All organisms use this energy to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which can then be used to energize other reactions.|$|E
25|$|Accreditation {{programs}} exist {{with professional}} bodies in most developed countries, ensuring {{the quality and}} consistency of education. In Canada, one may obtain the professional certification title – Certified Exercise Physiologist for those working with clients (both clinical and non clinical) in the health and fitness industry. An exercise physiologist's area of study may include but {{is not limited to}} biochemistry, <b>bioenergetics,</b> cardiopulmonary function, hematology, biomechanics, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and central and peripheral nervous system function. Furthermore, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.|$|E
25|$|By 1960 Christopher Hills had {{accumulated}} a large metaphysical library on frequent trips to Samuel Weiser Books in New York, while writing his own books, Kingdom of Desire, Power of the Doctrine and The Power of Increased Perception. At 30 {{he retired from}} business and began to research multiple spiritual paths and the physics of what Einstein called Unified field theory. Prolific research papers and lectures came out of Hills' laboratory in the Blue Mountains (Jamaica) on subjects such as <b>bioenergetics,</b> hypnosis, tele-thought, biophysics, effects of solar radiation on living organisms, resonant systems of ionosphere, and capacitor effects of human body on static electricity and electron discharge of the nervous system. In 1960 he began a 30-year project to document the effects of sound and color on human consciousness and states of health.|$|E
500|$|Ca2+ influx to the {{mitochondrial}} matrix {{has recently}} been implicated as a mechanism to regulate respiratory <b>bioenergetics</b> by allowing the electrochemical potential across the membrane to transiently [...] "pulse" [...] from ΔΨ-dominated to pH-dominated, facilitating a reduction of oxidative stress. In neurons, concomitant increases in cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium act to synchronize neuronal activity with mitochondrial energy metabolism.

2500|$|Temperature plays a {{key role}} in the ecology, {{physiology}} and metabolism of aquatic species. [...] The rate of PCB metabolism was temperature dependent in yellow perch (Perca flavescens). [...] In fall and winter, only 11 out of 72 introduced PCB congeners were excreted and had half-lives of more than 1,000 days. [...] During spring and summer when the average daily water temperature was above 20°C, persistent PCBs had half-lives of 67 days. [...] The main excretion processes were fecal egestion, growth dilution and loss across respiratory surfaces. [...] The excretion rate of PCBs matched with the perch’s natural <b>bioenergetics,</b> where most of their consumption, respiration and growth rates occur during the late spring and summer. [...] Since the perch is performing more functions in the warmer months, it naturally has a faster metabolism and has less PCB accumulation. [...] However, multiple cold-water periods mixed with toxic PCBs with coplanar chlorine molecules can be detrimental to perch health.|$|E
