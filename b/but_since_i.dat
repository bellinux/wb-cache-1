500|$|The {{situation}} in Rio Grande do Sul was chaotic, {{and the local}} military commanders were incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the Paraguayan army. PedroII, aware of the danger, {{decided to go to}} the front to shore up operations. As the Emperor's military aide-de-camp, Caxias followed him into the combat zone. The marquis had warned the Progressive cabinet that Brazil was unprepared to intervene in Uruguay and even less prepared to resist a foreign invasion. His warnings were ignored, and he complained, with a bit of irony, to his friend João Maurício Vanderlei, Baron of Cotejipe, a former colleague in the Conciliation cabinet: [...] "I am almost mad with the mistakes that I am seeing being made, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> am a red [...] I am not listened to, since everything is progress in our country." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{called this}} idea the central dogma, for two reasons, I suspect. I had already used the obvious word {{hypothesis}} {{in the sequence}} hypothesis, and in addition I wanted {{to suggest that this}} new assumption was more central and more powerful. ... As it turned out, {{the use of the word}} dogma caused almost more trouble than it was worth. Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E
500|$|Sholay was {{the first}} Indian film to have a {{stereophonic}} soundtrack {{and to use the}} 70mm widescreen format. However, since actual 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, [...] "A 70mm [...] format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator." [...] The use of 70mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: [...] "The greatest star cast ever assembled– the greatest story ever told".|$|E

500|$|One notable {{advocate}} for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean's epilepsy as well as Twain's own chronic bronchitis. In 1909, he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. [...] "I don't know as I cared much about these osteopaths until I heard {{you were going to}} drive them out of the state, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> heard that I haven't been able to sleep." [...] Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with [...] "he physicians think they are moved by regard for {{the best interests of the}} public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?" [...] "...The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Zappa {{prepared}} a remix of Cruising with Ruben & the Jets for its compact disc reissue and the vinyl box set The Old Masters I. The remix featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman, {{much as the}} 1984 remix of We're Only in It for the Money had featured. Zappa stated [...] "The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> liked the results on We're Only in it For the Money, I {{decided to do it}} on Ruben too. But those are the only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rolo's slogan-daubed car was {{a regular}} sight {{in the streets of}} Sydney, with protests of {{everything}} from smoking to royalty to religion. Until this time, there had been no anti-police slogans on the vehicle. However, never one to back down, Rolo then added the ambiguous [...] "Pigs are definitely not Kosher" [...] and the less ambiguous [...] "Support honest police, they both need you". He stated the Police harassment made him more determined to continue his antics. [...] "I left Argentina because it is run by a police-military fascist regime. I thought Australia was the land of democracy, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> began speaking out about things I think are wrong, I've found Australia is becoming a police state".|$|E
