Ashley created the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel</b> Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel.</b> The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports. A service is held annually to bless the island.|$|E

5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel</b> and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel</b> and the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{position}} {{near the mouth}} of the River Parrett, and the constantly shifting sands of the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel,</b> {{there has always been a}} significant risk to shipping in the area. As a result, several lighthouses, have been built.|$|E
50|$|During {{this period}} Nicholls engaged in other enterprises, acting mostly with Telford, {{who became a}} friend. Among their joint schemes was the plan of the English and <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channels</b> Ship Canal, in favour of which in December 1824 he and Telford reported. The reports were adopted, and an act of {{parliament}} obtained. The Panic of 1825, however, hindered the raising of funds; {{and the advent of}} railways killed the project.|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to use a}} generically {{integrated}} meteorological and hydrodynamic ensemble {{modelling system}} to quantitatively assess the effect of uncertainties arising from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) on the tide, surge and wave forecasts.

5|$|From 1768 {{there were}} a number of grand schemes proposed, all with the aim of linking the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel</b> to the English Channel by a waterway, thereby {{avoiding}} the need to navigate by sea around Cornwall and Devon. James Brindley was the first to survey a route, which would have run from the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel</b> to Exeter, following the course of the River Tone for part of its route. In 1769, Robert Whitworth looked at a shorter route from Bridgwater Bay to Seaton, following the River Parrett and the River Axe. He was asked to reassess the route in the 1790s. William Jessop surveyed a route between Taunton and Exeter in 1794, while another group proposed a canal linking Bristol, Nailsea, Bridgwater and Taunton, which was surveyed by William White. Jessop's assistant, Josiah Easton, suggested a route from Uphill (on the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel)</b> to Seaton, again in 1794, and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the Grand Western Canal and the Bristol and Western Canal, respectively. Only the first was authorised, but the economic downturn caused by the Napoleonic Wars meant that construction did not begin immediately.|$|E
5|$|Guglielmo Marconi, the {{inventor}} of wireless telegraphy, successfully transmitted radio signals across the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel</b> {{in the spring of}} 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to Brean Down (just south west of Weston, {{on the other side of}} the River Axe).|$|E
5|$|Proposals for the {{construction}} of a Severn Barrage aim to harness this energy. The island of Steep Holm in the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel</b> is within the ceremonial county and is now administered by North Somerset Council.|$|E
500|$|The {{town was}} built on the mouth of a small {{tributary}} of the Severn Estuary near the mouth of the River Avon. The old pill or jetty provided protection for craft against the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel's</b> large tidal range, and iron rings {{can be seen in the}} high street at which fishing boats used to moor. Its position meant Portishead was used to guard the [...] "King Road", as the waters around the headland are called. In 1497 it was the departure point for John Cabot on the Matthew. A fort {{was built on}} Battery Point, and was used during the English Civil War when the town supported the Royalists, but surrendered to Fairfax in 1645. [...] Guns were also placed at Battery Point during World War II. The King Road was the site of a naval action in 1758 when HMS Antelope captured HMS Belliqueux, one of a French squadron returning from Quebec.|$|R
50|$|The Chard and Taunton Railway got {{parliamentary}} {{authority to}} build its line by Act of 6 August 1861. It was to build a -mile line as a first stage to connecting the <b>Bristol</b> and English <b>Channels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Brean Down Fort {{was built}} on the {{headland}} between 1864 and 1871 on the recommendations of the 1859 Royal Commission. It was the most southerly of a chain of defences across the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel,</b> protecting the access to Bristol and Cardiff. Four acres of land at the end of Brean Down were requisitioned in 1862, with construction beginning in 1864 and completed in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Crosses, cruces, creases and cree {{were found}} in a broad band across England from crosses in Lincolnshire, cruce or cruces from Oxford through to Gloucester, creases in Berkshire and cree in South Wales and {{both sides of the}} <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel.</b> There are some areas of scruces, screwsies or screws in Essex and Suffolk.

25|$|In 1845, {{when the}} Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had {{recently}} completed its main line, there were proposals {{for a number}} of different and competitive railway schemes in west Somerset. A <b>Bristol</b> and English <b>Channels</b> Direct Junction Railway was proposed as a link from Watchet through Stogumber and Bishops Lydeard to Bridport on the south coast, which would be an alternative to ships taking a long and dangerous passage around Land's End. This prompted the promotion of a connecting line from Williton to Minehead and Porlock, a line designed to attract tourists to Exmoor. Shortly afterwards, a <b>Bristol</b> and English <b>Channels</b> Connection Railway was suggested from Stolford to Bridport which would have passed through the Quantock Hills near Crowcombe. Alternatively, the Bridgwater and Minehead Junction Railway would link with the B at Bridgwater and run through Williton to Minehead with a branch to Watchet and a connecting Minehead and Central Devon Junction Railway would provide a line to Exeter. An alternative link to South Devon was proposed by the Exeter, Tiverton and Minehead Direct Railway through Dunster and offered an extension to Ilfracombe.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the technique for channel sounding experiments {{carried out at}} the Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in <b>Bristol.</b> The <b>channel</b> sounding measurements were taken at 1. 7225 GHz, a frequency {{similar to those used}} by DCS 1800 and DECT, and to those which will be employed by other emerging PCS standards. Due to the time-varying characteristics of these radio channels, it is important to reflect the variations of the channel impulse response in the experiments, since the average impulse response gives only limited information for the analysis of radio communication systems. The technique presented is based on a software correlation between the input and the output of the channel, and the dynamic performance achieved is better than that obtained with conventional techniques. In particular, unlike conventional correlation sounders, this technique does not suffer from the trade-off between dynamic range and maximum resolvable Doppler shif...|$|R
5|$|In 1832 {{the island}} was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who {{established}} an inn for sailors. The inn was run by the Harris family, using rum and tobacco bought from ships. They claimed that {{the island was}} outside {{the jurisdiction of the}} excise men until a court case in 1884. After the Harris family, the inn was run by Mr W.L. Davies, who offered fishing, shooting and boating holidays. To make landing on the island easier, a new pier was built close to the inn. In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel</b> Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the <b>Bristol</b> <b>Channel.</b> The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.|$|E
