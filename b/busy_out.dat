60|$|The {{garden in}} front of their house, where Helena was waiting for him, was long and crooked, with a sunken {{flagstone}} pavement running up to the door {{by the side of the}} lawn. On either hand the high fence of the garden was heavy with wild clematis and honeysuckle. Helena sat sideways, with a map spread out on her bench under the bushy little laburnum tree, tracing the course of their wanderings. It was very still. There was just a murmur of bees going in and out the brilliant little porches of nasturtium flowers. The nasturtium leaf-coins stood cool and grey; in their delicate shade, underneath in the green twilight, a few flowers shone their submerged gold and scarlet. There was a faint scent of mignonette. Helena, like a white butterfly in the shade, her two white arms for antennae stretching firmly to the bench, leaned over her map. She was busy, very <b>busy,</b> <b>out</b> of sheer happiness. She traced word after word, and evoked scene after scene. As she discovered a name, she conjured up the place. As she moved to the next mark she imagined the long path lifting and falling happily.|$|E

They generated a so-called histogram (actually a scatterplot) of parts of the fabric where failures were particularly numerous, usually pointing to a particular bad crosspoint, even if it failed sporadically rather than consistently.

The trip was uneventful. The sleepers were comfortable and since I was Mess Officer {{in one of the}} kitchens, I made sure I ate O. K. Darling, the trip was similar to the one we made numerous times. I felt cheated in that I was not given the chance to see country which I have yet to see. I received a letter from Helen and Davey in which they write {{that they would like to}} see you and would like to have you stay with them. Frankly, I think it would be an excellent idea and give you a chance to enjoy a little vacation. As for me, I would jump at the opportunity immediately. If you don’t care to stay at their house, you could stay at Sylvia’s apartment or at a hotel. Yet, I would let them know where you are so that they could invite you out sometime. As for my work, we are kept pretty <b>busy</b> <b>out</b> here. We have received the assurance that passes will be available as soon as our requirements are met. If I get a pass, I’ll try to take in the big city and its theatres. We don’t know how long we’ll be here, so anything goes. Even one pass will be worth everything. The camp here is a reception center type, and reminds me so much of Edgewood. I attended a USO show tonight, which was excellent. Naturally, it had most of its talent from the big city. I didn’t spend much on the trip, about $ 3. 00, but I spent a lot of money today, such as $ 35. 00 combat coat 10. 00 val pack with zipper 7. 50 gift for Edith—surprise 1. 50 Schick blades $ 54. 00 whee! Also, I am rapidly running out of money. You might wire or send me some check blanks. My fondest regards to all, I remain your loving, devoted and eternal admirer. Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
40|$|Relevance: In a <b>busy</b> <b>out</b> {{patients}} department {{time for}} Continuing Professional Development (CPD) competes with patient contact {{in order to}} meet service requirements. Evidence based practice is supported by clinical guidelines and pathways of care, although uptake can be problematic. To facilitate decisions in practice clinicians need access to relevant information in a timely fashion. Information on management needs to be readily available and embedded within service delivery. Information technology can facilitate service delivery, evidence based healthcare and individual staff development. Purpose: This project aimed to embed pathways of care into the Community Musculoskeletal Service and Continuing Professional Development structure to ensure consistency of knowledge in the management of anterior knee pain. Approach: Using the plan, do, study, act cycle we developed a quarterly CPD cycle with taught sessions, journal club and structured supervision focussing on a key are of service provision. Inservice training sessions were used to review the evidence base and develop consistency in assessment and treatment skills. Journal clubs focused on critical appraisal of evidence that informs the pathway. Structured supervision topics embedded the pathway within individual's clinical practice. Following an audit of lower limb conditions seen in the department we focused on the management of people with anterior knee pain. We developed an integrated knee pathway, which we embedded in our electronic appointments system for ease of access at the clinical interface. The interactive pathway covered the key aspects of assessment and management of anterior knee pain and linked to patient information resources and education group referral criteria within our service. The journal club focussed on evidence for the management of anterior knee pain. The structured supervision topic was based on the integrated pathway for anterior knee pain with clinicians reviewing clinical records to identify management in the light of best evidence. Evaluation: We evaluated the management of thirty randomly selected patients with anterior knee pain against the integrated anterior knee pain pathway across three time periods; 2012, 2013 and 2014. Patient records were reviewed for three key aspects of management; stretching (hamstrings, calf and ileotibial band), recruitment of vastus medialis oblique (static and dynamic) and recruitment of gluteals. Outcomes: The proportion of patients who were managed with stretching increased across the three year period: hamstrings 40...|$|E
