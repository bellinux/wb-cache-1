50|$|Amédée-François Frézier (1682 - October 26, 1773) was a French {{military}} engineer, mathematician, spy, and explorer who is {{best remembered}} for bringing back five specimens of Fragaria chiloensis, the <b>beach</b> <b>strawberry,</b> from an assignment in South America, thus introducing this New World fruit to the Old.|$|E
5000|$|Etter {{became known}} for his insistence {{on the value of}} using {{unimproved}} parent material, often taken from wild strains, and he frequently made 'wide' crosses between widely divergent genetic types. In his work with strawberries, he showed other breeders the value of the <b>beach</b> <b>strawberry</b> (Fragaria chiloensis) as a source of germplasm conveying vigor, productivity, flavor, and disease resistance. He also worked in a more minor way with F. virginiana species.|$|E
50|$|Fragaria chiloensis, the <b>beach</b> <b>{{strawberry}},</b> Chilean strawberry, or coastal strawberry, {{is one of}} {{two species}} of strawberry that were hybridized to create the modern garden strawberry (F. × ananassa). It is noted for its large berries. Its natural range is the Pacific Ocean coasts of North and South America, and also Hawaii. Migratory birds are thought to have dispersed F. chiloensis from the Pacific coast of North America to the mountains of Hawaii, Chile, and Argentina.|$|E
50|$|The {{summit of}} Turtle Hill rises to about 666 ft. It is an outcrop of chert, {{which is part}} of the {{heterogeneous}} assemblage known as the Franciscan Formation, or Franciscan Assemblage, the primary geologic feature on which the city of San Francisco is founded, here covered with a thin layer of sand. It provides one of the last remaining habitats within the city for a number of native plants, including the endangered Franciscan wallflower and dune tansy, and also bush lupin, <b>beach</b> <b>strawberry,</b> bush monkey flower, and coyote bush. The hill is crowned with Monterey cypress trees.|$|E

5000|$|Passing {{himself off}} as a trader or {{merchant}} captain {{so that he could}} visit the fortifications as a tourist. Frézier ingratiated himself with the Spanish Governors, and based in Concepción, sketched maps of the ports that showed the best approaches for attack, where ammunition was stored and the routes of escape, estimated the strength of the Spanish colonial governments, the state of these colonies' natives, and examined the Spanish gold and silver mines. He also reported on the operations of the Church, the physical geography and flora and fauna of the area, as well as its agricultural products - such as the species of strawberry that he would subsequently introduce to Europe. About the <b>beach</b> <b>strawberry,</b> Frézier wrote: [...] "They there cultivate entire fields of a type of strawberry differing from ours by their rounder leaves, being fleshier and having strong runners. Its fruit are usually as large as a whole walnut, and sometimes as a small egg. They are of a whitish-red colour and a little less delicate to the taste than our woodland strawberries." ...|$|E

Edible fruits grow in open spaces in these forests, such as <b>beach</b> <b>strawberry</b> (Fragaria chiloensis var. chiloensis forma chiloensis) and calafate (Berberis buxifolia), which have been collected by Indians and residents alike. These forests are unique {{in the world for}} having developed in a climate with such cold summers. Tree cover extends very close to the southernmost tip of South America. Winds are so strong that trees in wind-exposed areas grow twisted by the force of winds, and people call the trees [...] "flag-trees" [...] for the shape that they need to take in the fight with the wind. Tree vegetation extends as far south as the Isla de los Estados, Navarino Island and the north of Hoste Island. At altitudes above, dwarf nothofagus communities are found. Going further south, Wollaston Islands and the south of Hoste Island are covered by subantarctic tundra.|$|E
40|$|The {{strawberry}} is {{a native}} of North America. The cultivated berry, as it is known today, is a relatively recent product of plant breeding. The cultivated strawberry is derived from two species. They are Fragaria virginiana, the wild meadow strawberry of eastern North America, and Fragaria chiloensis, the <b>beach</b> <b>strawberry,</b> which is found along the Pacific coast. The first improvement occurred among the Indians of Chile before Columbus landed at San Salvador. By selection from Fragaria chiloensis, they obtained plants which bore fruit of exceptional size and quality...|$|E
