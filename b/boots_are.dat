5|$|Skis are lighter, {{narrower}} {{and designed}} to be faster than those used in recreational cross-country skiing and made of composite materials. For classic events, typical ski lengths are between 195 and 210 centimetres, while ski lengths for skating are 170 to 200cm. Skis for skating are also more rigid than skis for classical. Skis are waxed for speed and, {{in the case of}} classic skis, traction when striding forward. Racing ski <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> also lighter than recreational ones and are attached at the toe only to bindings that are specialized for classic or skate skiing.|$|E

50|$|Russian <b>boots</b> <b>were</b> popular {{during the}} 1920s and the {{emergence}} of these tall <b>boots</b> for women <b>was</b> interpreted by some contemporary writers as a consequence of women’s transition from the “leisure class” to the world of business.

Although they were still popular as late as the beginning of the 1930s, within a few years Russian boots had fallen out of favor.|$|R

Ski <b>boots</b> <b>are</b> a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and {{designed to provide a}} way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings. The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.|$|E
