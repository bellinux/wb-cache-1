5|$|Last Night in Twisted River took 20 {{years to}} {{conceive}} and write, {{and is a}} story within a story that shows {{the development of a}} novelist and the writing process. It uses many of the themes and plot devices that have already seen treatment in other works <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author.</b> The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E

Balzac's health was deteriorating by this point, making the completion of this pair of books a significant accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|Much of Shen Kuo's written {{work was}} {{probably}} purged {{under the leadership}} of minister Cai Jing (1046–1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies. For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author.</b>|$|E

5|$|Originally {{published}} in serial form {{during the winter}} of 1834/35, Le Père Goriot is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks the first serious use <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext.|$|E

5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of places and people that inspired him.|$|E
