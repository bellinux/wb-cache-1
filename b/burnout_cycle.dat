40|$|Two-component binder model systems {{composed}} of the non-polar polymer polypropylene and either non-polar paraffin wax (PW) or moderately polar stearic acid (SA) as low molecular weight components (LMWC) have been chosen in order to study the achievable weight loss (removable mass) of LMWCs during conventional thermal debinding in the lower temperature regime. Stainless steel 316 L served as the powder material If {{has been found that}} the removable mass of SA is considerably lower than that of PW. This effect reflects the physical interaction of the low molecular weight components with the basic polymer. The influence of the debinding temperature and the sample thickness on the removable mass is discussed. The phenomena of removable mass influences the <b>burnout</b> <b>cycle</b> of powder injection moulded parts and attention has to be paid to this effect when devising a conventional thermal debinding treatment for a given binder. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} {{and performance of}} a ceramic component is determined {{by a combination of}} the materials from which it was fabricated and how it was processed. Most ceramic components are manufactured by dry pressing a powder/binder system in which the organic binder provides formability and green compact strength. A key step in this manufacturing process is the removal of the binder from the powder compact after pressing. The organic binder is typically removed by a thermal decomposition process in which heating rate, temperature, and time are the key process parameters. Empirical approaches are generally used to design the <b>burnout</b> time-temperature <b>cycle,</b> often resulting in excessive processing times and energy usage, and higher overall manufacturing costs. Ideally, binder burnout should be completed as quickly as possible without damaging the compact, while using a minimum of energy. Process and computational modeling offer one means to achieve this end. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop an experimentally validated computer model that can be used to better understand, control, and optimize binder burnout from green ceramic compacts...|$|R
