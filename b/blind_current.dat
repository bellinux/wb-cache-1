In these models, the geometrical information related to the deposit is transformed into parameter coefficients on a fictitious interface.

To support answering questions quickly, we introduce a general approach for intelligently recruiting human workers in advance called quikTurkit so that workers are available when new questions arrive. A field deployment with 11 blind participants illustrates that blind people can effectively use VizWiz to cheaply answer questions in their everyday lives, highlighting issues that automatic approaches will need to address to be useful.

The isolates form two lineages that fall outside the classical trachoma lineage, instead being placed within UGT clades of the C. trachomatis phylogenetic tree. The Australian trachoma isolates appear to be recombinants with UGT C. trachomatis genome backbones, in which loci that encode immunodominant surface proteins (ompA and pmpEFGH) have been replaced by those characteristic of classical ocular isolates. This suggests that ocular tropism and association with trachoma are functionally associated with some sequence variants of ompA and pmpEFGH...|$|R

These disabilities coincide most often in the elderly and as the elderly constitute almost two thirds of all blind people (due to the fact that blindness occurs most often in the over 65 's) we feel that this attention is justified. Some of the elderly blind have difficulty in using the common mobility aids such as the long cane or guide dog and consequently have little opportunity for independent exercise.

Adolescents (ages 14 – 19) at an “age of risk ” for bipolar disorder onset were screened on BAS sensitivity by interviewers <b>blind</b> to <b>current</b> symptoms, lifetime history, and family history of psychopathology. Participants were selected with high versus moderate levels of BAS sensitivity and administered a lifetime diagnostic interview. Those with a bipolar spectrum disorder, psychosis, or hypomanic episode with onset prior to the BAS sensitivity assessment were excluded. High BAS (n 171) and moderate BAS (n 119) sensitivity participants in the final sample completed baseline measures of symptoms, goal-setting, and reward responsiveness and were followed prospectively with semistructured diagnostic interviews every 6 months. Consistent with the vulnerability hypothesis of the BAS model of bipolar disorder, high BAS participants had a greater likelihood, and shorter time to onset, of bipolar spectrum disorder than moderate BAS participants across an average of 12. 8 months of follow-up (12. 9 % vs. 4. 2 %), controlling for baseline depressive and hypomanic symptoms, and family history of bipolar disorder. High reward responsiveness on a behavioral task and ambitious goal-striving for popular fame and financial success (but not impulsivity) also predicted first onset of bipolar spectrum disorder controlling for the covariates and BAS risk group, and ambitious goal-striving partially mediated the BAS risk group effect.

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is a major}} health problem {{in the developed world}} accounting for approximately half of all <b>blind</b> registrations. <b>Current</b> treatment options are unsuitable for the majority of patients and therefore the identification of modifiable risk factors that may inform disease prevention programmes is a priority. This review evaluates the long-held belief that blue light exposure has a role in the pathogenesis of AMD. Laboratory evidence has demonstrated that photochemical reactions in the oxygen-rich environment of the outer retina lead to the liberation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS cause oxidative stress which is known to {{contribute to the development of}} AMD. The precise chromopore that may be involved in the pathogenesis of AMD is unclear but the age pigment lipofuscin is a likely candidate. Its aerobic photoreactivity and adverse effects on antioxidant activity combined with its gradual accumulation over time suggests that its in vivo phototoxicity increases with age despite changes in the absorption characteristics of the crystalline lens. Evidence from animal studies confirms blue light's damaging potential but the results are not directly applicable to {{macular degeneration}} in humans. Studies of human macular pigment density and the risk of AMD progression following cataract surgery lend further weight to the hypothesis that blue light exposure has a role in the pathogenesis of AMD but the epidemiological evidence is equivocal. On balance the evidences suggests but does not yet confirm that blue light is a risk factor for AMD. Given the socio-economic impact of this disease and urgent need to identify modifiable risk factors, future work should include a large-scale clinical trial to evaluate the effect of blue blocking filters on AMD progression rates...|$|R

40|$|We {{address for}} the first time the issue of motion blur in light field images {{captured}} from plenoptic cameras (instead of camera arrays), where the spatial sampling in each view is decimated. We propose a solution to the estimation of a sharp light field given a blurry one, when the motion blur point spread function is unknown, i. e., the so-called blind deconvolution problem. Unfortunately, the (decimated) spatial sampling of each light field view does not allow the use of <b>current</b> <b>blind</b> deconvolution approaches for traditional cameras. Also, due to the complexity of the imaging model, we investigate first the case of uniform (shift-invariant) blur of Lambertian objects, i. e., when objects are sufficiently far away from the camera to be approximately invariant to depth changes and their reflectance does not vary with the viewing direction. We introduce a highly parallelizable model for light field motion blur that is computationally and memory efficient.
