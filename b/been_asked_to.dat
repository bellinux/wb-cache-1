Initially, they <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of self-criticism. They <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user <b>is</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> reflect upon the experience.|$|R

5|$|In 2002 {{producers}} asked Barlow {{to return}} as Mavis, {{but she was}} too busy. In 2006 Barlow claimed that she had again <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> return to Coronation Street, but had refused as she felt the storylines were not good enough for Mavis. Barlow stated in 2007 that she is unlikely to return, because she would be unable to cope with the accelerated production schedule of one more episode a week since her last appearance in 1997. Executive producer Kim Crowther said in 2009 that she would have liked Mavis to return to the serial.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E

40|$|Destination {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the receiver of transmitted information. By means of a destination memory directed forgetting task, we investigated whether participants with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) were able to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory. Twenty-six AD participants and 30 healthy elderly subjects <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> tell 10 different proverbs to 10 different celebrities (List 1). Afterwards, half of the participants were instructed to forget the destinations (i. e., the celebrities) whereas the other half <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> keep them in mind. After telling 10 other proverbs to 10 other celebrities (List 2), participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> read numbers aloud. Subsequently, all the participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> remember the destinations of List 1 and List 2, regardless of the forget or remember instructions. The results show similar destination memory in AD participants who <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> forget the destinations of List 1 and those who <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> retain them. These findings are attributed to inhibitory deficits, by which AD participants have difficulties to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory...|$|R
5|$|The {{cover was}} created by graphic artist Margo Nahas. It was not {{specifically}} commissioned; Nahas had <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> create a cover that featured four chrome women dancing, but declined due to the creative difficulties. Her husband brought her portfolio to the band anyway, and from that material they chose the painting of a putto stealing cigarettes that was used. The model was Carter Helm, who was the child of one of Nahas' best friends, whom she photographed holding a candy cigarette.|$|E
5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic. Many believe the unnatural occurrences are {{the beginning of}} the Apocalypse. Dr. Stephen Strange, the court magician of Queen Elizabeth I, senses that there are unnatural forces at work. He has also <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> watch over the secret treasure of the Knights Templar which is being brought over from Jerusalem. Elizabeth tells her head of intelligence, Sir Nicholas Fury, to bring the weapon to England safely. Fury in turn contracts blind minstrel and agent Matthew Murdoch to rendezvous with the Templar guard somewhere in Europe and secure the weapon. Later that evening, Fury and his assistant Peter Parquagh are attacked by an assassin whom Fury disables and locks in the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs had <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental divide between the two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, while {{attending}} Northwestern High School, {{he began working}} for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV), creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. After graduating from high school, Henson enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, as a studio arts major, thinking he might become a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department {{introduced him to the}} craft and textiles courses in the College of Home economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he had <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character: Kermit the Frog.

5|$|Jean Beliveau's number 4 was {{retired in}} 1971 {{after he left}} the game as the all-time leading scorer in Stanley Cup playoff history. Beliveau was offered, but declined, the {{position}} of Governor General of Canada in 1994; he is the only hockey player known to have <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> serve in this capacity. Guy Lafleur's number 10 followed in February 1985 after his first retirement. Lafleur was a six-time All-Star with the Canadiens, and won three scoring titles and two most valuable player awards. Also in 1985, Doug Harvey's number 2 was raised to the rafters. The defenceman won six Norris Trophies as the NHL's top defenceman in seven years between 1955 and 1961. Jacques Plante's number 1 was retired on October 17, 1995. Plante revolutionized the way goaltenders played the game, and he leads the Canadiens with 314career wins.|$|E

Suchit <b>was</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> eliminate a roadie from the other pair. He selected Anchal.|$|R
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> keep his controller's name a secret.

Garry pleaded guilty to murders, and forensic evidence has linked him to a wood-carving chisel used to commit the murders.

Although usually the responsibility of Park, the controllers took the matter into their own hands and ordered all aircraft into the air. Even those that were not in combat condition were flown north-east, to avoid them being caught on the ground.|$|E
5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth of a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> stand as his godfather.
