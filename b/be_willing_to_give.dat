The Iranians indicated that while they would not <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up their right to enrichment in principle, they were willing to consider the compromise solution. However, in March 2006, the Bush Administration {{made it clear that they}} would not accept any enrichment at all in Iran.|$|E

25|$|His next {{aim was to}} {{make the}} {{imperial}} crown hereditary. Henry tried to secure the Imperial election of his son Frederick II as King of the Romans, which however met with objections raised by Archbishop Adolf of Cologne. Spending the winter in Hagenau Castle, the emperor and his ministeriales evolved the idea of a hereditary monarchy. Though they would have lost their right to elect the kings, the secular princes themselves wished to make their Imperial fiefs hereditary and to be inheritable by the female line as well, and Henry agreed to consider these demands. The emperor also bought the support of ecclesiastical princes by announcing that he would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the Jus Spolii and the right to receive recurring earnings from church lands during a period of sede vacante. At the Diet of Würzburg, held in March/April 1196, he managed to convince the majority of the princes to vote for his proposal. However, Archbishop Adolf of Cologne did not even put in an appearance and several princes, predominantly in Saxony and Thuringia, were still dissatisfied.|$|E
500|$|Spain's push {{to regain}} {{sovereignty}} over Gibraltar was fuelled by the decolonisation {{agenda of the}} United Nations, which had been initiated in 1946. In that year, Britain had listed Gibraltar among other [...] "Overseas Dependent Territories" [...] {{in conjunction with the}} drive towards decolonisation, but it was not appreciated at the time that Gibraltar was in a unique position; due to the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, it could only be British or Spanish and could not gain independence. Franco's government calculated that Britain would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up an expensive possession that no longer {{had a great deal of}} military value, but this turned out to be a fundamental misjudgement. The British government followed a policy of allowing its colonies to become self-governing entities before giving them the option of independence. Almost all took it, choosing to become independent republics. That option was not available to Gibraltar under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht, which required that if Britain ever relinquished control it was to be handed back to Spain. The Gibraltarians strongly opposed this and organised a referendum in September 1967 in which 12,138 voters opted to remain with Britain and only 44 supported union with Spain. Spain dismissed the outcome of the referendum, calling the city's inhabitants [...] "pseudo-Gibraltarians" [...] and stating that the [...] "real" [...] Gibraltarians were the descendants of the Spanish inhabitants who had resettled elsewhere in the region over 250 years earlier.|$|E

[...] E! said that [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] was {{possibly}} [...] "the best episode ever of the entire series." [...] TV Guide described [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] as [...] "a dizzying exercise in adventure, sustained tension and time-shifting rug pulling [...] spectacularly produced, amazingly directed and gloriously acted." [...] IGN gave the double episode a perfect 10/10 – the best review of the season – saying it was [...] "nothing short of a masterpiece of storytelling with a brilliantly paced narrative." [...] IGN would conclude that the flashforward was the [...] "Biggest Shock" [...] in 2007 television. Both IGN and The Los Angeles Times would later declare [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] as the second best Lost episode, behind [...] "The Constant". BuddyTV praised the unpredictability, saying that [...] "no other show can even attempt to do what Lost does." [...] BuddyTV would later call [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] the best finale of 2007 and Charlie's death the saddest TV death of 2007. [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] was TV.coms [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] for [...] "Best Episode" [...] of 2007. [...] AOLs TV Squad gave the episode a 7/7, noting that [...] "the writers followed through on Desmond's premonitions and successfully delivered the highly anticipated game-changer."

He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs might not want to stick around, but the rest of us should <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least.

40|$|We {{report the}} result of {{experiments}} designed to assess the effect of initial endowments on willingness to pay values elicited from multi-unit Vickrey auctions.

The endowment effect is “reverse” when the number of units that participants <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up <b>is</b> lower or equal to the number of remaining endowed units.
