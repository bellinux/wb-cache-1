2500|$|Digital audio, {{programmable}} control: Both {{the audio}} circuit and the additional control circuits are fully digital. The hearing professional programs {{the hearing aid}} with an external computer temporarily connected to the device and can adjust all processing characteristics on an individual basis. Fully digital circuitry allows implementation of many additional features not possible with analog circuitry, {{can be used in}} all styles of hearing aids and is the most flexible; for example, digital hearing aids can be programmed to amplify certain frequencies more than others, and can provide better sound quality than analog hearing aids. Fully digital hearing aids can be programmed with multiple programs that can be invoked by the wearer, or that operate automatically and adaptively. These programs reduce acoustic feedback (whistling), reduce background noise, detect and automatically accommodate different listening environments (loud vs soft, speech vs music, quiet vs noisy, etc.), control additional components such as multiple microphones to improve spatial hearing, transpose frequencies (shift high frequencies that a wearer may not hear to lower frequency regions where hearing may be better), and implement many other features. Fully digital circuitry also allows control over wireless transmission capability for both the audio and the control circuitry. Control signals in a hearing aid on one ear can be sent wirelessly to the control circuitry in the hearing aid on the opposite ear to ensure that the audio in both ears is either matched directly or that the audio contains intentional differences that mimic the differences in normal <b>binaural</b> <b>hearing</b> to preserve spatial hearing ability. Audio signals can be sent wirelessly to and from external devices through a separate module, often a small device worn like a pendant and commonly called a “streamer”, that allows wireless connection to yet other external devices. This capability allows optimal use of mobile telephones, personal music players, remote microphones and other devices. With the addition of speech recognition and internet capability in the mobile phone, the wearer has optimal communication ability in many more situations than with hearing aids alone. This growing list includes voice activated dialing, voice activated software applications either on the phone or on the internet, receipt of audio signals from databases on the phone or on internet, or audio signals from television sets or from global positioning systems. The first practical, wearable, fully digital hearing aid was invented by Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka. Their work resulted in US Patent 4,548,082, [...] "Hearing aids, signal supplying apparatus, systems for compensating hearing deficiencies, and methods" [...] by A Maynard Engebretson, Robert E Morley, Jr. and Gerald R Popelka, filed in 1984.

40|$|The {{standard}} objective parameters aim {{to describe}} the linear effects of concert hall acoustics to an arbitrary excitation signal. However, neither the music signals from acoustic instruments nor the spatial hearing by the listener behave linearly.

Moreover, <b>binaural</b> directional <b>hearing</b> emphasizes high frequencies more when the sound arrives {{from the sides of}} the head rather than from the median plane. These premises lead to a hypothesis that the perceived dynamic range of identical performances varies between different concert halls. It is possible that concert halls that better convey musical dynamic changes would be preferred.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to compare three typical modes of fitting hearing aids with respect to the amount of maximum gain which could be obtained before the onset of acoustic feedback. A group of 15 children and a group of 15 adults were used.

The hearing aid volume controls were increased to a point just prior to the onset of feedback. Once this procedure had been completed for all three hearing aid fittings the high frequency average gain was measured on Bruel and Kjaer equipment. The results indicated that there was no significant difference between the gain values for the two groups, adult versus children. There was, however, a significant difference between the gain values of the three test positions.

Like Wells, these researchers attempted to compare and contrast what would become known as <b>binaural</b> <b>hearing</b> with the principles of binocular integration generally, and binocular color mixing specifically. They found that binocular vision did not follow the laws of combination of colors from different bands of the spectrum. Rather, it was found that when presenting a different color to each eye, they did not combine, but often competed for perceptual attention.|$|E

50|$|Action {{potentials}} {{originate in}} the hair cells of the cochlea and propagate to the brainstem; both the timing of these action potentials and the signal they transmit provide information to the SOC about the orientation of sound in space.

Each eardrum moves in one dimension, and the auditory brain analyzes and compares the movements of both eardrums in order to synthesize auditory objects. This integration of information from both ears is the essence of binaural fusion.

40|$|Occupational {{hearing loss}} {{is one of}} the most {{prevalent}} occupational conditions; yet, there is no acknowledged international metric to allow comparisons of risk between different industries and regions. In order to make recommendations for an international standard of occupational hearing loss, members of an international industry group (the International Aluminium Association) submitted details of different hearing loss metrics currently in use by members. We compared the performance of these metrics using an audiometric data set for over 6000 individuals working in 10 locations of one member company. We calculated rates for each metric at each location from 2002 to 2006. For comparison, we calculated the difference of observed-expected (for age) <b>binaural</b> high-frequency <b>hearing</b> loss (in dB/year) for each location over the same time period. We performed linear regression to determine the correlation between each metric and the observed-expected rate of hearing loss. The different metrics produced discrepant results, with annual rates ranging from 0. 0 % for a less-sensitive metric to more than 10 % for a highly sensitive metric. At least two metrics, a 10 dB age-corrected threshold shift from baseline and a 15 dB nonage-corrected shift metric, correlated well with the difference of observed-expected high-frequency hearing loss. This study suggests that it is feasible to develop an international standard for tracking occupational hearing loss in industrial working populations...|$|R
40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. Patients {{with profound}} <b>binaural</b> sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss {{can be treated}} with cochlear implantation. In recent years, patients who have lost {{the integrity of the}} auditory nerve between the spiral ganglion and the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem, and cannot benefit from a cochlear implant, have reported auditory sensations following direct stimulation of the cochlear nucleus with an auditory brainstem prosthesis. To examine the safety and efficacy of such a prosthesis, the cochlear nuclei of guinea-pigs were acutely implanted and stimulated unilaterally with bipolar surface electrodes using the parameters of human implants. The activation of the central auditory pathway by the prosthesis was demonstrated using the 2 -deoxyglucose technique. There was broad 2 -deoxyglucose labelling in the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus and bilaterally in the inferior colliculi, indicating unusual stimulation of the ipsilateral ascending pathway. Histological examination was performed on all cochlear nuclei. The volumes of cochlear nuclei and the neuron sizes and density in the cochlear nuclei were analysed with three-dimensional reconstruction techniques, and comparisons were made between the stimulated and unstimulated sides. No histological difference, either by direct visual observation or by statistical comparisons, was observed between the stimulated cochlear nuclei and the control sides. These results suggest that in the acute case the auditory brainstem prostheses can safely and effectively activate the auditory pathway in guinea-pigs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of symmetrical, asymmetrical and unilateral hearing impairment on music quality perception. Six validated music pieces in the categories of classical music, folk music and pop music were used to assess music quality in terms of its ‘pleasantness’, ‘naturalness’, ‘fullness’, ‘roughness’ and ‘sharpness’. 58 participants with sensorineural hearing loss [20 with unilateral hearing loss (UHL), 20 with bilateral symmetrical hearing loss (BSHL) and 18 with bilateral asymmetrical hearing loss (BAHL) ] and 29 normal hearing (NH) subjects participated in the present study. Hearing impaired (HI) participants had greater difficulty in overall music quality perception than NH participants. Participants with BSHL rated music pleasantness and naturalness to be higher than participants with BAHL. Moreover, the hearing thresholds of the better ears from BSHL and BAHL participants as well as the hearing thresholds of the worse ears from BSHL participants were negatively correlated to the pleasantness and naturalness perception. HI participants rated the familiar music pieces higher than unfamiliar music pieces in the three music categories. Music quality perception in participants with hearing impairment appeared to be affected by symmetry of hearing loss, degree of hearing loss and music familiarity when they were assessed using the music quality rating test (MQRT).

40|$|Abstract—This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the evolution and pros and cons of bilateral amplification. Determining whether a bilateral hearing aid fitting is superior to that of a monaural hearing aid is a long-standing question; for this reason, the trend toward bilateral amplification has been slow. However, it is now assumed that bilateral amplification has significant advantages over monaural amplification in most cases, a view that is supported by our localization results. In this article, we will address the advantages of bilateral hearing aids and reveal some new localization data that show that most listeners with bilateral amplification, when tested unaided, as well as normal-hearing listeners manifested very high degrees of symmetry in their judgments of perceived angle while listeners who rou-tinely use monaural amplification and those with asymmetric hearing loss had relatively large asymmetries. These data show that asymmetry in localization judgments is a much more sen-sitive indicator of abnormal localization ability than the magni-tude of localization errors.

40|$|The {{benefit of}} a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) to a patient fitted bilaterally; and the {{benefit of a}} BAHA® to a {{unilaterally}} deaf person was estimated by four acoustical measurements: directional sensitivity of a BAHA® placed at the skull, vibration transmission in the skull, gain, and estimated transcranial attenuation of bone conducted sound. Provided a patient has a similar bone conduction hearing ability at both cochlea, it was found that a patient should, theoretically, benefit from bilateral fitting of BAHAs in terms of better hearing thresholds from the front, and better overall hearing ability from the surround. The data indicates further, that bilateral fitting facilitates extraction of interaural cues, which should lead to greater ability to determine the direction of a sound source, as well as better hearing in noise. However, due to the cross-hearing of bone conducted sound, the binaural processing for the patient fitted bilaterally with BAHAs is less than for normal <b>binaural</b> air conduction <b>hearing.</b> Finally, the data showed that the benefit of fitting a BAHA® in a unilaterally deaf person, depends on that person's transcranial attenuation...|$|R
