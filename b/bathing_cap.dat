They were a little surprised not to have noticed her going down into the water, but beyond that her apparition had no shadow of wonder for them. They made the furtive penetrating observations usual in such cases. They could see that she was swimming very gracefully and that she had a lovely face and very beautiful arms, but they could not see her wonderful golden hair because all that was hidden in a fashionable Phrygian <b>bathing</b> <b>cap,</b> picked up--as she afterwards admitted to my second cousin--some nights before upon a Norman plage. Nor could they see her lovely shoulders because of the red costume she wore.|$|E

5|$|Abram Nathaniel Spanel founded Playtex's {{predecessor}} parent company, the International Latex Corporation, in Rochester, New York in 1932 {{to produce}} latex products, like <b>bathing</b> <b>caps,</b> swimwear and baby pants. ILC moved to Dover, Delaware, in 1939, {{making it the}} first large, non-agricultural business in the city.|$|R
5000|$|The {{brain wave}} is called an event-related {{potential}} (ERP) and {{is similar to}} an EEG. Brainwaves are monitored in a non-invasive procedure that involves placing a cap on the subject's head, similar to a <b>bathing</b> <b>cap.</b> This cap will monitor the brain's natural electrical activity and will record the brain's response when the subject is presented with various stimuli. Subjects respond to computer programs on a screen {{in front of them}} that flash various stimuli on the screen.|$|E
5000|$|Then, {{using an}} {{electric}} fan and a balloon tied to his waist, Sylvester attempts to float {{his way across}} through the air, but he floats too high. Tweety, again using the slingshot, shoots Sylvester down from the sky. Sylvester dons a <b>bathing</b> <b>cap</b> as he is descending, but misses the water, landing on the sidewalk, next to Tweety and Granny’s hotel as it turns out. He runs into the hotel and takes the elevator up {{to the floor of}} Granny and Tweety's room, but Granny and Tweety are leaving, so Sylvester goes back down the elevator, which takes him...into the water! ...|$|E
5000|$|Stationary bathing {{boxes were}} {{introduced}} in the early 1900s. They proved more amenable and cheaper to the public. In the 1920s, Mrs Elizabeth Travers and her brother-in-law, Bilshie Travers (uncle of the famous Bilshie Travers, former Mayor of Bundoran) hired the boxes from the local Council. For 3 old pennies a customer hired a bathing costume and for 6 old pennies they could hire [...] "the whole package" [...] which consisted of a <b>bathing</b> <b>cap,</b> costume and towel. The bathing costume was washed in a bucket and hung up to dry until the next customer came along. A familiar sight {{on the beach in}} the 1950s and 1960s was [...] "The Duck". This was a former British Army amphibious craft that ferried tourists out onto the Bay. It was operated by the Rooney family. Despite being prone to breakdown, it was a major attraction at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in Acushnet, Massachusetts by Philip E. [...] "Skipper" [...] Young in 1910, the Acushnet Process Company {{focused on}} deresinating latex and {{supplying}} rubber to industry, {{and over time}} began {{to make their own}} rubber-based products including water bottles and <b>bathing</b> <b>caps.</b> Eventually, Acushnet Process became a manufacturer of golf equipment, principally, golf balls.|$|R

5000|$|The {{other common}} {{element in the}} stunts was {{to get one of}} the contestants messy in some way often {{involving}} whipped cream, pancake batter, and such (usually limited to the husband of the couple). While it was not a part of every stunt, and sometimes it didn't even happen in an episode, it was common enough that when a couple brought a child on, Collyer would often ask what they thought the parents might have to do and the child would often respond [...] "get whipped cream in their face". Many times the wife would be shown a task, be blindfolded, and then her husband would be quietly brought out and unknown to her she would be covering him with some sort of mess. When the mess was not hidden from the wife, Collyer would often jokingly tell the husband (who usually had a short haircut) that they would put a <b>bathing</b> <b>cap</b> on his head [...] "to keep your long hair out of your eyes" [...] before revealing what form of mess he would be involved with. Occasionally Collyer himself would get caught in the mess accidentally.|$|E
5000|$|Reproduction is {{inherent}} to {{some forms of}} art. In Medieval Europe, an artist might create a drawing which was used by another craftsman to create a woodcut block. The drawing was usually destroyed in the block-cutting process, and the block was thrown away when it became worn out. The copies printed from the block are all that remain of the work.In a 1936 essay, Walter Benjamin discussed the new media of photography and film, in which {{the work of art}} can be reproduced many times with no one version being the authentic [...] "original". He linked this shift from authentic objects to broadly accessible mass media with a transformation in the function of art from ritual to politics.Modern art may raise new issues of authenticity of provenance. For example, the artist Duane Hanson instructed the conservators of his 1971 sculpture Sunbather to feel free to replace elements such as the <b>bathing</b> <b>cap</b> or swimsuit if they became faded.As Julian H. Scaff points out, the computer and the internet further confuse the issue of authenticity of provenance, since a digital work of art may exist in thousands or millions of identical versions, and in variants where {{there is no way to}} determine the original version or even the author.|$|E
5000|$|Gleitze {{gathered}} {{a large number}} of companies who were keen to be associated with her achievements. Consumers were asked to toast her with Paddy Whiskey when they were not drinking Lipton's Tea which had reputedly helped her [...] "beat the channel". She appeared at a corset demonstration for Kellett's and at the showing of the, now lost, 1927 silent film Swim Girl, Swim which starred Bebe Daniels and a fellow swimmer Gertrude Ederle. There was unproductive rumours that Gleitze might star in a film. Gleitze also recommended Be-ze-be honey and <b>bathing</b> <b>caps</b> as well as her enduring role as a brand ambassador for Rolex watches.|$|R
50|$|During {{the year}} of 1930, the {{councilor}} training unit began. The girls there lived in white army tents. By 1930, many of the tents were replaced by cabins for the younger campers. This year, they had fewer campers (402) {{but they were still}} open the full 8 weeks. The rankings changed over the years. In 1931 it went from Brownies to Tawny Owl to Brown Owl to Girl Scout, Lieutenant and Captain. In 1933, the camp store held emblems, cards, stamps, flashlight batteries, <b>bathing</b> <b>caps,</b> films, knives, ink, kotex, ties, notebooks, belts, toothpaste, stationary, pins, and many other useful items. In 1935, Anchorage officially became a unit. There were 389 campers that year. In 1937, Miss Sinnett begins to develop a long range plans {{to meet the needs of}} both the younger and older girls at camp. The dining hall began to fail, and new construction began in 1938. Also in 1938, the boating program was instated which continued into 1956. A totem pole was built, and the girls would sing around it. Two other Girl Scout camps formed near Bonnie Brae, one called Dyerbrook and the other was Edith Sinnett; these were day camps for younger girls.|$|R

In the foreground, a woman wearing a <b>bathing</b> suit and <b>cap</b> stands holding a ball to the left. Another woman {{splashes}} in the water as she walks on the right side. It seems that many younger children {{stay away from the}} deeper water while playing on the shore to the left...|$|R
