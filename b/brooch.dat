5|$|Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress, with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry. Their many-folded dresses were {{fastened}} by a <b>brooch</b> at one shoulder. Their headdresses {{also featured}} a veil which was draped backwards.|$|E
5|$|A grave found a short {{distance}} away also contained jewellery, including a gold pendant, silver <b>brooch,</b> and glass beads. It is thought that the occupant may have had a close connection with the woman in the bed burial– perhaps a relative or a lady-in-waiting who was buried with her mistress.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{analysis of}} Viking age female graves {{on the island}} Gotland in Sweden. The question asked is why some of these women carry penannular <b>brooches,</b> when these <b>brooches</b> were generally associated with males during the Viking age. The analysis shows {{that the majority of}} the women on Gotland wearing penannular <b>brooches</b> were found at the gravesite at Havor, Hablingbo. Depending on where the <b>brooches</b> were located in the grave; possible reconstructions of the individuals clothing were made. This shows that the women in Havor with penannular <b>brooches</b> had a different outfit than the general Viking woman of Gotland. When compared to women buried with penannular <b>brooches</b> in Birka, it shows that they do not use the <b>brooches</b> in the same way...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known <b>brooches</b> {{are from}} the Bronze Age. As fashions in <b>brooches</b> changed rather quickly, they are important chronological indicators. Many sorts of European <b>brooches</b> found in archaeology are usually referred to by the Latin term fibula.|$|R
40|$|In the 1970 s a {{study was}} carried out of 445 extant <b>brooches</b> from Richborough, both by the {{traditional}} typological method and by scientific methods which had not so far been applied systematically to material of this type. The early work indicated that there were significant correlations between typology, alloy composition and techniques of decoration. The decision was taken to extend the survey to <b>brooches</b> from other sites {{with the result that}} some 3500 <b>brooches</b> have been analysed and examined. Roman <b>brooches</b> in Britain is a supplement to Report number 68 of the Research Committee of the Society of Antiquaries of London, 'Roman <b>Brooches</b> in Britain: A Technological and Typological Study based on the Richborough Collection'. The raw data for the <b>brooches</b> is available to download as a comma delimited data file alongside analytical data tables in rich text format and a bibliography used to compile the data...|$|R
5|$|Crest badges are {{specifically}} used {{for people to}} wear, and are made out of silver or white metal. When illustrated, crest badges should only be printed in monochrome, and should not coloured. Women are entitled to wear the crest badge as a <b>brooch,</b> generally worn on the left side, and as such the crest badge may be of gold.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Creeper {{goes to a}} pawn {{store to}} buy a <b>brooch</b> for Helen, and kills the {{pawnbroker}} (Charles Wagenheim) following a fight. He later brings the <b>brooch</b> to Helen, who he realizes {{for the first time}} is blind. Hal learns she needs $3,000 for surgery that would restore her eyesight. When Helen tries to touch his face, Hal angrily storms out. He then goes to the Scott residence and demands money from Clifford and Virginia, whom he blames for his disfigurement. Clifford draws a gun and shoots Hal twice in the stomach, but the weakened Hal manages to strangle Clifford to death before escaping with Virginia's jewels. He brings them to Helen, who is concerned about Hal's injuries, but he flees before she can learn he is shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{whereabouts}} {{of some of}} Burges's most important pieces are unknown, but discoveries are sometimes made: a <b>brooch</b> which he designed as a wedding present for his friend John Pollard Seddon was identified on the BBC television series Antiques Roadshow and subsequently sold at auction for £31,000 in August 2011.|$|E
50|$|Little archaeological {{evidence}} of this period survives. The main sites are cemeteries at Chessell Down and Bowcombe Down, both excavated {{in the nineteenth century}} to produce skeletons, iron swords, knives, and jewellery such as <b>brooches</b> and buckles. The biggest <b>brooches</b> are in the British Museum but some swords, parts of shields, small <b>brooches</b> and buckles are retained in the county archaeological centre.|$|R
5000|$|Silver was {{the usual}} material, {{although}} gold heart <b>brooches</b> were made for wealthy people. Silver was commonly chosen for [...] "lucky" [...] charms, and was also an affordable metal for jewellery that was popular with poorer people. Inexpensive glass paste [...] "gems" [...] were sometimes used on silver luckenbooth <b>brooches,</b> as were garnets and semi-precious stones. Some <b>brooches</b> were engraved with initials, dates or mottoes.|$|R
40|$|Bird <b>brooches</b> at Uppåkra have a {{changing}} biography, as grave gifts, pendants, and scrap metal. The association between bird <b>brooches</b> and birds of prey, and a male face to female jewellery opens questions of identy of the wearer {{and the male}} person in question. Following the bird <b>brooches</b> and the connotations of falconry decode both a social identiy and a lifestyle, expressed in the aestetics of the time. Obviously, the bird <b>brooches</b> signal a message within the social elite, between men and women, and in a continantal networking, and contemporary travelling, in eastern and westens direction...|$|R
5|$|An {{excavation}} of Southcote Manor in the 1960s uncovered many Roman, Romano-British and medieval artefacts such as sherds and pottery; {{a sample of}} the latter was discovered to have originated in Oxford in the 2nd century. Similarly, a Pannonian <b>brooch</b> and samian ware have been found in the area, and Roman pottery was found {{in the vicinity of the}} clay pits at Prospect Park Brick Works.|$|E
5|$|Darren and Cindy {{have sex}} after she is {{neglected}} by Tony, who uncovers the pair {{in a romantic}} clinch. Darren and Suzanne have sex and begin an affair. Rhys exposes their affair and Suzanne moves in with Darren. Suzanne later moves to Spain with Neville. Darren moves in with Jack after they reconcile. Darren fails to win back Cindy's affections as she marries Alistair, but {{she gives him a}} <b>brooch</b> before leaving. Darren sells the <b>brooch</b> for ₤50,000 and uses it as a deposit to help his dad buy his house. Darren begins having sex with Nancy and shortly after, Darren begins a relationship with Nancy. Darren proposes and she accepts before Suzanne returns, and announces that she's pregnant with Darren's twins. She gives birth on 21 January 2011 to Jack and Francine. Suzanne and the twins move into Nancy's flat which leads Nancy to end her relationship with Darren. When Cindy returns, she pays Suzanne to leave the village, so she can have Darren to herself. Her plan fails, when Nancy and Darren reconcile.|$|E
5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and place name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and an ornate silver <b>brooch</b> was found on a hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin but with a 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the technological analysis by X-ray fluorescence of the copper alloy Roman <b>brooches</b> from the Musée du Monde souterrain in Han-sur-Lesse (Namur, Belgium) which {{allows us to}} obtain comparable data with that of Britain for the continent.

5000|$|Jewellery {{was worn}} by {{both men and}} women, though of {{different}} types. Married women fastened their overdresses near the shoulder with matching pairs of large <b>brooches.</b> Modern scholars often call them [...] "tortoise brooches" [...] because of their domed shape. The shapes and styles of women's paired <b>brooches</b> varied regionally, but many used openwork. Women often strung metal chains or strings of beads between the <b>brooches,</b> or suspended ornaments {{from the bottom of}} the <b>brooches.</b> Men wore rings on their fingers, arms and necks, and held their cloaks closed with penannular <b>brooches,</b> often with extravagantly long pins. Their weapons were often richly decorated on areas such as sword hilts. The Vikings mostly used silver or bronze jewellery, the latter sometimes gilded, but a small number of large and lavish pieces or sets in solid gold have been found, probably belonging to royalty or major figures.|$|R
50|$|Also we {{know there}} was a visogothic {{settlement}} in Alovera thanks to a couple of <b>brooches</b> which are on display at Museo Arquelógico Nacional, in Madrid. This <b>brooches</b> known as fibulas were made in the VI century by the cloisonné technique.|$|R
5|$|The {{kingdom of}} Dál Riata {{has been seen}} as a cross-roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland, with which the Scots {{settlers}} in what is now Argyll kept close contacts. This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd, which combine Pictish and Irish elements. This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the 7th century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the Hunterston <b>brooch,</b> found in Ayrshire, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration (or pressblech), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed. In the 8th and 9th centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular brooches with lobed terminals from Ireland. Some older Irish pseudo-penannular brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example the Breadalbane <b>Brooch</b> (British Museum). The 8th century Monymusk Reliquary has elements of Pictish and Irish style.|$|E

5|$|Little {{has changed}} in the general sweep of the plot from Boccaccio. Things are just more detailed, with Pandarus, for example, {{involving}} Priam's middle son Deiphobus during his attempts to unite Troilus and Cressida. Another scene that Chaucer adds was to be reworked by Shakespeare. In it, Pandarus seeks to persuade Cressida of Troilus' virtues over those of Hector, before uncle and niece witness Troilus returning from battle to public acclaim with much damage to his helmet. Chaucer also includes details from the earlier narratives. So, reference is made not just to Boccaccio's <b>brooch,</b> but to the glove, the captured horse and the battles of the two lovers in Benoît and Guido.|$|E
50|$|An inquest {{declared}} the items as treasure trove and {{the property of}} the Crown. Mr King was given the value of the <b>brooches,</b> £135,000. He donated £25,000 to Pentney church, and the <b>brooches</b> can now be viewed at the British Museum.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the research {{done on the}} <b>brooches</b> found in the late Roman fort and burial site at Oudenburg (Belgium). The first part aims to explain {{the context of the}} finds and typochronological data of the <b>brooches</b> from the excavation Oudenburg-Spegelaere on the southwest corner of the fort. Furthermore, it attempts to place these finds in a wider network by comparing some similar finds from other sites and their main distribution. The second part focuses specific on the crossbow <b>brooches.</b> After a short introduction about the research history, the article continues with the technological and social interpretation derived from the detailed measurements and observations of the <b>brooches</b> from both the fort and burial site...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} evaluates Germanic fibulae of the Early Roman Period {{found in}} the area of Bohemia. The catalogue mainly consists of ca. 740 already published <b>brooches.</b> For the purpose of this dissertation, many of them have been newly documented as well as some so far unpublished finds which are introduced in the appendix of the dissertation. The dissertation sums up our present knowledge of particular types and variations of fibulae and makes their chronology more accurate - based on various combinations of <b>brooches</b> occurring in graves. Alternatively it deals with their connection to certain sex, age and social status. The most common type of <b>brooches</b> is by far the group of the eye-brooches (ca. 300 pcs). Regarding the dating, the author managed to cast doubt upon information about some of the <b>brooches</b> {{found in the}} literature. The analysis has proven a long survival of some types of fibulae. Key words: <b>brooches</b> - fibulae - Early Roman Period - Germans - Chronolog...|$|R
5|$|Nancy was favorably {{impressed}} with Houston's land sales pitch, {{but not so}} {{impressed with}} his interest in her daughter. She {{and others in the}} family were concerned about his reputation as a hard-drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity, who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married. Several weeks of love letters had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839, presenting her with his image carved on a <b>brooch.</b> In an effort to assuage the family's opposition to the union, Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Presented with a jewelled <b>brooch</b> as a {{farewell}} gift by her fellow officers, Stevenson asked that its value instead be put towards a scholarship for an ex-WAAAF member to study social {{work at the}} University of Sydney. The WAAAF itself, the first and largest of Australia's wartime women's services, was disbanded on 30September 1946. It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation with a separate charter to the RAAF, the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF). WRAAF members achieved a pay scale equal to the male service in 1972, and five years later were integrated with the RAAF.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{use of a}} crown in Britain {{was discovered}} by archaeologists in 1988 in Deal, Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150BCE. A sword, <b>brooch,</b> ceremonial shield, and decorated bronze crown with a single arch, which sat directly {{on the head of}} its wearer, were found inside the tomb of the Mill Hill Warrior. Following the Roman conquest of Britain in 43CE (AD), crowns and other symbols of authority continued to be used by the governors of Britain. A dig in a field at HockwoldcumWilton, Norfolk, in 1957 revealed a large number of circlets and a bronze crown with two arches and depictions of male faces, dating from the period of Roman occupation.|$|E

2500|$|Penannular <b>brooches</b> {{are part}} of {{traditional}} dress {{to the present day}} among Berber women in the Maghreb, usually worn in pairs and apparently pinning straps of a dress to the bodice, with the pins pointing straight up. They are usually large, fairly plain, <b>brooches,</b> not unlike some Viking examples, though another style has a very elaborately decorated head to the pin, which can dwarf the ring. A heavy necklace often hangs between the two <b>brooches,</b> sometimes attached to a ring hanging from the head of the pin. Most of the women are identified as Berber. Local names for the <b>brooches</b> apparently include melia, melehfa, bzima, kitfiyya, and khellala in Arabic, and tabzimt, tizerzay, and tazersit in Berber.

5|$|Vanguard {{was laid}} down on 2 October 1941 by John Brown and Company of Clydebank, Scotland, with the yard number of 567. After the Japanese {{invasion}} of Malaya in December, {{the ship was}} given an A1 priority {{in the hope of}} finishing her by the end of 1944 and construction of the light cruiser HMS Bellerophon, as well as some merchant shipping, was halted to expedite the ship's completion. This was unsuccessful, however, due to a shortage of skilled labour. As a result, it was not until 30 November 1944 that the ship was launched. Princess Elizabeth presided over this ceremony, the first ship she ever launched, and was presented with a diamond rose <b>brooch</b> to commemorate the event.|$|E
5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus spends much of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a <b>brooch</b> – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E

A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large <b>brooch.</b> Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
