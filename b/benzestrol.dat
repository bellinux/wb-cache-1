25|$|Diethylstilbestrol is a nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} that is {{no longer}} used medically. It {{is a member of the}} stilbestrol group. Other stilbestrol estrogens that have been used clinically include <b>benzestrol,</b> dienestrol, dienestrol acetate, diethylstilbestrol dipropionate, fosfestrol, hexestrol, and methestrol dipropionate. Chlorotrianisene, methallenestril, and doisynoestrol are nonsteroidal estrogens structurally distinct from the stilbestrols that have also been used clinically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzestrol</b> {{is a drug}} in the stilbestrol {{family of}} estrogens. These drugs were first {{produced}} in the late 1930s. <b>Benzestrol</b> itself was reported in 1946. In 1953, experiments began on <b>benzestrol</b> and other stilbestrols {{to see if they}} actually helped stop premature births. This study in 1953 found that <b>benzestrol</b> did not in fact help stop premature births. A study in 1971 found that <b>benzestrol</b> was the cause of a rare vaginal cancer in girls and women whose mothers had been on <b>benzestrol</b> while pregnant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzestrol</b> {{is usually}} grouped with the stilbestrol estrogens. However, <b>benzestrol</b> is {{technically}} not a stilbestrol derivative because its central chain is elongated by one carbon. In any case, it {{is a very}} close analogue of the stilbestrol estrogens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzestrol</b> {{and other}} stilbestrol {{were used as}} {{synthetic}} estrogens {{in order to prevent}} premature births. Based on the idea that premature births happened because the mother did not produce enough estrogen on her own, doctors prescribed <b>benzestrol</b> to mothers in order to increase their estrogen levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzestrol</b> is {{described}} as a very powerful estrogen.|$|E
5000|$|Stilbestrols: <b>benzestrol,</b> bifluranol, dienestrol, diethylstilbestrol, dimestrol, fosfestrol, furostilbestrol, hexestrol, mestilbol, methestrol, pentafluranol, phenestrol, terfluranol, stilbestrol esters ...|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{have been}} done in the past on normal, mature and {{castrate}} female rats. <b>Benzestrol</b> produced the same type of estrus in the castrate rat when injected at 0.8 to 1.0 micrograms as when the rat was injected with 2.0 to 2.5 micrograms of estrone. [...] This is significant because less <b>benzestrol</b> could be used to produce the same effect as estrone in increasing estrogen production. It has been used in the past as a nonsteroidal estrogen antagonist.|$|E
5000|$|Estrogens: <b>benzestrol,</b> bifluranol, estrobin (DBE), {{diethylstilbestrol}} (stilbestrol), dienestrol, erteberel, fosfestrol, hexestrol (dihydroxystilbestrol), methallenestril, methestrol, methestrol dipropionate, paroxypropione, prinaberel, and triphenylethylene, {{as well as}} many xenoestrogens ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Benzestrol</b> (INN, BAN) (brand names Chem{{estrogen}}, Ocestrol, Octestrol, Octoestrol, Octofollin) is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol {{group that}} was formerly used medically but has since been discontinued. The stilbestrol estrogens, the most well-known of which is diethylstilbestrol (DES) were used extensively in the mid-1900s and were finally banned by the FDA due to them causing tumors in the children of women who used them.|$|E
