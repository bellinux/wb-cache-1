25|$|German {{loan words}} entered Romansh {{as early as}} the Old High German period in the Early Middle Ages, and German has {{remained}} an important source of vocabulary since. Many of these words have been in use in Romansh for long enough that German speakers no longer recognize them as German, and for morphological derivations of them to have appeared, in particular through the suffix -egiar ~ iar, as in Surs. baghegiar, sut. biagear, Surm. biagier, Put. biager, Vall. bear 'to build', derived from Middle High German bûwen. Other examples include malegiar 'to paint' (← malen), schenghegiar 'to give (a present)' (← schenken), schazegiar 'to estimate' (← schätzen), or Surs. betlegiar (sut. batlagear, Surm./Put. batlager, Vall. supetliar) 'to beg', derived from Swiss German <b>bettle</b> with the same meaning. Nouns derived from these verbs include maletg 'painting', schenghetg 'gift', schazetg 'estimation', or bagetg 'building'. The adjective flissi 'hard-working' has given rise to the noun flissiadad 'industriousness'. The word pur has given rise to derived words such as pura 'farmwife, female farmer' or puranchel 'small-time farmer', as has buob ‘boy’ from Swiss German bueb ‘boy’, with the derivations buoba ‘girl’ and buobanaglia ‘crowd of children’.|$|E

2500|$|... "Dolobran. [...] The country-seat of Clement A. Griscom, Esq., is a {{about half}} a mile {{northeast}} from Haverford Station, Pennsylvania Railroad, and comprises somewhat more than eighty acres, of a rolling, uneven nature, the larger portion of the land sloping generally toward the northward, and eastward to a stream of water which flows through the tract in an easterly direction. The tract is nearly rectangular in shape. The southwestern portion is gently rolling, and has been appropriated for a lawn, through which the carriage road winds to the residence past beds of beautiful variegated plants and flowers, clumps of evergreens, etc. Close by the residence is the upper end of a heavily wooded ravine, extending to the stream of water; a woodland walk has been made in this ravine, which is so closed in by trees and shrubbery that one could easily imagine himself following a path in the forest; here and there along this walk are rustic benches and 'crow-nests' for those who would rest a while. At the bottom of this walk we come out to the stream near a large lake, where there are facilities for boating and bathing. Near the head of the ravine just described, and near the mansion house is a flower garden devoted exclusively to Japanese plants. The northerly portion of the estate is naturally much rougher, and splendidly adapted by nature to the purpose to which Mr. Griscom has devoted about thirty acres of this section, namely, as an 'American Wild Garden.' Besides being originally heavily wooded, innumerable native American trees, plants, and flowers were brought from all sections of the country. Two or three old stone quarries in this tract have been utilized to make forest pools, in which are many varieties of beautiful water lilies and other water-growing flowers and plants; while rhododendrons and ferns abound along the shores of the pools and on the outcropping ledges of the cliffs. Throughout this tract woodland paths wind in every direction, along which the pedestrian can catch a glimpse of shaded pools, wooded glens, and nooks, mossy banks of rivulets, and such pretty bits of nature, and the paths are of a length that traversing all of them without going along the same one twice makes one feel that he had had plenty of exercise for the time. From the porch of the house one might imagine that the residence was the only building on the property, so thoroughly do the near-by tree growths hide the usual buildings of a country place, but it is only a walk of a minute or two through the trees to a finely-appointed stable, in which is kept a number of blooded horses for riding and driving, and not far off is a large greenhouse for the growth of many kinds of flowers, and hotbeds for early vegetable delicacies for the table. On {{the eastern edge of the}} estate is an attractive cottage occupied by Mr. and Mrs. <b>Bettle,</b> Mrs. <b>Bettle</b> being Mrs. Griscom's daughter; and at the foot of the lawn sloping to the eastward from the mansion house is another cottage in which reside Mr. Griscom's son, Rodman E. Griscom, and his wife." ...|$|E
