5|$|The Watten <b>bunker</b> {{was to be}} {{built to}} a design based on the B.III-2a <b>bunker,</b> though {{substantially}} larger. The Germans had originally planned to build a separate LOX plant at Stenay but this option was abandoned in favour of installing a LOX production facility within the Watten <b>bunker.</b>|$|E
5|$|A small {{detachment}} of men performs a reconnaissance mission on Tall's orders {{to determine the}} strength of the Japanese <b>bunker.</b> Private Bell reports there are five machine guns in the <b>bunker.</b> He joins another small team of men (including Witt), led by Captain John Gaff, on a flanking mission to take the <b>bunker.</b> The operation is a success and C Company overruns one of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. The Japanese they find are largely malnourished and dying, and put up little resistance.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} this study can be used by port authorities, but are also {{important}} to <b>bunkering</b> operators. The obtained knowledge enables the port and <b>bunkering</b> operators to improve their competitive position in ship <b>bunkering.</b> This can be done by designing appropriate instruments or business strategies to target the most important attributes in <b>bunkering</b> choice and improve the competitive position in the ship <b>bunkering</b> market.|$|R

5|$|The {{concrete}} <b>bunkers</b> of Albania are a ubiquitous {{sight in}} the country, {{with an average of}} 5.7 <b>bunkers</b> for every square kilometre. The <b>bunkers</b> (Albanian: bunkerët) were built during the communist government of Enver Hoxha from the 1960s to the 1980s; by 1983 a total of 173,371 concrete <b>bunkers</b> had been constructed around the country.|$|R
5|$|On his mother's side, Caleb Vance Haynes had Thai and Chinese {{ancestors}} {{through his}} grandfather Chang <b>Bunker,</b> {{one of the}} original Siamese Twins. The conjoined twins married sisters, with Chang <b>Bunker</b> marrying Adelaide Yates. The couple produced seven daughters and three sons, and lived west of Mount Airy, North Carolina. Three of their Anglo-Chinese offspring, including Lizzie <b>Bunker,</b> Haynes's mother, married into the local Haynes clan.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} both Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 {{as part of}} an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. The <b>bunker</b> largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried to blow up the <b>bunker,</b> but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the <b>bunker.</b> Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old <b>bunker</b> complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.|$|E
5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets. Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988–89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old <b>bunker</b> complex that were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the <b>bunker</b> still exist, but are sealed off from the public.|$|E
25|$|Hoxha's legacy also {{included}} a complex of 750,000 one-man concrete <b>bunkers</b> across a country of 3 million inhabitants, to act as look-outs and gun emplacements along with chemical weapons. The <b>bunkers</b> were built strong and mobile, with the intention {{that they could be}} easily placed by a crane or a helicopter in a previously dug hole. The types of <b>bunkers</b> vary from machine gun pillboxes, beach <b>bunkers,</b> to underground naval facilities, and even Air Force Mountain and underground <b>bunkers.</b>|$|R

5|$|An acute {{shortage}} of housing {{after the fall}} of the Communist regime in 1990 led some Albanians to set up home in abandoned bunkers, though the lack of running water and sanitation meant that the area around inhabited bunkers soon became contaminated and unhealthy. A few bunkers have found more creative uses. In the coastal city of Durrës one beachside <b>bunker</b> has been turned into the Restaurant Bunkeri, and another <b>bunker</b> in Gjirokastër was turned into a café.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} chorus begins, earlier {{scenes from the}} video are intercut with each other; Rihanna is shown {{commanding}} her troops, firing a machine gun, and dancing in the <b>bunker.</b> As the second verse begins, Rihanna is seen with slicked-back hair wearing a metal bikini top, rolling in mud and surrounded by troops on a stone structure before a mountainous backdrop. She is shown gambling with (and winning against) soldiers in another <b>bunker.</b>|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon, D Company {{had finally}} moved into {{position}} and commenced an assault, {{pushing through the}} <b>bunker</b> system from the north-east with the Centurion tanks in close support crushing many bunkers and their occupants with their tracks. The progress of the Australian assault was slowed by thick vegetation {{and the size of}} the position, even as the resistance slackened and volume of fire diminished. Indeed, the <b>bunker</b> system was later found to cover nearly a square kilometre and was wider than the front of the assaulting company. Painstakingly the Australians searched each <b>bunker</b> systematically. With the action now over, D Company and the tanks subsequently linked up with B Company and established a night defensive position.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bunker's</b> door must be {{at least}} as strong as the walls. In <b>bunkers</b> {{inhabited}} for prolonged periods, large amounts of ventilation or air conditioning must be provided. <b>Bunkers</b> can be destroyed with powerful explosives and bunker-busting warheads.|$|R

5|$|Following the station's closure, the replica No. 33 Squadron Supermarine Spitfire gate {{guardian}} {{was removed}} from the main entrance for restoration work and moved to the entrance of the Operations Room (now known as the Battle of Britain <b>Bunker).</b> The area around the <b>bunker</b> was retained as an enclave under the RAF Uxbridge name, under the care of RAF Northolt. An additional guardian, a Hawker Hurricane in the colours of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron, was added to the area in November 2010.|$|E
30|$|The {{research}} allows understanding by whom {{and how the}} <b>bunkering</b> {{decisions are}} made. It also allows determining the most important attributes of the <b>bunkering</b> choice. It {{turns out that the}} price of fuel and the trust that the correct quality and quantity of fuel is <b>bunkered</b> are the most important determinants of the <b>bunkering</b> choice. The other determinants which are related to the other costs during a port call and the market fit with the location of the port were of less importance. This confirms the results of other studies on <b>bunkering</b> choice determinants.|$|R

5|$|No further {{military}} use {{was made}} of the <b>bunker</b> and the land on which it stands reverted to private ownership. It was left abandoned for many years before the owners decided to redevelop the site. In 1973, the <b>bunker</b> was opened to the public for the first time under the name of Le Blockhaus d'Éperlecques. The ownership was taken over by Hubert de Mégille in the mid-1980s and on 3 September 1986 the French state declared it a monument historique. The area around the <b>bunker</b> has been re-forested, though it is still heavily scarred by bomb craters, and various items of Second World War military equipment (including a V-1 on a launch ramp) are on display alongside paths around the site. An open-air trail leads to and around the <b>bunker</b> with interpretative signs posted at various points {{to tell the story of}} the site and the German V-weapons programme. In 2009, the museum welcomed 45,000 visitors.|$|E
5000|$|During construction, it {{was already}} clear that the <b>bunkers</b> could not {{withstand}} the newly developed armour-piercing weapons.

These <b>bunkers</b> were mostly dugouts for single soldiers.|$|R

30|$|It can, {{from the}} {{in-depth}} interviews, {{be concluded that}} <b>bunkering</b> operations have no influence on port choice and that <b>bunkering</b> is optimized on a chosen route/loop and operation (speed and loading condition) of the ship.
