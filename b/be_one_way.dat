25|$|Researchers have {{analysed}} the behaviour of chimpanzees, {{with particular}} reference to copulation calling. Copulation calling {{is a type}} of vocalisation used to attract mates. The calls are vocalised either before, during, or after sexual intercourse. Copulation calling, in line with Hrdy's hypothesis, may then <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to ensure that the female can mate with as many different males as possible, causing paternity confusion. Indeed, the authors found that the probability of copulatory calling in female chimpanzees was not modulated by the ovarian phase of the female caller, thereby aiding paternity confusion. This paternity confusion ultimately ensures that the woman has access to the resources of a number of different males. These resources can be utilised by her, as well as by her offspring.|$|E
25|$|Contributions by the {{government}} of Puerto Rico may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to help fill the funding gap, but remain controversial and uncertain. At town hall meetings about the potential closure, Puerto Rican Senate President Kenneth McClintock announced an initial local appropriation of $3.0 million during fiscal year 2008 to fund a major maintenance project to restore the three pillars that support the antenna platform to their original condition, pending inclusion in the next bond issue. The bond authorization, with a $3.0 million appropriation, was approved by the Senate of Puerto Rico on November 14, 2007, {{on the first day of}} a special session called by Aníbal Acevedo Vilá. The Puerto Rico House of Representatives repeated this action on June 30, 2008. Puerto Rico's governor signed the measure into law in August 2008. These funds were made available during the second half of 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} these statistics learning abilities {{comes from a}} study by Jenny Saffran, Richard Aslin, and Elissa Newport, in which 8-month-old infants were presented with nonsense streams of monotone speech. Each stream was composed of four three-syllable “pseudowords” that were repeated randomly. After exposure to the speech streams for two minutes, infants reacted differently to hearing “pseudowords” as opposed to “nonwords” from the speech stream, where nonwords were composed of the same syllables that the infants had been exposed to, but in a different order. This suggests that infants are able to learn statistical relationships between syllables even with very limited exposure to a language. That is, infants learn which syllables are always paired together and which ones only occur together relatively rarely, suggesting that they are parts of two different units. This method of learning is thought to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> that children learn which groups of syllables form individual words.|$|E

500|$|... "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Antonina Armato and Tim James, {{who also}} {{produced}} the track. According to Cyrus, the track's moral is to free yourself from any biding or hindrance, in particular application to women. Cyrus said the song's message applies to different situations. Personally to her, [...] "it is {{about being a}} cage and people looking at you." [...] As for others, she believed it could describe high school, {{in a situation where}} [...] "someone feeling they have to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to be with a clique {{and they want to be}} who they are. A relationship, or whatever, it is just breaking out and feeling free."

2500|$|Stress may be {{increased}} {{when a person is}} living in a family situation, with increased pressures.

Violence is not always caused by stress, but may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> that some people respond to stress. Families and couples in poverty {{may be more likely to}} experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects. Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to his idea of [...] "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect.

60|$|A boy {{does not}} {{put his hand}} into his pocket until every other means of gaining his end has failed, but to that {{extremity}} had Tommy now come. For months his only splendid possession had been a penny despised by trade because of a large round hole in it, as if (to quote Shovel) some previous owner had cut a farthing out of it. To tell the escapades of this penny (there are no adventurers like coin of the realm) would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> of exhibiting Tommy to the curious, {{but it would be}} a hard-hearted way. At present the penny was doubly dear to him, having been long lost and lately found. In a noble moment he had dropped it into a charity box hanging forlorn against the wall of a shop, where it lay very lonely by itself, so that when Tommy was that way he could hear it respond if he shook the box, as acquaintances give each other the time of day in passing. Thus at comparatively small outlay did he spread his benevolence over weeks and feel a glow therefrom, until the glow went, when he and Shovel recaptured the penny with a thread and a bent pin.|$|E

My present impression is that it is essentially a case for a compromise, but you know the final decision does not rest on me.
