40|$|SUMMARY: <b>Bacterium</b> <b>coli</b> {{was killed}} rapidly when shaken with glass beads. The {{bacteria}} were killed {{before they were}} disintegrated. The effect on this process of size of bead, speed of shaking, density of suspension, and size of container were in-vestigated and optimal conditions for bacterial destruction were ascertained. Ciirran & Evans (1942) destroyed various bacterial spores and <b>Bacterium</b> <b>coli</b> cells by shaking in suspension with small inert particles. They studied the effect {{of different kinds of}} particles, the proportion of these to spores and density of the spore suspension. They noted in one experiment that efficiency increased with speed of shaking. King & Alexander (1948) amplified these observations, using glass beads, and a wider range of sporing and non-sporing bacteria. They confirmed that the optimal effect was obtained when the weight of beads in grams was the same as the volume of suspension in millilitres and that the rate of bacterial destruction increased with greater speed of shaking. They were, however, unable to sterilize a suspension of Bact. coli, as reported by Curran & Evans...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: By a cup-plate method, the {{antibiotic}} activity of fluid cultures of 253 strains of spore-bearing anaerobic bacilli representing over sixteen Clostridium spp. was tested against one strain each of Mycobacterium phlei, Staphylococcus aureus, and <b>Bacterium</b> <b>coli.</b> Two strains of Clostridium sporogenes {{and two of}} Cl. bifermentans showed a weak and variable activity against Mycobacterium phlei. The remainder of the tests were all negative. In view of the cqrrent trends in antibiotic research {{it was thought that}} a survey of {{the antibiotic}} activity of spore-bearing anaerobic bacteria might yield something of interest. A large collection of Clostridium spp. isolated from war wounds was available for this purpose. A preliminary test of a few clostridial species in agar cup-plates, against Mycobacterium phlei, M. smeg-matis, and <b>Bacterium</b> <b>coli,</b> revealed the presence of inhibitors of M. phbi in cultures of CZ. sporogenes and Cl. bqermentans.

40|$|SUMMARY: A bacteriolytic {{protease}} {{produced by}} a species of Streptomyces is activated by manganese and other metals.

40|$|SUMMARY: From the {{existing}} methods for identifying common antibiotics {{it is possible}} to select tests for recognizing one or more of fourteen known antibiotics in crude culture medium.

For final confirmation, isolation of the antibiotic may be necessary. Several hundreds of moulds have been reported (Wilkins & Harris, 1942, 1943...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: A {{number of}} {{different}} organisms were subjected to violent shaking with minute round glass particles. Vegetative bacteria, spores, and acid-fast species were killed by this treatment, though a t varying rates. Curran & Evans (1942) described the destruction of bacterial spores by violent agitation yvith small inert particles. Several workers (e. g. Gale, 1947) have applied this technique to the extraction of enzymes from vegetative cells. Unlike other mechanical methods (e. g. sonic disintegration {{or the use of}} bacterial mills) i t requires no elaborate equipment, and the risk of damage to proteins or other labile cell constituents is less than with methods involving autolysis or the use of chemical agents. Cuiran & Evans (1942) obtained large decreases in the viable count of spore suspensions by this method and claimed (though without giving experimental data) that suspensions of <b>Bacterium</b> <b>coli</b> may be completely sterilized. We have investigated a wider range of both sporing and non-sporing bacteria. In confirmation of Curran & Evans’s findings we obtained a rapid exponential fall in the number of viable organisms: bu...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Differential {{inhibition}} of Gram-negative bacilli of intestinal origin appears to depend upon a combined action of bile salts and electrolytes. This occurs only under certain conditions, among which aerobic incubation is {{one and the}} nature of the surface upon which the cultures are grown is another. During the recent war desoxycholate could not be obtained in Great Britain and a modified Leifson’s agar medium (1935) was prepared, substituting ‘ taurocholate ’ for desoxycholate, rosolic acid for neutral red and a peptic digest of sheep serum for the pork infusion peptone nutrient base. This medium gave adequate {{inhibition of}} <b>Bacterium</b> <b>coli</b> (Escherichia coli), while allowing good growth of smooth variants of intestinal pathogens. Rough variants of these micro-organisms were markedly inhibited. Materials and methods In all experiments the reaction of the media was standardized at pH 7 - 6.

40|$|SUMMARY: Experiments by the Thunberg tube {{technique}} {{have shown}} that tetra-thionate can oxidize reduced Nile blue {{in the presence of}} tetrathionate-adapted cells of a Gram-negative coliform organism but not in the presence of cells lacking a developed tetrathionase system, viz. unadapted cells of the same organism and cells of Shigella sonnei. Concentrations of tetrathionate of the order of ~/ 3200 and slight tetrathionase activity can be detected by the Thunberg tube technique, which may be useful also in investigating the effect of certain physical and chemical agents on the tetrathionase system. It appears that tetrathionate can act as a hydrogen acceptor for organisms capable of reducing it. Knox, Gel 1 & Pollock (1943) showed that certain organisms can reduce tetra-thionate {{in the presence of a}} hydrogen donator, and it has been suggested that tetrathionate. acts as a hydrogen acceptor alternative to oxygen for those organisms that are able to reduce i t (Knox et al. 1943; Pollock & Knox, 1943; Knox, 1945).

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{biochemical}} {{characteristics of}} approximately eighty strains of Friedlider’s bacillus are described. Certain {{aspects of their}} antigenic patterns were studied by testing the precipitating antigens of phase variants of originally mucoid strains, {{as well as the}} parent strains themselves. Evidence is presented that an as yet undescribed antigenic layer exists between those characteristic of the mucoid and smooth phases. This layer is most pronounced in the Sm phase organisms. The Sm antigen was shown to be present in nearly all Fkiedliinder’s strains and absent in the <b>Bacterium</b> <b>coli</b> strains studied; hence an Sm antiserum should be valuable for diagnostic purposes. The biochemical and serological results are discussed in regard to the taxonomy of this group with particular reference to the consolidation, already proposed by other workers, of the genera Kkbbsiella and Aerobacter. In the studies to be described the precipitin patterns of phase variants of originally mucoid organisms were used to demonstrate another antigenic layer in addition to those described by Kauffmann (1949 ~) and to show the possi...|$|E
