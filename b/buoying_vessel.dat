50|$|Aberdeen {{was ordered}} in 1893 from Fleming & Ferguson and {{constructed}} at their yard in Paisley, Scotland. The ship was launched on 19 June 1894 and completed in August of that year. The ship {{was named for}} the Earl of Aberdeen, the Governor General of Canada at the time. Entering service in 1894, Aberdeen was initially deployed as a lighthouse supply and <b>buoy</b> <b>vessel</b> along the Atlantic coast of Canada. The vessel was later transferred to Quebec {{before returning to the}} Atlantic coast in 1904 when the vessel was assigned to Saint John, New Brunswick.|$|R
5000|$|Scientific American {{was founded}} by {{inventor}} and publisher Rufus M. Porter in 1845 as a four-page weekly newspaper. Throughout its early years, much {{emphasis was placed on}} reports {{of what was going on}} at the U.S. Patent Office. It also reported on a broad range of inventions including perpetual motion machines, an 1860 device for <b>buoying</b> <b>vessels</b> by Abraham Lincoln, and the universal joint which now can be found in nearly every automobile manufactured. Current issues include a [...] "this date in history" [...] section, featuring excerpts from articles originally published 50, 100, and 150 years earlier. Topics include humorous incidents, wrong-headed theories, and noteworthy advances in the history of science and technology.|$|R

25|$|Loos {{sailed to}} the east coast where for the 1918 {{shipping}} season, all the Battle-class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. The trawler performed these duties {{until the end of}} the war, and remained in service until 1920, when she was paid off by the RCN. The Department of Marine and Fisheries took over the vessel and converted Loos to a lighthouse supply and <b>buoy</b> <b>vessel</b> in 1922. In the late 1930s, the vessel was sold out of government service to Marine Industries. However, the RCN reacquired the vessel on 12 December 1940. The former trawler was converted to a gate vessel and re-designated Gate Vessel 14 and deployed at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. Following the war, the ship was returned to Marine Industries and broken up in 1949.|$|R
50|$|CGS Stanley {{has been}} {{described}} as Canadas first effective icebreaker. She was launched in 1888, and remained in service until 1935. Constructed in the United Kingdom, Stanley was deployed along the East Coast of Canada for use as a ferry and lighthouse and <b>buoy</b> supply <b>vessel</b> and was used for icebreaking during winter months.|$|R
5000|$|CCGS George R. Pearkes is a [...] light {{icebreaker}} and <b>buoy</b> support <b>vessel</b> in the Canadian Coast Guard. Named for the Victoria Cross winner George Pearkes, {{the ship}} entered service in 1986. Initially assigned to Pacific region, the vessel {{transferred to the}} Quebec region. George R. Pearkes was assigned to her current deployment, the Newfoundland and Labrador region in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|Abraham Lincoln is {{the only}} U.S. {{president}} to have been awarded a patent for an invention. As a young man, Lincoln took a boatload of merchandise down the Mississippi River from New Salem to New Orleans. At one point the boat slid onto a dam and was set free only after heroic efforts. In later years, while traveling on the Great Lakes, Lincoln's ship ran afoul of a sandbar. The resulting invention consists {{of a set of}} bellows attached to the hull of a ship just below the water line. On reaching a shallow place, the bellows are filled with air and the <b>vessel,</b> thus <b>buoyed,</b> is expected to float clear. The invention was never marketed, probably because the extra weight would have increased the probability of running onto sandbars more frequently. Lincoln whittled the model for his patent application with his own hands. It is on display at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History. Patent #6469 for [...] "A Device for <b>Buoying</b> <b>Vessels</b> Over Shoals" [...] was issued May 22, 1849.|$|R
5000|$|Like Stanley, Minto {{was used}} as a {{lighthouse}} and <b>buoy</b> supply <b>vessel</b> from spring to fall and in winter, was used for icebreaking and passenger ferry service to and from Prince Edward Island. In 1905, the ice became too thick for either ship to traverse and the ferry service was suspended, with travel to island done by iceboat. In 1911, 1912 and 1915, Minto was sent to Hudson Bay for survey work.|$|R
5|$|Two {{research}} vessels have sailed in the US {{bearing the}} name R/V Rachel Carson. One {{is on the}} west coast, owned by MBARI, {{and the other is}} on the east coast, operated by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. Another vessel of the name, now scrapped, was a former naval vessel obtained and converted by the US EPA. it operated on the Great Lakes. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary also operates a mooring <b>buoy</b> maintenance <b>vessel</b> named the Rachel Carson.|$|R
40|$|A set of {{guidelines}} for evaluation of air-sea heat, freshwater and momentum flux datasets is developed {{in response to a}} recommendation of the CLIVAR Global Synthesis and Observation Panel (GSOP). The panel recognised the need for such guidelines in order to facilitate consistent evaluation and intercomparison of the many new flux datasets currently being developed (particularly those from ocean reanalyses). Our approach is to develop guidelines based on the use of both research quality data from flux <b>buoys</b> and research <b>vessels</b> (local evaluation) and large scale constraints (regional, global evaluation). The different evaluation techniques are discussed with reference to recent examples from the research literature. The document is not intended to be an exhaustive review of all methods for flux evaluation but rather to outline the main techniques that should be employed {{in order to meet the}} CLIVAR GSOP recommendation. CLIVAR GSOP Recommendation 28 (ICPO, 2005) : Ocean Reanalysis fluxes: All future ocean reanalysis fluxes should be evaluated against research quality data (flux <b>buoys,</b> research <b>vessels),</b> in addition to large scale constraints (e. g. heat transport), to determine whether reanalysis has led to improvements (individual reanalysis groups) ...|$|R
50|$|Larger debris found {{consisted}} of mainly plastic bottles, but also included shoe soles, plastic buckets, patio chairs, Styrofoam pieces, old toys and fishing <b>vessel</b> <b>buoys,</b> {{and a large}} collection of floating debris entangled in fishing net. Various types of marine life were found on, around and within the larger types of debris. Some of the garbage collected was put {{on display at the}} Bay Model Visitor Center in Sausalito, California.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of 31 January to 1 February 1953, the Clan Line vessel SS Clan Macquarrie (7131 tons) was driven onto the {{foreshore}} at Borve by gales. Braving the horrendous weather, with winds gusting up to 100 mph, local men got a breeches <b>buoy</b> onto the <b>vessel</b> and rescued all 66 crew members. In recognition of the villagers' courage and hospitality, the Clan Line donated funds {{for the construction of}} a village hall.|$|R
50|$|Nancy Foster {{supports}} {{applied research}} for the NOAA National Ocean Services Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management and the National Marine Sanctuary Program, and the NOAA Oceanic and Atmospheric Researchs Office of Ocean Exploration, Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, the National Undersea Research Program, and the National Sea Grant College Program. Operations include the characterization of various habitats in NOAAs National Marine Sanctuaries, pollution assessments, and studies to improve understanding {{of the connection between}} marine habitats and estuaries. The ship supports scientific data collection through bottom fish trawling, sediment sampling, side-scan sonar and multi-beam surveying, sub-bottom profiling, core sampling, scientific diving with air and Nitrox, ROV operations, and servicing oceanographic/atmospheric surface and subsurface <b>buoys.</b> The <b>vessel</b> employs state of the art navigation and propulsion systems resulting in high quality and efficient data collection.|$|R
50|$|The English Channel {{is one of}} {{the busiest}} seaways in the world and, despite {{standard}} radio warnings, three guard ships, and a lighted <b>buoy,</b> the Dutch <b>vessel</b> Nicola struck the wreck the next night, and had to be towed free. After this, two additional patrol ships and six more buoys were installed, including one with a Racon warning transponder. However, on 1 January 2003 the loaded Turkish-registered fuel carrier Vicky struck the same wreck; she was later freed by the rising tide.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1947 {{the ship}} was sold to United Whalers, London, for whaling purposes. Rebuilt as <b>buoy</b> boat (towing <b>vessel)</b> by Harland & Wolff, Belfast, she was {{delivered}} in November as Terje 11 to serve the whaling factory Balaena. The company used a second corvette as Terje 10 (the former [...] ) In summer 1951 she was converted in a whale catcher with an ice strengthened bow and worked with Balaena until the company gave up whaling {{at the end of}} the 1959/1960 season.|$|R
50|$|The Marine Department {{operates}} and maintains 58 mooring <b>buoys</b> for seagoing <b>vessels.</b> Of these 31 {{are suitable for}} ships up to 183 metres in length and 27 for ships up to 137 metres. There are 44 special typhoon mooring buoys to which ships can remain secured during typhoons. This improves efficiency and reduces operational costs of vessels through elimination of unnecessary movements. In addition to the three Immigration and Quarantine Anchorages designated for visiting vessels to complete port formalities, there are eight dangerous goods and eight general-purpose anchorages providing temporary berthing spaces for vessels.|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of July 20, 1998, Ecstasy departed the Port of Miami, Florida, en route to Key West, Florida, with 2,565 passengers and 916 crew members aboard. A fire started in the main laundry room and spread through the ventilation system to the aft mooring deck, where mooring lines ignited. As Ecstasy was attempting to reach an anchorage north of the Miami sea <b>buoy,</b> the <b>vessel</b> lost power and began to drift. The master then radioed the U.S. Coast Guard for assistance. Six tugboats responded to help fight the fire and tow Ecstasy. The fire was brought under control by onboard firefighters and was extinguished about 9:09 PM. Fourteen crew members and eight passengers suffered minor injuries. One passenger required medical treatment {{as a result of}} a pre-existing condition and was categorized as a serious injury victim because of the length of her hospital stay. Losses from the fire and associated damages exceeded $17 million.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} robust {{solution}} to detect and track small and distant boats from thermal images captured by a camera mounted on an autonomous platform (<b>buoy</b> or patrol <b>vessel).</b> It {{is characterized by a}} multiple-layer and multiplealgorithm architecture, which uses a combination of algorithms relying on complementary image cues to generate detections that are robust with respect to variations of boat appearance, image quality, and environmental conditions. The core component of the image exploitation is a detection layer which provides the results of several detection algorithms in a motion-stabilized scene coordinate frame aligned with the estimated horizon line. In the autonomous system, detections are used to trigger alarms and to facilitate multi-target tracking...|$|R
60|$|What I {{claim as}} my invention, {{and desire to}} secure by letters patent, is the {{combination}} of expansible buoyant chambers placed {{at the sides of}} a vessel with the main shaft or shafts by means of the sliding spars, which pass down through the buoyant chambers and are made fast to their bottoms and the series of ropes and pulleys or their equivalents in such a manner that by turning the main shaft or shafts in one direction the buoyant chambers will be forced downward into the water, {{and at the same time}} expanded and filled with air for <b>buoying</b> up the <b>vessel</b> by the displacement of water, and by turning the shafts in an opposite direction the buoyant chambers will be contracted into a small space and secured against injury.|$|R
40|$|New {{trends in}} {{experimental}} marine research require long term {{monitoring of the}} seas and oceans with higher data resolutions than those which {{can be obtained from}} oceanographic <b>vessels,</b> <b>buoys</b> or autonomous se nsors. Subsea observation platforms are the response to these needs. These infras tructures are complex systems, precisely designed to ensure they are flexible, robust and stable and also capable of managing a wide range of sensors and instruments in r eal time with minimum maintenance. Some of the most commonly used instruments fo r ocean research are based on optical and image sensors, and in this chapter we provi de a review of the key components of a subsea observatory and the main challenges facing optical and image sensors used in multidisciplinary and multiparameter underwater observatories.

60|$|When {{the skipper}} had secured a strong rope round {{the bag and}} hooked it on to a block and tackle made fast to the rigging, the order was given to heave away, and {{gradually}} the ponderous mass rose like an oval balloon, or <b>buoy,</b> over the <b>vessel's</b> side. When it cleared the rail it was swung inwards and secured in a hanging position, with the lower end sweeping the deck as the smack rolled from side to side. In all these operations, from the prolonged heaving at the capstan to the hauling in of the net, hand over hand, the men were exerting their great physical powers to the uttermost--almost without a moment's relaxation--besides being deluged at times by spray, which, however, their oiled frocks, long boots, and sou'-westers prevented from quite drenching them. But now all danger of loss was over, and they proceeded to liberate the fish.|$|R
40|$|AIS, Automatic Identification System, is an {{application}} of cyber-physical systems (CPS) to smart transportation at sea. Being primarily used for collision avoidance and traffic monitoring by ship captains and maritime authorities, AIS is a mandatory installation for over 300, 000 vessels world-wide since 2002. Other promoted benefits are accident in-vestigation, aids to navigation and search and rescue (SAR) operations. In this paper, we present a unique security eval-uation of AIS, by introducing threats affecting both the im-plementation in online providers and the protocol specifi-cation. Using a novel software-based AIS transmitter that we designed, we show that our findings affect all transpon-ders deployed globally on vessels and other maritime sta-tions like lighthouses, <b>buoys,</b> AIS gateways, <b>vessel</b> traffic services and aircraft involved in SAR operations. Our con-cerns have been acknowledged by online providers and inter-national standards organizations, and we are currently and actively working together to improve the overall security. 1...|$|R
50|$|Galați is {{the largest}} naval {{shipyard}} on the Danube, its output ranging from large tankers to small coast guard patrol boats. The company also represents a significant element of the local economy. Since 1990, all of its products have gone to export. Following Damen's takeover, an investment plan focusing on improving efficiency and working conditions was introduced. For example, {{at the time of}} the takeover, spoons and coffee cups were listed in the inventory; afterwards, all items worth under $100 were considered disposable goods and no longer placed on the record books. The yard builds offshore vessels, naval vessels, special <b>vessels</b> (such as <b>buoy</b> laying <b>vessels,</b> patrol vessels and research vessels), tugs, workboats and mega yachts, and has also produced oil tankers, container carriers, cargo barges and drilling rig platforms - over 250 vessels since 1999. There were some 1550 employees at the end of 2010, as well as 1150 subcontracted employees handling support functions including electricity, HVAC, carpentry, blasting and painting. This was down from 10,000 total employees in 2006, of whom 3100 worked for Damen. Engineering services are mainly supplied by a Galați firm established in 2004 in which Damen is the major shareholder. Production takes place on four lines: for vessels up to 10,000 dwt, for vessels up to 26,000 dwt, for vessels up to 50,000 dwt and for tugs and workboats. There is also a workshop for piping and galvanizing and a blasting and painting hall.|$|R
40|$|Flexible riser {{configurations}} in {{harsh environments}} require riser buoyancy {{in order to}} decouple vessel induced motions from the seabed interface. This is achieved through either wave (distributed buoyancy) or S (subsea buoy) solutions. In the UK sector of the North Sea circa 30 % of all floating production system field developments utilise subsea buoys in Lazy-S configurations. The majority of these fields have been in service {{for many years and}} designed prior to the widespread adoption of current industry standards, the analytical rigour available today, and better characterisation of the metocean environment. In many cases original system design has also been for 50 yr return period conditions, compared to the specified 100 yr return period events required in todays codes and standards, e. g. ISO 13628 - 2 [1]. Therefore, when replacement riser or life extension work is performed on existing structures or new developments are being designed there can be significant challenges in confirming the applicability of traditional system configuration designs. The principal challenges with these configurations is minimising sag bend compressions driven by differential <b>buoy</b> vs. <b>vessel</b> motions and maintaining the riser or umbilical minimum curvature and compression criteria at the seabed touch down. The latter point is a particular problem for umbilicals routed via Lazy-S configurations owing to their relatively low weight and stiffness, and constraining MBR criteria. This paper considers the applicability of Lazy-S configurations as a solution to modern harsh environment field developments and the evolution in Lazy-S system design to address the design challenges with particular emphasis on the TDP response...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Arctic Ocean is {{a region}} where the impact of global change is {{detected}} {{on an annual basis}} by a wide varietyof observations: <b>buoys,</b> research <b>vessels</b> and aircrafts. But the large area involved and the need of frequentsampling make polar orbiting satellites a prime source of observations for documenting the corresponding fastchanges, especially in summer. Sun reflected measurements in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of thespectrum are not very sensitive because of the elevated solar zenith angle. In these conditions, thermal infrared(TIR) measurements using spectra collected by high spectral resolution nadir sounders are a good complement todocument the high latitudes regions. In the present work the spectra acquired by the TANSO-FTS instrument onGOSAT and by the IASI instrument on the MetOp platforms have been used to test the retrieval capabilities ofthese Fourier transform spectrometers to retrieve the carbon dioxide column averaged mixing ratio XCO 2 aswell as the sea surface temperature (SST) used as an inversion diagnostic. Results for 3 observing periods insummer (July, August, September) and 6 years (2010 to 2015) have been obtained in the latitude range 68 N to 82 N over open water (no pack ice). The retrieved products have been analyzed from a climatologic point of viewto assess inter-annual variability and trends of TIR derived XCO 2 and SST zonal averages (3 summer monthsand 7 bins of 2 ° in latitude). Results will be described and compared with other sources of information. This typeof study is important for preparing future satellite missions like IASI-NG (a follow-on of IASI) and GOSAT- 2 (afollow-on of GOSAT). Some specific regional Arctic Ocean basins will be compared to the zonal climatologies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFish Aggregating Devices (FADs) are {{increasingly}} used by tuna purse-seine fleets {{all around the}} world, modifying the species catch composition. We analyse the determinants of FAD vs free school (FS) fishing, including the skipper effect, and environmental and economic factors. A multivariate and econometric analysis of a panel dataset for the French purse-seine fleet in the Indian Ocean (1980 - 2007), complemented by a survey of fishers, demonstrates the influential role of climate and prey on FAD fishing and also emphasises individual skipper preference. However, {{we found that the}} major determinant of FAD fishing remains the growing fishing capacity (use of bigger <b>vessels,</b> satellite <b>buoys,</b> echo-sounders, supply <b>vessels),</b> thus modifying the species catch composition towards smaller tuna. Other things being equal, raising the proportion of FAD sets by 1 % would increase the catches of skipjack by 1. 3 % and decrease those of large yellowfin tuna by 1. 7 %. This result shows that the control of effort and investment could be adapted through management measures to encourage one fishing method...|$|R
50|$|The Tamaki River {{also has}} a marina / ferry wharf at Half Moon Bay, from where {{commuter}} ferries depart for the Auckland CBD and car/passenger ferries for Waiheke Island. Many yachts are also moored in its relatively well protected interiors. The river channel is marked with large green <b>buoys.</b> Deep draught <b>vessels</b> should {{stay close to the}} buoys as the channel, although averaging 20 m deep is very narrow in many places. Near the large Point England sand spit there are numerous mudflats which are barely covered at high tide. The speed limit in the river is 10 km/h. Rocks at the western mouth of the river at St Heliers are marked by a distinctive barber's pole. Vessels of more than 4 m draught should not attempt the opening between Musick Point and Browns Island. The channel in this area is marked by port and starboard markers about 20 m apart. It is 0.5 km northwest of Musick Point. Large mussel beds extend out 200 m from Browns Island into the river.|$|R
