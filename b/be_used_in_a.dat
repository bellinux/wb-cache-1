5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{is highly}} {{volatile}} and penetrates skin readily, {{and is very}} toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. Airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and should therefore <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fume hood. Osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as corn oil.|$|E

Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E
5|$|Anthony {{passed on}} both the castle and a {{considerable}} fortune to his son, yet another Sir Edward Hungerford, in 1657. After his marriage, Edward enjoyed an income of around £8,000 (£1,110,000) a year, making him a very wealthy man. Edward lived a lavish lifestyle, however, including giving a huge gift of money to the exiled Charles II shortly before his restoration to the throne, and later entertaining the royal court at Farleigh Hungerford Castle in 1673. Edward later fell out with the king over the proposal that the Roman Catholic James II should succeed to the throne on Charles's death, and after {{the discovery of the}} Rye House Plot in 1683 the castle was searched by royal officials looking for stocks of weapons that might <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> possible revolt.|$|E

The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed Fat Man, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping {{reorganization of the}} Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert George Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape {{using a combination of}} both slow and fast high explosives.|$|E

Although Teller {{was head of the}} T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was spending too much time on the Super, which had been given a low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
5|$|During {{the scene}} where Ray's stolen minivan is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E

5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{in spring training}} in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI {{for the third time in}} his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July.|$|E
5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is −1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in cyclic voltammetry. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar way.|$|E

5|$|Szczerbiec, {{together}} with other crown jewels, {{was removed from the}} Wawel Hill on several occasions during that period. After his Polish coronation in 1370, King Louis I of Hungary took the crown jewels with him to Buda; his successor on the Hungarian throne, Emperor Sigismund, rendered them to Poland in 1412. On two occasions, in mid-17th and early 18th centuries, they were evacuated across Poland's southern border to protect them from invading Swedish armies. In 1733, during the War of the Polish Succession, supporters of King Stanislaus I concealed the jewels in a Warsaw church for three years to prevent Augustus III from using them in his coronation. In 1764, they were sent to Warsaw again, to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coronation for the last time – that of Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski. They were returned to Kraków afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The animators also {{employed}} subsurface scattering—developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull {{during his}} graduate student {{days at the}} University of Utah in the 1970s—to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This {{would be the first}} time that subsurface scattering would <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, Geri's Game (1997), was attached alongside A Bug's Life in its theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} heavy {{emphasis on}} environmental destruction using a procedural destruction system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes. Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies. In addition to destruction, players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are valuable, as only limited numbers can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> round.|$|E
