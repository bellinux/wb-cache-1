40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study into the development of <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> for the measurement of Pitot pressures in low density expansion tube flows. The <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> developed here are modified from the conventional designs for <b>bar</b> <b>gauges.</b> A steel disc of 9 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness is attached to the front of a shielded sensing <b>bar.</b> Semiconductor strain <b>gauges</b> are used as the strain sensing elements. A PCB impact hammer was used to calibrate the <b>bar</b> <b>gauges.</b> Experiments in flows at 9 km/s, with Pitot pressures close to 750 kPa, were done in the X 1 expansion tube at The University of Queensland. Tests were also performed by changing the operation mode of the X 1 facility to run it as a non-reflected shock tunnel. For those tests the flow speed was around 1. 3 km/s and the Pitot pressure was close to 650 kPa. This test flow was used to check the calibration of the <b>bar</b> <b>gauges.</b> The results indicate that the <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> developed here can be used to measure Pitot pressures in flows with a test period of up to 100 µs. The quality of the signals can be enhanced by ensuring good contact between the front disk and the sensing bar. Moreover, by isolating the sensing bar electrically from the tunnel the effects of ionisation on noise levels on the strain signal is reduced. In order to obtain the true Pitot pressure measurements, the average disc pressures measured using the presented <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> have to be multiplied by a factor of 1. 08 (1 / 0. 93). The overall uncertainty of the Pitot pressure measured is estimated to be ± 7 %, for Pitot pressures of order 600 kPa...|$|R

Divers used the bounce diving techniques for repair and maintenance of the TBM. The tunnel boring machine jammed at its deepest depth. As a result the work time was not sufficient. The saturation diving technique was developed and permitted longer work time at great depth. Thirty-one divers were involved in this project. Twenty-three divers were examined using Doppler ultrasound. Data analysis addressed 52 exposures to Trimix at 4. 6 - 4. 8 <b>bar</b> <b>gauge</b> using the bounce technique and 354 exposures to Trimix at 4. 0 - 6. 9 <b>bar</b> <b>gauge</b> on saturation excursions.

This research studied a pressure swing adsorption using cassava-based adsorbent prepared from mixture of cassava starch and cassava pulp for dehydration of ethanol vapor. The apparatus used in the experiments consisted of double adsorption columns, an evaporator, and a vacuum pump. The feed solution contained 90 - 92 %wt of ethanol. Three process variables: adsorption temperatures (110, 120 and 130 °C), adsorption pressures (1 and 2 <b>bar</b> <b>gauge)</b> and feed vapor flow rate (25, 50 and 75 % valve opening of the evaporator) were investigated.

40|$|University of Minnesota Master of Science thesis. December 2014. Major: Industrial and Systems Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Caroline Hayes. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 349 pages, appendices 1 - 9. This thesis describes a usability study {{designed to increase}} an automotive designer's {{understanding of how to}} design effective dual-fuel gauges for hybrid vehicles. Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) aim at reducing dependency on gasoline. While gasoline has one primary source, which is non-renewable, electricity comes from renewable as well as non-renewable sources of energy. As we begin to generate electricity more efficiently from newer power plants that are built using renewable energy, it is important that drivers of HEVs begin to reduce their dependency on gasoline and rely more on electricity for operating their vehicles. Hybrid fuel gauges {{have a role to play}} in the overall user experience and adoption of HEVs. When purchasing a car, people take into consideration how the instrument panel looks and how understandable it is (Green, 1984). Therefore, it is important that these gauges are effective in providing information on fuel levels so that it can be read quickly and accurately. The goal of this work was to identify a class of gauges that support quick and accurate reading so that the driver can understand when to recharge the electric battery or refill the gas tank for efficient trip planning. A set of thirty-three hybrid gauge designs created by designers at General Motors was provided to the University of Minnesota team. The UMN team created four new gauge designs that were different from the ones created by the General Motors. These were reduced to a set of nine gauges by the process of heuristic evaluation. A two-part usability study was conducted with sixty drivers. In the first part, drivers participated in a timed comprehension task in which they were made to view certain gauges and answer questions on them. This was followed by a subjective questionnaire in which participants were asked about their preferences for various <b>gauges.</b> Vertically oriented <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> were found to be most effective. They elicited the highest accuracy rates and lowest response times compared to horizontally oriented <b>bar</b> <b>gauges</b> and circular gauges. Participants were able to process information in relative form (expressed in graphical or pictorial form) more easily and accurately than information in absolute form (expressed in numeric form). Familiar types of gauges, which appeal to participants, do not always contribute to better performance. Introducing new types of gauges requires more upfront marketing of their benefits (such as higher reading accuracy and speed). A set of recommendations has been created for automotive designers on how to create effective hybrid fuel gauges. These recommendations are important in driving standardization of hybrid fuel gauges to help deliver a consistent user experience and to minimize confusion and user frustration. These gauges encourage fuel-efficient behavior by helping drivers reduce their dependency on gasoline, thereby reducing pollution from carbon dioxide emissions and ultimately resulting in a cleaner environment...|$|R

This allows high-voltage operation with inherent voltage grading between the electrodes. A further feature of such switches is that they can have relatively low jitter under triggered condition.

PVDF polymeric matrix membrane is excellent in term of chemical and thermal stabilities, which make it very promising to be used as a membrane matrix for water separation. However, poor hydrophilic property of the PVDF has led to the severe fouling during operation. Thus, current work was performed to investigate the effect of incorporation of two additives i. e. polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) in PVDF-TiO 2 membrane, which fabricated using dry/wet phase inversion technique.
