50|$|The loch {{may have}} served as the head water for Ellingtone or Helenton Mill which is dated from 1583 in one source and 1549 in another. Two dams {{provided}} the head of water and the fall was around eleven feet powering a <b>breast</b> <b>wheel</b> and driving the two pairs of stones from Kameshill at West Kilbride. Half a ton of oatmeal per hour was the maximum milling rate. Provender for cattle was produced in addition to oatmeal. The mill had been built {{for the benefit of}} the tenants by the Montgomeries of Eglinton and one half of the machinery belonged to the miller.|$|E
5000|$|A wooden <b>breast</b> <b>wheel</b> {{with steel}} gearing {{was still in}} use up until 1884 when {{improvements}} included a new iron overshot wheel with gearing for one pair of stones. The set proved less than satisfactory, and in 1902 the whole machinery was replaced. The wheel was removed and a Hercules water turbine was installed with a belt drive. It operated at speed of 450 revolutions and if the gate was fully opened moved 600 cubic feet of water per minute through a single pipe of 21 in. diameter. The changes are very apparent in the gable ends and side walls where the enlargements to the mill were built with brick.|$|E
50|$|The current mill {{was built}} in the 18th century. Two wheels and wheelpits are present. The north wheelpit has a cast iron single-spoke wheel {{connected}} to flour sifting machinery that is dated 1883. It is thought that this end of the building was built on mediaeval foundations. This would explain the installation of a single spoke wheel as this form is the only one narrow enough to fit in either of the two channels separated by a sandstone pier. The south wheelpit has a restored low <b>breast</b> <b>wheel</b> and a complete train of machinery driving three pairs of French burr stones. The ground floor has a quarry tiled floor and a cast iron fireplace.|$|E
25|$|This was a <b>breast</b> shot <b>wheel</b> {{driving a}} pump again the exact {{location}} is not known.|$|R
50|$|There {{is often}} an {{associated}} millpond, a reservoir for storing water and hence energy until it is needed. Larger heads store more potential energy {{for the same amount}} of water so the reservoirs for overshot and backshot wheels tend to be smaller than for <b>breast</b> shot <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only {{the cast}} iron hub of this wheel remains, {{on a wooden}} axle of some 18 in{{diameter}}. The wheel had eight wooden spokes per side. This <b>breast</b> shot <b>wheel</b> was 13 ft diameter by 6 ft wide, with 48 floats mounted on a cast iron rim. This wheel drove three pairs of millstones by a layshaft.|$|R
40|$|The Jeffrey L. Brown Institute of Archaeology, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, {{conducted}} {{historical and}} archaeological {{documentation of the}} Wilson Mill Dam on the Ocoee River near Benton, Polk County, Tennessee, in July, 1983. Performed under {{a contract with the}} Tennessee Department of Transportation, the research involved 1) the development of a site-specific history of the mill and dam, based on primary and secondary documentation, 2) field documentation of the extant remains of the timber and stone crib-type dam and associated mill house remains, and 3) preparation of a synopsis of the development of milling in Polk County. The mill seat was utilized from 1847 to c. 1940 for grist and flour milling, as well as lesser operations. The mill was powered by an undershot wheel, <b>breast</b> <b>wheel</b> and from the 1870 s on, by turbine. Archaeological remains of the mill dam and associated features were photographed, mapped and described in field notes; no significant excavations were undertaken and no artifacts were collected. The principal remains documented were 1) an early debris-type dam, 2) a stone-filled timber crib dam, 3) penstock (turbine housing) remains, 4) mill house piers, and 5) possible early waterwheel underpinnings.

60|$|Paul hung {{behind in}} terror of being sent back. But {{the woman was}} amiable, and {{directed}} them. The mother and son went through the wheat and oats, over a little bridge into a wild meadow. Peewits, with their white <b>breasts</b> glistening, <b>wheeled</b> and screamed about them. The lake was still and blue. High overhead a heron floated. Opposite, the wood heaped on the hill, green and still.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is the old gentleman there?" [...] said he; {{and as he}} asked, the Marquis, {{with his}} eyes closed, and his hands crossed on his <b>breast,</b> was <b>wheeled</b> into the room. Agatha was seated, or rather was crouching, on a sofa in the corner, for Adolphe Denot was {{standing}} over her uttering threats and words of love alternately, the latter of which, however, sounded {{by far the most}} horrible in poor Agatha's ears.|$|R
60|$|Ska, {{filled with}} suspicions, circled warily. Twice he almost alighted upon the great, naked <b>breast</b> only to <b>wheel</b> {{suddenly}} away; {{but the third}} time his talons touched the brown skin. It was as though the contact closed an electric circuit that instantaneously vitalized the quiet clod that had lain motionless so long. A brown hand swept downward from the brown forehead and before Ska could raise a wing in flight {{he was in the}} clutches of his intended victim.|$|R
50|$|By the 1840s {{the mill}} had been become {{dilapidated}} and William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire decided it needed rebuilding and re-equipping. The mill was substantially rebuilt in dressed stone from the Hardwick Estate and fitted with modern machinery, including a 17 ft diameter <b>breast</b> shot water <b>wheel,</b> between 1846 and 1850. It was in operation {{for a century}} until it finally closed in 1952. Up till 1865 the millers {{were members of the}} Saunders family who had worked the mill since 1689. Subsequently the tenancy passed into the Hitch family for the rest of its working life, the last miller being William Hitch..|$|R
50|$|Two {{and a half}} {{miles down}} the River Doon from Kerse Mill was Nether Skeldon Mill. There were two estates of Skeldon, Nether and over Skeldon. The latter was renamed Hollybush and the other was simply called Skeldon. This mill was held by a branch of the Craufurds of Kerse and was on the Barony of Lochmartnaham. The mill had a <b>breast</b> paddle <b>wheel</b> of about 14 horse power. David Templeton was tenant of the mill in 1851. The mill was {{situated}} in a bend of the Rive Doon between Hollybush and Skeldon, and was operated as an oatmeal mill until 1868 when the water power and mill were taken over by William T. Hammond, a nephew of James Templeton, carpet manufacturer, Ayr, who erected a woollen mill on the site for the manufacture of blankets. The water power was increased by deepening the tailrace and carrying it about half a mile down the river giving it a fall of about nineteen feet at the water wheel. Several types of water wheels had been used since the mill was erected. A new turbine was installed in the 1940s with horizontal drive by Gilks of Kendal, said to develop at full gate 150 horse power. From the head of the dam {{to the end of the}} tailrace was about a mile. Thus, in a mile of the River Doon, full gate could be achieved resulting in 150 h.p.|$|R
2500|$|Sandwiched {{between the}} canal and the River Lud is a sewage {{treatment}} plant. The treated effluent is discharged into the canal below the lock site. Beyond the works are Alvingham Fisheries, {{and then a}} bridge which carries Lock Road over the canal. Alvingham Lock has two semi-circular drain openings in its western wall, and an inverted syphon carries water from the River Lud under the lock, to feed the mill pond for Alvingham Mill. The canal then passes the church of St Mary, once the chapel for a Gilbertine Priory, which dates from the eleventh to fourteenth centuries. It was the parish church for North Cockerington, and is Grade I listed. In the same churchyard is the parish church of St Adelwold, also Grade I listed, and build in the thirteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The churches separate Alvingham Water Mill from the canal. The present building was constructed in 1782 by John Maddison, with extensions in 1900, and it was restored in 1972. Most of the machinery, including an [...] diameter <b>breast</b> shot water <b>wheel,</b> dates from 1782, and was in regular use following restoration. The building replaced an earlier structure, as a water mill {{is known to have}} existed on the site since 1155. Water from the mill stream flows into Westfield Drain and returns to the canal a little further downstream. This is only possible because of the lowered water levels in the canal. Before closure to navigation, there was another inverted syphon under the canal, which returned the water to the River Lud, but this has been blocked up and abandoned.|$|R
