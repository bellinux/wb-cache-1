50|$|Angle {{grinders}} can be {{powered by}} an electric motor, petrol engine or compressed air. The motor drives a geared head at a right-angle on which is mounted an abrasive disc or a thinner cut-off disc, either {{of which can}} be replaced when worn. Angle grinders typically have an adjustable guard and a side-handle for two-handed operation. Certain angle grinders, depending on their speed range, can be used as sanders, employing a sanding disc with a <b>backing</b> <b>pad</b> or disc. The backing system is typically made of hard plastic, phenolic resin, or medium-hard rubber depending on the amount of flexibility desired.|$|E
30|$|The {{lateral flow}} test strip was {{composed}} of sample pad, conjugate pad, NC membrane, and absorbent pad, and all parts were pasted on a PVC baking (Fig.  1 b). The sample pad was saturated with PBS containing 0.1  % Tween- 20 (v/v) and dried at room temperature. The prepared QD-labeled anti-CA 72 - 4 mAb (CC 49) was applied into the conjugate pad, dried at 37  °C overnight and stored at 4  °C. To prepare the test line and control line, Biodot BJQ 3000 model XYZ 3200 was used. A solution of anti-CA 72 - 4 mAb (B 72.3, 2  mg/mL) was immobilized on NC membrane as a test line. The goat anti-mouse IgG was immobilized at a concentration of 1  mg/mL as a control line. After immobilization, the NC membrane was dried at 37  °C for 1  h and then blocked with PBS containing 1  % BSA (w/v). Absorbent pad was not treated. The sample pad, conjugate pad, coated membrane, and absorbent pad were sequentially laminated and pasted to a PVC <b>backing</b> <b>pad</b> with proper overlaps {{to ensure that the}} testing solution could migrate through the whole test strip. Then, the whole assembled strip was cut lengthways into strips with 3  mm width and stored in sealed plastic tubes until use.|$|E

2500|$|Innovations for 1937 {{included}} built-in defroster vents, safety type interior hardware (such as {{flexible door}} handles and recessed {{controls on the}} dash) and seat <b>back</b> <b>padding,</b> and fully insulated engine mounts. Brakes were 13" [...] drums, then in 1939 they expanded to 14", but shrunk to 12" [...] drums in 1940. Front suspension was independent.|$|R
5000|$|Vaulting {{horses are}} not saddled but wear a {{surcingle}} (or a roller) {{and a thick}} <b>back</b> <b>pad.</b> The surcingle has special handles which aid the vaulter in performing certain moves as well as leather loops called [...] "cossack stirrups". The horse wears a bridle and side reins. The lunge line is usually attached to the inside bit ring.|$|R
5000|$|Officials {{will require}} players with illegal {{equipment}} (such as, {{but not limited}} to, [...] "crop-top" [...] jerseys that expose the <b>back</b> <b>pads</b> (popularized by Ohio State running back Ezekiel Elliott) and writing on eye block) to leave the field for one play to correct it. A time-out may be taken to correct the equipment and avoid the player having to sit out the one play.|$|R
50|$|Reclining power {{chairs are}} a more {{reasonable}} option because they allow access where wheel cots do not. Properly modified by removal of foot rests and replacement with an ottoman type leg rest provides a reasonably comfortable option. The leg lift option along with suitable <b>back</b> <b>padding</b> and cushions is required. These chairs {{are readily available}} through most power chair manufacturers. This allows the user to be autonomous and not dependent on a caretaker.|$|R
50|$|The {{product range}} {{includes}} abrasive materials, polishing compounds and sanding machines for {{different types of}} abrasive processes in automotive refinishing and production (OEM), the manufacture of composite parts, furniture production, metal processing and for sales via the hardware, paint and machinery trades. Sales are increasingly {{in the form of}} systems sales, for which reason the product programme has been augmented by products such as sanding discs, <b>backing</b> <b>pads,</b> sanding and polishing machines, vacuum cleaners and other accessories.|$|R
50|$|Though horse riding {{was very}} common among Near Eastern elites by this date, who all used {{some type of}} bit, this large style of cheekpiece is only found in Luristan. The rigid single-piece {{mouthpiece}} bar, secured by bent back ends, is also unusual; elsewhere more flexible mouthpieces are found. Many pieces have small spikes on the reverse of the plates; it is thought these were either used to control the horse, or to fix <b>backing</b> <b>pads</b> of softer material.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} frame comprises two aluminum staves running the full {{height of the}} field pack. The staves are removable. The suspension system is adjustable allowing the user to position the field pack where it is most comfortable. The field pack has lower <b>back</b> <b>padding</b> {{as well as an}} extended lumbar support pad and the shoulder pads are made of bi-laminate foam. A softer, open cell foam is against the body for comfort followed by a stiffer closed cell foam for stability and good recovery after compression.|$|R
50|$|In April 1977, {{new federal}} safety {{standards}} {{went into effect}} that changed how school buses are constructed. Bodies had to be designed stronger to better survive crashes and rollovers, seats had to be redesigned, and other changes were made as well. Gillig's largest bus was now 90-passenger capacity, as the high <b>back</b> <b>padded</b> seats took up the extra space needed for the 16th row of seats. In states outside of California where Gilligs were sold, states began requiring amber warning lights along with the red lights seen since the 1940s.|$|R

5000|$|The IOTV is {{designed}} to take {{the weight of the}} vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that {{is designed}} to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a <b>back</b> <b>pad</b> in the lower back area of the vest, which {{is designed to}} defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the <b>back</b> <b>pad</b> does not provide significant ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear if using the older SAPI plates (NIJ standard III). Use of the new E-SAPI plates increase protection to armor-piercing versions of the aforementioned rounds in addition to [...]30-06 Springfield M2 armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified as this is primarily a law enforcement standard.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{optimization}} of cone calorimeter to determine the burning behavior of textile fabrics. In particular, the combustion behavior of commercial polyester textile fabrics with varying densities was studied in terms of time to ignition (TTI), heat release rate (HRR), and relative peak (pkHRR) were monitored. Reproducibility and repeatability of the data have been verified by the influence of instrument variable including incident heat flux, the temperature of ceramic <b>backing</b> <b>pads</b> and retaining grid used during sample mounting as well as sample weight (as the number of fabric layers), the density of textiles, and the relative humidity. A low reproducibility has been obtained when a wire grid was not used to stabilize samples during the tests. The effects of these variables on TTI and pkHRR were observe...|$|R
50|$|Mansfield gained notoriety for {{modeling}} {{a sweater}} designed by Edith Head, which she wore when she entertained U.S. Army troops in Alaska and Japan. The sweater's <b>back</b> was <b>padded</b> with heat-producing chemicals, and this then-novel idea along with Mansfield's photo was widely syndicated. She modeled a two-piece bathing suit in Pose! The Picture Magazine, in March 1955.|$|R

Wendt remained as Pad Leader for the entire Apollo program.|$|R
50|$|LC-36A was {{the scene}} of the biggest on-pad {{explosion}} in Cape history when Atlas-Centaur AC-5 fell <b>back</b> onto the <b>pad</b> on March 2, 1965. The accident spurred NASA to complete work on LC-36B which had been abandoned when it was 90% finished.|$|R
