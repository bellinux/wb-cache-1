50|$|The {{screaming}} cowbird is {{a specialist}} brood parasite, predominantly parasitizing the nests of the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> (Agelaidoides badius Molothrus badius). In 1874, W H Hudson {{was first to}} observe this parasitic relationship when he witnessed what he believed to be <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> chicks morph into screaming cowbird plumage. Bay-winged cowbirds have a clutch size of 3-4 eggs; they do not build their own nests and instead mostly use the old nests of other species.|$|E
5000|$|The main host, the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird,</b> can {{successfully}} fledge 1 screaming cowbird for 3 of its own. Reproductive success, {{as the number}} of fledgling per egg laid, has been recorded to be 0.14 for the screaming cowbird when hosted by the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird.</b> When hosted by the chopi blackbird, a reproductive success rate of 0.17 was found [...] In addition, the brown and yellow marsh bird is also able to successfully rear screaming cowbird chicks.|$|E
50|$|The {{screaming}} cowbird frequently parasitizes {{its main}} host, the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird,</b> during the pre-laying period. Screaming cowbirds lay 31% of their eggs {{before the first}} <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> egg {{but most of the}} eggs laid are ejected, and often within 24 hours. By ejecting parasitic eggs with their feet, bay-winged cowbirds can reduce the parasitic egg load by 75%. Host species can eject an entire clutch and commence egg laying again in the same nest or abandon the nest and start afresh. Chopi blackbirds and brown and yellow marsh birds have not been observed to eject screaming cowbird eggs.|$|E
50|$|Once hatched, <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbirds</b> treat {{parasitic}} chicks {{as their}} own, {{not only by}} providing food and protection but also by removing ecto-parasites such as botfly larvae.|$|R
50|$|Screaming cowbirds can lay 6-20 {{eggs in a}} <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> nest {{but usually}} one pair will lay only 2 eggs in the host nest. Up to 12 female {{screaming}} cowbirds can parasitize the same bay-wing nest.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> nests are parasitized by the {{screaming}} cowbird with parasitism rates of 74-100% recorded.Parasitism rates of 5-20% {{have been recorded}} for the brown and yellow marsh bird [...] and 46% for the Chopi blackbird.|$|E
50|$|Screaming cowbirds are monogamous {{and form}} stable pairs for the {{duration}} of the breeding season. As obligate brood parasites, they do not build their own nests, and instead, parasitize the nests of other species, predominantly the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird.</b>|$|E
50|$|The main host species, the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird,</b> clearly suffers losses through intense {{parasitism}} by {{the screaming}} cowbird; however, {{they are able}} to successfully raise their young with little overall impact in terms of hatching success, survival of nestlings and fledgling body mass.|$|E
50|$|Screaming cowbird {{eggs are}} spotted {{like those of}} their main host, the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird,</b> but do vary in shape, {{background}} colour and markings. Although this may be obvious when they appear in the host nest during pre-laying, they {{can be difficult to}} detect in a nest full of eggs.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is social}} and {{commonly}} seen in small groups. Unlike the [...] "true" [...] cowbirds in the genus Molothrus, this species {{is not a}} brood parasite. In contrast, the screaming cowbird is a brood parasite of the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird,</b> and while adult screaming cowbirds are overall blackish, juvenile screaming cowbirds closely resemble bay-winged cowbirds.|$|E
50|$|Screaming cowbirds deceive {{their main}} host, the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird,</b> with superb visual chick mimicry. In fact, {{screaming}} cowbirds {{are the only}} avian brood parasite to exhibit this trait. There are slight differences in skin and bill colour of nestlings but this is only present for the first 4-5 days. They then remain almost identical in size and appearance until they become nutritionally independent.|$|E
50|$|The pre-laying period (the {{time between}} nest making and egg laying) of the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> {{exhibits}} great variability in length (1-19 days). It {{is suggested that}} this behavior may act as an antiparasitic/defense mechanism to reduce the chances of successful parasitism. Such behaviours are a fascinating element to the co-evolutionary arms race that exists between avian brood parasites and their hosts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{screaming}} cowbird also parasitizes {{the nests}} of the chopi blackbird (Gnorimopsar chopi) and the brown and yellow marsh bird (Pseudoleistes virescens). Parasitism {{of these other}} two species generally occurs {{in areas where the}} <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> is absent but can also occur in its presence. The three host species that can successfully raise screaming cowbirds are all cooperative breeders. [...] "Helpers" [...] at the nest provide assistance with chick feeding and with predator defense.|$|E
50|$|Screaming cowbird chicks also {{mimic the}} begging calls of their <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> nest mates and, in addition, beg for longer {{and at a}} higher intensity. This more intense begging does not reflect greater hunger demands; instead, {{reflects}} a hard-wired behavior to ensure adequate nourishment and survival. Due to the mimicry of nestlings and fledglings, {{it has been suggested}} that screaming cowbirds and bay-winged cowbirds are closely related; however, molecular research has shown the species are not each other's closest relatives.|$|E
50|$|The grayish baywing (Agelaioides badius), {{formerly}} known as the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird,</b> is a species of bird in the family Icteridae. It is currently placed in the genus Agelaioides but has traditionally been placed in the genus Molothrus. It is found in the northern half of Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay and southern and central Brazil, The isolated population in north-eastern Brazil is usually now considered a separate species, the pale cowbird or pale baywing (Agelaioides fringillarius). The greyish baywing has been recorded as a vagrant in Chile.|$|E
50|$|Screaming cowbird adults {{frequently}} {{pierce the}} eggs of their hosts {{as well as}} previously laid parasite eggs. One study found 22.5% of <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> eggs were punctured by the screaming cowbird. Screaming cowbirds can distinguish between their eggs {{and those of other}} species and laboratory trials have shown that screaming cowbirds will puncture shining cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) eggs more frequently than their own. The purposes of egg puncture behavior are not clearly understood but may provide the parasite with information on the embryonic development of the host eggs and therefore whether or not to parasitize. Egg puncturing may also be practiced to reduce nestling competition and to enhance survival of parasitic offspring. Heavy predation in the form of egg punctures, which result in total nest failure and nest abandonment, may also create new opportunities for screaming cowbirds in the form of new nests to parasitize.|$|E
40|$|Parasitic cowbirds monitor {{potential}} hosts' nests {{and return}} to lay when appropriate, a task {{that is likely to}} involve spatial recall. Seasonal and sexual behavioral variations in the cowbirds correlate with anatomical changes in the hippocampal formation. During the breeding season, parasites have larger hippocampal formations than nonparasites. In parasitic species in which females alone perform nest bookkeeping, females have larger hippocampal formations than males. We investigated the distribution of the neuropeptide substance P (SP) in three sympatric cowbirds: two obligate parasites (shiny cowbird and screaming cowbird) and one nonparasite (<b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird).</b> Distribution of SP was similar to that in other songbirds, except for a previously undescribed field of dense SP-rich terminals within the hippocampus that we call the hippocampal SP terminal field (SPh). We found robust species differences in the volume of this new area, measured relative to the remainder of the telencephalon. SPh was largest in the generalist parasite (shiny cowbird) and smallest in the nonparasitic species (<b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird).</b> In the specialist parasite (screaming cowbird), SPh was smaller than in the generalist parasite but larger than in the nonparasitic species. SPh overlaps with two subdivisions described in the pigeon that have been related to the mammalian dentate gyrus and subiculum. The area containing SPh receives a major input from the lateral mammillary nucleus, which is probably the avian equivalent of the mammalian supramammillary nucleus (SUM), the main source of extrinsic SP input to mammalian hippocampus. SPh may be the termination of a pathway homologous to the SP-rich projection from SUM to the hippocampus in mammals...|$|E
40|$|Obligate avian brood parasites show {{dramatic}} {{variation in}} {{the degree to which}} they are host specialists or host generalists. The screaming cowbird Molothrus rufoaxillaris is one of the most specialized brood parasites, using a single host, the <b>bay-winged</b> <b>cowbird</b> (Agelaioides badius) over most of its range. Coevolutionary theory predicts increasing host specificity the longer the parasite interacts with a particular avian community, as hosts evolve defences that the parasite cannot counteract. According to this view, host specificity can be maintained if screaming cowbirds avoid parasitizing potentially suitable hosts that have developed effective defences against parasitic females or eggs. Specialization may also be favoured, even in the absence of host defences, if the parasite's reproductive success in alternative hosts is lower than that in the main host. We experimentally tested these hypotheses using as alternative hosts two suitable but unparasitized species: house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and chalk-browed mockingbirds (Mimus saturninus). We assessed host defences against parasitic females and eggs, and reproductive success of the parasite in current and alternative hosts. Alternative hosts did not discriminate against screaming cowbird females or eggs. Egg survival and hatching success were similarly high in current and alternative hosts, but the survival of parasitic chicks was significantly lower in alternative hosts. Our results indicate that screaming cowbirds have the potential to colonize novel hosts, but higher reproductive success in the current host may favour host fidelity...|$|E
