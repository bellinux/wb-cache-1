5|$|HDR {{brachytherapy}} for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, such as <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> and {{squamous cell}} carcinoma, provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction. Various applicators {{can be used}} to ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of the skin and help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinoma</b> or other neoplasms.|$|E

40|$|Background: Topical {{photodynamic}} therapy {{has been used}} for the treatment of superficial and nodular <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> with varying cure rates. Aims: This study aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} topical {{photodynamic therapy}} in the treatment of superficial and nodular <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in Asian patients treated at the National Skin Centre, Singapore. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of Asian patients with histologically confirmed <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and treated with photodynamic therapy was performed. Results: Eight Chinese patients, with an equal gender distribution and mean age of 83. 4 years were included. Five of eight <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were superficial while the remaining three were nodular. The <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were located in the head and neck in seven patients. The overall clearance rate at 3 months was 87. 5 % while the clearance rate for superficial and nodular <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> was 100 % and 66. 6 % respectively at 3 months. At 12 months, the overall clearance rate was 85. 7 %. Limitations: This is a retrospective analysis with small patient numbers. Conclusions: In this small series of eight Asian patients, topical photodynamic therapy has been shown to be effective and generally well-tolerated in the treatment of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> particularly of the superficial subtype. However, larger studies are needed to evaluate its overall efficacy in Asian patients...|$|R
40|$|<b>Basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are {{the most}} common form of skin cancer. Tazarotene is a retinoic acid {{receptor}} selective retinoid that upregulates a tumor suppressor, tazarotene-induced gene 3 (TIG- 3), in keratinocytes and psoriasis. Expression of TIG- 3 in <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> was studied in an opened-label pilot biomarker study of 22 patients with <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> who applied tazarotene 0. 1 % gel for up to 12 wk prior to excision. Nineteen paired baseline and treated specimens were compared using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Compared to overlying normal epidermis, TIG- 3 protein and mRNA were decreased in 14 and 18 of 19 <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (74 % and 95 %), respectively (p< 0. 001). Tazarotene treatment was associated with increased TIG- 3 protein and mRNA expression in <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> compared to baseline levels (p≤ 0. 001 and p= 0. 028, respectively). Sixty percent of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> treated with tazarotene decreased in size by at least 25 %. Ten of 19 lesions improved histologically, including three complete responses. There was a correlation between the increased expression of TIG- 3 protein and histologic improvement (p= 0. 020), suggesting that suppression of TIG- 3 may underlie the development of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> This association suggests that reversal of TIG- 3 expression may help to explain the mechanism of retinoid action in epidermal differentiation and chemoprevention...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} of all skin cancers worldwide and form {{the majority of the}} surgical workload for most modern cutaneous malignancy centres. Primary surgical removal of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> remains the gold standard of treatment but, despite almost two centuries of surgical experience, rates of incomplete surgical excision of up to 50 % are still reported. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess, quantify and perform comparative analysis of the outcomes and predictive factors of consecutive primarily-excised <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in a tertiary centre over a six-year period. METHODS: Retrospective audit was conducted on all patients who underwent surgical excision of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> from January 2000 to December 2005. Assessment parameters included patient biographics, tumour management differences and detailed histopathological analysis of tumour margins and subtypes. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and thirty two <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were excised from 1329 patients over the designated time period. Two hundred and fifty one (14 %) lesions were incompletely excised with 135 (7. 4 %) involving the peripheral margin only, 48 (2. 6 %) the deep margin only and 41 (2. 2 %) involving both. Nasal location was the most common predictor of incomplete excision.

In the present paper, we investigated intensity-based, texture-based and fractal-based features for automatically classifying the melanomas, <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and pigment nevi. Generalized estimating equations were used to test for differences between the skin tumors. A modified p value of < 0. 001 was considered statistically significant. Significant increase of mean and median of intensity and significant decrease of mean and median of absolute gradient were observed in <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and pigment nevi as compared with melanomas.

40|$|Mutations in {{the tumor}} {{suppressor}} gene PATCHED (PTC) are found in human patients with the <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> nevus syndrome, a disease causing developmental defects and tumors, including <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Gene regulatory relationships defined in the fruit fly Drosophila suggest that overproduction of Sonic hedgehog (SHH), the ligand for PTC, will mimic loss of ptc function.

40|$|Abstract: BACKGROUND- Morbidity from <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> is {{increasing}} worldwide. In Brazil {{there are no}} studies about morbidity rates {{of this type of}} cancer. OBJECTIVES- To determine morbidity and to analyze and classify the <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> diag-nosed in the city of Blumenau, from 1980 to 1999, according to their major clinical and his-tological features. METHODS- The author reviewed the histopathological findings of two laboratories of the city of Blumenau, considering the variables sex, age, primary site and histological type. The mor-bidity rates were calculated using the number of <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> found and the annual population estimated from 1980 to 1999. RESULTS- A total of 5254 tumors were identified, with a higher incidence in females and in sub-jects older than 50 years. Primary site in exposed areas was predominant. Morbidity rates var-ied from 51. 5 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants/year in 1980 to 225 cases per 100000 inhabitants in 1999. CONCLUSIONS- <b>Basal</b> <b>cell</b> <b>carcinomas</b> in Blumenau have distribution patterns similar to those reported in the literature regarding age, anatomical site and histological types.

25|$|Light-skinned {{people living}} in high {{sunlight}} environments {{are more susceptible to}} the harmful UV rays of sunlight {{because of the lack of}} melanin produced in the skin.

This cultural practice to gain tanned skin if not regulated properly can lead to sunburn, especially among very lightly-skinned humans.

The parameters based on spectral features of the lesions such as reflectance and color, as well as others empirically computed using reflectance values, were calculated pixel-by-pixel from the images obtained. Statistical descriptors were calculated for every segmented lesion [mean (x˜x˜), standard deviation (ss), minimum, and maximum]; descriptors based on the first-order statistics of the histogram [entropy (EpEp), energy (EnEn), and third central moment (µ 3 µ 3) ] were also obtained.
