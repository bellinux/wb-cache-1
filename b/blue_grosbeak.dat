50|$|HNWR {{is located}} within the Central Flyway, a route {{traveled}} annually by numerous species of waterfowl and other migratory birds. The refuge enjoys {{a reputation as a}} premier bird watching destination in North Texas. Although a total of 316 bird species have been recorded on the refuge since it was established in 1946, recent surveys show 273 different bird species are regularly found at HNWR, of which 80 species nest and 193 are migratory. Painted buntings, cardinals, scissor-tailed flycatchers, <b>blue</b> <b>grosbeaks,</b> eastern meadowlarks, northern mockingbirds, blue jays, and red-bellied woodpeckers are common nesting birds. Neotropical migrants such as warblers, tyrant flycatchers, tanagers, orioles, sparrows, and others pass through them each spring and fall with many of these species remaining to nest. Game birds on the refuge include the mourning dove, northern bobwhite and wild turkey. Many declining species either occasionally or commonly occur on the refuge including the American golden plover, prothonotary warbler, painted bunting and Hudsonian godwit. The refuge attracts 15 species of raptors during the fall and spring migration period including the osprey, rough-legged buzzard and Swainson's hawk, hen harrier, sharp-shinned hawk and Cooper's hawk. The refuge provides excellent wintering habitat for bald eagles, particularly along Lake Texoma. Nesting raptors include the red-tailed hawk, red-shouldered hawk, hen harrier, Mississippi kite, American kestrel, and the broad-winged hawk.|$|R

40|$|After {{years of}} {{investigation}} into the function of sexually dimorphic ornamental traits, researchers are beginning to understand how bright plumage colour in birds acts as an intraspecific signal. This work has focused primarily on pigment-based ornaments because they are highly variable in patch size, hue and brightness for some species. In contrast, structurally based ornaments have been little studied, {{in part because they}} {{do not appear to be}} as variable as pigment-based ornaments. We investigated a structurally based plumage ornament in a wild population of <b>blue</b> <b>grosbeaks</b> (Guiraca caerulea), a sexually dimorphic passerine. We report plumage variation that extends into the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. The pattern of covariation between four out of five elements of plumage variation suggests that structurally based ornamentation is pushed towards extreme expression of the trait as predicted by the sexual selection theory. The 'bluest' birds have the highest percentage of blue feathers on the body. These ornamental feathers reflect light maximally at the shortest wavelengths (ultraviolet), with the greatest intensity and the greatest contrast. Age may have some effect on expression of blueness. In addition, plumage variables are correlated with growth bars in tail feathers (a record of nutritional condition during moult in a non-ornamental trait). This suggests that the ornament is partially condition dependent. Thus, blue plumage in male grosbeaks may serve as an honest indicator of age and quality...|$|R

40|$|I visit {{a lot of}} {{properties}} across the South each year. Without exception, there is one rec-ommendation I have given everyone—get rid of the tall fescue and/or bermudagrass. I have never made an initial property visit in the South (or Midwest or Northeast, for that matter) where I didn’t find one of these grasses. Few landowners realize that just by eradi-cating these grasses, they can enhance habitat for white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, wild turkeys, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, field sparrows, indigo buntings, dickcissels, <b>blue</b> <b>grosbeaks,</b> yellow-breasted chats, American goldfinch, loggerhead shrikes, and many other species. And tall fescue and bermudagrass aren’t the only culprits. In my opinion (and in that of {{a whole lot of}} other biologists), you can add orchardgrass, timothy, bluegrass, john-songrass, crabgrass, goosegrass, bahiagrass, vaseygrass, velvetgrass, japangrass, and, cer-tainly, cogongrass. Why? None of these grass-es provide quality cover, forage, or seed for wildlife, none are native to North America, some are extremely invasive, and they all dis-place more desirable plants. Yes, I know deer may eat some of them at various times of the year, turkeys may eat bahiagrass seed, and quail and several other birds may eat crabgrass or johnsongrass seed. But why have a plant(s) that provides marginal cover, forage, or seed take up space where more desirable plants could grow?!? Make no mistake, you can increase the carrying capacity of your property for many wildlife species just by eradicating these grasses. Now, before you think I’m a native plant purist, let me explain. I do encourage people to promote native plants when possible and prac-tical, but I think foremost about landowner objectives and what would benefit wildlife. Thus, I’m also a proponent of food plots, for example, if they fit in with the landowner’s objectives. Of all the food plot plantings I might recommend, only a couple are native to North America. Therefore, I don’t have a problem with someone using a non-native plant to meet a specific objective, as long as that plant is no...|$|R

50|$|The {{indigo bunting}} {{is closely related}} to the lazuli bunting and interbreeds with the species where their ranges overlap, in the Great Plains. They were {{declared}} to form a superspecies by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1983. However, according to sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene of members of the genus Passerina, it was determined that the indigo bunting and lazuli bunting are not, in fact, sister taxa. The indigo bunting is the sister of two sister groups, a “blue” (lazuli bunting and <b>blue</b> <b>grosbeak)</b> and a “painted” (Rosita's bunting, orange-breasted bunting, varied bunting, and painted bunting) clade. This genetic study shows these species diverged between 4.1 and 7.3 million years ago. This timing, which is consistent with fossil evidence, coincides with a late-Miocene cooling, which caused the evolution of a variety of western grassland habitats. Evolving to reduce size may have allowed buntings to exploit grass seeds as a food source.|$|E
