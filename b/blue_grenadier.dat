40|$|Fish {{otoliths}} are {{calcium carbonate}} aggregates in the membranous labyrinth of all teleost fishes. The deposition of these structures {{is affected by}} both physiological and environmental factors which can cause changes in both the rate of otolith depositon and {{in the composition of}} the material deposited. The rate of otolith deposition, particularly in regard to the alternation of calcium carbonate-rich and protein-rich zones, has been widely investigated in an attempt to understand processes of ageing and growth in fishes. Aspects of the chemistry of these structures, particularly trace elements and stable isotopes, that may vary in response to physiological and environmental change, have not been studied in detail and are the basis of this research. The effects of temperature, somatic growth, otolith growth, condition factor, RNA/DNA ratio, age and season on the incorporation of Sr, Na, K and S into the sagittal otoliths of Australian salmon and <b>blue</b> <b>grenadier</b> were investigated by a combination of laboratory rearing experiments and monthly collections of wild fish. Microchemical analyses of otolith chemistry were carried out with a wavelength dispersive electron microprobe. There were significant differences in otolith Sr/Ca ratios among Australian salmon maintained in the laboratory at different temperatures and a slight positive correlation with temperature, but there was no evidence for a linear relationship between Sr/Ca ratio and temperature. Biologically significant relationships between other factors were not evident in laboratory-maintained fish. Furthermore, the variability of elemental ratios within temperature treatments and within individual otoliths was very significant. There were highly significant correlations between otolith chemistry and fish age in wild <b>blue</b> <b>grenadier</b> and it was hypothesized that the seasonal and age-related variation in otolith Sr content is largely the result of changes in the proportions of free and bound Ca and Sr present in the blood plasma and that this is in turn a function of the quantity and type of proteins present in the plasma. Data on the level of Sr present in the saccular endolymph and the sagittae of 12 fish species showed that there was a very strong relationship between the composition of the endolymph and the otoliths. Seasonal collections of otoliths, blood plasma, saccular endolymph and biological data from Pseudophycis barbatus indicated that physiology was largely responsible for changes in endolymph composition. Measurements of weight, length, gonad weight, and Sr, Ca, Na, K, protein, triglyceride, phosphate and glucose in the plasma and endolymph were used to develop multivariate models to explain endolymph and otolith composition.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the quantity of omega 3 (n- 3) fatty acids in commonly consumed species of South Australian fish. Omega 3 fatty acids ranged from 17. 7 % to 53. 7 % of total fat with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6 n- 3) as the major omega 3 fatty acid in all 26 species tested (range 9. 5 % to 47. 1 % of total fat). The levels of total omega 6 (n- 6) fatty acids ranged from 2. 3 % to 20. 2 % of total lipids, chiefly as arachidonic acid (AA, 20 : 4 n- 6). Fatty fish such as Gemfish, Atlantic Salmon and Swordfish were found to be good sources of omega- 3 fatty acid (1360, 2252 and 2571 mg/ 100 g fish respectively), while low fat fish such as Ling, Deep Sea Bream (Blue Warhou) and <b>Blue</b> <b>Grenadier</b> (0. 5, 0. 7 and 0. 7 % fat) had low levels of omega 3 fatty acid (222, 257 and 247 mg/ 100 g). Because most white table fish consumed by Australians are so low in fat they are actually a limited source of omega 3 fats.

40|$|Australian {{fur seals}} {{are known to}} {{interact}} directly (i. e. operational interactions) with trawlers fishing in the winter <b>blue</b> <b>grenadier</b> trawl fishery of western Tasmania, Australia. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the environmental and operational aspects of the fishery that were associated with increased numbers of seals observed at the surface. The incidence of net entry was determined in order to establish the effectiveness of the currently used Seal Exclusion Device (SED) at reducing by-catch and mortalities. In addition, the stage and depth at which seals were at greatest risk of entering the net at depth and becoming by-catch were also identified. An increase in seal numbers observed at the surface is assumed to be proportional to the increased risk of by-catch and mortality incidences at trawlers. The most important subset of environmental and operational factors for predicting the number of seals observed at the surface both in the fishing ground in general and during fishing operations were identified using Generalised Linear Modelling. The final model yielded a significant result (R 2 = 0. 63, P < 0. 01, n = 149) and indicated that the number of seals observed increased when weather conditions deteriorated, particularly when barometric pressure decreased and when swell height and visibility increased. Vessel operations also influenced the number of seals observed; seal numbers increased when the number of nearby vessels and trawl frequency increased, but decreased when vessel speed increased. Seal numbers also increased as the distance from the nearest breeding colony and haul-out site decreased. Seal numbers at the surface generally increased steadily during trawling operations (n = 475), although brief declines were noted during shooting and hauling phases. Sub-surface net interactions were also examined using a submersible video camera unit. Seal activity at depth was converse to that observed at the surface, with increased seal numbers noted during shooting and hauling, suggesting that seals dived to forage on fish in the submerged net. All seal by-catch occurred during the day and almost half occurred during shooting. Mortalities were significantly higher during shooting compared with hauling (Fishers exact test: coef. = 0. 65, P < 0. 05). However, mortality rates were similar between tows with the Seal Exclusion Device (SED) attached and those without (Fishers exact test: coef. = 0. 07, P < 0. 99). Only one seal was detected entering and exiting the net mouth during monitored tows, suggesting that the recently observed reduction in by-catch levels (and mortalities) may not necessarily be attributed to the introduction of the Seal Exclusion Device. Seal by-catch recorded during hauling typically occurred when haul speeds exceeded minimum average swimming speeds for fur seals. Recommendations based on these findings have been made to assist with the future management of fur seal populations that interact with trawl fisheries. Derek J. Hamer and Simon D.

40|$|The myotendinous {{junction}} of fish muscle {{was investigated in}} detail using both scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM respectively). The properties of the main connective tissue structure, type I collagen, were characterised and the purified collagen was used to prepare antibodies to examine structural aspects by immunogold procedures. The SEM studies showed that a network of fibrous connective tissue surrounds each muscle fibre, linking it into a socket-like indentation in the myocomma. These connective tissue fibres were degraded in chill storage, leading to the detachment of muscle fibres from the myocommata and subsequent loss of tissue integrity. Detailed study by TEM demonstrated grooves and invaginations in the terminal ends of the muscle fibres that were filled with fine collagen fibres from the myocomma. These collagen fibres were linked by fine connections to the basal lamina which in turn {{was linked to the}} sarcolemma. During chill storage, the basal lamina, the fine connections and the fine collagen fibres progressively degraded and significant deterioration occurred in the myotendinous junction. This deterioration preceded any obvious changes within the muscle fibre structure. The major structural collagen of the skin and muscle and other organs in the fish <b>blue</b> <b>grenadier</b> is an heterotrimer of type I collagen. This collagen was highly soluble in dilute acid and the proportion of insoluble collagen increased with the age of the fish. The collagen possessed three alpha chains in its molecular structure and the amino acid composition of the a- 3 chain indicated its derivation from the a- 1 chain. The melting and shrinkage temperatures obtained for this collagen were consistent with the imino acid levels and the environment of the fish. Immunogold labelling procedures were developed which confirmed the presence of type I collagen fibres in the myocomma adjacent to the muscle fibre cell but which were inadequate to define individual collagen fibre types. These studies illustrate the complex and intricate nature of the myotendinous junction in commercial fish species. They show that post mortem degradation occurs external to the muscle fibre cell in the extracellular matrix and, in particular, in the fine collagen fibres that form the muscle cell envelope and fill the interstitial muscle space. The study has thus shown that the initial problems of post mortem softening and gaping have their origin in the myotendinous junction not within the muscle fibre itself. The TEM work confirms the SEM work that the breakdown occurs at the interface between the muscle fibres and the connective tissue of the myocomma. It has highlighted the need for further work on the nature and properties of the interstinal collagens and on the nature, activity, specificity and location of the enzymes responsible for the degradation. It has also pointed out the need to establish whether the marine equivalents of minor components of mammalian muscle and its extracellular matrix occur in fish...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the ecology of}} zooplankton, midwater fishes and top predators off {{the east coast of}} Tasmania in relation to the regional oceanography. This work was completed from small (< 15 m) to large (60 + m) fishing and fisheries research vessels using nets ranging from fine-meshed plankton nets (100 µm) to large midwater trawls (cod end mesh size 10 mm). Further data was obtained from the Maria Island hydrographic station and the AFZ observer program. The study area was situated in and around the northern edge of the subtropical convergence zone. This zone separates the most southern edge of the East Australia Current from the broader subtropical convergence and subantarctic water to the south. The latitudinal position of this front depends not only on the time of year - in the summer it extends southward and retreats in winter - but also on interannual cycles such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation. On the shelf the distribution and biomass of the major zooplankton species, Nyctiphanes australis, was closely related to fluctuations in these water masses. This species is central to the shelf food web - it is, at times, the main prey for predators ranging in size from larval fishes (eg. those of jack mackerel Trachurus declivis) to large southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). In autumn, when its biomass is highest, schools of its main fish predator, jack mackerel form on the surface over the shelf where they are fished commercially. The central position of N. australis in the shelf food web was demonstrated in the summer of 1988 / 89 when warm waters from an anti El Nino event flushed the shelf resulting in the disappearance of the krill and the subsequent collapse of the jack mackerel fishery. Over the continental slope a suite of myctophid species dominated the water column. These lanternfish aggregate in dense schools over the slope in spring and summer, migrating to the surface at dusk and descending before dawn to depths between 300 - 500 m. Their horizontal distribution is restricted mainly to a thin band (- 500 m wide) over the 300 m contour. One of these, Lampanyctodes hectoris, was central to the upper slope food web. Examination of the reproductive cycles of L. hectoris and other abundant lanternfish showed multiple spawning over winter. The winter spawning is presumably timed so that juveniles can take advantage of increased prey levels, mainly euphausiids, which are generated by the spring bloom. Growth in L. hectoris, which lives up to 3 years, is fastest at this time. In winter they are scarce over the slope. The reasons for this scarcity are not clear, but it is at least partly due to the massive predation on them. However, lack of feed - copepods are the main prey over winter - may limit the size of aggregations that can be sustained. The concentrations of lanternfishes during spring and summer form the basis of a food chain supporting larger fishes such as <b>blue</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Macruronus novaezelandiae) and jack mackerel, and during summer, other larger lanternfish such as Diaphus danae. Offshore, a more diverse community of midwater fishes was identified, which, although similar among the different water masses, was significantly different in the surface waters of the East Australia Current, the result of a relative increase in species of subtropical origin. Densities were an order of magnitude lower than that found for the slope lanternfish. The diets of lanternfish ff shore were dominated by calanoid copepods, particularly those of the genus Plueromamma. Non-myctophids within the same size range ate a wider range of prey. Some, such as the Stomiatoid genus Chauliodus, were entirely piscivorous on lanternfish. Estimation of the relative biomass of zooplankton and micronekton from the main geographic and oceanographic regions of the area showed that shelf biomass was significantly higher than that offshore. This increased biomass appears to be derived from a mixture of subtropical convergence water washing over the shelf and shelfbreak upwelling. The higher biomass over the shelf was reflected in the daily ration of shelf-caught southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), which fed mainly on jack mackerel and had rations - 3 times that of offshore-caught tuna. I identified 10 trophic categories off eastern Tasmania across the shelf to the open sea. These were-large pelagic omnivores (eg. Thunnus maccoyii), pelagic omnivores (eg. Trachurus declivis), pelagic piscivores (eg. Brama brama), small mesopelagic omnivores (eg. Diaphus danae, Lampanyctus australis and Chauliodus sloanii), neritic planktivores (eg. Lampanyctodes hectoris), bathypelagic omnivores (eg. Hoplostethus atlanticus), squid (eg. Nototodarus gouldii), gelatinous zooplankton (eg. Pyrosoma pyrosoma), oceanic (eg. Pleuromamma spp. and Phronima sedentaria) and shelf (eg. Nyctiphanes australis) zooplankton. A common theme, which has run through many of these studies, was the link between inshore and offshore processes. Although the dominant zooplankton and micronekton species were usually restricted in their distributions (eg. Nyctiphanes australis with the shelf), their main predators moved freely between the inshore and offshore waters. I believe that the movements of these predators are determined largely by prey availability. Thus, prey availability, itself dependent upon seasonal and interannual cycles in the regional oceanography, appears to drive much of the seasonal and interannual patterns of abundance of larger fishes in the region. Two of these species, jack mackerel and southern bluefin tuna, are the focus of commercial fisheries. Their effective management therefore will need to consider (1) the dependence of the tuna on the mackerel and (2) that both species in this area depend, either directly or indirectly on krill stocks, which in tum depend on the fluctuations of the regional oceanography. Finally, over the period of this study {{there have been a number}} of advances both in techniques and technologies in the study of midwater communities. I have therefore summarised those techniques and approaches to studying the midwater that I think have benefited this area of research. I have also identified some of the difficulties that need addressing...|$|E
