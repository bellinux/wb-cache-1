5000|$|In {{the seasons}} {{leading up to}} the {{creation}} of the Met Opera Guild in 1935, the financial situation at the Met Opera was dire. The Great Depression extinguished the social structure that gave rise to the old Met Opera, a place dominated by the whims of a few rich <b>boxholders.</b> The real admirers of the art form were revealed in box office receipts; while “the cheap seats were often filled … (the pricey orchestra sections featured) stretches of empty seats." ...|$|R
5000|$|Slayden's {{growth was}} {{spurred by the}} {{existence}} of a railroad line (the [...] "Mineral Branch" [...] of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad) which was built in the late 19th century largely to assist the movement of iron from the nearby works at Cumberland Furnace to market. In the early 20th century Slayden was home to a department store and was considered a major community of Dickson County. With the closure of the Mineral Branch and the Cumberland Furnace works, the area went into an economic decline. As the area declined from the loss of the furnace works, nearby Nashville and Clarksville offered more non-farming opportunities. The local primary school was closed in 1960 and merged with the larger one in nearby Vanleer. At about this time mail ceased to be delivered from the post office, which continues to serve post office <b>boxholders.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1775, a {{fire had}} {{destroyed}} the Royal Theatre which {{was located in}} one of the palace wings. The <b>boxholders</b> association together with Archduke Ferdinand seized the opportunity to build a prestigious new theatre. Charged with its design in 1776, Giuseppe Piermarini immediately decided not to use the old site but rather the ground made available after the closure of the convent of Santa Maria della Scala, hence the name Teatro alla Scala. Brick rather than wood was chosen as the building material and the number of rows of boxes was increased to six. Additional rooms were included for various functions: there was a dance hall, a gaming room, workshops, cafes and restaurants. An extremely innovative feature, {{at least as far as}} Italian theatres were concerned, was the addition of an entrance for carriages. Access was further facilitated by widening the street now known as Santa Redegonda which had been a narrow old winding lane.|$|R
