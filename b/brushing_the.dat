5|$|Around {{the same}} time, a {{separate}} tropical cyclone {{formed in the}} western Atlantic. It moved from {{off the coast of}} Florida to near Bermuda between October 24 and November 1, <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> coast from St. Augustine to Charleston with gale-force winds. No significant damage occurred, though coastal flooding and heavy rainfall that caused a break in an earthen dam were reported along the coast of Georgia.|$|E
5|$|On November13, a level three TCOR {{was issued}} for Okinawa. This {{prompted}} military personnel to begin securing {{the island and}} preparing planes without hangars for evacuation. <b>Brushing</b> <b>the</b> region as a Category3-equivalent typhoon, Karen caused considerable disruptions to airlines, trains, shipping, and communications. No serious damage was reported in Okinawa, but the nearby Daiyumaru and another Japanese fishing vessel {{with a total of}} 26crew went missing.|$|E
5|$|The season's eleven known storm {{identified}} several hundred {{miles south of}} Mexico on October17. Quickly tracking northwestward, the storm attained an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its existence.

5|$|Hurricane Henri {{developed}} as Tropical Depression Eighteen {{in the extreme}} northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 14 from a tropical wave, which had previously moved {{off the coast of}} Africa. The formation of a tropical depression was confirmed by reports from Hurricane Hunters. The depression tracked northward, <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> eastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. After reaching the Gulf of Mexico it turned sharply westward, with a ridge preventing further northward movement. The depression turned southwestward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Henri on September 16.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paine {{contributed to}} one of the most {{significant}} flooding events in Oklahoma history. The 16th tropical storm and 8th hurricane of the 1986 Pacific hurricane season, Paine formed on September 28 off the southeast coast of Mexico. It moved around a ridge, later turning to the north and <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> Baja California Peninsula. By that time, Paine had attained peak winds of 100mph (155km/h), but it weakened slightly before hitting the Mexican state of Sonora. The remnant moisture combined with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall in the south-central United States.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Agnes, {{which at the time}} was the costliest United States hurricane, until Frederic in 1979. After <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> western tip of Cuba, the hurricane made landfall on the Florida Panhandle. It caused at least $2.1billion (1972USD) in damage and 137fatalities, mostly from inland flooding in Pennsylvania and New York. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betty, which reached peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) while west of the Azores. Tropical Storm Carrie passed just offshore of Massachusetts, causing heavy rainfall and resulting in four fatalities, but leaving only $1.78million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Despite the storm's extreme intensity, {{it quickly}} began to weaken as it {{approached}} the Philippines on October 6. Within ten hours, the pressure rose to 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg) and later dropped below Category 5 status. That morning, Nora turned more northwesterly {{in response to}} a weakening in a subtropical ridge and an approaching shortwave trough over China. Steady weakening continued over the following days, with the storm <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> northeastern tip of Luzon, Philippines, with winds of 175ndash&185 km/h (110ndash&115 mph) on October 7. Nora's intensity leveled out around 130 km/h (80 mph) on October 8 as it tracked between the Philippines and Taiwan. After passing within 95 km (60 mi) of Taiwan, Nora turned more northerly before making landfall near Xiamen, Fujian as a minimal typhoon early on October 10. Once onshore, the storm rapidly degenerated into an area of low pressure before dissipating the following day.|$|E
5|$|Emilia {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about}} 18hours, during which it passed about 60mi (95km) southwest of Cabo San Lazaro, {{which is a}} cape located southwest of Ciudad Constitución on the southwestern coast of the Baja California peninsula. After <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> peninsula with its outer rainbands, Emilia {{turned away from the}} coast into cooler waters, and subsequently began to weaken rapidly. On July 27 it deteriorated into a tropical depression, and the next day Emilia degenerated into a convective-less remnant low. The low continued westward until turning northward on July 30, and on July 31 the remnants of Emilia dissipated about 495mi (800km) west-southwest of San Diego, California.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Anna {{impacted}} Central America and the Windward Islands in July1961. The first {{tropical cyclone}} and first hurricane {{of the hurricane}} season, Anna developed on July20 from an easterly wave located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone(ITCZ) over the Windward Islands. Initially a tropical storm, it moved westward across the Caribbean Sea. Favorable environmental conditions allowed Anna to reach hurricane intensity late on July20. Early on the following day, the storm strengthened into a Category2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Intensification continued, and later on July21, Anna became a major hurricane, upon reaching Category3 intensity. After attaining peak intensity on July22, the hurricane slightly weakened while <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> northern coast of Honduras. Further weakening occurred; when Anna made landfall in landfall in Belize (then known as British Honduras) on July24, winds decreased to 80mph (130km/h). Anna rapidly weakened over land and dissipated later that day.|$|E
5|$|On September8, a low {{pressure}} area formed east of the Philippines. It intensified into a tropical storm while moving to the northwest, passing near the Ryukyu Islands on September17. After bypassing Taiwan to the north, the storm approached {{the mouth of the}} Yangtze in eastern China, before recurving to the northeast. It was last noted on September21 in the Sea of Japan. On {{the last day of the}} month, a typhoon formed west of Palau. Steered to the northwest, the storm moved across northern Luzon, hitting Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan. After emerging into the South China Sea, the storm turned to the northeast, <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> Batanes islands as well as southeastern Taiwan on October4. Crossing the Ryukyu Islands, the storm was last noted on October6 to the southwest of Kyushu.|$|E
5|$|The only deadly {{storm of}} the season was Elinah, which formed on January9 in the Mozambique Channel. It moved to the {{southwest}} and was intensifying when it struck Comoros on January11. There, high winds and waves heavily damaged banana and coconut crops, and the storm damaged or destroyed 4,357buildings. High waves knocked 40people off a pier on Anjouan, killing 33 of them. Damage in Comoros totaled $23.1million (1983USD). Elinah intensified before <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> coast of Mozambique, and it dissipated on January9. Aside from a weak storm classified by the JTWC in February, there was minimal activity for several months. The final storm {{of the season}} was Tropical Depression Fely, which dropped moderate rainfall in eastern Madagascar in late June.|$|E
50|$|A {{spring is}} {{typically}} used with <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> to maintain constant {{contact with the}} commutator. As <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> downwards towards <b>the</b> commutator. Eventually <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> wears small and thin enough that steady contact {{is no longer possible}} or it is no longer securely held in <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> holder, and so <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> must be replaced.|$|R

5|$|Typhoon Wipha, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Goring, was the strongest typhoon to {{threaten}} the Chinese coastline since Typhoon Saomai in August 2006. Forming out of a tropical disturbance on September15, 2007, it quickly developed into a tropical storm, and intensified into a typhoon the following day {{with the appearance of}} an eye feature. After a period of rapid intensification, Wipha attained its peak intensity on September18, with winds of 185km/h (115mph) and a barometric pressure of 925mbar (hPa), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Later that day, the storm began to weaken as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan before <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> northern edge of the island. Wipha subsequently made landfall near Fuding along the Fujian-Zhejiang provincial border with winds estimated at 185km/h (115mph) by the JTWC. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon weakened as it moved inland, weakening to a tropical storm within 18hours of moving over land.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Beatriz was a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{that killed}} four people after <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> western coast of Mexico in June 2011. Originating {{from an area}} of disturbed weather on June19, several hundred miles south of Mexico, Beatriz gradually intensified. Gaining latitude, the system became increasingly organized and reached hurricane status {{on the evening of}} June20. The following morning, Beatriz attained winds of 90mph (150km/h) as it passed roughly 15mi (20km) of Mexico. Due to its interaction with land, the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later. Early on June22, Beatriz dissipated over open waters. Prior to Beatriz's arrival in Mexico, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas. Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of Colima and Guerrero. Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the Sabana River in Acapulco, killing four people. However, the overall effects of Beatriz were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in mitigating a severe drought.|$|E
5|$|In late October, {{a highly}} unusual {{tropical}} cyclone {{formed in the}} far eastern Atlantic, first detected to the southwest of Madeira on October 24. On October 26, a ship near Madeira recorded a barometric pressure of , suggesting a hurricane of Category 2 intensity. The hurricane passed just north of Madeira on October 27, producing heavy damage in Funchal. After <b>brushing</b> <b>the</b> northwestern coast of Morocco {{on the night of}} October 28–29, the hurricane moved ashore over southwestern Spain and likely became extratropical shortly thereafter. As a result of the extratropical transition, damaging winds extended far from the storm center and affected much of inland Spain. Dozens of ships, including three belonging to the Spanish Navy, were lost or severely damaged in the storm. Two bridges were washed away in Cádiz and homes were destroyed in Seville. Hurricane-force winds reached as far inland as Madrid, and thousands of trees were uprooted in the province of Badajoz. This storm serves as an important historical analogue for Hurricane Vince, which followed a similar course in October 2005.|$|E
