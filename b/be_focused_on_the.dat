A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine and analyze {{broadcasting}} station's image expressed in wearing dress color of male and female news anchors. The data were collected from replay video news(n= 180) provided in each station's website during 2005 - 2010 year. The results were as follows. First, in the case of the male anchor, KBS <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> quiet and classic image and the gentle image. MBC <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vital and urban image. SBS <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dynamic and young image. Second, in the case of the female anchor, KBS <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neat, soft, and feminine in S/S season, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand the loud and flamboyant image in F/W season. MBC <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vital and urban image like image of a male anchor. SBS <b>was</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> private image of a female anchor than broadcasting station's image. Through the results of this study, the image of the individual and companies can be symbolized by the color of dress...|$|R

The Air Cadet League introduced awards for proficiency and loyalty to the squadrons, summer courses were offered at RCAF stations, and a flying scholarship course was developed. To date, more than 15,000 cadets have received their private pilot licence through the scholarship course.

5|$|There {{was little}} support for {{compulsory}} military service amongst the public, however, and combined with the financial pressure that the government felt {{at that time to}} reduce defence spending, the 1920 recommendations were not fully implemented. Although the compulsory training scheme was retained, it was decided that it would only <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more populated areas, essentially ending the scheme in rural areas. The result of this was that the course of only a year the strength of the Citizens Forces fell from 127,000 to only 37,000 in 1922. Throughout the 1920s, numbers decreased even further and although the divisional structure was maintained, it {{was little more than a}} skeleton force as units found their numbers dropping drastically.|$|E
5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} process of {{developing}} a management plan for the Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan. Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the management plan, which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal of the herd, and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a plan could be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that the herd size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of the damage to the island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan. The study published in 2000 recommended a management strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> female members of the herd, due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the {{invention}} of his revolutionary illumination scheme as {{a graduate student at the}} University of Giessen, Köhler was working on overcoming problems with microphotography. Microscopes were illuminated by gas lamps, mirrors or other primitive light sources, resulting in an uneven specimen illumination unsuited for producing good quality photomicrographs using the slow-speed emulsions available at the time. Over the course of his work for his doctorate degree, Köhler developed a microscope configuration that allowed for an evenly illuminated field of view and reduced optical glare from the light source. It involved a collector lens for the lamp that allowed the light source to <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front aperture of the condenser. This in turn allowed the condenser to <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> specimen using a field diaphragm and condenser focus control. This superior illumination scheme is still widely used in modern microscopes and forms the basis for phase contrast, differential interference contrast, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy.|$|E

Julian certainly had a clear idea of what he wanted Roman society to be, both in political as well as religious terms. The terrible and violent dislocation of the 3rd century meant that the Eastern Mediterranean had become the economic locus of the Empire.

25|$|Thus, the Internet {{of things}} creates an {{opportunity}} to measure, collect and analyse an ever-increasing variety of behavioural statistics. Cross-correlation of this data could revolutionise the targeted marketing of products and services. For example, as noted by Danny Meadows-Klue, the combination of analytics for conversion tracking with behavioural targeting has unlocked {{a new level of}} precision that enables display advertising to <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> devices of people with relevant interests. Big data and the IoT work in conjunction. From a media perspective, data is the key derivative of device interconnectivity, whilst being pivotal in allowing clearer accuracy in targeting. The Internet of things, therefore, transforms the media industry, companies and even governments, opening up a new era of economic growth and competitiveness. The wealth of data generated by this industry will allow practitioners in advertising and media to gain an elaborate layer on the present targeting mechanisms used by the industry.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{microwave}} {{transmission of}} {{power has been}} the most controversial issue in considering any SPS design. At the Earth's surface, a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center, of 23mW/cm2 (less than 1/4 the solar irradiation constant), and an intensity of less than 1mW/cm2 outside the rectenna fenceline (the receiver's perimeter). These compare with current United States Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) workplace exposure limits for microwaves, which are 10mW/cm2, - the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for Federal OSHA enforcement purposes. A beam of this intensity is therefore at its center, of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels, even for long term or indefinite exposure. Outside the receiver, it is far less than the OSHA long-term levels Over 95% of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna. The remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world. It is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible <b>be</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rectenna. Outside the rectenna, microwave intensities rapidly decrease, so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected.|$|E
