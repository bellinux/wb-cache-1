5|$|The kingdom {{has a small}} <b>but</b> <b>well</b> {{equipped}} military {{called the}} Bahrain Defence Force (BDF), numbering around 13,000 personnel. The supreme commander of the Bahraini military is King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and the deputy supreme commander is the Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{that feature}} {{scandium}} in the oxidation state other than +3 are rare <b>but</b> <b>well</b> characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl3 {{is one of}} the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{accepted}} described {{living species}} of molluscs vary from 50,000 {{to a maximum}} of 120,000species. In 1969 David Nicol estimated the probable total number of living molluscs at 107,000 of which were about 12,000 fresh-water gastropods and 35,000 terrestrial. The Bivalvia would comprise about 14% of the total and the other five classes less than 2% of the living molluscs. In 2009, Chapman estimated the number of described living species at 85,000. Haszprunar in 2001 estimated about 93,000named species, which include 23% of all named marine organisms. Molluscs are second only to arthropods in numbers of living animal species—far behind the arthropods' 1,113,000 <b>but</b> <b>well</b> ahead of chordates' 52,000. About 200,000 living species in total are estimated, and 70,000 fossil species, although the total number of mollusc species ever to have existed, whether or not preserved, must be many times greater than the number alive today.|$|E
50|$|All of Theotocopulos's {{scenes were}} {{originally}} shot with Ernest Thesiger in the role, <b>but</b> <b>Wells</b> found his performance to be unsatisfactory, {{so he was}} replaced with Cedric Hardwicke and the footage re-shot.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the native}} Egyptian rulers {{installed}} by Esarhaddon {{were unable to}} retain full control of the whole country for long. Two years later, Taharqa returned from Nubia and seized control of a section of southern Egypt {{as far north as}} Memphis. Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa; however, he fell ill and died in his capital, Nineveh, before he left Assyria. His successor, Ashurbanipal, sent an Assyrian general named Sha-Nabu-shu with a small, <b>but</b> <b>well</b> trained army, which conclusively defeated Taharqa at Memphis and once more drove him from Egypt. Taharqa died in Nubia two years later.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, Well Dunn began another {{series of}} matches against The Bushwhackers. The feud lasted the {{remainder}} of the year, although Barry Horowitz substituted for Steven Dunn in several matches when Dunn was unable to appear. The Bushwhackers were victorious in the majority of matches, <b>but</b> <b>Well</b> Dunn won occasional matches. One of these matches was featured on the Coliseum Video release Wham Bam Bodyslam, and another two were televised on Monday Night Raw. During one of the Monday Night Raw matches, The Bushwhackers were accompanied by ring announcer Howard Finkel, who had a long-standing rivalry with Wippleman. Finkel and Wippleman had an argument during the match that led to a tuxedo match, in which Finkel was declared the winner after stripping Wippleman to his underwear.|$|E

50|$|Wells was a {{reluctant}} propagandist, as he {{states in the}} volume's early pages.

He told his publisher his text had been approved, and told censors that he lost their revised proofs, though in fact he had burned them.|$|R

25|$|One of Cotten's last films was the box-office bomb Heaven's Gate (1980), at {{the time}} {{critically}} mauled in the United States <b>but</b> <b>well</b> received abroad. The film was positively reevaluated early in the 21st century, receiving a Criterion Collection release in 2013.|$|E

They had little artillery and no tanks. As the battle progressed, German reinforcements were added.

25|$|As {{the early}} BBC Micros had ample I/O {{allowing}} machines to be interconnected, {{and as many}} schools and universities employed the machines in Econet networks, numerous networked multiplayer games were created.

25|$|Global exit {{activity}} totalled $252bn in 2011, practically unchanged {{from the}} previous year, <b>but</b> <b>well</b> up on 2008 and 2009 as private equity firms sought {{to take advantage of}} improved market conditions {{at the start of the}} year to realise investments. Exit activity however, has lost momentum following a peak of $113bn in the second quarter of 2011. TheCityUK estimates total exit activity of some $100bn in the first half of 2012, well down on the same period in the previous year.|$|E
