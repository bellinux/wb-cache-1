Such fish include T-Bar cichlids, Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel cichlids, Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys outgrow the convicts territorial issues will become a problem.)

[...] The {{police investigation}} found that the Stork Club did not discriminate against Josephine Baker. The NAACP {{went on to say}} that the results of the police investigation did not provide enough evidence for the organization to pursue the incident further in criminal court. Baker filed suit against Winchell over the matter, but the suit was dismissed in 1955. Walter Winchell later said. [...] "The Stork Club discriminates against everybody. White, black and pink.

2500|$|Trần Thủ Độ {{was also}} an honest {{mandarin}} who never profited his high position {{for the benefit of}} his family. It was said that one time the Emperor wanted to appointed Trần Thủ Độ's elder brother Trần An Quốc for the position of grand chancellor. Trần Thủ Độ politely declined the Emperor's request by an answer: [...] "An Quốc is my brother, if he is better than me then I had better retire from the position, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty think that I am better than him, so please not appoint him for grand chancellor. Because if we hold the same position then what royal court will become?". For his dedication, the Emperor personally redacted an epitaph for Trần Thủ Độ in his tomb. However, Trần Thủ Độ still remains as a controversial figure in History of Vietnam for his ruthless decisions against members of Lý royal family and his responsibility in the forced marriage between Trần Thái Tông and his brother Trần Liễu's wife, which was highly criticized by feudal historians. Sometimes, his Machiavellian figure was compared with Dorgon, the powerful general who helped establish the Qing Dynasty's rule in China, or Cardinal Mazarin who was chief minister of France for 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|After much {{personal}} {{struggle and}} a turbulent on-off engagement, he married the Chilean-born American actress Felicia Cohn Montealegre on September 10, 1951. One {{suggestion is that}} he chose to marry partly to dispel rumors about his private life to help secure a major conducting appointment, following advice from his mentor Dimitri Mitropoulos about the conservative nature of orchestra boards. In a book released in October 2013, The Leonard Bernstein Letters, his wife reveals his homosexuality. Felicia writes: [...] "you are a homosexual and may never change—you don’t admit {{to the possibility of}} a double life, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>your</b> peace of mind, your health, your whole nervous system depend on a certain sexual pattern what can you do?" [...] Arthur Laurents (Bernstein's collaborator in West Side Story) said that Bernstein was [...] "a gay man who got married. He wasn't conflicted about it at all. He was just gay." [...] Shirley Rhoades Perle, another friend of Bernstein, said that she thought [...] "he required men sexually and women emotionally." [...] But the early years of his marriage seem to have been happy, and no one has suggested Bernstein and his wife didn't love each other. They had three children, Jamie, Alexander, and later Nina. There are reports, though, that Bernstein did sometimes have brief extramarital liaisons with young men, which several family friends have said his wife knew about.|$|E
