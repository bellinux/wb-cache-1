She did not give serious thought to the performing arts {{until the age of}} 18. After winning a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama— where her contemporaries included Shirley Henderson, Maggie O'Neill and Niamh Cusack— Lancashire realised that she enjoyed acting. She graduated in 1986, describing her time as a student there as [...] "tremendous" [...] but [...] "seriously hard work and quite intimidating". After rejection from several repertory theatre companies, Lancashire was given her first acting role by Howard Lloyd-Lewis, artistic director of the Manchester Library Theatre Company, which provided her with an Equity Card. Lancashire performed two plays with the company, Pacific Overtures and The Beauty Game, which she states formed [...] "the start of my career as an actor". She found her first professional acting experience [...] "terrifying" [...] {{as a result of the}} live audiences, recalling that, [...] "because I wore a <b>bathing</b> <b>costume</b> in some of the scenes, I got heckled!" [...] She also realised that taking risks or underperforming could have had consequences for her acting career. Her role as Denise in The Beauty Game earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Australians {{generally}} have a relaxed attitude to what beachgoers wear, although {{this has not}} always been the case. At the start of the twentieth century a proposed ordinance in Sydney would have forced men to wear skirts over their [...] "bathing costume" [...] to be decent. This led to the 1907 Sydney <b>bathing</b> <b>costume</b> protests which resulted in the proposal being dropped. In 1961, Bondi inspector Aub Laidlaw, already known for kicking women off the beach for wearing bikinis, arrested several men wearing swim briefs charging them with indecency. The judge found the men not guilty because no pubic hair was exposed. As time went on Australians' attitudes to swimwear became much more relaxed. Over time swim briefs, better known locally as speedos or more recently as budgy smugglers, became an iconic swimwear for Australian males.|$|E
