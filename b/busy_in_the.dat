Bullock made his loan permanent and signed an 18-month contract, and David Brown signed after impressing on a trial. Five players also left Valley Parade on loan deals during January, with Craig Bentham joining Farsley Celtic, Luke Medley joining Cambridge City, Sean Taylforth and Luke Morgan both going to Droylsden, and Simon Ainge joining Halifax Town. Goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts was also expected to leave but his transfer to Queens Park Rangers collapsed after the Home Office rejected his application for a work permit.|$|E
5|$|The Command {{was kept}} <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1940s. Units {{were sent to}} the Middle East and Palestine as part of an air {{policing}} policy, in co-operation with the Israeli Air Force and Egyptian Air Force to prevent conflict between the two countries owing to the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. While there, they undertook a major operation, Operation Bobcat, to prevent illegal Jewish migrants coming into Palestine. In May 1948 the variety of aircraft was reduced despite increasing demand for operations. In May, Palestinians began attacking British military installations throughout the region. In the largest British post-war action, Operation Dawn (13 to 14 May 1948) was launched with the support of Coastal Command.|$|E
5|$|The Marathas marched {{beyond the}} Indus as their empire grew. The {{responsibility}} {{for managing the}} sprawling Maratha empire in the north was entrusted to two Maratha leaders, Shinde and Holkar, as the Peshwa was <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south. The two leaders did not act in concert, and their policies were influenced by personal interests and financial demands. They alienated other Hindu rulers such as the Rajputs, the Jats, and the Rohillas, and they failed to diplomatically win over other Muslim leaders. A large blow to the Marathas came in their defeat on 14 January 1761 at Panipat against the Afghan Ahmad Shah Abdali. An entire generation of Maratha leaders lay dead on the battlefield {{as a result of}} that conflict. However, between 1761 and 1773, the Marathas regained the lost ground in the north.|$|E

5|$|At 9a.m. on 11 November, Whitlam, {{together}} with {{deputy prime minister}} Frank Crean and Leader of the House Fred Daly, met with the Liberal and Country party leaders. No compromise could be reached. Whitlam informed the Coalition leaders {{that he would be}} advising Kerr to hold a half-Senate election on 13December, and he would not be seeking interim supply for the period before the election. Thinking it unlikely that Kerr would grant the election without supply, Fraser warned Whitlam that the Governor-General might make up his own mind about the matter. Whitlam was dismissive and after the meeting broke, telephoned Kerr to tell him that he needed an appointment to advise him to hold a half-Senate election. Both men were <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, Kerr with Remembrance Day commemorations, and Whitlam with a caucus meeting and a censure motion in the House which the Opposition had submitted. The two discussed a meeting for 1:00p.m., though Kerr's office later called Whitlam's and confirmed the time as 12:45. Word of this change did not reach the Prime Minister. Whitlam announced the request for a half-Senate election to his caucus, which approved it.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often stayed at home. If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. The ideal of the chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it. This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E

25|$|In 1669, Owen wrote a {{spirited}} remonstrance to the Congregationalists in New England, who, {{under the influence}} of Presbyterianism, had shown themselves persecutors. At home, too, he was <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same cause. In 1670 Samuel Parker's Ecclesiastical Polity attacked the Nonconformists with clumsy intolerance. Owen answered him (Truth and Innocence Vindicated); Parker replied offensively. Then Andrew Marvell finally disposed of Parker with banter and satire in The Rehearsal Transposed. Owen himself produced a tract On the Trinity (1669), and Christian Love and Peace (1672).|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Nur ad-Din was <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north, {{fighting}} the Ortoqids, and in 1170 {{he had to}} settle a dispute between his nephews when his brother Qutb ad-Din died. After conquering Egypt, Nur ad-Din believed that he had accomplished his goal of uniting the Muslim states, but Saladin {{did not wish to}} be subject to his authority. He did not participate in the invasions led by Nur ad-Din against Jerusalem in 1171 and 1173, hoping that the crusader kingdom would act as a buffer state between Egypt and Syria. Nur ad-Din realized that he had created a dangerous opponent in Saladin, and the two rulers assembled their armies for what seemed to be the inevitable war.|$|E

Stoke made a steady start to the 2012–13 season despite a tough opening set of fixtures. Pulis has stated {{that he would like to}} see out the remainder of his managerial career at Stoke and that he is starting to change his side's style of play. Stoke went on a ten match unbeaten run from 10 November to 29 December conceding just seven goals in the process, giving Stoke one of the best defensive records in Europe up to that point.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems that}} Cortina was most active in 1896–1898, during {{the run-up to}} the Spanish–American War. <b>Busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hispanic New York {{community}} and contributing to a daily Las Novedades, he tried to confront the anti-Spanish frenzy of American press and complained about lack of assistance on part of Madrid, the charges which thanks to Vázquez de Mella reached the Cortes and the government in 1896. Following a visit in Spain, starting 1897 Cortina changed the tone of his press endeavors; he switched to advertising the claims of Carlos VII. Thanks to his efforts few US periodicals, including New York Herald, published pieces on Carlism. Some quoted Cortina say that 100,000 volunteers waited for an order to rise and that by January 1, 1898, Don Carlos would assume the throne, though also that the claimant would do nothing which might impair international standing of his country.|$|E

For some years after this, he was <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of sacred music, odes addressed to the king and royal family, and other similar works. In 1685, he wrote two of his finest anthems, I was glad and My heart is inditing, for the coronation of King James II. In 1690 he composed a setting of the birthday ode for Queen Mary, Arise, my muse and four years later wrote one of his most elaborate, important and magnificent works – a setting for another birthday ode for the Queen, written by Nahum Tate, entitled Come Ye Sons of Art.|$|E
500|$|During the day, {{the flames}} {{began to move}} eastward from the {{neighbourhood}} of Pudding Lane, straight against the prevailing east wind and towards Pepys's home on Seething Lane and the Tower of London with its gunpowder stores. The garrison at the Tower took {{matters into their own}} hands after waiting all day for requested help from James's official firemen who were <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west. They created firebreaks by blowing up houses on a large scale in the vicinity, halting the advance of the fire. In a letter to William Coventry, Pepys wrote that he [...] "saw how horribly the sky looks, all on a fire in the night, was [...] enough to put us out of our wits; and, indeed, it was extremely dreadful, for it looks just as if it was at us, and the whole heaven on fire." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly ran most Mint {{operations}} under Scobey and his successor, Robert J. Grant. Although the Mint Bureau {{was very}} <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> booming {{economy of the}} 1920s, numismatic historian Roger Burdette points out that there were flaws in operations—for example, Philadelphia Mint officials, instead of setting aside gold coins from each batch delivered for inspecting and testing by the annual Assay Commission, took all assay coins from a bag set aside {{at the start of}} the year, increasing the likelihood that nonstandard coins would go undetected. O'Reilly did keep a close eye on coinage operations, warning the San Francisco Mint in November 1931 that it had produced fewer than 200,000 nickels, a figure that if allowed to stand would have resulted in the issue being hoarded by collectors. [...] She directed the mint to strike nothing but nickels for the remainder of the year, resulting in a total mintage for the 1931–S of 1,200,000, still the second-lowest by date and mint mark in the Buffalo nickel series.|$|E

500|$|When the French and Indian War {{came to an}} end in 1763 the British {{government}} {{sought to}} recover the costs of posting troops in the colonies by imposing taxes on the colonies. [...] Cushing was an early opponent of these taxes, couching his opposition in economic terms, a reflection on his livelihood as a merchant. [...] An astute observer of the trade ties binding the various parts of the British Empire, he wrote in 1763 that extant high duties on molasses (payment of which was widely flouted by New England merchants) would have significantly harmed the economies of Britain, North America, and the West Indies, in part by diverting significant quantities of scarce hard currency to those duties.

500|$|The {{regional}} {{commander of}} the Parliamentarian forces, Colonel Edward Massey, was ordered to relieve Taunton in June, but he could only raise 3,000 men; far less than was needed to dispel Goring's army. The New Model Army, with Fairfax at their head, were <b>busy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Midlands defeating {{the bulk of the}} Royalist army at the Battle of Naseby, described by modern sources as [...] "the decisive clash of the English Civil War". Goring had been ordered by the King to abandon his siege and join the Royalist forces at Naseby, and it has been suggested by modern historians that with his forces, and his leadership, the Royalists might have won the battle. Immediately after securing that victory, Fairfax led his army down towards Taunton once again. Aware of the approaching army, Lord Goring mounted a final assault on the town, hoping to catch Blake unaware by sending his cavalry towards the town on 9 July. The attack was neutralised by a section of Fairfax's army in Ilminster, and Goring withdrew from Taunton to meet Fairfax at the Battle of Langport, relieving the third and final siege of Taunton during the English Civil War.|$|E

Madonna admitted that she did not have any material for the film and Lars explained that Marshall wanted only a ballad.
