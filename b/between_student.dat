5|$|This act {{introduced}} the 11+ examination {{to determine if}} a child should be eligible for a grammar school, secondary modern or technical college, under the Tripartite System, but has since been phased out across the majority of the United Kingdom, with just several boroughs in England and Northern Ireland still using it. League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools; data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division <b>between</b> <b>student</b> attainment in grammar schools compared to comprehensive schools.|$|E

25|$|In regards, to education, caring {{refers to}} the {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and teacher, not just the person who cares. As educators respond {{to the needs of}} students, teachers may see the need to design a differentiated curriculum because as teachers work closely with students, we will be moved by their different needs and interests. The claim to care must not be based on a one time virtuous decision but an ongoing interest in the student’s welfare.|$|E
25|$|More than 100 student {{clubs and}} organisations {{operate on the}} {{university}} campus. These include numerous student government, service providers, and service organisations. The most prominent amongst these are the Student Parliament, Student Representative Council, and Constitutional Tribunal (Student Court). The Student Parliament is the plenary body of student governance and determines the wider mandate for student governance. The Student Representative Council (SRC) is the executive body of student governance and subsequently charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. The SRC is the residential student government, specialising in programming, policy, and facilities and services. Societies are registered in the following categories as catering for religious, political, social, cultural, academic and other. The Constitutional Tribunal is the judicial body of student governance and adjudicates disputes primarily <b>between</b> <b>student</b> organisations. Its judges sit on the panel of student disciplinary hearings. The various service providers are the university’s primary programming organisations, serving as a centre of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life.|$|E

2500|$|In the Slovak {{republic}} {{the content}} of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to [...] "Nature science" [...] in English (this course covers both biology and petrology). Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and {{is dependent on the}} teacher's knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|In the Stanford prison study, by Philip Zimbardo, a {{simulated}} exercise <b>between</b> <b>student</b> prisoners and guards showed how far people would follow an adopted role. In {{just a few}} days, the [...] "guards" [...] became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant. This was initially argued {{to be an important}} demonstration {{of the power of the}} immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits. However, to this day, it remains a matter of contention what conclusions may be drawn from this study. For example, it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behaviour, and that the participants' personality influenced their reactions in a variety of ways, including how long they chose to remain in the study. One of the most concerted empirical revisitations of the themes raised by Zimbardo came with the 2002 BBC prison study.|$|E
