50|$|The tuning pegs (Luk-bid) {{face the}} same {{direction}} as the Thuan Saw. They are wooden or ivory cylindrical shape. The low pitch string is attached to the upper peg while the high pitch string is attached to the <b>bottom</b> <b>peg.</b> Like the violins, the pegs are twisted to tune to the strings.|$|E
50|$|As per {{previous}} years' competitions, {{the playing}} field is 27-feet wide by 54-feet long. The floor consists of gray carpet. On each end of the field, there are scoring grids immediately in front of the alliance stations, where robots are remotely controlled by drivers. Each alliance station is protected by a wall, known as the alliance wall. On each alliance wall, there are two scoring grids. Each scoring grid has 9 pegs arranged like a square. Each row is 37 inches above the next, except on the outside columns in each grid, where the <b>bottom</b> <b>peg</b> is only 30 inches above the ground.|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{multiples}} are {{a serious}} hindrance to hydrocarbon exploration in Australia. In particular, water bottom multiples {{can be very}} difficult to attenuate. This is because there often exists a strongly reflective sea floor which gives multiples large amplitudes when compared with the primary events they overlay, and secondly, because of a widely occurring velocity inversion, which seriously reduces the effectiveness of a very important class of multiple attenuation techniques. Multiple attenuation techniques can be classified according to the characteristic of the data which is used to discriminate against the multiples in conjunction with the operation behind the demultiple process. Common multiple attenuation processes include FK demultiple, Radon Demultiple, predictive deconvolution, wave equation based demultiple procedures and the family of techniques which come under the umbrella of Surface Multiple Attenuation (SMA). All of these techniques, given the right conditions, can be very effective. They also vary in price from very cheap (FK demultiple) through to expensive (wave equation based demultiple procedures). However, despite these procedures, and fifty odd years of research, there is no effective general solution to multiple problems off the coast of Western Australia and indeed in many regions around the world. Two new wavefield transformations, Multiple MoveOut (MMO) and IsoStretch Radial Trace (ISR), have been developed in this research to precondition data prior to the removal of surface related multiples by existing techniques. These form the basis of a new multiple attenuating procedure. MMO shifts the data so that the water bottom primary event is flattened and the simple water bottom multiples are also flat and periodic. Water <b>bottom</b> <b>peg</b> leg multiples are made approximately periodic. To solve the stretch problem introduced by the MMO transform, ISR ++interpolates oblique traces of constant stretch, which also map constant shot emergence angles. The water bottom primary and multiple events form a stationary time series after MMO and ISR. They are then amenable to removal by autoconvolution and predictive deconvolution. The results of the new procedure are demonstrated on two case studies from offshore Western Australia. It is shown to be more effective at removing both simple and peg leg water bottom multiples than traditional techniques. Finally, it is an inexpensive procedure, which does not require velocity analysis prior to its application...|$|E
5000|$|Bonus Bonanza and Flamingo Fortune both renamed {{this game}} Freefall (not to be {{confused}} with the game [...] "Freefall" [...] mentioned below when IIR became Luckiest). This was because there was no pegs in between the swinging paddles and the <b>bottom</b> set of <b>pegs</b> above the slots. Thus, the ping pong ball took a freefall towards the slots. The payout was the same.|$|R
50|$|Arará {{music is}} {{characterized}} by particular percussive styles, including drumming, hand clapping and body percussion. Instruments include the ogan (an iron bell) which may be replaced with a guataca (hoe blade), cachimbo (smallest drum, highest pitch), mula (medium drum), and caja (largest drum, lowest pitch). The drums are single-headed and closed on the <b>bottom,</b> tuned with <b>pegs.</b> Other names for these drums are also used {{in some parts of}} Cuba, such as hungan for the caja. The lead is played with a stick and a hand, while the others are played with pairs of sticks by seated players.|$|R
60|$|As we {{approached}} the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast crowd of the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts, among which we could only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We were much surprised at perceiving that, {{with one or two}} exceptions, these new comers were entirely naked, and skins being used only by the men of the canoes. All the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter, for there was no appearance of any among the villagers. There were a great many women and children, the former not altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. They were straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of carriage not to be found in civilized society. Their lips, however, like those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that, even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed. Their hair was of a finer texture than that of the males. Among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed, like the party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed with lances and heavy clubs. These appeared to have great influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title Wampoo. These, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces. That of Too-wit was situated in the centre of the village, and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of its kind. The tree which formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root, and there were several branches left just below the cut, these serving to extend the covering, and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk. The covering, too, which consisted of four very large skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was secured at the <b>bottom</b> with <b>pegs</b> driven through it and into the ground. The floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{efficiency}} of an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) for purification of nanometer-sized bioparticles, plasmid DNA (pDNA), was studied. Polymer-salt ATPS consisting of polyethylenglycol (PEG) -K 2 HPO 4 {{was used for the}} purification of 7 kb and 14 kb plasmid vectors. PEG- 300 and PEG- 1450 were applied to investigate the influence of different molecular mass of PEGon partitioning behavior of pDNA. The Taguchi design of experiments has been applied in order to optimize the significant system characteristics including PEG/salt ratio, temperature, lysate mass fraction and size of plasmid for pDNA separation by using ATPS. The results indicated that PEG/salt ratio has a considerable contribution on pDNA recovery both in the presence of PEG- 300 and PEG- 1450. It is also obtained that the size of pDNA in the range of 7 kb to 14 kb is not a significant factor on its partitioning. Furthermore, pDNA is easily partitioned to polymer-rich top phase in PEG 300 /salt system; and in salt-rich <b>bottom</b> phase in <b>PEG</b> 1450 /salt system. Under optimum conditions, pDNA was extracted in top phase of PEG- 300 /K 2 HPO 4 with mass percent of 26 : 17 at 25 °C with a recovery percent of 85...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{recently}} reported phenomenon that {{red blood cells}} (RBC) from Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and normal individuals, which have identical electrophoretic mobilities (EPM) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), have different EPM in appropriately selected polymer solutions, has been further explored. Of a number of in vitro treatments to which AD and normal RBC were subjected prior to EPM measurements in bottom phase (from a dextran-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) aqueous phase system) only trypsin eliminated the difference. Thus, the differential polymer interaction between AD and normal RBC, {{thought to be the}} basis for their dissimilar EPM, can be abolished by appropriate proteolytic modification of the cell surfaces and suggests protein as a source of difference. Because young and old RBC from normal individuals, which have the same EPM in PBS, have different EPM in certain polymer solutions, and the RBC from AD patients have been reported to age abnormally, we also compared the young and old RBC subpopulations from these two sources. By the criterion of cell electrophoresis in polymer solutions the differences between AD and normal RBC and between young and old RBC are distinct. The EPM of AD and normal RBC differ in <b>bottom</b> phase or <b>PEG</b> but not in dextran solution; while the EPM of young and old RBC differ predominantly in dextran. We speculate that since the observed difference in EPM of RBC from AD patients and normals depends on protein(s) yet is anticoagulant-related (being obtained only when blood is collected in citrate or oxalate) it might be the result of an interaction (Ca 2 +-mediated?) between the surfaces of these cells and protein component(s) of their respective, compositionally differing sera...|$|R
