5|$|In 1869 reformers again left Baith Israel, and, joining with dissenters from Kahal Kodesh Beth Elohim of Williamsburg, founded Temple Israel. Though many reformers {{had left}} the congregation, several reforms in the service were {{nonetheless}} introduced: the congregation abolished most piyyutim and the Priestly Blessing, and, in 1873, introduced a confirmation ceremony for girls, led by the Reverend Dr. Tinter. The confirmation ceremonies, which had initially been held during the holiday of Sukkot, were eventually moved to the holiday of Shavuot (the holiday during which the Reform movement held these ceremonies), and continued for both <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> (<b>in</b> place of Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations) until the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{different}} approaches to co-educational Scouting. Countries such as the United States have maintained separate Scouting organizations for <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls.</b> <b>In</b> other countries, especially within Europe, Scouting and Guiding have merged, {{and there is a}} single organization for boys and girls, which is a member of both the WOSM and the WAGGGS. In others, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls, but is only a member of the WOSM, while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS. In some countries like Greece, Slovenia and Spain there are separate associations of Scouts (members of WOSM) and guides (members of WAGGGS), both admitting boys and girls.|$|E

25|$|The Bahá'í International Community has, however, {{stated that}} the Bahá'í {{community}} in Iran {{was the victim of}} the Shah's regime, and that SAVAK {{was one of the main}} ways of persecuting the Bahá'ís. For example, Reza Shah’s government ordered the closure of Bahá'í schools, such as Tehran’s Tarbiyat school for <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls,</b> <b>in</b> 1934. Also during the month of Ramadan in 1955, when the Shah’s government needed to distract the general population from its decision to join the Baghdad Pact under pressure from the British and American governments, it sought the support of the clerics. Ayatollah Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi, acting as the Marja Taqlid, a Grand Ayatollah with the authority to make legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law, pushed the Shah's government to support the persecution of the Bahá'í community.|$|E

It was situated on Glanmor Hill in Uplands in wooden ex-army buildings. It had a status between secondary and elementary until 1930, {{when it was}} defined as {{a secondary}} school. The buildings were requisitioned for the US army during the Second World War, and the boys' school closed in 1941. The girls' school continued as a grammar school until 1972. When the presence of high alumina cement in support structures of other Swansea schools caused their closure in 1974, its buildings were re-used by Olchfa Comprehensive School for two years. The site was cleared in August 1989 and replaced with housing, with the new streets named after some of the school's houses.|$|E

25|$|After Slovak {{students}} {{started moving}} to nearby Sobrance {{and the number}} of classes was reduced from 19 to 16 by April 1939, teaching in at the school year was interrupted again. When Hungarian troops invaded Slovakia on March 23, 1939 and the subsequent Slovak–Hungarian War, Slovak troops occupied the school and returned Slovak language to the curriculum. This education highlighted growing Slovak national consciousness and nationalism. At this time the Head teacher was also the government commissioner of Michalovce and later the leader of the Hlinka Youth (Slovak paramilitary scout movement, modeled after the Hitler Youth). In school year 1939/40 that organization counted 118 of the schools students. Two years later the count was 590 <b>boys</b> <b>and</b> <b>girls.</b> <b>In</b> 1944 it was 694 students out of a total 875. Influenced in part by the ideas of Slovak nationalist Andrej Hlinka, Catholicism became {{an important part of the}} school year, the year began with worship of Veni Sancte Spiritus, a school celebration, ending a solemn Te Deum. During the closing phase of World War II, the school became a military hospital for the Wehrmacht, and after November 1944, for the Red Army.|$|E
