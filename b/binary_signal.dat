25|$|In {{the early}} days of BCI research, another {{substantial}} barrier to using EEG as a brain–computer interface was the extensive training required before users can work the technology. For example, in experiments beginning in the mid-1990s, Niels Birbaumer at the University of Tübingen in Germany trained severely paralysed people to self-regulate the slow cortical potentials in their EEG {{to such an extent that}} these signals could be used as a <b>binary</b> <b>signal</b> to control a computer cursor. (Birbaumer had earlier trained epileptics to prevent impending fits by controlling this low voltage wave.) The experiment saw ten patients trained to move a computer cursor by controlling their brainwaves. The process was slow, requiring more than an hour for patients to write 100 characters with the cursor, while training often took many months. However, the slow cortical potential approach to BCIs has not been used in several years, since other approaches require little or no training, are faster and more accurate, and work for a greater proportion of users.|$|E

2500|$|Colloquial {{usage of}} the term 'PSK31' in amateur radio usually implies {{the use of the}} most {{commonly}} used variant of PSK31: binary phase shift keying (BPSK). [...] BPSK uses no error control, but an allied mode, QPSK31 quadrature phase shift keying, uses four phases instead of two, to provide a degree of forward error correction. [...] It is simple to switch from BPSK to QPSK if difficulties arise during a contact. [...] When QPSK is used; after encoding into varicode, the <b>binary</b> <b>signal</b> is further transformed into a quaternary set of phase shifts. [...] A sliding window of five bits is used to select one of the four possible phase shifts, providing a means of error correction by spreading each bit of data across adjacent bits. [...] Successful decoding of an input bit requires a large number of phase shift sequences to be received, causing a 20-bit, 640-millisecond latency (delay) in the output of the decoder.|$|E
