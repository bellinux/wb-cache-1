According to International Permanent Social Building Committee social housing consists in supply houses with fixed minimum standard {{of comfort and}} equipment, for rent or sale for persons {{who can not afford}} a house at market price without assistance of state or social organizations. In Poland Social <b>Building</b> <b>Societies</b> can not supply houses for sale but only for rent. State assistance in supplying houses for rent consists in establishing purposeful fund and providing it with financial means to allow credits on preferential conditions. National Housing Fund allows Social <b>Building</b> <b>Societies</b> large, cheap and long term credits, bearing interest at a half rediscount rate in NBP but not lower then 4, 5 %. Social <b>Building</b> <b>Societies</b> solve housing shortage problem by transformation of existing housing needs in demand, anticipating average households future incomes to pay off credit during almost 30 years. Social <b>Building</b> <b>Societies</b> are like a hybrid, because they have to fulfil social mission as well as maximise financial profit from their activity. Construction of Social <b>Building</b> <b>Societies</b> lead to creation of a closed market on which Social <b>Building</b> <b>Societies</b> play on demand side on building market as well as on supply side on housing market.

The study proceeds by analysing negotiations between the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and state authorities, such as the Treasury, the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies and the Board of Trade. These discussions eventually resulted in a change in the audit procedure applied to <b>building</b> <b>societies</b> (as documented in the <b>Building</b> <b>Societies</b> Act 1960).
