5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of writing}} an autobiography, {{and he began}} {{granting}} interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude toward women. There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E
5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> about {{what might have happened}} to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E
5|$|Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books {{solicited}} author Margaret Atwood {{to write}} a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages {{as part of an}} international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> about the Odyssey. She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help address it with this project.|$|E

5|$|She {{began writing}} songs and {{recording}} demos, {{but after a}} few months, all the demos she had sent to record companies around the UK were returned with negative replies. She <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> about moving to another country, and initially considered moving to the Netherlands, but later decided on France. In 1996, her international career began to advance; she was introduced to producer Erick Benzi, who previously had worked with Celine Dion, Jean-Jacques Goldman and Johnny Hallyday. Impressed by Anggun's talent, Benzi immediately offered her a recording deal. Later that year, Anggun was signed to Columbia France and Sony Music Entertainment. After a brief French course at Alliance Fran√ßaise, Anggun began working on her debut album with Benzi, alongside Jacques Veneruso, Gildas Arzel and Nikki Matheson.|$|E
5|$|In April 1962, McGovern {{announced}} he would run for election to South Dakota's other Senate seat, intending to face incumbent Republican Francis H. Case. Case died in June, however, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former Lieutenant Governor Joseph H. Bottum. Much of the campaign revolved around policies of the Kennedy administration and its New Frontier; Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat. McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the Farmers Union. Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign. (During this hospitalization, McGovern read Theodore H. White's classic The Making of the President, 1960 {{and for the first}} time <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> about running for the office someday.) Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may have preserved his chance of winning. The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern's 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years and only the third since statehood in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea behind Slackers first occurred in 1990. Along with some friends, Kurt Jellinek and Paul Zacharias {{went to a}} Don Henley concert, and <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> about owning their own music store. At the time, the two were undergraduate students, and decided to focus their studies on business management and becoming entrepreneurs. Slackers CDs and Games was officially founded in 1993, by Jellinek and Zacharias, in Columbia, Missouri. Jellinek and Zacharias opened the store after graduating from Saint Louis University, using only their own collection of 1,500 music CDs. The name originated from their generation being considered slackers before being {{given a chance to}} prove otherwise. Although business was slow at first, with the store sometimes only making US$30 in a day, business eventually increased. After 2years they were able to open a second location in O'Fallon, Illinois. As of 2009, there are 10 locations in the states of Missouri and Illinois, eight of which are in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, and two of which are in Mid-Missouri.|$|E

5|$|The third {{series of}} Cold Feet (2000) was {{extended}} {{from six to}} eight episodes by ITV. Bullen believed that the production team had covered all potential storylines {{in the first two}} series, so declined to write any more episodes. A team of five writers was hired by Granada Television, overseen by Bullen as a co-executive producer. Four out of the five writers left the team due to their scripts not being appropriate for the series, leaving only David Nicholls on staff. The writing process had made Bullen think twice about not writing and he <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> about further storylines, such as mid-life crises and IVF. The same year, he signed a two-year contract with Granada to develop new projects. A fourth series of Cold Feet, also of eight episodes, was commissioned for 2001. Bullen announced {{that he did not want}} to write a fifth series, and that the fourth would be the last. His reasons were that with ITV's proposed commission of up to 20 episodes a year, the series would become like a soap opera. The popularity of the fourth series persuaded Bullen to write four more episodes that formed the fifth series in 2003. The fifth series won Bullen the Writer of the Year Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Johnson <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{life after}} {{basketball}} while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through his movie theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E

It is about letting go of a concept ‚Äì almost impossible to relinquish ‚Äì that teaching and learning are transparent entities: understandable, limitable, predictable, something we can and do know about. Thinking about the event is thinking about what actually happens, not what we think should or ought to happen in our classrooms...|$|R

Rather than think of each maturity (a ten-year bond, a five-year, etc.) as a separate marketplace, they began drawing a curve through all their yields.

Fisher <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> of a better means of testing cars before delivering them to consumers. At the time, racing was just getting started on horse tracks and public roads. Fisher noticed how dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing. He also argued that spectators did not get their money's worth, as they were only able to get a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{that decade}} the church congregations <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> of {{expanding}} again. The Presbyterians needed a larger building. They sold their building to the new Trinity Episcopal Church, who had split from nearby St. Paul's over differences of opinion on the war. The lot at the Maple Place intersection was ideal for their new building designed by Isaac Perry, later New York's state architect. The stone-trimmed brick structure has design features common to Perry's other churches, all designed during this period, and in particular with the First Congregational Church in Binghamton, where he opened an office in 1872, two years after finishing his Ossining church.|$|E
25|$|Genealogy of Grigoriy Zhukovsky, Odessa citizen, {{attributed}} to the poet Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky (1783-1852). The verses and fairy-tale of this poet were included in school program in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and could be earlier and up today. Also biography of Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky the pupils had to know. As per Soviet school program from the 1950s and up to {{second part of the}} 1980s or beginning of the 1990s the father of this poet was the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky (died in 1817) and as per legend his father was the landlord Afanasiy Ivanovich Bunin (1716‚Äî1791) and the mother was the captive Turkish girl Salha, she was named by Christian name Yelizaveta Dementiyevna Tutchaninova. Their illegitimate boy, as per legend, was adopted by the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky and named Vasiliy Andreyevich Zhukovsky. Turkey joined the NATO in 1952 and in the 1960s or earlier the NATO was able to watch and listen to the Northern part of the Black Sea, including Odessa. It is why Turkish girl Salha was included in the legend. The landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky, the father of poet, had Polish family name Zhukovsky and the landlords with this family name left in the Eastern Prussia before Swedish and then German invasion in the Eastern Prussia. It is why Soviet Intelligence wished to present Zhukovsky family in Odessa as representatives of Prussian Zhukovsky family branch. To avoid any person of Zhukovsky family in Odessa <b>began</b> <b>thinking</b> about the Royal title, the legend of the Bunin family was introduced. And it was done successfully. During the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev this legend was presented as the correct version to stop this Intelligence activity.|$|E
