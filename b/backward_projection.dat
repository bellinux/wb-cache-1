40|$|The {{development}} of computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction methods that significantly reduce patient radiation exposure while maintaining high image quality {{is an important}} area of research in low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging. We propose a new penalized weighted least squares (PWLS) reconstruction method that exploits regularization based on an efficient Union of Learned TRAnsforms (PWLS-ULTRA). The union of square transforms is pre-learned from numerous image patches extracted from a dataset of CT images or volumes. The proposed PWLS-based cost function is optimized by alternating between an image update step, and a sparse coding and clustering step. The CT image update step is accelerated by a relaxed linearized augmented Lagrangian method with ordered-subsets that reduces the number of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>projections.</b> Simulations with 2 D and 3 D axial CT scans of the XCAT phantom and 3 D helical chest scans show that for low-dose levels, the proposed method significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images compared to PWLS reconstruction with a nonadaptive edge-preserving regularizer (PWLS-EP). PWLS with regularization based on a union of learned transforms leads to better image reconstructions than using a single learned square transform or a learned overcomplete synthesis dictionary.

Most of the existing historical reconstructions have insufficient spatial and thematic detail and do not consider various land change types. In this context, this paper explored the possibility of using a cellular automata-Markov model in 90 m × 90 m spatial resolution to reconstruct historical land use in the 1930 s in Zhenlai County, China.

40|$|The basic {{structure}} of the cortico-hippocampal system is highly conserved across mammalian species. Comparatively few hippocampal neurons can represent and address a multitude of cortical patterns, establish associations between cortical patterns and consolidate these associations in the cortex. In this study, we investigate how elementary anatomical properties in the cortex-hippocampus loop along with synaptic plasticity contribute to these functions. Specifically, {{we focus on the}} high degree of connectivity between cortex and hippocampus leading to converging and diverging forward and <b>backward</b> <b>projections</b> and heterogenous synaptic transmission delays that result from the detached location of the hippocampus and its multiple loops. We found that in a model incorporating these concepts, each cortical pattern can evoke a unique spatio-temporal spiking pattern in hippocampal neurons. This hippocampal response facilitates a reliable disambiguation of learned associations and a bridging of a time interval larger than the time window of spike-timing dependent plasticity in the cortex. Moreover, we found that repeated retrieval of a stored association leads to a compression of the interval between cue presentation and retrieval of the associated pattern from the cortex. Neither a high degree of connectivity nor heterogenous synaptic delays alone is sufficient for this behavior. We conclude that basic anatomical properties between cortex and hippocampus implement mechanisms for representing and consolidating temporal information.

By injecting a grid of ibotenic acid, we unilaterally lesioned the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, which provides massive direct and indirect <b>backward</b> <b>projections</b> ipsilaterally to the inferotemporal cortex. After the lesion, the monkeys fixated the cue stimulus normally, relearned the preoperatively learned set (set A), and learned a new set (set B) of paired associates.
