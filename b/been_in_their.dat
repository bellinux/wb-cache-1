He made an {{immediate}} impact, scoring 14 goals in 22 starts for the Under-18s in the 2004–05 season. His performances for the youth team also led to him playing five times for the reserves, for whom he scored once. He signed his first professional contract with Manchester United on 22 March 2006, and he was named as a substitute for Roy Keane's testimonial match at Old Trafford on 9 May 2006, in which he was a 75th minute replacement for Kieran Richardson. Later that summer, he scored his first goal for the club after coming on as a substitute for Wayne Rooney in a friendly against Macclesfield Town.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, the {{two characters}} attempt to coordinate an escape with their fellow people. A girl {{appears in a}} boat she constructed from wood used in the sand castle {{from the beginning of}} the story; this causes the tribe to abandon their original plans and instead attempt to float up the river. After expanding the boat, the group loads onto it and sets sail. Soon they join the remaining members of their tribe, who had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own smaller boat. After a night of drifting, while the others are still asleep, the man and woman spot land. When they reach it, the story ends with the man and woman, last to depart, going into the new wilderness to explore it, with the boat seen bobbing in the water. The final five frames of the comic, in which the boat is bobbing on the water, are currently rotating in an undetermined pattern for the comic on the xkcd website.|$|E
5|$|During Stalin's Great Purge in the late-1930s, {{which had}} not ended {{by the time of}} the German {{invasion}} on 22 June 1941, much of the officer corps of the Red Army was decimated and their replacements, appointed by Stalin for political reasons, often lacked military competence. Of the five Marshals of the Soviet Union appointed in 1935, only Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny survived Stalin's purge. Tukachevsky was killed in 1937. Fifteen of 16 army commanders, 50 of the 57 corps commanders, 154 of the 186 divisional commanders, and 401 of 456 colonels were killed, and many other officers were dismissed. In total, about 30,000 Red Army personnel were executed. Stalin further underscored his control by reasserting the role of political commissars at the divisional level and below to oversee the political loyalty of the army to the regime. The commissars held a position equal to that of the commander of the unit they were overseeing. But in spite of efforts to ensure the political subservience of the armed forces, in the wake of Red Army's poor performance in Poland and in the Winter War, about 80 percent of the officers dismissed during the Great Purge were reinstated by 1941. Also, between January 1939 and May 1941, 161 new divisions were activated. Therefore, although about 75 percent of all the officers had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> position for less than one year at the start of the German invasion of 1941, many of the short tenures can be attributed not only to the purge, but also to the rapid increase in creation of military units.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Gemini and Keck telescopes {{obtained}} {{spectra of}} Haumea which showed strong crystalline water ice features {{similar to the}} surface of Pluto's moon Charon. This is peculiar, because crystalline ice forms at temperatures above 110 K, whereas Haumea's surface temperature is below 50 K, a temperature at which amorphous ice is formed. In addition, the structure of crystalline ice is unstable under the constant rain of cosmic rays and energetic particles from the Sun that strike trans-Neptunian objects. The timescale for the crystalline ice to revert to amorphous ice under this bombardment is on the order of ten million years, yet trans-Neptunian objects have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> present cold-temperature locations for timescales of billions of years. Radiation damage should also redden and darken the surface of trans-Neptunian objects where the common surface materials of organic ices and tholin-like compounds are present, {{as is the case with}} Pluto. Therefore, the spectra and colour suggest Haumea and its family members have undergone recent resurfacing that produced fresh ice. However, no plausible resurfacing mechanism has been suggested.|$|E

25|$|It {{was another}} 150years before another European group {{recorded}} the Tunica.

While the Spanish had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> territory only for a short time, their encounter had devastating effects.

According to Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich, after the vehicle caught fire, the driver was injured and lost control. While performing a U-turn on the narrow road the bus caught fire and the cadets tried to escape the burning vehicle. The back door would not open due to the extreme heat but was eventually broken through, enabling some cadets to flee the burning bus; however, those who fled encountered the intense blaze outside.

The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea if the kids bring them a fish that has never <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of medical units within the Australian colonial forces {{had begun in}} the mid-1850s when the colonial military forces had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> infancy. Initially, it had been limited largely to single doctors who were attached to infantry units in an honorary role, but as the colonial military forces had become more sophisticated, various medical units or corps were formed, consisting {{of a variety of}} personnel including doctors, non-commissioned officers, orderlies, bearers, and dispensers as well as cooks and drivers. Within each colony, these units were tasked with various duties including conducting medical examinations of recruits, and providing emergency medical aid during field manoeuvres; initially, they were unpaid volunteers, but eventually a system of paid part-time soldiering developed. The reliance upon part-time professionals is a common theme in the corps' development, due largely the nature of the specialised skill sets required by some personnel, particularly doctors and surgeons; however, as the corps' role has expanded, it has become a broader organisation, with personnel serving in many capacities including professional and non professional roles including stretcher bearers, orderlies, medical assistants, pathologists, radiographers, pharmacists, drivers, physiotherapists, as well as the traditional domains of the medical officer, and in many of these areas, particularly after the Second World War there has been an expansion {{of the size of the}} corps' regular personnel, although Reservists continue to provide much of its higher clinically trained personnel.|$|E
25|$|PGA Tour players {{compete for}} two {{player of the}} year awards. The PGA Player of the Year award dates back to 1948 and is awarded by the PGA of America. Since 1982 the winner has been {{selected}} using a points system with points awarded for wins, money list position and scoring average. The PGA Tour Player of the Year award, also known as the Jack Nicklaus Trophy, is administered by the PGA Tour and was introduced in 1990; the recipient is selected by the tour players by ballot, although the results are not released other than to say who has won. More often than not the same player wins both awards; in fact, as seen in the table below, the PGA and PGA Tour Players of the Year have been the same every year from 1992 through 2016. The Rookie of the Year award was also introduced in 1990. Players are eligible in their first season of PGA Tour membership if they competed in less than seven events from any prior season. Several of the winners had a good deal of international success before their PGA Tour rookie season, and some have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> thirties when they won the award. In March 2012, a new award, the PGA Tour Courage Award, was introduced in replacement of the defunct Comeback Player of the Year award.|$|E

25|$|Most of Dalmatia {{was in the}} 7th century {{under the}} Avar Khaganate, a nomadic confederacy led by the Avars who subjugated {{surrounding}} Slavic tribes. In 614 the Avars and Slavs sacked and destroyed {{the capital of the}} province of Dalmatia, Salona, and retained direct control of the region for a few decades until they were driven out by the Croats. The earliest recorded Croatian leader, referred to by the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, was Porga. After their participation in Samo and Kubrat 's 632 defeat of the Avars, White Croats were either invited into Dalmatia by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius (r. 610-641) and allowed to settle there, or prevailing the Avars after that lengthy war the Croats migrated across the Sava from Pannonia Savia and settled Dalmatia on their own. In either case, a new wave of Avars retook Pannonia in 677 but only as far as the Sava and Danube. By the early 9th century, Croatia emerged as a political entity with a duke as head of the state, territorially in the basins of the rivers Cetina, Krka and Zrmanja. It was administered in 11 counties (županija). According to De Administrando Imperio, the Croats in Pannonia were subject to the Franks for several years, 'as they had formerly <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own country', until they rebelled and defeated the Franks after a seven-year war, but it is not known on which specific war and time span this refers to.|$|E
