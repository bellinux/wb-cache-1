5000|$|While the {{spelling}} of Dutch is officially standardised {{by an international}} organisation (the Dutch Language Union), the pronunciation has no official standard and relies on a de facto standard documented in reference works such as The Phonetics of English and Dutch by Beverley Collins and Inger M.

5000|$|Standard Dutch has {{two main}} de facto {{pronunciation}} standards: Northern and Belgian. Northern Standard Dutch {{is the most}} prestigious accent in the Netherlands. It is associated with high status, education and wealth. Even though its speakers seem to be concentrated in the provinces of North Holland, South Holland and Utrecht (especially in the Randstad), it cannot be considered a regional dialect. It is often impossible to tell where its speakers were born or brought up. <b>Belgian</b> <b>Standard</b> Dutch {{is used by the}} vast majority of Flemish journalists, which is why it is sometimes called VRT-Nederlands ("VRT Dutch"; formerly BRT-Nederlands [...] "BRT Dutch"), after VRT, the national public-service broadcaster for the Flemish Region.|$|E
50|$|German {{measurements}} (until 1920 {{the area}} belonged to Germany) indicated {{an altitude of}} 689 m (NN, German standard) at the nearby located measuring point, and a small higher area surrounded by the 690 meter altitude line. In 2007 the University of Liège executed measurements and found a height of 692 m (TAW, <b>Belgian</b> <b>standard).</b> The altitude meter of Google Earth caused some doubt about Signal de Botrange (694 m TAW) as Belgium's highest point because its vertical reference EGM96 deviates a couple of meters from the German Normalnull and the Belgian TAW, thereby suggesting an altitude of 701 m for the Weißer Stein. An accurate control by the Belgian National Geographic Institute in 2010 showed the Weißer Stein to be at maximum 693.3 m TAW (=691 m NN), with which it differs by less than 1 m from Signal de Botrange.|$|E

50|$|In 1965 Győr won the Hungarian Cup for {{the first}} time by beating Diósgyőri VTK 4-0 in the final held at the Népstadion {{therefore}} Győr could enter the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1966-67 season. In the first round Győr lost 1-0 (Chiarugi) to ACF Fiorentina in Florence but in the second leg they could beat the Italian club by 4-2 (Stolcz 2, Varsányi, Orbán) therefore they could advance on aggregate. In the first leg of the second round Győr beat SC Braga 3-0 at home. Although they lost 2-0 away, they could qualify for the quarter finals of the Cup Winners' Cup. In the quarter-finals Győr won their first match 2-1 against the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Standard</b> Liège at home but they lost the second leg of the tie 2-0 which resulted the elimination of the club from the cup.|$|E
5000|$|The Kemmelberg is the {{emotional}} centrepiece of the race. This edition, the second ascent of the Kemmelberg was addressed via its steepest road.

Race director Hans De Clercq stated {{that it is a}} tribute to the historical significance of the Kemmelberg, as it is that road being used the first time the Kemmelberg was included in the men's race, in 1955. According to COTACOL, a <b>Belgian</b> <b>standard</b> work that has examined and graded every climb in the country, the [...] "new" [...] Kemmelberg ascent is the toughest climb in all Flemish races.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} average {{fundamental}} frequency of eight peripheral vowels in <b>Belgian</b> <b>Standard</b> Dutch {{in order to}} examine whether a vowel gradient exists with respect to Intrinsic Vowel Pitch (IF 0). The results show that IF 0 exists in <b>Belgian</b> <b>Standard</b> Dutch and amounts to 3. 26 semi-tones. It is found that the assumed gradience in the degree of openness/tongue height is only reflected to a certain extent in vowel F 0 : mid vowels have intermediate values between those of high and low vowels and there is {{no significant difference between the}} close-mid and open-mid vowels. This suggests that gradience in the degree of opening in vowel articulation does not correspond directly to a gradient change in F 0, but that the mechanical coupling between articulation and the laryngeal system has a non-uniform effect on intrinsic vowel F 0...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the acoustic characteristics of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>Standard</b> Dutch vowels in children with hearing impairment and in children with normal hearing. In a balanced experimental design, the 12 vowels of <b>Belgian</b> <b>Standard</b> Dutch were recorded in three groups of children: {{a group of children}} with normal hearing, a group with a conventional hearing aid and a group with a cochlear implant. The formants, the surface area of the vowel space and the acoustic differentiation between the vowels were determined. The analyses revealed that many of the vowels in hearing-impaired children showed a reduction of the formant values. This reduction was particularly significant with respect to F 2. The size of the vowel space was significantly smaller in the hearing-impaired children. Finally, a smaller acoustic differentiation between the vowels was observed in children with hearing impairment. The results show that even after 5 years of device use, the acoustic characteristics of the vowels in hearing-assisted children remain significantly different as compared to their NH peers...|$|E
40|$|The {{context of}} {{ventilation}} in Belgian dwellings {{has changed since}} the publication of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>standard</b> NBN D 50 - 001 : 1991. Due to the higher energy performance of these dwellings, ventilation plays nowadays a more essential role in maintaining a good indoor air quality. Therefore, new rules for improved ventilation strategies are needed to accomplish high energy-efficient ventilation while providing a good indoor air quality. A first step is to compare different ventilation strategies, including strategies that don’t comply with the current standard, in terms of airflow rates and airflow paths. This comparison also includes the influence of demand controlled ventilation. This paper covers a simulation study using multi-zone airflow and contaminant transport calculation software (CONTAM) which compares the performances of the different ventilation strategies in terms of indoor air quality and average airflow rates. The evaluation of the indoor air quality is based on the exposure of the occupants to CO 2 and VOC and on the relative humidity in the rooms. The different ventilation strategies can achieve a comparable indoor air quality, including the strategies not conform to the <b>Belgian</b> <b>standard.</b> However, some strategies require up to twice the airflow rate than others...|$|E

Building on a speaker evaluation experiment in which older and younger West-Flemish listener-judges rate <b>Belgian</b> <b>Standard</b> Dutch, Brabantic-flavoured Tussentaal and West-Flemish-flavoured Tussentaal, two hypotheses are explored. First of all, we investigate whether the strong position of the dialects in West-Flanders, and the alleged concomitant weak position of Tussentaal, translate in negative attitudes towards West-Flemish Tussentaal. Secondly, it is investigated to what extent times are “a-changing”: is Tussentaal more easily tolerated in the private conceptualisations of adolescent West-Flemings...|$|E
