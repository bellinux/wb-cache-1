40|$|Background: Today's {{healthcare}} system is under development and reorienting and adapting {{to embrace a}} person centred and holistic perspective on health, including a focus on health promotion. This reorientation results in changes in the healthcare models, processes {{as well as it}} sets new requirements for healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> A vast majority of research has been devoted to the relation between inpatient healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design</b> and individual health, e. g. how our hospitals affects treatments and patient outcomes. Less {{attention has been paid to}} the relation between outpatient healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design</b> and public or population health and wellbeing, e. g. healthcare in the community to lessen the load on large hospitals. At the same time as the aforementioned development is happening there is a growing body of research emphasizing the importance of the built environment for public health. Objective: This licentiate thesis aim to explore conceptualizations of health promotion in the context of outpatient healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design,</b> the aim is to enable a broader platform to enable incorporation of several health promotion perspectives into future healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> The main research question is: How is health promotion conceptualized in the context of outpatient healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design?</b> In addition, several other questions emerged in the research process: What aspects of <b>building</b> <b>design</b> result in health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design?</b> How is health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design</b> conceptualized in the literature and in practice? What tools and outcomes are referred to when evaluating health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design?</b> Methods: The research included two studies with an explorative approach: a scoping review and a content analysis of interviews. Results: The results present different conceptualizations of health promotion in the context of healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> In addition, the results provide an interpretation of health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> The results also relate to health promotion strategies, perspectives on health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design</b> and some aspects of <b>building</b> <b>design</b> that can contribute to, or prevent, health promotion. Discussion: The discussion emphasizes challenges related to developing health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design,</b> such as vague and contradicting definitions and interpretations of core concepts as health promotion and itís interpretation in the built environment. In addition, the discussion highlights the challenges associated with evaluating health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> Conclusions: Health promotion perspectives, have been shown to influence healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design</b> through altered implications for the built environment. As shown, healthcare <b>building</b> <b>design</b> thus seems to have the opportunity to promote the health and wellbeing of patients, staff, visitors and the community. However, the vocabulary used to address health promotion, the different perspectives and health-promotion is weak and inconsistent. The thesis therefore proposed definitions for health promotion and health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design,</b> that might guide future research and discussions on health promotion vocabulary. Future research should focus on developing the health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design</b> vocabulary, collecting examples of health-promoting <b>building</b> <b>design,</b> relating health promotion theory to existing architecture theory, and methods and outcomes to evaluate health-promotion <b>building</b> <b>design...</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Green <b>building</b> <b>design</b> {{has been}} a major trend in the last decade which has largely {{affected}} the AEC industry. As of 2013, for example, there were over 13, 000 green buildings certified with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) in the United States alone. Building Information Modeling (BIM) technolo-gy and computer simulations are adopted largely for green <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> However, while information sharing and automated, collaborative design review are important for the <b>design</b> of green <b>buildings,</b> the current way of BIM-based green <b>building</b> <b>design</b> relies mainly on individual file transfer and does not support collaboration in the distributed environment of construction projects. On the other hand, as the Internet becomes ubiquitous, the web provides convenient and cost-efficient means for multi-location cross-organizational collaboration. Energy analysis and validation against standard building codes are two major processes in green <b>building</b> <b>design</b> evaluation. This paper presents a modular web service based framework which integrates the information necessary for green <b>building</b> <b>design,</b> automates the <b>building</b> <b>design</b> evaluation processes, and facilitates simple updates on the building model on a common but distributed platform. This framework is based on BIM data models like gbXML (Green Building XML) which contain information for green <b>building</b> <b>design</b> like geometry of the building, material, and sensor information from more than one source. The BIM data models act as a single source of building information for all processes. <b>Building</b> <b>design</b> evaluation and updating are iterative in gree...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} special demands for {{representation}} and reasoning posed by cross-disciplinary communication i collaborative conceptual <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> These needs {{are not well}} addressed by existing software technology. By <b>building</b> upon <b>design</b> theory literature and observations of {{a case study of}} an actual <b>building</b> <b>design</b> project, we are identifying and devising computational strategies for addressing these needs. Our conceptualization suggests that designers propose a shared form model, interpret the form model into discipline models, critique the discipline form models to derive behavior and compare it to function, and explain the results to other members of the team. We present this propose-interpret-critique-explain paradigm as a communication cycle for collaborative conceptual <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> We are exploring and testing the conceptualization by modeling it with an experimental software prototype, ICM, that integrates graphic representations of, and AI reasoning about, the evolving <b>building</b> <b>design.</b> 1.

Among their distinct wooden buildings were the Hollola Municipal House (1902), the Suviranta artists’ home for artist Eero Järnefelt, in Tuusulanjärvi, along the same lake shore where other artists would build their atelier homes, most notably Jean Sibelius. By far the largest scale project of the architectural firm was never realised, the Vyborg City Hall, which Nyström and Penttilä had won in an architectural competition in 1899.

25|$|The load a {{skyscraper}} experiences {{is largely}} from {{the force of the}} building material itself. In most <b>building</b> <b>designs,</b> the weight of the structure is much larger than the weight of the material that it will support beyond its own weight. In technical terms, the dead load, the load of the structure, is larger than the live load, the weight of things in the structure (people, furniture, vehicles, etc.). As such, the amount of structural material required within the lower levels of a skyscraper will be much larger than the material required within higher levels. This is not always visually apparent. The Empire State Building's setbacks are actually a result of the building code at the time (1916 Zoning Resolution), and were not structurally required. On the other hand, John Hancock Center's shape is uniquely the result of how it supports loads. Vertical supports can come in several types, among which the most common for skyscrapers can be categorized as steel frames, concrete cores, tube within tube design, and shear walls.|$|E
25|$|He {{established}} a solo practice in 1950, and incorporated as a firm in 1956. At first, {{he set a}} goal of applying Modernist architectural principles to major types of building. But his work soon reflected a desire to harmonize <b>building</b> <b>designs</b> with the environment in which they were set as well as their cultural and historical setting, an architectural theory known as contextualism. Warnecke won national recognition in 1951 for the Mira Vista Elementary School in East Richmond Heights, California (a small residential community which overlooks the northern part of San Francisco Bay). Other schools in the San Francisco Bay are followed, earning him much praise. Warnecke became an internationally recognized architect after submitting a design for a new U.S. embassy in Thailand in 1956 (it was never built). He reorganized his firm in 1958 under the name John Carl Warnecke & Associates, the name it would be best known by. He was named an Associate of the National Academy of Design the same year. He won additional notice for buildings at Stanford University (built in the 1960s) and the University of California, Berkeley (built in the 1960s and early 1970s).|$|E
