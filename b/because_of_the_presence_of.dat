5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> monothecate anthers, {{as opposed to}} the bithecate anthers common {{to the rest of the}} mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should actually be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesize that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims In 1976 the {{monotypic}} genus Hellmuthia {{was placed}} in the Hypolytreae s. l., but was subsequently ascribed to the Mapanioideae, tribe Chrysitricheae, mainly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> in Hellmuthia <b>of</b> two lateral, mapanioid-like floral scales with ciliated keels, <b>the</b> anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nutlet, the embryo and the inflorescence. Recently, based on cladistic analyses and supported by pollen ontogenetic evidence, Hellmuthia was transferred to a Cyperaceae, tribe Cypereae, clade mainly consisting of Ficinia and Isolepis. In this study, the floral ontogeny in Hellmuthia was investigated and compared with the floral ontogeny in Paramapania, with special attention for the floral scales...|$|R

5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> star spots combined with {{the rotation of the}} star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The Rokeby Venus {{depicts the}} Roman goddess of love, beauty and {{fertility}} reclining languidly on her bed, {{her back to}} the viewer—in Antiquity, portrayal of Venus from a back view was a common visual and literary erotic motif—and her knees tucked. She is shown without the mythological paraphernalia normally included in depictions of the scene; jewellery, roses, and myrtle are all absent. Unlike most earlier portrayals of the goddess, which show her with blond hair, Velázquez's Venus is a brunette. The female figure can be identified as Venus <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> her son, Cupid.|$|E

It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Da Matta, Andretti, and Franchitti contended {{for third}} {{position}} until the field closed up <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> slower cars.

It was announced on lap 90 that Kniefel had reduced the number of laps to be run from 168 to 140 because of the danger from fading sunlight. All of the leaders (including Bräck) chose to make pit stops for fuel and tyres under caution on lap 100. Castroneves passed da Matta and Andretti around the inside in the pit lane and Newman/Haas Racing believed he had committed an infraction. The team informed CART of Castroneves' passing, which was observed by their co-owner Paul Newman.|$|E

5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> developing pin feathers.|$|E
5|$|In Tallahassee, Florida, on December 21, 1999, a {{memorial}} service is held for a former FBI agent named Raymond Crouch. His widow is approached by a mysterious man, Mark Johnson (Holmes Osborne), {{who claims to have}} worked with her husband. After the other mourners have left, Johnson returns to the funeral parlor, dons the corpse's clothes, and places a cell phone in the coffin. One week later, Johnson is monitoring Crouch's grave when his phone rings; he walks towards the grave with a shovel. Subsequently, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to examine Crouch's empty grave. They notice damage done to the interior of the casket; Scully theorizes that the scene was staged. A briefing is held by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who notes that Crouch is one of four former FBI agents whose graves have been exhumed; all four men had committed suicide. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> goat's blood encircling the grave, Mulder states that the crime was an act of necromancy. After the briefing, Skinner takes the agents aside and asks them to investigate Crouch's possible ties to the Millennium Group, which is now dissolved.|$|E

5|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops under caution. Fittipaldi had his {{engine control unit}} and spark box changed on lap 17 after he {{reported}} a problem with his car. Bräck remained the leader at the lap-21 restart and {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Andretti began to reduce the gap between Bräck and himself between laps 31 and 33. Tagliani reduced his pace between the second and third turns on lap 42, and was ordered by his engineer to enter the pit lane. His crew removed his car's left sidepod and retired on the next lap with a battery problem. A second caution was necessitated on the 46th lap when debris was located in turn two. The leaders made their pit stops because of the mandatory pit stop window. Fittipaldi's car problem re-emerged on the 44th lap despite having his vehicle's coils and springs changed; he drove to the pit lane to retire because his team's mechanics could not rectify the issue. Franchitti stalled his car because of a clutch issue. Bräck maintained the first position at the lap-52 restart, followed by Takagi. Nine laps later, Takagi attempted to pass Bräck around the outside for the first position but was unable to complete the manoeuvre <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> slower cars.|$|E
5|$|Tagliani ran {{in sixth}} gear after his team {{ordered him to}} {{conserve}} fuel {{and was unable to}} generate enough heat into his tires to challenge Andretti on the restarts. On lap 87, Fittipaldi tried an overtaking manoevure on Junqueira around the outside of turn three which resulted in Fittipaldi and Junqueira making contact and both drivers slid into the outside tire barrier. Andretti's lead of 7.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when the eleventh (and final) caution was displayed on the next lap to allow course officials to extract Fittipaldi's and Junquiera's cars from the track. Racing resumed on lap 90 with Andretti retaining the first position and pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Fernández's radio had malfunctioned and was in another gear in an attempt to save fuel which allowed Tagliani to pass him for second. However, Tagliani was unable to close the gap to Andretti <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Junqueira's lapped car which cost him more than two seconds. He drove on the track's dirty side on the backstraight and his tires were cleaned in the next five turns on the track.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} routes towards Syria from Iraq, one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal (Now known as Skaka) {{and the other}} was through Mesopotamia passing though Raqqa. Since the Muslim forces in Syria were in need of urgent reinforcement, Khalid avoided the {{conventional}} route to Syria via Daumat-ul-Jandal because it was a long and would take weeks to reach Syria. He also avoided the Mesopotamian route <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Roman garrisons in northern Syria and Mesopotamia. Engaging them at the time when Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria, was also ruled out since it would mean fighting on two fronts. Khalid selected a rather shorter route to Syria which unconventionally passed though the Syrian Desert. He marched his army though the desert, where traditions tells that his soldiers marched for two days without a single drop of water, before reaching a pre-decided water source at an oasis. Khalid is said to have solved the water shortage issue using a Bedouin method. Camels were made to drink water after intentionally denying them water for a lengthy time period, encouraging the camels to drink a lot of water at one time. Camels have the ability to store water in their stomach which in turn could be obtained by slaughtering them when necessary. Muslim troops rode entirely on camels and this method became an effective one for the Muslim army.|$|E
