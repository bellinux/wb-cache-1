5|$|A strong {{influence}} on Champagne wine production was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} <b>Burgundy.</b> From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and <b>Burgundy</b> would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only <b>Burgundy</b> wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
5|$|In 1490, Sigismund {{was forced}} to abdicate and turn over all his territories to Frederick's son Maximilian I. Maximilian had married Mary of <b>Burgundy</b> in 1477 {{after the death of}} Charles the Bold in the <b>Burgundy</b> Wars and thus {{inherited}} the Burgundian territories: Duchy and County of <b>Burgundy</b> and the Netherlands. He took over and expanded the Burgundian administration with a more centralized style of government, which in 1482, caused the outbreak of a rebellion of the cities and counts, allied with Charles VIII of France, against Maximilian. The Duchy of <b>Burgundy</b> was also a French fiefdom and immediately claimed by Charles VIII. The first phase of this conflict would last until 1489, keeping Maximilian occupied in the Low Countries. He even fell into the hands of his enemies and was held prisor for four months in Bruges in 1488. He was freed only when his father sent an army under the command of duke Albert of Saxony to his rescue. Maximilian subsequently returned to Germany, leaving his cousin Albert as his representative. Albert would, in the following years, manage to assert the Habsburg hegemony in the Netherlands.|$|E

The {{explosion}} reveals a buried cellar containing artwork, coins, jewellery and an ancient manuscript.

As the charter had never been revoked, an area of Pimlico is declared to still be a legal part of <b>Burgundy.</b>|$|E

5|$|Maximilian {{had been}} elected King of the Romans in 1486 on his father's initiative, {{and they had been}} ruling jointly since then. Upon the death of Frederick in 1493, Maximilian also took over his father's {{possessions}} and thus united the whole Habsburg territory in his hands. In the same year, the Peace of Senlis also marked the end of his wars against the French about his Burgundian possessions; he kept the territories in the Netherlands and also the County of <b>Burgundy,</b> but had to cede the Duchy of <b>Burgundy</b> to the French king. Maximilian controlled thus territories that nearly encircled the Old Swiss Confederacy: Tyrol and Vorarlberg in the east, Further Austria in the north, and the County of <b>Burgundy</b> in the west.|$|E

Nobody in the town or Robert's army was aware that a mile behind them the French held the field. As darkness fell, Robert and Armagnac trooped back to their respective positions on the same road resulting in a number of frantic skirmishes in the dark but little significant fighting.|$|R
