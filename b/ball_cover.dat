40|$|Abstract In this chapter, {{we present}} a system for {{real-time}} point cloud mapping and scene reconstruction based on an efficient implementation of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm on the graphics processing unit (GPU). Compared to state-of-the-art approaches that achieve real-time performance using projective data associ-ation schemes which operate on the 3 -D scene geometry solely, our method allows to incorporate additional complementary information to guide the registration pro-cess. In this work, the ICP’s nearest neighbor search evaluates both geometric and photometric information in a direct manner, achieving robust mappings in real-time. In order to overcome the performance bottleneck in nearest neighbor search space traversal, we exploit the inherent computation parallelism of GPUs. In particular, we have adapted the random <b>ball</b> <b>cover</b> (RBC) data structure and search algorithm, orig-inally proposed for high-dimensional problems, to low-dimensional RGB-D data. The system is validated on scene and object reconstruction scenarios. Our imple-mentation achieves frame-to-frame registration runtimes of less than 20 ms on an off-the-shelf consumer GPU. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{tremendous}} amount of work has been conducted in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) on designing effective index structure to accelerate the retrieval process. Most of them improve the retrieval efficiency via complex index structures, and few {{take into account the}} parallel implementation of them on underlying hardware, making the existing index structures suffer from low-degree of parallelism. In this paper, a novel graphics processing unit (GPU) adaptive index structure, termed as plane semantic ball (PSB), is proposed to simultaneously reduce the work of retrieval process and exploit the parallel acceleration of underlying hardware. In PSB, semantics are embedded into the generation of representative pivots and multiple balls are selected to cover more informative reference features. With PSB, the online retrieval of CBIR is factorized into independent components that are implemented on GPU efficiently. Comparative experiments with GPU-based brute force approach demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve high speedup with little information loss. Furthermore, PSB is compared with the state-of-the-art approach, random <b>ball</b> <b>cover</b> (RBC), on two standard image datasets, Corel 10 [*]K and GIST 1 [*]M.

40|$|Nearest {{neighbor}} {{search is}} a core computational task in database systems and throughout data analysis. It {{is also a}} major computational bottleneck, and hence an enormous body of research {{has been devoted to}} data structures and algorithms for accelerating the task. Recent advances in graphics hardware provide tantalizing speedups on a variety of tasks and suggest an alternate approach to the problem: simply run brute force search on a massively parallel sys- tem. In this paper we marry the approaches with a novel data structure that can effectively make use of parallel systems such as graphics cards. The architectural complexities of graphics hardware - the high degree of parallelism, the small amount of memory relative to instruction throughput, and the single instruction, multiple data design- present significant challenges for data structure design. Furthermore, the brute force approach applies perfectly to graphics hardware, leading one to question whether an intelligent algorithm or data structure can even hope to outperform this basic approach. Despite these challenges and misgivings, we demonstrate that our data structure - termed a Random <b>Ball</b> <b>Cover</b> - provides significant speedups over the GPU- based brute force approach...|$|E

With the ad-vent of RGB-D imaging devices that deliver dense, metric and textured 6 -D data in real-time, on-the-fly reconstruc-tion of static environments has come into reach. In this pa-per, we propose a system for real-time point cloud mapping based on an efficient implementation of the iterative clos-est point (ICP) algorithm on the graphics processing unit (GPU).

40|$|This work {{refers to}} the analysis, study and {{resolution}} of the mathematical problem involved {{in the design and}} construction of the cover of a ball, such as the ones used in sports, in order to achieve a ball with optimal roundness and sphericity factors. The design of well distributed ball structures has grown in importance in the last years, most of all in the field of sports, such as soccer. The current trend is directed mainly towards finding a fast ball that will give more dynamism to the game. In order to achieve a greater velocity of the ball during its movement it is important that it has not only an adequate distribution of panels, that give it a greater sphericity, but also that it has a structure that allows for a good distribution of the existing tension between the panels. Starting from an initial design, we define a process of readjustment of the panels in the <b>ball</b> <b>cover,</b> which will lead us to obtain optimal sphericity factors. Then, through a “twisting” process, we can add area to the surface without altering the sphericity factors, and solving the Missing Area Problem (or MAP).

40|$|Large scale {{geometric}} data is ubiquitous. In this dissertation, we design algorithms and data structures to process large scale {{geometric data}} efficiently. We design algorithms for some fundamental geometric optimization problems {{that arise in}} motion planning, machine learning and computer vision. For a stream S of n points in d-dimensional space, we develop (single-pass) streaming algorithms for maintaining extent measures such as the minimum enclosing ball and diameter. Our streaming algorithms have a work space that is polynomial in d and sub-linear in n. For problems of computing diameter, width and minimum enclosing ball of S, we obtain lower bounds on the worst-case approximation ratio of any streaming algorithm that uses polynomial in d space. On the positive side, we design a summary called the blurred <b>ball</b> <b>cover</b> and use it for answering approximate farthest-point queries and maintaining approximate minimum enclosing ball and diameter of S. We describe a streaming algorithm for maintaining a blurred <b>ball</b> <b>cover</b> whose working space is linear in d and independent of n. For a set P of k pairwise-disjoint convex obstacles in 3 -dimensions, we design algorithms and data structures for computing Euclidean shortest path between source s and destination t. The running time of our algorithm is linear in n and the size and query time of our data structure is independent of n. We follow a summary based approach, i. e., quickly compute a small sketch Q of P whose size is independent of n and then compute approximate shortest paths with respect to Q. For d-dimensional point sets A and B, |A| |B| n, and for a parameter &epsilon > 0, We give an algorithm to compute &epsilon-approximate minimum weight perfect matching of A and B under d(.,.) in time O(n 1. 5 &tau(n)); here &tau(n) is the query/update time of a dynamic weighted nearest neighbor under d(.,.). When A, B are point sets from a bounded integer grid, for L 1 and L infinity -norms, our algorithm computes minimum weight perfect matching of A and B in time O(n 1. 5). Our algorithm also extends to a generalization of matching called the transportation problem. We also present an O(n polylog n) time algorithm that computes under any L p - norm, an &epsilon-approximate minimum weight perfect matching of A and B with high probability; all previous algorithms take O(n 1. 5 time. We approximate the L p norm using a distance function, based on a randomly shifted quad-tree. The algorithm iteratively generates an approximate minimum-cost augmenting path under the new distance function in time proportional {{to the length of}} the path. We show that the total length of the augmenting paths generated by the algorithm is O(n log n) implying a near-linear running time. All the problems mentioned above have a history of more than two decades and algorithms presented here improve previous work by an order of magnitude. Many of these improvements are obtained by new geometric techniques that might have broader applications and are of independent interest. Dissertatio...|$|E
