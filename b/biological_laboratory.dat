5|$|Reynolds {{became the}} Class of 1909 Professor of Physics in 1978, and Professor Emeritus 1987. For 31 years he {{combined}} {{his interest in}} the sea and science by working during the summer at the Marine <b>Biological</b> <b>Laboratory</b> in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine bioluminescence. He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Reynolds began a long {{academic}} career at Princeton University. He {{was director of}} the Princeton's High Energy Physics Program from 1948 until 1970, when he became the first director of Princeton's new Center for Environmental Studies. He combined his interest in the sea and science by working during the summers at the Marine <b>Biological</b> <b>Laboratory</b> in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, where he studied marine bioluminescence. He also worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.|$|E
5|$|Bond again {{encounters}} Goodhead in Venice {{where he}} is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He discovers a secret <b>biological</b> <b>laboratory,</b> and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond and is killed; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces {{that she is a}} CIA agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretence of being on leave.|$|E

5|$|Sverdrup's {{main task}} now {{was to keep}} his crew busy. He ordered a {{thorough}} spring cleaning, and set a party to chip {{away some of the}} surrounding ice which was threatening to destabilise the ship. Although there was no immediate danger to Fram, Sverdrup oversaw the repair and overhaul of sledges, and the organisation of provisions should it after all be necessary to abandon ship and march to land. With the arrival of warmer weather as the 1895 summer approached, Sverdrup resumed daily ski practice. Amid these activities a full programme of meteorological, magnetic and oceanographic activities continued under Scott Hansen; Fram had become a moving oceanographic, meteorological and <b>biological</b> <b>laboratory.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{bodies of}} the University of Chicago consist of the College, five divisions of graduate research, six professional schools, and the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies. The university also contains a library system, the University of Chicago Press, the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, and the University of Chicago Medical Center, and holds ties {{with a number of}} independent academic institutions, including Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), Argonne National Laboratory, and the Marine <b>Biological</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> The university is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine <b>Biological</b> <b>Laboratory</b> provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

5|$|The {{university}} operates {{more than}} 140 research centers and institutes on campus. Among {{these are the}} Oriental Institute—a museum and research center for Near Eastern studies {{owned and operated by}} the university—and a number of National Resource Centers, including the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Chicago also operates or is affiliated with a number of research institutions apart from the university proper. The university manages Argonne National Laboratory, part of the United States Department of Energy's national laboratory system, and co-manages Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), a nearby particle physics laboratory, as well as a stake in the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico. Faculty and students at the adjacent Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago collaborate with the university. In 2013, the university formed an affiliation with the formerly independent Marine <b>Biological</b> <b>Laboratory</b> in Woods Hole, Mass. Although formally unrelated, the National Opinion Research Center is located on Chicago's campus.|$|E
5|$|University of Chicago {{scholars}} {{have played a}} major role in the development of many academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics; the Chicago school of sociology; law and economics theory in legal analysis; the Chicago school of literary criticism; the Chicago school of religion; and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction (Chicago Pile-1) beneath the viewing stands of university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits are aided through its operation of world-renowned institutions, including the nearby Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine <b>Biological</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, marine {{biologist}} Doc is already at work in his one-man Western <b>Biological</b> <b>Laboratory,</b> getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in. Suzy is fully aware {{of what kind of}} a place it is.|$|E
