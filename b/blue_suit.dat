5|$|Saadiq {{recorded}} the album with producers Michael Angelo, Focus..., and Jake and the Phatman, among others. He {{also worked with}} singer-songwriter Joi, former Tony! Toni! Toné! member D'wayne Wiggins, singer-songwriter Teedra Moses, singer Dawn Robinson, formerly of Saadiq's other group Lucy Pearl, singer-songwriter Babyface, and rapper Allie Baba, Saadiq's nephew. The album's title is a reference to his mother's nickname for him, also a childhood name. Its cover artwork {{was inspired by the}} blaxploitation films of the 1970s. It shows Saadiq dressed in a vintage cornflower <b>blue</b> <b>suit,</b> knicker pants, and lime green argyle socks, while leaning on a white 1967 Mercury Cougar.|$|E
5|$|Capitol Hill {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most densely {{populated}} neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. It is bounded by F Street NE on the north and Southeast/Southwest Freeway on the south. The U.S. Capitol marks its western boundary, while the Anacostia River is its eastern limit. Although Capitol Hill has been home to many of the city's powerful, its hauntings appear to be few. One ghost, however, is said to haunt First Street NE. Joseph Holt was Judge Advocate General of the United States Army from 1862 to 1875. He presided over the trials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators. During the trials, accused conspirators Dr. Samuel Mudd (who treated John Wilkes Booth's broken leg) and Mary Surratt (at whose downtown boarding house the conspirators met) were held at the Old Capitol Prison opposite the U.S. Capitol (the modern day United States Supreme Court Building stands on the site today). After Holt retired, he allegedly became a recluse in his Capitol Hill home. Although the Holt house no longer exists, local residents have told stories of Holt's ghost walking down First Street NE in a <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> and cape, pondering the guilt of Mudd and Surrat as he heads for the site of the Old Capitol Prison.|$|E

Primary characters include Fox McCloud, a fox who wears a green suit and leads the Star Fox team; Falco Lombardi, the cocky expert pilot with a green suit and a sometimes contentious relationship with Fox; Peppy Hare, a rabbit in a red suit and a mentor to Fox and the wisest member of the team; Slippy Toad, a frog in a <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> and the team technician and childhood friend of Fox; Fay, a white dog with a <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> like Slippy and a pink hair bow who is a new member of the team; and Miyu, a tomboyish lynx in a red suit like Peppy who is also a new addition to the team.|$|E
25|$|Dressed in {{a version}} of the Sarong Kebaya {{designed}} by Pierre Balmain in 1968, the uniform of the Singapore Girl has remained largely unchanged. Stewards previously wore light-blue business jackets and grey trousers. Since June 2008, this has been redesigned by Christophe Galibert, artistic Director of Balmain Uniformes. The new steward's uniform now features a single-breasted navy <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> (jacket and trousers), a sky blue shirt and different coloured striped ties. The tie colours differentiates the four ranks of cabin crew: inflight supervisor, chief steward(ess), leading steward(ess), and steward(ess).|$|E
25|$|The single's music video, is {{credited}} to Alan Smithee (Nick Brandt removed his name {{due to the}} way Clive Davis re-edited the video), and produced by Rob Newman. It begins {{with the performance of}} the song Houston gives at the end of The Bodyguard. The video then cuts to Houston in a dark <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> sitting in an empty theater with the spotlight shining on her, singing of her love. The video is inter-cut with scenes from The Bodyguard and gives the viewer the experience of reliving the moments with the singer. At the time of the video's shooting Houston was pregnant with her daughter Bobbi Kristina so is shown only sitting in the theater scenes.|$|E

60|$|On {{the ground}} floor, nurse made me walk; and I {{walked out to}} the door, where a cab was in waiting, drawn slowly by a pair of horses. People were looking on, on either side, between the door and the cab--great crowds of people, peering eagerly forward; and two more men in <b>blue</b> <b>suits</b> were holding them off by main force from surging against me and incommoding me. I don't think they wanted to hurt me: it was rather curiosity than anger I saw in their faces. But I was afraid, and shrank back. They were eager to see me, however, and pressed forward with loud cries, so that the men in <b>blue</b> <b>suits</b> had hard work to prevent them.|$|R
25|$|Rimmer's Space Corps uniform changes {{several times}} {{during the course of the}} show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer's jacket becomes quilted and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original. In the 2009 three-part special Back to Earth, Rimmer wears a <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> similar to his Series III and VI green suit but with the {{addition}} of a plain waist-high belt worn over the jacket and a quilted collar.|$|E
25|$|Air Marshal Les Fisher, {{who headed}} the RAAF from 1994 to 1998, served as the last CAS and the first Chief of Air Force (CAF), the change of name {{occurring}} in 1997. Fisher instituted a policy requiring staff to meet minimum physical fitness standards {{to remain in the}} service, {{for the first time in}} Air Force history. Air Marshal Errol McCormack commanded the RAAF as it moved into the 21st century, addressing fundamental cultural questions such as the balance of change and tradition, and whether defence should be run like a business. Beginning in 2000, he reintroduced the distinctive dark blue uniform that had been chosen by Richard Williams in the 1920s but discarded in 1972 by then-CAS, Air Marshal Hannah, in favour of a more neutral <b>blue</b> <b>suit.</b> McCormack’s successor, Air Marshal Angus Houston, became well-known to the public for contradicting the Federal Government’s version of events in relation to the Children Overboard Affair. In 2005, Houston was promoted to Chief of the Defence Force, the third Air Force member out of 18 Chiefs of the Defence Force or equivalent, and the third to achieve the rank of air chief marshal.|$|E
25|$|The Service Dress Blue (SDB) uniform {{consists}} of a navy <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> coat and trousers (or the optional skirt for women) that are nearly black in color, a white shirt, and a four-in-hand necktie for men or a neck tab for women. The material is generally wool or a wool blend, depending on the vendor. The men's jacket is double breasted with six gold-colored buttons, and the women's jacket has a single row of four gold-colored buttons. Rank insignia is the gold sleeve stripes for commissioned officers, while rating badges and service stripes are worn on the left sleeve by Chief Petty Officers (CPOs). The prescribed headgear is the white combination cap, although a navy blue garrison cap is optional, unless stated otherwise by the prescribing authority in some situations when the jacket is not worn. Beginning in 2016, the Navy began phasing out the female combination cap and now prescribes a cover similar to the male version for female officers and CPOs. Commissioned and warrant officers wear a cap badge of the American shield and eagle in silver upon gold crossed anchors; CPOs wear a single fouled anchor. The combination cover's chinstrap is gold for commissioned and warrant officers, narrower gold for midshipmen, and black for CPOs. Female officers and chief petty officers wear beltless slacks with the SDB, although since January 2017, belted slacks can be worn as an alternative.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the uniform}} of the Singapore Girl has {{remained}} largely unchanged, the uniform for male cabin crew was updated on 30 June 2008.

500|$|Williams' legacy {{extends to}} the very look of the RAAF. He {{personally}} chose the colour of the Air Force's winter uniform, a shade [...] "somewhere between royal and navy blue", designed to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force shade. Unique at the time among Commonwealth forces, the uniform was changed to an all-purpose middle <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> in 1972 but following numerous complaints in the ensuing years reverted to Williams' original colour and style in 2000.|$|E

The driver of the Impala, an African American male dressed in a <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> and bow tie, rolled down his window, drew a 9mm blue-steel pistol and fired at the GMC Suburban; four bullets hit Wallace in the chest.

500|$|The uniforms {{worn by the}} SPARS {{were the}} same design and style as those worn by the WAVES, except for the service insignias; created for them by the New York fashion house of Mainbocher. The {{decision}} made regarding the type and style of the uniforms was largely that of the U.S. Navy Uniform Board. The standard uniform was a navy <b>blue</b> <b>suit,</b> consisting of a jacket and a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a brimmed hat; black gloves; black leather purse, and rain and winter coats. [...] The summer uniform was of the same design as the standard uniform, worn in white Palm Beach cloth, tropical worsted, or other light fabrics. Shoes were oxfords or pumps of white leather. The summer work wear was a grey and white striped seersucker dress with jacket.|$|E
500|$|Sam & Max Save the World {{is set in}} a {{universe}} that parodies American popular culture, and it follows the title characters of Sam and Max, the Freelance Police, a pair of vigilantes and private investigators. Sam is a level-headed but enthusiastic anthropomorphic dog who wears a <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> and fedora. He is inquisitive, knowledgeable in obscure areas and tends to prefer the logical solution to problems, but he is not above using force. Max is described as a [...] "hyperkinetic rabbity thing"; cunning, uninhibited and reveling in violence and mischief. His reactions to situations usually incorporate force but often with a seeming disregard for his own personal safety. Together, the Freelance Police operate out of a dilapidated office block in a dangerous neighborhood in New York City where they receive cases over the telephone from an unseen police commissioner.|$|E
60|$|Lawson again led the {{way across}} the square in search of the commissioner's office. The large, bare waiting-room was filled with a dozen or more redmen, all wearing new <b>blue</b> <b>suits</b> and wide black hats.

5000|$|In Western civilisation, {{those in}} the upper classes in high places of {{political}} or economic power often wear dark <b>blue</b> <b>suits.</b> Ordinary members {{of the working class}} (especially those who work in the computer industry) often refer derisively to these management functionaries as the suits. This terminology is also used in the television industry—the network executives are often referred to by the creative people (actors, directors, and screenwriters) as the suits.|$|R
500|$|... "Till I Die" [...] {{was written}} by Cameron Jabril Thomaz, Chris Brown, Marcella Araica, Nathaniel [...] "Danja" [...] Hills and Sean Anderson, while {{production}} was handled by Danja.

500|$|Frakes {{considered}} {{the entrance of}} the Borg Queen—where her head, shoulders, and steel spine are lowered by cables and attached to her body—as the [...] "signature visual effect in the film". The scene was difficult to execute, taking ILM five months to finish. Jaeger devised a rig that would lower the actress on the set, and applied a prosthetic spine over a <b>blue</b> <b>suit</b> so that ILM could remove Krige's lower body. This strategy enabled the filmmakers to incorporate as many live-action elements as possible without resorting to further digital effects. To make the prosthetics appear at the proper angle when her lower body was removed, Krige extended her neck forward so it appeared in line with the spine. Knoll did not want it to seem that the Queen was on a hard, mechanical rig; [...] "we wanted her to have the appropriate 'float'," [...] he explained. Using separate motion control passes on the set, Knoll shot the lower of the upper torso and the secondary sequence with Krige's entire body. A digital version of the Borg body suit was used for the lowering sequence, at which point the image was morphed back to the real shot of Krige's body. The animated claws of the suit were created digitally as well using a detailed model. As reference to the animators, the shot required Krige to realistically portray [...] "the strange pain or satisfaction of being reconnected to her body".|$|E
500|$|Another common {{criticism}} of Wintour's editorship focuses on Vogues {{increasing use of}} celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a <b>blue</b> <b>suit.</b> At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a Vogue-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour {{is said to have}} personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von Fürstenberg. [...] "I don't think Vreeland had that kind of concentration," [...] says WWD publisher Patrick McCarthy. [...] "She wouldn't have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her." [...] By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in Vogue but more general-interest magazines like People and Us, which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. [...] "The end result is that Anna can control {{it all the way to}} the selling floor," [...] says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for Vogue. All complied.|$|E
