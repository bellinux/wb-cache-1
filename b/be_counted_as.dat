5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported {{and that he did}} not realize it was an issue at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> political contributions.|$|E
5|$|The first {{academic}} {{accounts of}} the Nanking Massacre included as massacre victims all Chinese who {{were killed by the}} Japanese Army in and around Nanking, including Chinese soldiers who were killed in action. This definition was supported by Hora and other early scholars. In 1986 Ikuhiko Hata became the first historian to call this definition into question. Hata argued that Chinese troops killed on the battlefield were part of the Battle of Nanking rather than Nanking Massacre, and that only civilians and disarmed POWs should <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> massacre victims.|$|E
5|$|Following an announcement, in August 2015, that {{tennis player}} Sania Mirza {{was to be}} awarded, a Public-Interest Litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court. The petitioner, Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, {{mentioned}} that his performance was ignored by the committee. Girisha {{claimed to be a}} top contender for the award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's High Jump F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> the events were {{not a part of the}} list of sports events to be considered for the performance evaluation. The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the selection process. The Ministry nevertheless presented the award to Mirza on 29 August 2015 amidst the case processing.|$|E

50|$|Adopters of NLTC {{should note}} that all {{singleton}}s, except singleton A, <b>are</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> three half-losers (1.5 losers), and all doubletons that are missing both the A and K <b>are</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> five half-losers (2.5 losers). Like basic LTC, no suit contains more than three losers, so with NLTC, three small cards in a suit <b>are</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> six half-losers (3.0 losers).|$|R
50|$|In {{the census}} from 1881 to 1960, all Muslims <b>are</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> Turks, only Greek Orthodox <b>are</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> Greeks. There <b>were</b> small populations of Greek-speaking Muslims and Turkish-speaking Greek Orthodox.|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
5|$|Calling a {{constitutional}} convention required {{the approval of}} a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt {{in the minds of many}} legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E
25|$|The gallium {{content is}} greater {{in a few}} minerals, {{including}} gallite (CuGaS2), but these are too rare to <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> major sources and make negligible contributions to the world's supply.|$|E
50|$|If all ballots <b>are</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> {{cast and}} cast as intended, then all ballots <b>are</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> intended. Therefore, the {{integrity}} of the election can be proven to a very high probability.|$|R

25|$|Eisner v. Macomber. (Eisner was {{the person}} {{responsible}} for Internal Revenue Collection in both cases). However, in the aftermath of Towne v.

25|$|As {{may be seen}} below, {{the novel}} may also <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> the prequel to the Empire series of novels, which form part of the Foundation Series. Asimov had already {{included}} a kind of time travel in his 1950 novel Pebble in the Sky, {{but it was a}} one-way trip.|$|E
25|$|When {{speed limits}} are arbitrary, {{such as when}} set through {{political}} rather than empirical processes, the speed limit's relationship to the maximum safe speed is weakened or intentionally eliminated. Therefore, a crash can <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> speed-related even if it occurs at a safe speed, simply because the speed was in excess of a politically determined limit.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} to postulate that the long vowels and diphthongs should <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> separate single phonemes, because they can be treated as sequences of two vowels. They are in fact historically derived from two-syllable sequences. This is easily seen in the synchronic co-existence of allomorphic pairs of Hawaiian forms such as kolu with -kou, both meaning 'three'.|$|E

HRW also called for him to receive visits from the ICRC, and said that the prolonged incommunicado detention of Shalit was cruel and inhumane and amounted to torture.|$|E
25|$|The Petitioners {{argued that}} the {{definition}} in the CAA is so broad that carbon dioxide must <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> an air pollutant. They claimed that the question was controlled by {{the words of the}} statute, so that factual debate was immaterial. Furthermore, the Petitioners filed substantial scientific evidence that the toxicity of carbon dioxide results from high concentrations and that causation of global warming transforms the gas into a pollutant.|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, {{paintings}} by Joachim de Beuckelaer, Pieter Aertsen and Pieter Bruegel clearly depict the modern waffle form. Bruegel's work, in particular, not only shows waffles being cooked, but fine detail of individual waffles. In those instances, the waffle pattern can <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> a large 12x7 grid, with cleanly squared sides, suggesting {{the use of}} a fairly thin batter, akin to our contemporary Brussels waffles (Brusselse wafels).|$|E

25|$|If {{there is}} more than one player with the same amount of goals, since 1994 the tie-breaker goes to the player who has contributed the most assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group {{deciding}} whether an assist is to <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> such. If there is still more than one player, the tie-breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{rest period}} {{of at least}} 69 hours in total may <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> two {{back-to-back}} weekly rests (e.g. a 45-hour weekly rest followed by 24 hours), provided that the driver does not exceed 144 hours’ work either {{before or after the}} rest period in question. Where reduced weekly rest periods are taken away from base, these may be taken in a vehicle, provided that it has suitable sleeping facilities and is stationary.|$|E
25|$|After this {{endurance}} test the specified parameter limits {{to pass the}} test are, on the one hand, no total failures (short circuit, open circuit) {{and on the other}} hand, not reaching degradation failure, a reduction of capacitance over 30% and an increase of the ESR, impedance or loss factor by more than a factor of 3 compared to the initial value. Parameters of the tested component beyond these limits can <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> evidence of degradation failure.|$|E

50|$|This uncertainty, {{plus the}} fact that Constantine {{remained}} uncrowned means that he <b>is</b> not always <b>counted</b> among Byzantine Emperors.
