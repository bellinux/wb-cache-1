5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Jack and his rival Devon <b>Banks</b> (<b>Will</b> Arnett) both aspire {{to become the}} Chairman of GE. When about to {{announce}} that Jack will be his successor, Don Geiss (Rip Torn), the current Chairman of GE, slips into a diabetic coma. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Devon places his fiancee, Don's daughter, Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) as the puppet GE Chairwoman.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{preparing}} {{for the beginning of}} her new talk show, Dealbreakers. Jack's rival, Devon <b>Banks</b> (<b>Will</b> Arnett), complicates the situation by threatening to publicly ridicule Jack if the show loses money. Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in her dressing room, Jack shuts Dealbreakers down, but manages to break even by selling the show's opening titles; in future, whenever a television show is playing in the background of a Sheinhardt Universals soap opera, the Dealbreakers titles will be shown.|$|E
5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fianc√©e Avery Jessup (Elizabeth <b>Banks)</b> <b>will</b> not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she never told him he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E

50|$|The {{first season}} of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air premiered on September 10, 1990, and {{concluded}} on May 6, 1991. In the pilot, Will Smith is {{revealed to be}} a street-smart teenager from West Philadelphia, who is sent {{to live with his}} wealthy relatives in their Bel Air mansion. His relatives include Phillip <b>Banks,</b> <b>Will's</b> strict and gruff uncle, and Vivian <b>Banks,</b> <b>Will's</b> no-nonsense, forthright, and career-minded aunt. Other members of the Banks family include Carlton <b>Banks,</b> <b>Will's</b> preppy and arrogant cousin, Hilary <b>Banks,</b> <b>Will's</b> attractive but dumb, eldest cousin, Ashley <b>Banks,</b> <b>Will's</b> youngest cousin, and Geoffrey, the family's cynical English Butler. Will's lifestyle often clashes with that of his relatives there, and frequently got him or other members of the family into trouble as well.|$|R
25|$|The urban {{location}} of the crime also contributes to its repeat victimization profile, {{a measure of how}} quickly a crime victim will suffer a repeat of the original crime. One study carried out by the Home Office found that in England, one third of banks at which a robbery has occurred will be robbed again within three months, while the same study found that in Tallahassee, Florida, one quarter of robbed <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> suffer repeat robbery within a week, and over half of robbed <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> be robbed again within a month.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.|$|E
25|$|Fear of {{insolvent}} banks: Japanese {{people are}} afraid that <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> collapse so they prefer to buy gold or (United States or Japanese) Treasury bonds instead of saving their money in a bank account. People also save by investing in real estate.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{critical}} factor that determines whether a stream will meander or braid is bank erodibility. A stream with cohesive banks that {{are resistant to}} erosion will form narrow, deep, meandering channels, whereas a stream with highly erodible <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> form wide, shallow channels, sustaining helical flow and resulting {{in the formation of}} braided channels.|$|E

25|$|Stream {{channels}} {{will often}} recover from channelization without human intervention, provided that humans do {{not continue to}} maintain or modify the channel. Gradually, channel beds and stream <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> begin to accumulate sediment, meanders will form, and woody vegetation will take hold, stabilizing the banks. However, this process may take decades: a study found stream channel regeneration took approximately 65 years in channelized streams in West Tennessee. More active methods of restoration may speed the process along.|$|E
25|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007, which resulted from insufficient consumer financial {{protection in the}} US, conflicts {{of interest in the}} credit rating agency industry, and defective transparency requirements in derivatives markets, triggered a massive rise in corporate insolvencies. Contemporary debate, particularly in the banking sector, has shifted to prevention of insolvencies, by scrutinising excessive pay, conflicts of interest among financial services institutions, capital adequacy, and the causes of excessive risk taking. The Banking Act 2009 created a special insolvency regime for banks, called the special resolution regime, envisaging that <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> be taken over by the government in extreme circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Based on a 20 December 2011 memorandum, the EU {{parliament}} {{resolved the}} mandatory dates for {{the adoption of}} the IBAN on 14 February 2012. From 1 February 2014, all national systems for credit transfer and direct debit must be abolished and replaced by an IBAN-based system. This will be extended to all cross-border SEPA transactions from 1 February 2016 (Article 5 Section 7). After these dates the IBAN will be sufficient to identify an account for home and foreign financial transactions in SEPA countries and <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> no longer be permitted to require that the customer supply the BIC for the beneficiary's bank.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, a reboot of the 'Charlie's Angels film franchise' {{is planned}} {{with a new}} 'Charlie's Angels film' - this time Sony Pictures Entertainment has elected to put American actress, director, and {{producer}} Elizabeth Banks in the director's chair. Banks - who produced and then directed the enormously successful female-centric Pitch Perfect franchise - seems like the natural fit for a freshly empowered take on the 1970s Charlie's Angels TV formula. As The Hollywood Reporter first broke back in September, <b>Banks</b> <b>will</b> also produce the upcoming film with partner and husband Max Handelman. In April 2016, Banks signed up to direct {{a revival of the}} classic Charlie's Angels TV series.|$|E
25|$|Under an MMT {{framework}} where {{government spending}} injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw {{it from the}} banking system, government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. If on a particular day, the government spends more than it taxes, reserves {{have been added to}} the banking system (see vertical transactions). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the short-term interest rate down to the support rate (or alternately, to zero if a support rate is not in place). At this point <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the support rate.|$|E
25|$|The Credit CARD Act of 2009 {{requires}} that consumers opt into over-limit charges. Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting {{this as a}} benefit as it may avoid {{the possibility of a}} future transaction being declined. Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees. Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not. Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee. This legislation took effect on 22 February 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills {{how long it would take}} them to pay off the balance.|$|E
50|$|However a {{different}} outcome is also possible. Since banks lend out at long maturity, they cannot quickly call in their loans. And {{even if they}} tried to call in their loans, borrowers {{would be unable to}} pay back quickly, since their loans were, by assumption, used to finance long-term investments. Therefore, if all depositors attempt to withdraw their funds simultaneously, a <b>bank</b> <b>will</b> run out of money long before it is able to pay all the depositors. The <b>bank</b> <b>will</b> be able to pay the first depositors who demand their money back, but if all others attempt to withdraw too, the <b>bank</b> <b>will</b> go bankrupt and the last depositors will be left with nothing.|$|R

25|$|Iceland {{had been}} hit {{especially}} hard by the Great Recession that began in December 2007, because {{of the failure of}} its banking system and a subsequent economic crisis. Before the crash of the country's three largest banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, their combined debt exceeded approximately six times the nation's gross domestic product of ‚Ç¨14billion ($19billion). In October 2008, the Icelandic parliament passed emergency legislation to minimise the impact of the Financial crisis. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. Icelandic officials, including central bank governor Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson, stated that the state did not intend to take over any of the banks' foreign debts or assets. Instead, new banks were established to take on the domestic operations of the banks, and the old <b>banks</b> <b>will</b> be run into bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{both the}} {{monetary}} hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz {{as well as the}} debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered aggregate demand, a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. <b>Banks</b> <b>will</b> react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a credit crunch which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.|$|E
