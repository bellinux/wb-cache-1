5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{the only}} child of Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive to adulthood. Her younger {{half-brother}} Edward VI (son of Henry and Jane Seymour) succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine. When Edward became mortally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he opposed her Catholicism. On his death, leading politicians tried to proclaim Lady Jane Grey as queen. Mary assembled a force in East Anglia and deposed Jane, who was ultimately beheaded. Mary was—excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the Empress Matilda—the first queen regnant of England. In 1554, Mary married Philip of Spain, becoming queen consort of Habsburg Spain on his accession in 1556, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> visited Spain.|$|E
5|$|She {{then moved}} to Portland and practiced law. Women's rights groups {{promoted}} Hobbs as a candidate to run for governor, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> ran for office. Within a few years Hobbs became the commissioner of Oregon State Industrial Accident Commission, working on getting taxes due on the Oregon & California Lands. In 1917, with the United States entering World War I, she began a long association with the Red Cross. From 1917 to 1922 she worked in Europe, including time spent as {{the chief of the}} casualty division in Paris, France. In that position Hobbs was responsible for notifying dead soldiers' next of kin. She returned to Europe in the 1930s, working in the Rhine Valley when it was occupied by France.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. She was {{at the height of}} her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> managed to feel at home there.|$|E
5|$|Within the year, Edward {{caused a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by announcing {{his desire to}} marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against {{the teaching of the}} Anglican church, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings. Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately. She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, the reserved and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> wavered in her disapproval of his actions.|$|E

25|$|MacDonald {{also made}} a few nightclub appearances. She sang and danced at The Sands and The Sahara in Las Vegas in 1953, The Coconut Grove in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> felt entirely {{comfortable}} in the smoky atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Teira Batey, 28, of Gary, Indiana, left to meet {{a friend}} on January 13, 2014 <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> returned. Her family waited to hear from her {{for a few days}} but {{reported}} her missing later that month. Her body was found in an abandoned house at 1800 East 19th Avenue in Gary on October 19.|$|E

6000|$|... “That {{is why she}} was {{so anxious}} to come,” said Mrs. Norbury; “she put off another {{engagement}} in order to accept my invitation. She’s had visions and dreams, and all those sort of things, that have come true in a most marvellous manner, <b>but</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>never</b> actually seen a ghost, and she’s longing to have that experience. She belongs to that Research Society, you know.” ...|$|R

25|$|She {{began her}} {{education}} in France at Vouvray on the Loire. After arriving to Mexico, she continued at the Liceo Franco-Mexicano, then at Eden Hall {{and high school}} at the Sacred Heart Covent in the late 1940s. In 1953, she returned to Mexico, where she learned to type, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> went to university. Instead, she began working at the Excélsior newspaper.|$|E
25|$|Lopez {{was growing}} {{surrounded}} by shoes and everything related to shoe production. Her observations {{and attention to}} the techniques gave her deep knowledge of the shoe construction and design concepts. Later, in the interview for the Spanish Magazine Surrealista, Lopez admitted that she was always attracted by art and creative process <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> really thought to work neither in the shoe industry nor in fashion.|$|E
25|$|Prior to her brief {{reign as}} regent, {{she had been}} a close adviser of her brother since 1369, and the de facto ruler of the kingdom since the early 1380s. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> gained the support of the court. Powerful factions of the court used her alleged {{long-term}} affair with her much younger nephew-in-law Smim Maru to undermine her influence. When her nephew and adopted son Binnya Nwe raised a rebellion in 1383, Chief Minister Zeik-Bye secretly sided with Nwe.|$|E

25|$|She {{had made}} a similar claim in the past which she did not pursue. On August 18, 1996, the dancer – then 18 years old – told {{a police officer in}} Creedmoor she had been raped by three men in June 1993, {{according}} to a police document. The officer who took the woman's report at that time asked her to write a detailed timeline of the night's events and bring the account back to the police, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> returned.|$|E
25|$|Sarah Walker was, {{as some of}} Hazlitt's friends could see, {{a fairly}} {{ordinary}} girl. She had aspirations to better herself, and a famous author seemed like a prize catch, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> really understood Hazlitt. When another lodger named Tomkins came along, she entered into a romantic entanglement with him as well, leading each of her suitors {{to believe he was}} the sole object of her affection. With vague words, she evaded absolute commitment until she could decide which she liked better or was the more advantageous catch.|$|E
25|$|She {{applied for}} {{admission}} to various convents, but she was rejected because she could not afford a dowry. Eventually, the Poor Clares in Münster agreed to accept her, provided she would learn to play the organ. She went to the organist Söntgen in Coesfeld to study music and learn to play the organ, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> got around to it because the poverty of the Söntgen family prompted her to work there to help them, and she sacrificed her small savings for that. Later, one of the Söntgen daughters entered the convent with her.|$|E

25|$|The {{victims of}} the first attack, Jimmy Hollis and Mary Jeanne Larey, were the only victims to give a {{description}} of their attacker. They described him as being six feet tall with a white mask over his face with holes cut out for his eyes and mouth. Although Hollis believed {{he was a young}} dark-tanned white man under 30 years old, Larey believed he was a light-skinned African-American. The only other surviving victim was Katie Starks, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> saw her assailant. Since Hollis and Larey were the only survivors to give a description, it cannot be known if the killer wore a mask during the other attacks.|$|E
25|$|Diana Rebollar, 9, {{was killed}} on August 8, 1994. She had been beaten, sexually {{assaulted}} and strangled. She lived in the Heights area of Houston, {{at the front of}} a small duplex. One day, she went to the neighborhood store to buy a bag of sugar. Employees of the store saw her leave the store safely, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> returned home. She was found the next day on a loading dock behind a building. One lead for police was given by a neighbor who described a van that frequented the area. She was connected to the Carmen Del Estrada case by the killer's MO: a rope with a bamboo stick attached was found around her neck.|$|E
25|$|George Mueller {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri, on July 16, 1918. His mother, a high school graduate, was from Belleville, Illinois and had been a secretary, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> worked after marriage. His father was an {{electrician}} who began working as a boy and never went to high school, but later became superintendent of an electrical motor repair shop in St. Louis. Both parents were English speakers, but also spoke German, although Mueller never learned it well enough to converse. He went to Benton School in St. Louis until the 8th grade, {{when he and his}} parents moved to a larger house in the country called Bel Nor, and later graduated from Normandy High School.|$|E
