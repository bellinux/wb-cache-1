5|$|Although Constantine was {{reluctant}} to leave England, his poor health necessitated a return to Trinidad, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could do so {{he died of a}} heart attack, probably brought about by bronchitis, on 1 July 1971.

5|$|Bart and Marge {{take the}} lizards to the Springfield Birdwatching Society. Principal Skinner, {{a member of}} the society, {{explains}} that they are Bolivian tree lizards, a type of lizard that steals a bird’s eggs and leaves their own eggs to be watched after by the mother bird, which is then eaten by the offspring once they hatch. Skinner says the lizards must be killed by law, because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the lizards glide to the ground, where they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|E

5|$|Koss {{arrives on}} board Enterprise {{to speak to}} his wife, T'Pol. He gives her an IDIC pendant from her mother, who he {{explains}} is also a Syrrannite. The pendant projects a map showing a path across a desert on Vulcan called “the Forge”, which Archer believes will lead them to both T'Pau and T'Pol's mother. T'Pol and Archer leave the ship and begin to make the crossing, following the map. They soon encounter another traveller, calling himself Arev, who assists, but remains distrustful of them. A sand-fire storm kills Arev, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> dies, he forcefully performs a mind meld with Archer to transfer his katra. After burying him, a focussed Archer leads T'Pol directly to the concealed T'Karath Sanctuary, where they are quickly captured.|$|E
5|$|Marthinus Pretorius {{hoped to}} achieve either {{federation}} or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could contemplate this {{he would have}} to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but Stephanus Schoeman, Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts.|$|E

At the prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated with those who find the fallen meteorites, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{had begun}} with an {{unsuccessful}} expedition against Naxos, {{a joint venture}} between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Milesian tyrant Aristagoras. In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy. The other Ionian cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies. Aristagoras then appealed to the states of mainland Greece for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to send troops.|$|E

5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava {{then takes}} Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God. Mithra demands Bhairava admit {{his love for}} her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the puja and, using her own blood, paints an image on a nearby rock of Bhairava leaving his true love to do his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev and Sher Khan's army have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive shortly, and Sher Khan {{challenges}} Bhairava to battle his soldiers. Bhairava boldly accepts the challenge and kills a hundred soldiers, but is severely injured in the process. Sher Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra fatally, but he is in turn killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he follows her and falls to his own death.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli {{agreed to}} Wood's {{proposed}} changes, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could {{set to work}} there were more legal complications. In the years since Thunderball, Kevin McClory had set up two film companies {{and was trying to}} make a new Bond film in collaboration with Sean Connery and novelist Len Deighton. McClory got wind of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film Thunderball, back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend the already ongoing legal dispute that could have delayed the production of The Spy Who Loved Me, Broccoli requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.|$|E
