40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} evaluation of a novel distributed channel allocation scheme that attains a high resource reuse in cellular networks. A suitable interference model has been envisaged. Resources are nominally assigned to cells with Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA), according to a given reuse distance. Whenever a channel demand from a mobile user does not find a free nominal resource in a cell, a channel is temporarily borrowed violating the reuse distance constraint, provided that the co-channel interference level is acceptable. As soon as a nominal channel becomes available in this cell, the <b>borrowed</b> <b>resource</b> is released (virtual queuing). The performance of the proposed channel allocation scheme has been evaluated considering both uniform and non-uniform traffic patterns. A performance analysis approach has been also developed and validated by simulations. Comparisons with the classical FCA scheme and other dynamic and borrowing channel allocation strategies have permitted to highlight the good performance of the proposed technique...|$|E

The author proposes {{the model of}} a new combination appearance and those possible consequences, which this introduction causes in economic system. The presented model shows that {{the emergence of a}} new combination (sector) is not based only on the resource withdrawing from the former combination, but it requires the creation of a new resource. Thereby, the principle of 'creative destruction' is modified and the principle of 'combinatorial augmentation' is suggested. Fundamentally the important condition for economic evolution is to create a new resource for the new combination, not just <b>borrowing</b> <b>resources</b> from the old combinations to the new ones.

40|$|The {{provision}} of cloud resources to meet user demands in 5 G wireless networks is a challenging task {{due to the}} high workload predicted to be experienced by cloud service providers (CSPs).

40|$|The factual, {{not only}} formal {{capacity}} of {{local governments to}} appeal to <b>borrowed</b> <b>resources</b> is, considering the current conditions, a prerequisite for ensuring {{economic and social development}} of local communities. In this paper we intend to position the main theoretical and empirical evidences on local governments' indebtedness capacity, mainly focusing on its sizing according to Romanian regulatory framework. With respect to previous research, the issue approached is one of great interest as it has not been, in the Romanian literature on local public finances, subject to a separate analysis of proportions. The undertaken analysis comprises a quantitative dimension, based on processed data from the consolidated general budget of Romanian local governments for 2007 - 2009, in permanent conjunction with monitoring and analysis of the involved qualitative aspects. To ensure the relevance of the research results, the analysis undertaken refers to the legal framework in function throughout the considered period of time, without involving the legislative changes operated in mid- 2010. The main conclusions drawn from our analysis indicate that, considering the current Romanian socio-economic environment, under the impact of specific factors of different nature, the legal indebtedness capacity is far from being well valued, thus bringing its benefits to local communities development. This conclusion is valid from a global perspective as well as for different types of local communities. This appears to be inconsistent with the permanently claimed need to fund important local public investments, mainly in infrastructure, indicating, despite the high legal indebtedness capacity, the lack of factual access to <b>borrowed</b> <b>resources.</b> We suggest, therefore, to introduce the concept of effective indebtedness capacity, the result of a particularized correlation for different local governments between legal indebtedness capacity and the manifestation of several factors with specific action and we intend to contribute, by future research, to its measurement. legal indebtedness capacity, effective indebtedness capacity, local governments, local public debt, local autonomy...|$|R

Spread spectrum also facilitate that centrally controlled base stations dynamically <b>borrow</b> <b>resources</b> from each other depending on the traffic load, simply by increasing the maximum allowed number of simultaneous users in one cell (the maximum allowed interference level from the users in the cell), and decreasing it in an adjacent cell.

Indeed, we show that the country may choose to retain reserves instead of employing them to inject the liquidity needed to bring the production project to maturity. sovereign debt, international reserves, liquidity shock, strategic default...|$|R

However, when the economy is in the middle stages of development, multiple equilibrium arise since the extemality affects the performance of the credit market. The multiplicity of equilibria disappear when the credit market is perfect or it does not exist.
