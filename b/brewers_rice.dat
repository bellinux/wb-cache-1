40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} effects of {{various levels of}} nitrogen and potassium application on kernel processing characteristics of rice cultivars, an experiment was developed in 2004 and 2005 using Tarrom (a local Iranian landrace) and Neda (an Iranian improved cultivar). In this experiment four levels of nitrogen fertilizer (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N ha - 1 from urea source) and four levels of potassium fertilizer (0, 75, 150 and 225 kg K 2 O ha - 1 from potassium sulfate source) have been applied using a split factorial design with 3 replications. Nitrogen fertilizer have been applied in three stages (1 / 3 in transplanting stage, 1 / 3 in tillering stage and finally 1 / 3 in flowering initiation stage) and potassium fertilizer have been applied in two stages (1 / 2 in transplanting stage and 1 / 2 in shooting stage). Results showed that application of nitrogen cause an increase in amount of bran production and have shown significant effects on percentages of bran, head and <b>brewers</b> <b>rice,</b> husking efficiency and transformation degree. However, potassium application has increased percent of bran and husking efficiency and has decrease percentages of <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> and has not demonstrated significant effects on percentages of husk, head rice and transformation degree. Furthermore, simultaneous application of nitrogen and potassium in Tarrom genotype has not shown significantly effects on percentages of husk, head and <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> and transformation degree. In Neda, cultivar has not also shown significant effects on percentages of bran production, head and <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> and husking efficiency, respectively. In Tarrom genotype amount of husk, bran, <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> and transformation degree were higher than in Neda cultivar, however, amount of head rice and husking efficiency in Neda cultivar were higher than in Tarrom genotype...|$|E
40|$|<b>Brewer’s</b> <b>rice</b> is a nutritionally rich {{by-product}} of rice milling industries but remained unutilized {{due to its}} high susceptibility to lipid oxidation. Thus, it is desirable to develop certain strategies to stabilize the <b>brewer’s</b> <b>rice</b> for food application. In the present study, the effects of microwave heating, gamma irradiation, and chemical (hydrochloric acid) treatments in stabilizing <b>brewer’s</b> <b>rice</b> were investigated. Result showed that microwave-heated <b>brewer’s</b> <b>rice</b> contained lower FFA content as compared with control and irradiation. However, FFA content in <b>brewer’s</b> <b>rice</b> increased significantly (p < 0. 05) during storage for all methods, except for hydrochloric acid (HCl) treatment. All the stabilizations methods showed non-significant (p < 0. 05) effect on protein, fat, and ash content. However, microwave and chemical treatment significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced moisture content. All methods showed no significant (p < 0. 05) reduction on phenolic contents but significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced the γ-oryzanol and α-tocopherol contents. Microwave heating was able to reduce the oxidation of <b>brewer’s</b> <b>rice</b> without affecting other bioactive molecules present in <b>brewer’s</b> <b>rice.</b> Therefore, microwave heating {{can be considered as}} the most suitable technique for stabilizing <b>brewer’s</b> <b>rice...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine whether <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> can replace all corn in diets for swine and reduce fecal excretion of Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) without compromising performance and carcass quality of growing-finishing pigs. Sixteen Yorkshire x Duroc x Hampshire crosses (BW = 77 Â± 2. 5 kg) {{were randomly assigned to}} either corn/soybean meal (CSM; control) or brewers rice/soybean meal (RSM) diet. Both diets were formulated to contain 14 % CP. The RSM pigs had a greater reduction (p - 1) and P (0. 007 Vs. 0. 008 kg pig - 1), lower (p - 1), than CSM pigs. Compared with CSM pigs, RSM pigs gained faster (0. 712 Vs. 0. 581 kg pig - 1 per day; p 0. 10) affect carcass yield and Loin Eye Area (LEA), however, RSM pigs tended (p< 0. 10) to lay more back fat than CSM pigs. In conclusion, <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> can replace all corn in diets for growing-finishing pigs, reduce fecal excretion of N and P, increase pig performance with no effect on carcass quality. Consequently, feeding <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> instead of corn may help reduce environmental pollution attributed to excessive fecal excretion of N and P in growing-finishing pigs...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} diets with {{different}} starch sources {{on the total}} tract apparent digestibility and glucose and insulin responses in cats were investigated. Six experimental diets consisting of 35 % starch were extruded, each containing {{one of the following}} ingredients: cassava flour, <b>brewers</b> <b>rice,</b> corn, sorghum, peas, or lentils. The experiment was carried out on 36 cats with 6 replications per diet in a completely randomized block design. The <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> diet offered greater DM, OM, and GE digestibility than the sorghum, corn, lentil, and pea diets (P 93 % for all the diets, proving that despite the low carbohydrate content of carnivorous diets, cats can efficiently digest this nutrient when it is properly processed into kibble. Mean and maximum glucose concentration and area under the glucose curve were greater for the corn-based diet than the cassava flour, sorghum, lentil, and pea diets (P < 0. 05). The corn-based diets led to greater values for the mean glucose incremental concentration (10. 2 mg/dL), maximum glucose incremental concentration (24. 8 mg/dL), and area under the incremental glucose curve (185. 5 mg. dL(- 1). h(- 1)) than the lentil diet (2. 9 mg/dL, 3. 1 mg/dL, and - 40. 4 mg. dL(- 1). h(- 1), respectively; P < 0. 05). When compared with baseline values, only the corn diet stimulated an increase in the glucose response, occurring at 4 and 10 h postmeal (P < 0. 05). The corn-based diet resulted in greater values for maximum incremental insulin concentration and area under the incremental insulin curve than the lentil-based diet (P < 0. 05). However, plasma insulin concentrations rose in relation to the basal values for cats fed corn, sorghum, pea, and <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> diets (P < 0. 05). Variations in diet digestibility and postprandial response can be explained by differences in the chemical composition of the starch source, including fiber content and granule structure, and also differences in the chemical compositions of the diets. The data suggest that starch has less of an effect on the cat postprandial glucose and insulin responses than on those of dogs and humans. This {{can be explained by the}} metabolic peculiarities of felines, which may slow and prolong starch digestion and absorption, leading to the delayed, less pronounced effects on their blood responses.

40|$|The {{nutritive value}} of rice by {{products}} in Costa Rica, Chemical composition, availability and use. By-products from the milling of rice, as obtained in Costa Rica, were examined for chemical composition and availability in the country. Data {{were taken from}} the CINA feed data base and from the literature. In Costa Rica, rice bran is a mixture of rice polishings and rice bran, without the broken rice and contain all the layers of the rice obtained in the milling operation of brushing the grain to polish the kernel. It may contain small quantity of hulls and germ of the rice. It must contain no less than 9 % of crude protein and no more than 13 % of crude fiber. The data show an availability of rice bran of 16. 800 tons with an average protein content of 13. 6 % and 8. 5 % of crude fiber. The digestible energy swine was 3924 Kcal/kg of dry matter and 3340 Kcal/kg of dry matter of metabolizable energy for poultry. The <b>brewers</b> <b>rice</b> (polished and broken grain) and the rice hulls showed a chemical analysis typical for this type of products' It is suggested to control the marketing of rice bran mixtured with gro. rlá hulls which is illegal in CostaRica' It should be marketed as "bran with hulis"...|$|E

40|$|Controls on {{the density}} and {{porosity}} of biochar: Catherine <b>Brewer,</b> <b>Rice</b> University Engineering biochar through production conditions or for specific applications requires understanding of biochar properties. This session explores trends in biochar properties related to production conditions and analytical {{methods used to}} measure biochar properties. Characterization of biochars from different thermo-chemical processing of biogenic waste: Sabrina Eichenauer, University of Applied Sciences THM Coalification of biomass opens up new strategies in regional material flow management. It homogenizes organic wastes or residues of different origin into a uniform solid product composed of mostly char and ash. Different methods for thermo-chemical conversion are available. Wet biomass favors Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC) in water under {{high pressure and temperature}} around T = 200 °C. Dry organic residues are more appropriate for pyrolysis or gasification systems working in a temperature range of T = 300 °C to 800 °C. This presentation will discuss chars produced from biomass using HTC or dry pyrolysis in form of Low Temperature Conversion (LTC) focusing on the chemical nature of carbonaceous materials produced depending on conversion technique and starting material. The overall results of the comparative analyses show that thermo-chemically treated biomass can lead to products with different characteristics and thus to different kinds of application according to the type of biochar. Effect of Wood 2 ̆ 6 Cardboard Biochars on Plasticity, Shrinkage 2 ̆ 6 Moisture Retention of Non-Hydric Spodosols: Jeff Licht Investigators conducted a four part study to examine the effect of biochar amendment on plasticity, shrinkage, volumetric soil moisture and adsorption. These were conducted in laboratory and field tests involving clay soils in Massachusetts using chars derived from wood and cardboard and where pyrolyzed using TLUDs. Chars were found to increase soil moisture and adsorption. Cardboard based char was found to produce results matching or surpassing those of the wood char.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that dogs sensitized to soy antigen would produce significantly greater amounts of antigen specific IgE antibody compared to a control population before and after challenges with soy, hydrolyzed soy, and non-soy diets. Further, we sought to evaluate important allergenic components of soy using Western blot analysis. Lastly, absorption and mucosal function testing using inert sugars were evaluated for our sensitized and non-sensitized controls. Eight dogs (6 female, 2 male) were sensitized to whole soy using an established protocol. Seven dogs (3 female, 4 male) roughly age matched were used as controls. The dogs were randomly split into three groups. All dogs were fed an elimination diet of egg and <b>Brewer's</b> <b>rice</b> for six weeks. Samples were collected and each group was fed a diet of soy and rice flour, hydrolyzed soy and rice flour, or corn and rice flour for three weeks. Samples were collected and each group was fed the elimination diet followed by challenge with each of the diets. Serum was collected and stored for allergen specific IgE semi-quantitation and Western blot analysis using whole soy fractionated into globulin and whey components. A solution of monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars was administered in a volume determined by weight. Six hours after administration the dogs were catheterized and the entire urine volume was collected for measurement of sugar recovery by high pressure chromatography, followed by pulsed amphometric detection. There was a statistically significant difference in serum IgE between sensitized and control dogs after the elimination diet, and also for each of the challenged diets. There were differences detected by Western blot analysis for allergens within the soy globulin and whey fractions for sensitized dogs compared to control dogs. There were no significant differences between sensitized and control dogs for sugar recovery for any of the diets. We conclude that although there were significant differences in measurable IgE between sensitized and control dogs, we were unable to differentiate these groups using gastrointestinal mucosal permeability and function testing...|$|R

40|$|Pollen {{substitute}} diets are {{a valuable}} resource for maintaining strong and health honey bee colonies. Specific diets {{may be useful in}} one region or country and inadequate or economically unviable in others. We compared two artificial protein diets that had been formulated from locally-available ingredients in Brazil with bee bread and a non-protein sucrose diet. Groups of 100 newly-emerged, adult workers of Africanized honey bees in Brazil and European honey bees in the USA were confined in small cages and fed on one of four diets for seven days. The artificial diets included a high protein diet made of soy milk powder and albumin, and a lower protein level diet consisting of soy milk powder, <b>brewer’s</b> yeast and <b>rice</b> bran. The initial protein levels in newly emerged bees were approximately 18 - 21 μg/μL hemolymph. After feeding on the diets for seven days, the protein levels in the hemolymph were similar among the protein diet groups (~ 37 - 49 μg/μL after seven days), although Africanized bees acquired higher protein levels, increasing 145 and 100 % on diets D 1 and D 2, respectively, versus 83 and 60 % in the European bees. All the protein diets resulted in significantly higher levels of protein than sucrose solution alone. In the field, the two pollen substitute diets were tested during periods of low pollen availability in the field in two regions of Brazil. Food consumption, population development, colony weight, and honey production were evaluated to determine the impact of the diets on colony strength parameters. The colonies fed artificial diets had a significant improvement in all parameters, while control colonies dwindled during the dearth period. We conclude that these two artificial protein diets have good potential as pollen substitutes during dearth periods and that Africanized bees more efficiently utilize artificial protein diets than do European honey bees.
