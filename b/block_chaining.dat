25|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{security}} researchers at the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London reported an attack that can become effective using only 234 encrypted messages. While yet not a practical attack for most purposes, this result is sufficiently close to one that {{it has led to}} speculation that it is plausible that some state cryptologic agencies may already have better attacks that render RC4 insecure. Given that as of 2013 a large amount of TLS traffic uses RC4 to avoid recent attacks on block ciphers that use cipher <b>block</b> <b>chaining,</b> if these hypothetical better attacks exist, then this would make the TLS-with-RC4 combination insecure against such attackers in a large number of practical scenarios.|$|E
25|$|On September 23, 2011 {{researchers}} Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo {{demonstrated a}} {{proof of concept}} called BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS) using a Java applet to violate same origin policy constraints, for a long-known cipher <b>block</b> <b>chaining</b> (CBC) vulnerability in TLS 1.0: an attacker observing 2 consecutive ciphertext blocks C0, C1 can test if the plaintext block P1 is equal to x by choosing the next plaintext block P2 = x ^ C0 ^ C1; due to how CBC works C2 will be equal to C1 if x = P1. Practical exploits had not been previously demonstrated for this vulnerability, which was originally discovered by Phillip Rogaway in 2002. The vulnerability of the attack had been fixed with TLS 1.1 in 2006, but TLS 1.1 had not seen wide adoption prior to this attack demonstration.|$|E

Thus, skip-link chain spreads wear over half the number of teeth and has worse sprocket durability than a symmetrical roller chain. Chain wear is dominated by wear between pins and bushings, and this is the same as a modern roller chain.|$|R

Together with window of opportunity it also poses quite a few challenges. One of the most important and unresolved challenge is vulnerability in security and privacy in IoT. This is mainly due to lack of a global decentralized standard even though characteristically IoT is based on distributed systems. Due to lack of standard IoT has interoperability issue between different devices and platform suppliers which implicitly creates need of reliance on the suppliers as they store and control user data. There is no decentralized industry wide solution which can offer the control of user data and security back to the user. While experts in IoT are still wondering on solving the challenge, a new <b>Block</b> <b>chain</b> technology has surfaced in past few years and showed signs of disruptive innovation in financial industry.

50|$|The Solidus Bond {{utilizes}} SHA-256 elliptical encryption on a decentralized <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> {{to create}} and redeem debt instruments issued in a digital currency. The bonds are brought into existence upon command by any investor via algorithm rather than fiat. Coupon payments and bond redemption are also executed by algorithm, {{eliminating the need for}} brokerages and theoretically reducing bond duration to zero, making credit ratings obsolete. Investors choose bond size and bond maturity of seven days to 10 years. Payments are emitted from the <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> to the SwiftCoin wallet chosen by the investor at the time of bond creation. There are no commissions or fees to pay. The only requirement to purchase a Solidus Bond is a SwiftCoin wallet and a sufficient balance of the SwiftCoin digital currency to cover the face value of the bond. Bond ownership is conveyed solely through possession. There are no accounts, records, or user databases and the <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> ledger is not public. Interest rates are set by the market and were 18% in 2016. Holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies convert to SwiftCoin to access the Solidus Bond <b>block</b> <b>chain,</b> then cash back into their initial currency at bond expiry. Solidus Bonds are not open source. Unlike Bitcoin, Solidus Bonds cannot be mined.|$|R
