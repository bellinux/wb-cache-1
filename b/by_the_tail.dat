5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that {{he was looking for a}} horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E
5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough {{to allow it to}} keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to the tail base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus, the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E

5|$|From {{early in}} its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start {{to develop and}} are used as an {{accessory}} breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, keratinized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, {{but the number of}} rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification. In the Pipidae, with the exception of Hymenochirus, the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small catfish. Their tails are stiffened by a notochord, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December, UN Command {{temporarily}} switched some of {{the responsibilities}} of Task Element 95.11 and the US Fifth Air Force. Consequently, Sydney was required to provide air support for convoys between Japan and Korea amongst the other duties of her fifth patrol, which commenced on 7 December. On 8 December, a second RAN pilot was killed; although successfully bailing out from a flak-damaged Sea Fury, he was struck <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of his own aircraft, and died from wounds. Four other aircraft were damaged that day. Clear weather, which lasted until 14 December, allowed the carrier to maintain {{a high rate of}} attack against North Korean troop concentrations, railways, and coastal vessels, while providing air cover for the Task Element. Ending on 18 December, the fifth patrol was the most costly to Sydneys CAG, with one pilot killed, five aircraft destroyed, and another 25 aircraft heavily damaged. The carrier was in Kure for Christmas, and relieved USS Badoeng Strait on 27 December, the start of her sixth patrol. The remaining days of 1951 were spent providing air cover in the Inchon area for both UN ground forces and supply convoys returning to Japan. On New Year's Day 1952, Sydneys aircraft helped repel the North Korean invasion of the island of Yongho Do. The third RAN pilot to be lost in Korea died on 2 January while performing a combat air patrol around the carrier; personnel on the flight deck saw the aircraft fly into a cloud, but not emerge. No wreckage was found, and it was assumed that the plane dived into the Yellow Sea. For most of the patrol, RAN aircraft attacked artillery emplacements and concentrations of junks in the Cho Do-Sok To area, while also proving air support for South Korean Army and irregular forces.|$|E

25|$|Prior to Lloyd, {{several authors}} had {{reported}} this phenomenon and {{had attempted to}} explain it by positing that creatures caught <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> repeatedly set off the trap as they thrash about {{in an attempt to}} escapeeven as their tails are actively digested by the plant.

25|$|Some {{species of}} opossums have prehensile tails, {{although}} dangling <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> {{is more common}} among juveniles. An opossum may also use its tail as a brace and a fifth limb when climbing. The tail is occasionally used as a grip to carry bunches of leaves or bedding materials to the nest. A mother will sometimes carry her young upon her back, where they will cling tightly even when she is climbing or running.|$|E

25|$|The second Versailles version (267 × 230cm; 105 × 90½in) shows a {{black and}} white horse with {{complete}} tack but lacking the martingale. The girth is red. The cloak is orange-red, the collar is black, and the embroidery of the gauntlet is very simple and almost unnoticeable. The scarf tied around Napoleon's waist is light blue. The officer with the sabre is again masked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of the horse. Napoleon's features are older, he has shorter hair, and—as in the Charlottenburg version—there is the faint trace of a smile. The embroidery and the style of the bicorne suggest that the picture was completed after 1804. The picture is not dated but is signed L.DAVID.|$|E
25|$|Geckos, skinks, {{and other}} lizards that are {{captured}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> will shed {{part of the}} tail structure through a process called autotomy and thus be able to flee. The detached tail will continue to wiggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. The detached tails of leopard geckos can wiggle for up to 20 minutes. In many species the tails are of a separate and dramatically more intense color {{than the rest of}} the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first. In the shingleback skink and some species of geckos, the tail is short and broad and resembles the head, so that the predators may attack it rather than the more vulnerable front part.|$|E
