5|$|Several factors {{external}} to ice sheets may cause Heinrich events, but such factors {{would have to}} be large to overcome attenuation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> volumes of ice involved (MacAyeal 1993).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its great}} reactivity, all {{chlorine}} in the Earth's crust {{is in the}} form of ionic chloride compounds, which includes table salt. It is the second-most abundant halogen (after fluorine) and twenty-first most abundant chemical element in Earth's crust. These crustal deposits are nevertheless dwarfed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> reserves of chloride in seawater.|$|E
5|$|In 1600, as Russia was {{entering}} {{a period of}} instability, the Commonwealth proposed a union with the Russian state. This failed move was followed by many other similarly unsuccessful, often adventurous attempts, some involving military invasions, other dynastic and diplomatic manipulations and scheming. While {{the differences between the}} two societies and empires proved in the end too formidable to overcome, the Polish–Lithuanian state ended up in 1619, after the Truce of Deulino, with the greatest ever expansion of its territory. At the same time it was weakened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> military effort made.|$|E
5000|$|SC 402 is a two-lane {{rural road}} that begins 0.2 mi from US 52/US 17 Alt near Moncks Corner; the {{highways}} are connected by an unnamed secondary road (signage on US 52/US 17 Alt direct travelers [...] "to" [...] SC 402). From there, it goes east, through Cordesville and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Huger</b> Recreational Area, to Huger, where it ends at SC 41. Because it traverses mostly in or along Francis Marion National Forest, {{majority of the}} route is forested.|$|R
50|$|In some heavily forested regions such as Scandinavia and Canada, lumberjacks use {{the river}} to float felled trees {{downstream}} to lumber camps for further processing, saving much effort and cost <b>by</b> transporting <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> heavy logs <b>by</b> natural means.|$|R
25|$|The agriculture-based {{economic}} boom brought about <b>by</b> <b>the</b> train's <b>huge</b> load capacity and greater speed (compared to boats) encouraged waves of migrations to Nueva Ecija {{from places like}} Ilocos, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Tarlac and Bulacan.|$|R
5|$|Kempton and Jankowski relayed Hambleton's {{coordinates}} to King 22, a HC-130 {{search and}} rescue (SAR) aircraft operating just south of Quảng Trị. Recovering Hambleton quickly was essential, as the odds of recovering downed airmen dropped below twenty percent if the aircrew member {{was on the ground}} after four hours. But their efforts would be severely hampered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> number of troops and large quantity of anti-aircraft fire in the area, some of it supporting the NVA's efforts to capture and protect the Cam Lo Bridge near Hambleton's position.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the Little Ice Age, which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the Little Ice Age, the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Lackawanna Steel {{reported}} {{very large}} deficits, driven primarily <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> New York steel mill's aging equipment.|$|E
50|$|<b>By</b> chance, <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> load of starstuff falls onto a ship stolen <b>by</b> George and <b>the</b> Lost Boys, {{causing it}} to float. The flying ship, {{expertly}} handled by Captain Hook, takes the whole party back to Mollusk Island, when Shining Pearl, Fighting Prawn's daughter, has joined forces with the pirates to repel the invaders.|$|R
50|$|<b>By</b> 1899 <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> coal {{deposits}} {{in the settlement}} had attracted additional settlers, and the Pennsylvania Railroad installed a spur line through the community that year. Commercial mining was initiated in 1896 by Dr. James W. Dunwiddie of Pine Flats, Indiana County, who opened up what was then called Nanty Glo No. 1.|$|R
6000|$|The Cowardly Lion, {{looking very}} dignified, was {{stretched}} out upon {{the marble floor}} of the stable, eyeing Hank with a calm and critical gaze, while near <b>by</b> crouched <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> Hungry Tiger, who seemed equally interested in the new animal that had just arrived.

25|$|On 30 March 2009, at the Second South America-Arab League Summit in Qatar, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a petro-currency. It would be backed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> oil reserves of the oil producing countries.|$|E
25|$|While the CH-47 Chinook {{is a large}} {{helicopter}} by American standards, its payload of 28,000 lb is dwarfed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> Soviet-Russian heavy-lift helicopters such as the Mil Mi-26 (44,000 lb) and {{the experimental}} Mil Mi-12 (55,000–88,000 lb), {{and for a long}} time Boeing and the US military had an urge to match or top the Mil heavy lifters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1939 an early Mk I K9788 was fitted with {{a new version of}} the Merlin, the XII. With the success of the trial it was decided to use this version of the Merlin in the Mk II which, it was decided, would be the first version to be {{produced}} exclusively <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> new Lord Nuffield shadow factory at Castle Bromwich.|$|E
50|$|Derivators {{were first}} {{introduced}} by Alexander Grothendieck {{in his long}} unpublished 1983 manuscript Pursuing Stacks. They were then further developed <b>by</b> him in <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> unpublished 1991 manuscript Les Dérivateurs of almost 2000 pages.|$|R
50|$|He then expounds upon why {{states should}} not be allowed to mint their own {{currencies}} or issue paper money, saying that multiple currencies would cause confusion and discrepancies, hurt citizens and fuel animosity between the states. He condemns the state issuance of paper money <b>by</b> citing <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> problems caused <b>by</b> this after <b>the</b> peace in 1783 (paper money issued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> states led to runaway inflation).|$|R
5000|$|The {{mission of}} the Department of Essential Drugs and Medicines of the World Health Organization is [...] "to help save lives and improve health <b>by</b> closing <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> gap between <b>the</b> {{potential}} that essential drugs have to offer and the reality that {{for millions of people}} - particularly the poor and disadvantaged - medicines are unavailable, unaffordable, unsafe or improperly used." ...|$|R
25|$|Buoyed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> {{success of}} the series in the USA, BBC America {{commissioned}} a special straight-to-VHS compilation in 1992. Running at 78 minutes, The Best of Are You Being Served featured newly-shot scenes of Mr Humphries reminiscing with his elderly mother, Annie, about his time working at Grace Brothers. Both roles were played by John Inman. The additional sequences were filmed in America, and directed by Don Hopfer.|$|E
25|$|A gaping North–South divide is a {{major factor}} of {{socio-economic}} weakness. It can be noted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> difference in statistical income between the northern and southern regions and municipalities. The richest department,Alto Adige-South Tyrol, earns 152% of the national GDP per capita, while the poorest region, Calabria, 61%. The unemployment rate (11.1%) stands slightly above the Eurozone average, but the disaggregated figure is 6.6% in the North and 19.2% in the South.|$|E
25|$|Some whales lunge feed on bait balls. Lunge feeding is {{an extreme}} feeding method, in which the whale accelerates from below a bait ball to a high {{velocity}} and then opens its mouth to a large gape angle. This generates the water pressure required to expand its mouth and engulf and filter {{a huge amount of}} water and fish. Lunge feeding <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> rorquals {{is said to be the}} largest biomechanical event on Earth.|$|E
50|$|Over the applause, Hilda and Evadne are {{presented}} with gifts of appreciation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> organisers. <b>Huge</b> bouquets arrive for Hilda, but for Evadne, never more than a meagre token, ranging from the tiniest posy of flowers, via half a dozen eggs in a cardboard carton, to a banjo.|$|R
50|$|The {{west end}} of the Tudor Barn was mostly {{occupied}} by servants, {{as can be seen}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> two <b>huge</b> chimneys there. However, the barn was also used for storage. It can be seen on old maps that the moat was directly connected to <b>the</b> Tudor Barn <b>by</b> a bridge.|$|R
50|$|<b>By</b> then, <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> {{overheads}} {{involved in}} running a world-size independent {{company and the}} underperformance of several releases, notably Billy Idol's much-delayed Cradle of Love album, had forced Wright to sell 50% of Chrysalis Records to EMI. The next year, EMI exercised its option to buy the other half, just after Wright's company topped the singles charts {{for the last time}} with The One And Only by Chesney Hawkes.|$|R
25|$|Much debate {{continues}} over annual fare increases, {{although the}} government has now pledged to keep regulated rail fare increases at Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation {{for the remainder of}} this Parliament. In addition much debate has continued over the financing of various rail schemes driven primarily <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> cost and time overrun on the GWML route modernisation and electrification scheme. In connection with this, and to coincide with the Chancellor's Autumn statement on 25 November 2015, the Bowe and Hendy reports were produced.|$|E
25|$|Under Zhou, Communist {{businessmen}} {{made great}} profits engaging in currency trading and commodity speculation, {{especially in the}} international markets for American dollars and gold. Zhou's most lucrative business was generated by several opium plantations that Zhou established in remote areas. Although the CCP had been engaged in the eradication of opium smoking since its establishment, Zhou justified opium production and distribution in KMT-controlled areas <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> profits generated for the CCP, and by the debilitating effects that opium addiction might have on KMT soldiers and government officials.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Dutch {{rock and}} pop music (Nederpop) {{originated}} in the 1960s, heavily influenced by popular music from the United States and Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s the lyrics were mostly in English, and some tracks were instrumental. Bands such as Shocking Blue, Golden Earring, Tee Set, George Baker Selection and Focus enjoyed international success. As of the 1980s, more and more pop musicians started working in the Dutch language, partly inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> success of the band Doe Maar. Today Dutch rock and pop music thrives in both languages, with some artists recording in both.|$|E
50|$|Banasree is {{currently}} experiencing {{a real estate}} boom where demand for apartments is very high due to its centralized location in Dhaka city. Furthermore, developers are seizing <b>the</b> opportunity <b>by</b> meeting <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> wave of demand by constructing new apartments and commercial buildings by going into a 50:50 ratio joint-venture land development with landowners of vacant plots. This {{has led to a}} skyrocketing of real estate prices in the area.|$|R
30|$|Though the {{interpretation}} of the phenomenon was not clear, we hypothesized that a single-base mismatch at the outermost position of the ssDNA-GNP probes may induce a repulsive interaction [17]. The repulsive interaction was amplified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> GNPs’ <b>huge</b> specific surface area. Ultimately, the variable stability between these two dsDNA-GNPs was large enough to be observed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> naked eye.|$|R
50|$|The 41.70 m high {{monument}} is in {{the form}} of four square columns 7.5 m wide with 10 m space between each other, topped by a concrete slab of 25 <b>by</b> 25 m. <b>The</b> <b>huge</b> structure is well visible during passage through the Dardanelles.|$|R
25|$|In 927, both {{countries}} were exhausted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> military efforts {{that had taken}} a heavy toll on the population and economy. Simeon's successor Peter negotiated a favourable peace treaty. The Byzantines agreed to recognize him as Emperor of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an independent Patriarchate, {{as well as to}} pay an annual tribute. The peace was reinforced with a marriage between Peter and Romanos's granddaughter Irene Lekapene. This agreement ushered in a period of 40 years of peaceful relations between the two powers, a time of stability and prosperity for both Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
25|$|HIV/AIDS {{will drive}} up social and {{healthcare}} costs in India and China, but the broader {{economic and political}} impact {{is likely to be}} readily absorbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> populations of these countries. We do not believe the disease will pose a fundamental threat through 2010 to their status as major regional players, but it will add to the complex problems faced by their leaders. The more HIV/AIDS spreads among young, educated, urban populations, the greater the economic cost of the disease will be for these countries, given the impact on, and the need for, skilled labor.|$|E
25|$|The British {{victory in}} the war sowed some of the seeds of Britain's later {{conflict}} in the American War of Independence. American colonists had been delighted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> swathes of North America that had now been brought under formal British control, but many were angered by the Proclamation of 1763, which {{was an attempt to}} protect Native American territory—and prevent European settlement. Similarly the issue of quartering the British regular troops became a thorny issue, with colonists objecting to their billeting in private homes. Events such as these contributed to a drift apart between the British government and many of its subjects in the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E

60|$|Both {{passengers}} stopped chopping ice to watch. Twenty {{miles of}} Bennett were behind them--room and to spare for {{the sea to}} toss up its mountains toward the sky. Sinking and soaring like a storm-god, <b>the</b> sailor drove <b>by</b> them. <b>The</b> <b>huge</b> sail seemed to grip the boat from the crests of the waves, to tear it bodily out of the water, and fling it crashing and smothering down into the yawning troughs.|$|R
40|$|Most {{analysis}} of NAFTA begins <b>by</b> citing <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> increase in bilateral {{trade between the}} U. S., Canada and Mexico since 1993. U. S. -Mexico trade—exports plus imports—has grown {{three and a half}} times faster than U. S. GDP since NAFTA began in 1994. If NAFTA were solely responsible for that trade, renegotiating it on more favorable terms might have big payoffs. However, there are seven problems with thinking NAFTA has mattered or can matter very much...|$|R
