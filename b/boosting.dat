5000|$|A ball & {{spring type}} <b>boost</b> {{controller}} uses {{the force of}} a spring acting against the <b>boost</b> pressure to control <b>boost.</b> This is installed with one <b>boost</b> signal line coming from the intake somewhere after the turbocharger, and one <b>boost</b> signal line going to the wastegate. A knob changes the force on the spring which in turn dictates how much pressure is on the ball. The tighter the spring, the more <b>boost</b> that is needed to unseat the ball, and allow the <b>boost</b> pressure to reach the wastegate actuator. There is a bleed hole on the <b>boost</b> controller after the ball, to allow the pressurized air that would be trapped between the wastegate actuator and the ball after it is seated again.
