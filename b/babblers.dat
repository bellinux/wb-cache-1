5|$|The melampittas are a family, Melampittidae, of New Guinean birds {{containing}} two enigmatic species. The {{two species}} {{are found in}} two genera, the greater melampitta in the genus Megalampitta and the lesser melampitta in the genus Melampitta. They are little studied and before being established as a family in 2014 their taxonomic relationships with other birds were uncertain, being considered at one time related variously to the pittas, Old World <b>babblers</b> and birds-of-paradise.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} {{including}} treepies, bulbuls, <b>babblers,</b> mynahs and crows were noted. In 2010, {{the first ever}} bird survey was conducted in the Sathyamangalam forests. A total of 230 species of birds were recorded in the survey. In 2010, a small population of critically endangered Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and three other species of vultures were discovered to be thriving in the Moyar river valley. 20 nests were sighted and the population was estimated to consist up of 40 adults. Last sighted in {{the region in the}} 1970s, the rediscovery of the vulture, a bird rapidly disappearing from India, has been significant. Diclofenac, which caused the decline of vulture population was banned in 2006 and since then, vulture numbers have started to grow back.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook nests in {{holes in}} trees {{between one and}} twenty metres (3-70 ft) above the ground. The holes are generally vertical, and mostly in eucalypts, though other trees such as coast banksia (Banksia integrifolia) have been recorded. Some sites are reused for up to 20 years, especially if broods have been successfully raised in them before. Boobooks may also evict other birds such as galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus) to use their hollows, and have used sites abandoned by <b>babblers,</b> crows and ravens. The male does more of the site preparation, such as lining {{the base of the}} hollow with leaves.|$|E
25|$|Birds include Hornbills, Kingfishers, Bulbuls, Parakeets, Doves, Pigeons, <b>babblers,</b> Flycatchers, munias, Swallows, Woodpeckers, Peafowl, Jungle fowl, Partridges. A tiger and lion safari at Tyavarekoppa {{was created}} in the northeastern part of the {{sanctuary}} in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} cuckoos, they are brood-parasitic and hosts {{recorded}} include the common iora, red-whiskered bulbul, white-bellied erpornis, scarlet minivet, bulbuls and small <b>babblers</b> (Stachyris spp.). The eggs {{resemble those of}} the hosts. The incubation and nesting are not well documented. Fledglings of the host are evicted.|$|E
25|$|The {{avifauna}} of Sikkim {{include the}} impeyan pheasant, crimson horned pheasant, snow partridge, Tibetan snowcock, bearded vulture and griffon vulture, {{as well as}} golden eagles, quails, plovers, woodcocks, sandpipers, pigeons, Old World flycatchers, <b>babblers</b> and robins. Sikkim has more than 550 species of birds, {{some of which have}} been declared endangered.|$|E
25|$|An old anecdotal {{record of}} these birds laying their {{eggs in the}} nests of Turdoides <b>babblers</b> has not been {{supported}} by later observers. Laboratory studies have demonstrated cyclic changes in the melanin pigmentation of the tissue surrounding the testes. The dark pigmentation is lost during the breeding season and regained later.|$|E
25|$|Gleaning is {{a common}} feeding {{strategy}} for some groups of birds, including nuthatches, tits (including chickadees), wrens, woodcreepers, treecreepers, Old World flycatchers, Tyrant flycatchers, <b>babblers,</b> Old World warblers, New World warblers, Vireos and some hummingbirds and cuckoos. Many birds make use of multiple feeding strategies, depending {{on the availability of}} different sources of food and opportunities of the moment.|$|E
25|$|The quail-thrushes and jewel <b>babblers</b> are {{medium-sized}} songbirds, 17–28cm in length. They {{have strong}} legs and bills. Males and females often differ in plumage markings. The quail-thrushes are largely brown above, the colour varying to provide camouflage against the soil, but are more boldly marked {{with black and}} white below. Jewel-babblers usually have extensive blue in their plumage. Most species have loud, distinctive songs.|$|E
25|$|This process {{contrasts}} with intragroup competition where individuals work {{against each other}} for selfish reasons. Cooperation exists not only in humans but in other animals as well. The diversity of taxa that exhibits cooperation is quite large, ranging from zebra herds to pied <b>babblers</b> to African elephants. Many animal and plant species cooperate with both {{members of their own}} species and with members of other species.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{game birds}} (which were once hunted) include {{partridges}} (swamp francolin), bustards (Bengal florican) and pigeons (pale-capped pigeon). Several other important families of birds inhabit Kaziranga, including rare species of hornbills (great Indian hornbill and the lesser risk wreathed hornbill), Old World <b>babblers</b> (Jerdon's babbler, marsh babbler) and weaver birds (the common baya weaver and the threatened Finn's weaver), thrushes (Hodgson's bushchat), Old World warblers (bristled grassbird). Other threatened species include the black-breasted parrotbill and rufous-vented prinia.|$|E
25|$|Though vangas were {{traditionally}} {{believed to}} be a small family of generally shrike-like birds, recent research suggests that several Madagascan taxa most similar in appearance and habits (and formerly considered to be) Old World warblers, Old World flycatchers or Old World <b>babblers</b> may be vangas. Yamagishi et al. found in 2001 that Newtonia appeared to belong with the vangas rather than the warblers and also that Tylas was a vanga and not a bulbul. It also appears that Ward's flycatcher and Crossley's babbler belong with the vangas.|$|E
25|$|The vangas (from vanga, Malagasy for the hook-billed vanga, Vanga curvirostris) are a {{group of}} little-known small to {{medium-sized}} passerine birds restricted to Madagascar and the Comoros. They are usually classified as the family Vangidae. There are about 22 species, depending on taxonomy. Most species are shrike-like, arboreal forest birds, feeding on reptiles, frogs and insects. Several other Madagascan birds more similar to Old World warblers, Old World <b>babblers</b> or Old World flycatchers are now often placed in this family. Vangas differ greatly in bill shape and {{have a variety of}} foraging methods. Their stick nests are built in trees. They do not migrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{forest is}} also rich in bird life, with 286 species {{including}} the endemic brown-winged kingfishers (Pelargopsis amauroptera) and the globally threatened lesser adjutants (Leptoptilos javanicus) and masked finfoots (Heliopais personata) and {{birds of prey}} such as the ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), white-bellied sea eagles (Haliaeetus leucogaster) and grey-headed fish eagles (Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus). The Sundarbans was designated a Ramsar site on 21 May 1992. Some more popular birds found in this region are open billed storks, black-headed ibis, water hens, coots, pheasant-tailed jacanas, pariah kites, brahminy kites, marsh harriers, swamp partridges, red junglefowls, spotted doves, common mynahs, jungle crows, jungle <b>babblers,</b> cotton teals, herring gulls, Caspian terns, gray herons, brahminy ducks, spot-billed pelicans, great egrets, night herons, common snipes, wood sandpipers, green pigeons, rose-ringed parakeets, paradise flycatchers, cormorants, white-bellied sea eagles, seagulls, common kingfishers, peregrine falcons, woodpeckers, whimbrels, black-tailed godwits, little stints, eastern knots, curlews, golden plovers, pintails, white-eyed pochards and lesser whistling ducks.|$|E
25|$|The true {{evolutionary}} affinities of the sittellas {{have long}} been clouded by their close resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere nuthatches. As late as 1967 the sittellas were retained in that family by some authorities, although doubts about that placement had been voiced in the previous decades. Both their climbing technique and overall morphology are extremely similar; however they differ both in their sociality and their nesting behaviour, as sittellas create nests on branches whereas nuthatches nest in cavities in trees. In addition {{the specifics of the}} morphology of the leg differed, with sittellas having leg muscles more {{similar to those of the}} honeyeaters. Their placement was then moved to various families, including the Old World <b>babblers</b> (an infamous wastebin taxon), the true treecreepers (Certhiidae, which range across the Holarctic and Africa) and the Australian treecreepers (Climacteridae). Their relationship with the Australian radiation of passerines was suggested by S.A. Parker on the basis of egg colour, nest structure and nestling plumage, and their position in this radiation was vindicated by Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA–DNA hybridization studies. These researchers placed the sittellas in a monotypic tribe within the superfamily Corvidae. Today they are afforded their own family in a clade close to the berrypeckers and longbills (Melanocharitidae) and the whistlers (Pachycephalidae).|$|E
500|$|Southern pied <b>babblers</b> Turdoides bicolor {{appear to}} avoid {{inbreeding}} in two ways. The first is through dispersal, {{and the second}} is by avoiding familiar group members as mates. [...] Although both males and females disperse locally, they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered. Within their group, individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite-sex breeder is unrelated.|$|E
500|$|The taxonomic {{placement}} of the melampittas {{was the source of}} long-standing confusion. Based on their superficial resemblance to the suboscine pittas (plump bodies, short tails and long legs), Hermann Schlegel [...] placed the lesser melampitta within that family when he described that species in 1871. The name melampitta is derived from the Ancient Greek melas- for [...] "black" [...] with the genus name [...] "Pitta". As Ernst Mayr demonstrated that the structure of the syrinx was that of an oscine bird the genus was later moved to the Old World <b>babblers</b> (an infamous [...] "taxonomic dustbin"), then to Orthonychidae (where some authorities still retain them) and then to the jewel-babblers and whipbirds (the treatment used by the 2007 Handbook of the Birds of the World).|$|E
500|$|In contrast, human {{language}} is open-ended and productive, {{meaning that it}} allows humans to produce a vast range of utterances from a finite set of elements, and to create new words and sentences. This is possible because {{human language}} {{is based on a}} dual code, in which a finite number of elements which are meaningless in themselves (e.g. sounds, letters or gestures) can be combined to form an infinite number of larger units of meaning (words and sentences). However, one study has demonstrated that an Australian bird, the chestnut-crowned babbler, is capable of using the same acoustic elements in different arrangements to create two functionally distinct vocalizations. [...] Additionally, pied <b>babblers</b> have demonstrated the ability to generate two functionally distinct vocalisations composed of the same sound type, which can only be distinguished by the number of repeated elements.|$|E
500|$|Specific types: alarm; contact; duet; antiphonal duetting; food begging; flight; mobbing. A type of bird vocalization {{tending to}} serve such {{functions}} as giving alarm or keeping {{members of a}} flock in contact—as opposed to a bird's , which is longer and more complex and is usually associated with courtship and mating. Individual birds may be sensitive enough to identify each other through their calls. Many birds that nest in colonies can locate their chicks using their calls. Alarm calls are used to sound alarm to other individuals. Food-begging calls are made by baby birds to beg for food, such as the [...] "wah" [...] of infant blue jays. Mobbing calls signal other individuals in mobbing species while harassing a predator. They differ from alarm calls, which alert other species members to allow escape from predators. As an example, the great tit, a European songbird, uses such a signal to call on nearby birds to harass a perched bird of prey, such as an owl. This call occurs in the 4.5kHz range, and carries over long distances. However, when such prey species are in flight, they employ an alarm signal in the 7–8kHz range. This call is less effective at traveling great distances, but {{is much more difficult}} for both owls and hawks to hear (and detect the direction from which the call came). Contact calls are used by birds for the purpose of letting others of their species know their location. Relatedly, flight calls are vocalizations made by birds while flying, which often serve to keep flocks together. These calls are also used for when birds want to alert others that they are taking flight. Many birds engage in duet calls—a call made by two birds at or nearly at the same time. In some cases, the duets are so perfectly timed as to appear almost as one call. This kind of calling is termed antiphonal duetting. Such duetting is noted {{in a wide range of}} families including quails, bushshrikes, <b>babblers</b> such as [...] scimitar <b>babblers</b> and some owls and parrots.|$|E
500|$|Their {{habit of}} driving away predators from near their nests is {{believed}} to encourage other birds such as orioles, doves, pigeons, <b>babblers,</b> and especially bulbuls, to nest in the vicinity. In one study 18 of 40 nests had red-vented bulbuls nesting within [...] An abnormal case of interspecific feeding with a red-vented bulbul feeding the chicks of a black drongo at their nest has been recorded.They are so aggressive that they may sometimes land on large birds of prey and peck them when mobbing. It {{has been suggested that}} the Asian drongo-cuckoo (Surniculus lugubris) has evolved to mimic this species. The intensity of mobbing predators was studied in Java and observations showed that there was a significant increase in mobbing, during the nesting season, of some predators such as the Javan hawk-eagle but the black eagle, a nest predator is mobbed with equal intensity in all seasons. It has been suggested that this strategy may avoid giving away the location of nests during the breeding season.|$|E
500|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Anton Reichenow in 1899 from a bird {{collected at the}} base of Mount Cameroon near Limbe, Cameroon. He published his description in Ornithologische Monatsberichte and described it as Picathartes oreas. The generic name was first used by René-Primevère Lesson in 1828 after he split the grey-necked rockfowl's close relative the white-necked rockfowl from the crow genus Corvus and placed it in its own genus, Picathartes, as the white-necked rockfowl did not share characteristics common to members of Corvus such as a feathered head. This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera pica for [...] "magpie" [...] and cathartes for [...] "vulture". The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek word oreas, meaning [...] "mountain". Since its initial description, the picathartes have been placed in more than five different families, including those of crows (Corvidae), starlings (Sturnidae), Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae), <b>babblers</b> (Timaliidae) and Old World warblers (Sylviidae). Today the grey-necked rockfowl and the white-necked rockfowl are believed to comprise a unique family, Picathartidae. Additionally, it has been suggested, though not generally accepted, that the two rockfowl represent the remnants of an ancient bird order. Recent DNA analysis has shown that Picathartidae and its closest relatives, southern Africa's rockjumpers and south-east Asia's rail-babbler, form a clade. The analysis suggests that the rockfowl split from the common ancestor of their clade 44million years ago. It is believed that the ancestor of this clade originated in Australia and spread to Africa. Though the grey-necked rockfowl has no subspecies, it may form a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl, with plumage and facial pattern being the main differences between the two species.|$|E

2500|$|Many birds {{engage in}} duet calls. In some cases, the duets are so {{perfectly}} timed as to appear almost as one call. This kind of calling is termed antiphonal duetting. Such duetting is {{noted in a}} wide range of families including quails, bushshrikes, <b>babblers</b> such as the scimitar <b>babblers,</b> some owls and parrots. In territorial songbirds, birds are more likely to [...] when they have been aroused by simulated intrusion into their territory. This implies a role in intraspecies aggressive competition.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of bird species around the lake. These include African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer), {{malachite}} kingfishers (Alcedo cristata), pied kingfishers (Ceryle rudis), swamp flycatchers (Muscicapa aquatica), village weavers (Ploceus cucullatus), [...] speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus), black-lored (Turdoides melanops) and arrow-marked (T. jardineii) <b>babblers,</b> African paradise-flycatchers (Terpsiphone viridis), scarlet-chested (Nectarinia senegalensis), bronze (N. kilimensis) and green-headed (N. verticalis) sunbirds, yellow-fronted canaries (Serinus mozambicus), green-winged pytilias (Pytilia melba), great (Phalacrocorax carbo) and white-breasted (P. lucidus) cormorants, openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus) and yellow-billed (Mycteria ibis) storks and cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis). There is also a pair of semi-domesticated grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum) at the Jambo Beach resort in Gahini.|$|E
2500|$|Major [...] "wastebin" [...] {{families}} {{such as the}} Old World warblers and Old World <b>babblers</b> {{have turned}} out to be paraphyletic and are being rearranged. Several taxa turned out to represent highly distinct species-poor lineages, so new families had to be established, some of them – like the stitchbird of New Zealand and the Eurasian bearded reedling – monotypic with only one living species. In the Passeri alone, a number of minor lineages will eventually be recognized as distinct superfamilies. For example, the kinglets constitute a single genus with less than 10 species today, but seem to have been among the first perching bird lineages to diverge as the group spread across Eurasia. No particularly close relatives of them have been found among comprehensive studies of the living Passeri, though they might be fairly close to some little-studied tropical Asian groups. Treatment of the nuthatches, wrens, and their closest relatives as a distinct superfamily Certhioidea is increasingly considered justified; the same might eventually apply to the tits and their closest relatives.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{specialization}} {{within a}} habitat {{is associated with}} behaviors and morphological adaptations (physical traits of size and shape). Tiny birds are lightweight enough to hang onto the ends of twigs and pluck small prey; the goldcrest of Europe and its counterpart the golden-crowned kinglet of North America exhibit this feeding style. The related common firecrest is very similar in size and shape, but slightly bulkier, and has less of a tendency to glean along twigs {{and more of a}} habit of flying from perch to perch. Having a very small bill seems to be good for taking tiny prey from the surfaces of leaves, and small-billed birds such as the blue tit forage in broad-leafed woodlands. The long-billed gnatwren and speckled spinetail of Central and South America, and the ashy tailorbird and striped tit-babbler of South Asia, show a preference for gleaning in tangles of vines. [...] The ash-browed spinetail of South America specializes in gleaning among epiphytes on moss-covered tree branches. Many hummingbirds take small insects from flowers while probing for nectar, and some species glean actively among bark and leaves. The Puerto Rican emerald is one such hummingbird. Found only on the island of Puerto Rico, the female subsists on insects and spiders, while the male has a typical hummingbird diet of nectar. [...] Hummingbirds and other gleaners are also sometimes attracted to the sap wells created by sapsuckers. [...] Sapsuckers, which are in the woodpecker family, drill small holes in living tree branches to get the sap flowing. The sap and the insects it attracts are then consumed, and rufous hummingbirds have been observed to follow the movements of sapsuckers and take advantage of this food source. Clusters of dead leaves also often harbor invertebrate prey, and the Bewick's wren and worm-eating warbler of North America have long bills well-suited for probing them, as do certain Asian <b>babblers,</b> such as the rusty-cheeked scimitar-babbler. In Central and South America, foliage-gleaners such as the red-faced spinetail and buff-throated foliage-gleaner are also examples of birds that glean clusters of dead leaves.|$|E
