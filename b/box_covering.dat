Many networks such as the WWW and biological networks are known to display spatial heterogeneity which can be characterized by their fractal dimensions. Multifractal analysis is a useful way to systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns. In this paper, we introduce a new <b>box</b> <b>covering</b> algorithm for multifractal analysis of complex networks. This algorithm {{is used to calculate}} the generalized fractal dimensions $D_{q}$ of some theoretical networks, namely scale-free networks, small world networks and random networks, and one kind of real networks, namely protein-protein interaction networks of different species. Our numerical results indicate the existence of multifractality in scale-free networks and protein-protein interaction networks, while the multifractal behavior is not clear-cut for small world networks and random networks. The possible variation of $D_{q}$ due to changes in the parameters of the theoretical network models is also discussed. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures, 4 table...|$|E
40|$|Most {{state-of-the-art}} text {{detection methods}} {{are specific to}} horizontal Latin text and are not fast enough for real-time applications. We introduce Segment Linking (SegLink), an oriented text detection method. The main idea is to decompose text into two locally detectable elements, namely segments and links. A segment is an oriented <b>box</b> <b>covering</b> {{a part of a}} word or text line; A link connects two adjacent segments, indicating that they belong to the same word or text line. Both elements are detected densely at multiple scales by an end-to-end trained, fully-convolutional neural network. Final detections are produced by combining segments connected by links. Compared with previous methods, SegLink improves along the dimensions of accuracy, speed, and ease of training. It achieves an f-measure of 75. 0 % on the standard ICDAR 2015 Incidental (Challenge 4) benchmark, outperforming the previous best by a large margin. It runs at over 20 FPS on 512 x 512 images. Moreover, without modification, SegLink is able to detect long lines of non-Latin text, such as Chinese. Comment: To Appear in CVPR 201...|$|E

We construct a <b>box</b> <b>covering</b> of a Poincaré section under consideration, use the Poincaré first return time for the identification of those regions relevant for transport and then we apply an adaptation of recently developed techniques for the computation of transport rates ([12], [27]).

40|$|Visual object {{tracking}} is {{a classical}} and very popular problem in computer vision with {{a plethora of}} applications such as vehicle navigation, human computer interface, human motion analysis, surveillance, auto-control systems and many more. Given the initial state of a target in the first frame, the goal of tracking is to predict states of the target over time where the states describe a bounding <b>box</b> <b>covering</b> the target. Despite numerous object tracking methods that have been proposed in recent years [1 - 4], most of these trackers suffer a degradation in performance mainly because of several challenges that include illumination changes, motion blur, complex motion, out of plane rotation, and partial or full occlusion, while occlusion is usually the most contributing factor in degrading the majority of trackers, {{if not all of}} them. This thesis is devoted to the advancement of generic object trackers tackling different challenges through different proposed methods. The work presented propose four new state-of-the-art trackers. One of which is 3 D based tracker in a particle filter framework where both synchronization and registration of RGB and depth streams are adjusted automatically, and three works in correlation filters that achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy while maintaining reasonable speeds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ð We {{have applied}} tomographic {{techniques}} to amplitude data to quantify regional phase path e€ects {{for use in}} source discrimination studies. Tomography complements interpolation (kriging) methods by extending our ability to apply path corrections into regions devoid of calibration events, as well as raising levels of con®dence in the corrections because of their more physical basis. Our tomography technique solves for resolvable combinations of attenuation, source-generation, site and spreading terms. First di€erence regularization is used to remove singularities and reduce noise e€ects. In initial tests the technique was applied to a data set of 1488, 1. 0 Hz, Pg/Lg amplitude ratios from 13 stations for paths inside a 30 ° by 40 ° <b>box</b> <b>covering</b> western China and surrounding regions. Tomography reduced variance 60 %, relative to the power-law distance correction traditionally applied to amplitude ratios. Relative P g/L g attenuation varied with geologic region, with low values in Tibet, intermediate values in basins and high values for platforms and older crust. Spatial patterns were consistent with previous path e€ect studies in Asia, especially local earthquake coda-Q. Relative spreading was consistent with expected values for P g and L g. Relative site terms were similar to one another, yet some tradeo € with attenuation was evident.

Based on properties of the percolation cluster we show that the distance between vertices under strong disorder and on the minimum spanning tree behaves as N 1 / 3 for the N vertex complete graph and for Erdős– Rényi random graphs, {{as well as for}} scale free networks with exponent γ> 4. For scale free networks with 3 < γ < 4 the distance behaves as N (γ− 3) /(γ− 1). For 2 < γ < 3, our numerical results indicate that the distance scales as lnγ− 1 N. We also discuss a fractal property of some real world networks. These networks present self similarity and a finite fractal dimension when measured using the <b>box</b> <b>covering</b> method. 1. Random Graphs and Complex Networks About 50 years ago a model for random networks was developed, combining ideas from graph theory with ideas from probability theory.

In this model, graphs consist of N vertices and M edges randomly selected between them. That is, in this model all graphs contain-ing N labeled vertices and M edges are equiprobable.

40|$|Recently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) {{has become}} a popular choice to model {{individual}} dynamics for single-person action recognition due to its ability of modeling the temporal information in various ranges of dynamic contexts. However, existing RNN models only focus on capturing the temporal dynamics of the person-person interactions by naively combining the activity dynamics of individuals or modeling them as a whole. This neglects the inter-related dynamics of how person-person interactions change over time. To this end, we propose a novel Concurrence-Aware Long Short-Term Sub-Memories (Co-LSTSM) to model the long-term inter-related dynamics between two interacting people on the bounding <b>boxes</b> <b>covering</b> people. Specifically, for each frame, two sub-memory units store individual motion information, while a concurrent LSTM unit selectively integrates and stores inter-related motion information between interacting people from these two sub-memory units via a new co-memory cell.
