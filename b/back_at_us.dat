25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} end of our contribution... They would shout <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.|$|E
500|$|Tiny Mix Tapes {{included}} the album as its 21st-best {{album of the}} year, and summarized the album as [...] "hyperreal... frivolous... eerily familiar and scarily comfortable: pop structures moving one step closer toward the 'synthetic music box' from Huxley's Brave New World." [...] Fact ranked Far Side Virtual as its sixth-best album of the year, and called it [...] "he finest, most accessible example yet of James Ferraro’s ability to turn the detritus and dreck of US pop/commercial culture into gold – or, at any rate, something stomach-turningly psychedelic, mentally disturbing yet oddly celebratory." [...] Dummy named the album one of its [...] "12 albums for 2011," [...] and Ruth Saxelby concluded that Ferraro [...] "neither celebrates nor critiques the internet's reign but simply observes it with deep fascination. Andy Warhol style, it reflects the ambiguity of consumer culture in the digital age <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> with a Pixar-animated wink." [...] The album placed at 316 on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop poll, with votes from four critics.|$|E
60|$|We {{both looked}} at Romayne. He silently looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us,</b> {{like a man}} turned to stone. I tried to reason with him.|$|E

Harris {{responds}} that reaction [...] "works both ways". They eye each other suspiciously and cautiously. However, Loggins clarifies that Harris won't 'get it in the back'.|$|R

60|$|She looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> {{from the}} door, and I had a last {{impression}} of that beautiful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{turned away}} slowly, walked on, {{following}} the bank, and {{passed into the}} bushes to the left. Once only her eyes gleamed <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> in the dusk of the thickets before she disappeared.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} end of the highway was truncated when U.S. Route 160 was extended from its former terminus in Springfield, and the road's terminus was moved <b>back</b> to Springfield (<b>at</b> <b>US</b> 160), and later still (in the 1980s) back to Willard when US 160 was rerouted.|$|R

60|$|One of {{the other}} Selenites walked a few paces out upon the plank, and turned and looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> unconcernedly. The others stood ready to follow after us. Our guide's {{expectant}} figure reappeared. He was returning to see why we had not advanced.|$|E
6000|$|But for my part, I {{felt there}} was a show of reason in one last taunt which the rascal flung <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> as the boat receded: [...] "Sir Charles Vandrift, we are a pair of rogues. The law protects you. It persecutes me. That's all the difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of HIV/AIDS is {{primarily}} a [...] "drug cocktail" [...] of protease inhibitors, and education programs help people avoid infection. For the first few decades, infected foreign nationals were turned <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the <b>U.S.</b> border to help prevent additional infections. The number of U.S. deaths from AIDS have declined sharply since {{the early years of}} the disease's presentation domestically. In the United States, 1.2 million people live with an HIV infection, about 1/8th of whom are unaware of their infection.|$|R
60|$|NORA [with {{a sudden}} bitter flush]. I suppose that's all that brings him <b>back</b> to look <b>at</b> <b>us,</b> {{just to see}} how much WE'VE changed. Well, he can wait and see me be candlelight: I didn't come out to meet him: I'm going to walk to the Round Tower [going west across the hill].|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm bust!" [...] Trent said roughly. [...] "Is that plain enough? I've been bulling on West Australians, {{and they}} boomed and this {{afternoon}} the Government {{decided not to}} <b>back</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> Bekwando, and the mines are to be shut down. Tell {{you all about it}} if you like." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the door}} of the kitchen he stopped and looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us.</b> Both Ross and I held our knives and forks poised and gave him our regard. Some men have the power of drawing the {{attention}} of others without speaking a word. Their attitude is more effective than a shout.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} at four o'clock, when we start, {{he is on the}} box again, {{nibbling}} bread and cheese, and glancing furtively <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> to say good morning. He has little twinkling black eyes, just like a mouse, and a sharp moustache, and sharp tuft on his chin--as like Victor Emanuel's as a mouse's tuft can be.|$|E
60|$|Sis-s-s! Flare! It {{was almost}} like {{dropping}} a spark into gunpowder. The flame ran quickly, reached the pine-needles, then sputtered and fizzed into a big blaze. The first pine-tree exploded and went off like a rocket. We were startled by {{the sound and the}} red, up-leaping pillar of fire. Sudden heat shot <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> as if from a furnace. Great sparks began to fall.|$|E
60|$|After {{firing a}} shot Kenton would, {{had he been}} able, come <b>back</b> to <b>us</b> <b>at</b> once; for {{even though he had}} not learned all which seemed necessary, he must have {{understood}} that he would {{no longer be able to}} spy upon the foe.|$|R
25|$|During the US Open series, Kvitová {{posted a}} quarterfinal {{appearance}} in Stanford, but then lost early in Toronto and Cincinnati, both at that {{the hands of}} the resurgent Sloane Stephens, before bowing out in the opening round of New Haven to Zhang Shuai. However, she bounced <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the <b>US</b> Open by beating the likes of Jelena Janković, Alizé Cornet and 18th seed Caroline Garcia to reach the fourth round. There, she saw off third seed Garbiñe Muguruza to sail into her tenth Grand Slam quarterfinal where she was stopped by ninth seed Venus Williams in three sets.|$|R
60|$|They {{brought me}} a great quantity, so, whilst the girl was serving coffee-with-rum to {{the men at the}} bar, I took another spoon and knife and fork and plates for Emil, and we had two dinners from my one. When the girl--she was a woman of thirty-five--came <b>back,</b> she looked <b>at</b> <b>us</b> sharply. I smiled at her coaxingly; so she gave a small, kindly smile in reply.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, on {{the rise}} of a curve upon our right the four-in-hand had appeared, the horses {{stretched}} to the utmost. Our mares laid themselves out gallantly, and the distance between us began slowly to decrease. I found that I could see the black band upon Sir John's white hat, then that I could count the folds of his cape; finally, that I could see the pretty features of his wife as she looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was a mere}} skirmish, Terence. First of all we {{were shot}} at, and could not shoot back again; and thin we shot at the enemy, and they could not shoot <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us.</b> And as for the {{boarding}} affair, faith, it did not last a minute. The others have had two hours of steady fighting, clambering up the hill, and banging away at the enemy, and shouting and cheering, {{and all sorts of}} fun; and there were we, tramping along among those bastely stones and rocks, and no one as much as took the trouble to fire a shot at us!" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{this attack}} {{did not last}} long. He quickly {{recovered}} his common sense, and besides, our missiles were shrewd to hurt. Vividly do I recollect the vision of one bulging eye of his, swollen almost shut {{by one of the}} stones we had thrown. And vividly do I retain the picture of him as he stood {{on the edge of the}} forest whither he had finally retreated. He was looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us,</b> his writhing lips lifted clear of the very roots of his huge fangs, his hair bristling and his tail lashing. He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees.|$|E
50|$|The route {{breaks from}} <b>US</b> 65 <b>at</b> Pickens Street, with Highway 277 {{shooting}} from the route east of Cypress Creek. The route forms a concurrency north with Highway 1 for 24.99 mi beginning <b>at</b> <b>Back</b> Gate. <b>US</b> 165/AR 1 intersect Highway 212 before crossing the Arkansas River on the Pendleton Bridge.|$|R

50|$|Dengler and Martin try {{to reach}} the Mekong River to cross over into Thailand, {{fashioning}} a crude raft, but are caught in rapids and a waterfall. After losing their raft, Dengler and Martin are soon found by a mob of angry villagers, who kill Martin. Dengler escapes and flees back into the jungle, hiding from the pursuing villagers. A few days later, he is rescued by an American helicopter. <b>Back</b> <b>at</b> the <b>U.S.</b> compound he is taken to, Dengler is kept isolated in a hospital for debriefing due to the classified nature of his mission. He is visited {{by some of the}} men from his squadron, who covertly take him back to his ship, where he is welcomed as a hero by the crew.|$|R
60|$|He {{was beaten}} {{and he knew}} it. Recovering his dignity, he stalked out solemnly from under the rain of stones. He stopped {{in the middle of}} the open space and looked wistfully and hungrily <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us.</b> He hated to forego the meal, and we were just so much meat, cornered but inaccessible. This sight of him started us to laughing. We laughed derisively and uproariously, all of us. Now animals do not like mockery. To be laughed at makes them angry. And in such fashion our {{laughter}} affected Saber-Tooth. He turned with a roar and charged the bluff again. This was what we wanted. The fight had become a game, and we took huge delight in pelting him.|$|E
60|$|We went inside. An {{old woman}} with very white hair {{was in charge}} of the place and cringed rather {{obviously}} to the new master. She evidently found him a very strange and frightful apparition indeed, and was dreadfully afraid of him. But if the surviving present bowed down to us, the past did not. We stood up to the dark, long portraits of the extinguished race--one was a Holbein--and looked them in their sidelong eyes. They looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us.</b> We all, I know, felt the enigmatical quality in them. Even my uncle was momentarily embarrassed, I think, by that invincibly self-complacent expression. It was just as though, after all, he had not bought them up and replaced them altogether; as though that, secretly, they knew better and could smile at him.|$|E
60|$|I {{was walking}} in the village street with a lady friend when we noticed four little girls coming towards us with arms linked. As they came near they {{suddenly}} stopped and curtseyed all together in an exaggerated manner, dropping till their knees touched the ground, then springing to their feet they walked rapidly away. From the bold, free, easy {{way in which the}} thing was done it was plain to see that they had been practising the art in something of a histrionic spirit {{for the benefit of the}} pilgrims and strangers frequently seen in the village, and for their own amusement. As the little Selbornians walked off they glanced <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>us</b> over their shoulders, exhibiting four roguish smiles on their four faces. The incident greatly amused us, but I am not sure that the Reverend Gilbert White would have regarded it in the same humorous light.|$|E
50|$|Valentín leaves Acapulco {{with the}} baby, Maggie, and hitchhikes across Mexico toward Tijuana. After being turned <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the <b>US</b> border, he crosses by being smuggled in a hidden {{compartment}} in a transport truck along with numerous other Mexicans. Going {{only by a}} single photo of Julie in which a Los Angeles hotel is visible in the background, Valentín visits the hotel to track down Julie. However, when Maggie wanders to a nearby pool, Valentín ends up jumping out of a hotel presidential suite into the pool 10 stories below, rescuing his daughter. A movie director witnesses this event and hires Valentín as a stuntman — a job which Valentín accepts since he believes {{it is the only}} way he can support Maggie.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, US 202 was {{designated}} and overlapped with NY 118 (later NY 100) from Somers to Croton Falls. The overlap between NY 100 and US 202 lasted {{as late as}} 1990. NY 100 was cut <b>back</b> to end <b>at</b> <b>US</b> 202 in Somers by 2004. The south end of NY 100 {{had been at the}} New York City line since 1956; however, as of 2007, NYSDOT recognizes the Cross County Parkway underpass as the official southern terminus of NY 100.|$|R
60|$|A {{little before}} eleven Mr. Franklin came back. The {{resolute}} {{side of him}} had, to all appearance, given way, in the interval since his departure, under the stress that had been laid on it. He had left <b>us</b> <b>at</b> a gallop; he came <b>back</b> to <b>us</b> <b>at</b> a walk. When he went away, he was made of iron. When he returned, he was stuffed with cotton, as limp as limp could be.|$|R
