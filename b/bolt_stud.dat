40|$|Abstract. The {{reactor vessel}} body and closure head are {{fastened}} with the <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> {{that is one}} of crucial parts for safety of the reactor vessels in nuclear power plants. It is reported that the <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> is often experienced by fatigue cracks initiated at threads. <b>Stud</b> <b>bolts</b> are inspected by the ultrasonic technique during the overhaul periodically for the prevention of failure which leads to radioactive leakage from the nuclear reactor. The conventional ultrasonic inspection for <b>stud</b> <b>bolts</b> was mainly conducted by reflected echo method based on shadow effect. However, in this technique, there were numerous spurious signals reflected from every oblique surfaces of the thread. In this study, ultrasonic phased array technique was applied to investigate detectability of flaws in <b>stud</b> <b>bolts</b> and characteristics of ultrasonic images corresponding to different scanning methods, that is, sector and linear scan. For this purpose, simplified <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> specimens with artificial defects of various depths were prepared...|$|R
5000|$|With {{respect to}} shape, <b>stud</b> <b>bolts</b> a.k.a <b>studs</b> are {{categorized}} into 3 basic types: [...] "Fully Threaded Stud Bolts", [...] "Tap End Stud Bolts", and [...] "Double End Stud Bolts". Each of these studs have different application. As name suggests, fully threaded studs have full body coverage with threads for full engagement of the matings nuts or similar parts. Tap end studs have threads at extreme {{ends of the}} body with unequal thread engagement length, while double end <b>stud</b> <b>bolts</b> have equal thread length at both ends. Apart from these there are <b>stud</b> <b>bolts</b> for flanges which are fully threaded studs with chamfered ends, and double end studs with reduced shank for special <b>bolting</b> applications.For <b>studs</b> that are not completely threaded, {{there are two types}} of studs: full-bodied studs, and undercut studs. Full-bodied studs have a shank equal to the major diameter of the thread. Undercut studs have a shank equal to the pitch diameter of the screw thread. Undercut studs are designed to better distribute axial stresses. In a full-bodied stud the stresses are greater in the threads than in the shank.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{characteristics}} of bond-type anchor <b>bolts</b> with headed <b>studs</b> {{on its surface}} were investigated by laboratory tests. The specimen used for the experiment have the real-sized diameters ranging from 120 mm to 180 mm. It was observed from the test results that the bond strength of the <b>bolt</b> with <b>studs</b> is almost the same, regardless {{of the size of}} the diameter. In contrast, the bond strength of the <b>bolt</b> without <b>studs</b> tends to decrease with the increase in its diameter. An in-situ pull-out test of the bond-type anchor bolt confirmed that the anchor bolt has a sufficient bond strength to be used in stead of the conventional anchor bolt. Based on the loading test on a 1 / 3 scaled pier base-to-footing connection with the bond-type anchor bolts, we examined the applicability of the component method to the prediction of the moment-rotation curve. In the component method, we considered the bond stress-slip relation on the surface of the anchor bolt in addition to the constitutive relations of anchor bolt and concrete footing. As a result, it was found that the experimental moment-rotation curve can be predicted with an acceptable accuracy by the component method...|$|R
50|$|Undercut studs {{are only}} {{required}} in applications where the stud {{is exposed to}} fatigue.

40|$|Flanged joints {{on large}} {{diameter}} flanges can prove problematic to seal successfully with many {{factors contributing to}} ensuring a successful operation. One such factor is <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> loading contributing to stress and deflection of the flanged joint. This investigation {{involves the use of}} finite element analysis (F. E. A) to predict levels of stress and deflection of a particular flanged joint when the <b>stud</b> <b>bolts</b> are tightened and flange pressurised. The level of <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> force selected must ensure the joint is sufficiently tight to avoid leakage. However, the force must not be excessive causing damage. The flanged joint is located on the channel head of a shell and tube heat exchanger. For the purposes of this project, the educational version of ANSYS 5. 5 was used thus a number of critical assumptions were made to operate within the restrictions of the software. As a comparative check of the F. E. A method, a conventional method termed the target load bolt-up method was employed. The analysis results using both methods, when interpreted, indicated the flange was not excessively stressed. Field monitoring by observation of the flanged joint for signs of leakage and other detrimental effects indicates the <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> load selected is acceptable...|$|R

50|$|A superbolt, or multi-jackbolt {{tensioner}} is {{an alternative}} type of fastener that retrofits or replaces existing nuts, <b>bolts,</b> or <b>studs.</b> Tension in the bolt is developed by torquing individual jackbolts, which are threaded through {{the body of the}} nut and push against a hardened washer. Because of this, the amount of torque required to achieve a given preload is reduced. Installation and removal of any size tensioner is achieved with hand tools, which can be advantageous when dealing with large diameter bolting applications.|$|R
50|$|Thrust-collar type MJTs {{are used}} in {{applications}} where {{it is difficult to}} use threaded tensioners, such as on rolling mills where the joint would typically need to be tightened by crane wrenching. Jackbolts push a threadless nut against a retainer ring, which is fitted into a groove and transfers the jacking force to the main <b>bolt</b> or <b>stud.</b> Because there are no threads, they can also be used in press column applications, eliminating the problems and hassles associated with large nut threads.|$|R
40|$|The {{bolts and}} nuts are widely used in various fields as {{important}} joining elements with long history. However, screw loosening is easily induced by vibration and external loads, and sometimes causes very serious accident without notice. In this paper, a special <b>stud</b> <b>bolt</b> named "Super <b>Stud</b> <b>Bolt</b> (SSB) " is studied, which can prevent loosening effectively. Between the upper threads and the lower threads, there is a thin walled tube which can be deformed along the axial direction so that the phase difference is designed and SSB is developed. During fastening, this phase difference induces the contrary forces on the surfaces of the upper threads and the lower threads, which bring out the anti-loosening performance. In this stydy, both courses of processing and fastening are simulated, {{and the relationship between}} axial force and displacement is illustrated with the finite element method. In this analysis, the large plastic strains and elastic-plastic large deformation theory are applied to 4 nodes axial symmetric FEM models. Through the comparison among the results, the desirable range of the phase difference of lower and upper threads is decided. Since the thin walled tube is the heart of anti-loosening mechanism, optimum original dimensions are discussed in this study...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{includes an}} attachment apparatus comprising a rotation limiting member adapted to be threaded onto a threaded member; and a preload nut adapted to be threaded onto the threaded member.

30|$|In {{this study}} the {{progressive}} collapse resisting {{capacity of a}} RC beam-column subassemblage with and without strengthening was investigated. Total of five specimens were tested; two unreinforced specimens, the one designed as gravity load-resisting system and the other as seismic load-resisting system, and three specimens reinforced with: (i) bonded strand, (ii) unbonded strand, and (iii) side steel plates with <b>stud</b> <b>bolts.</b> The two-span subassemblages were designed {{as part of an}} eight-story RC building. Monotonically increasing load was applied at the middle column of the specimens and the force–displacement relationships were plotted. It was observed that the gravity load-resisting specimen failed by fractures of re-bars in the beams. In the other specimens no failure was observed until the maximum displacement capacity of the actuator was reached. Highest strength was observed in the structure with unbonded strand. The test result of the specimen with side steel plates in beam-column joints showed that the force–displacement curve increased without fracture of re-bars. Based on the test results it was concluded that the progressive collapse resisting capacity of a RC frame could be significantly enhanced using unbonded strands or side plates with <b>stud</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractDry {{machining}} {{is gaining}} {{more and more}} importance in today's manufacturing science because of health hazards imposed {{by the use of}} coolants while machining. This paper presents a detailed analysis of surface topology in dry machining of EN- 8 steel which is widely used material for general-purpose axles, shafts, gears, <b>bolts</b> and <b>studs.</b> Regression models are developed for Ra, Rq, and Rz parameters of surface topology which are very significant parameters from contact stiffness, fatigue strength and surface wear point of view. For all the regression models a good correlation is found between surface roughness and cutting parameters and hence these models can be used to predict the surface roughness within the range of cutting parameters under investigation. Regression models are compared with experimental values of roughness and with available geometrical models. Percent errors are also calculated by comparing regression models and experimental values and a geometrical model. It is found that the percent errors are very small for regression model as compared to geometrical model. Finaly performance of dry machining is compared with that of machining with coolant, no significant difference is found for the surface roughness with the dry machining and that of machining with coolant...|$|R
50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches. Standard and special fasteners like alloys, nuts, <b>bolts,</b> washers, <b>studs,</b> tapping, self drilling screw and socket screware are often quoted in both imperial and metric; products range from 2/56 in diameter up to 4 in.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{is attached to}} the engine block by numerous <b>bolts</b> or <b>studs.</b> It has several functions. The {{cylinder head}} seals the cylinders on the side opposite to the pistons; it contains short ducts (the ports) for intake and exhaust and the associated intake valves that open to let the cylinder be filled with fresh air and exhaust valves that open to allow the combustion gases to escape. However, 2-stroke crankcase scavenged engines connect the gas ports directly to the cylinder wall without poppet valves; the piston controls their opening and occlusion instead. The cylinder head also holds the spark plug in the case of spark ignition engines and the injector for engines that use direct injection. All CI engines use fuel injection, usually direct injection but some engines instead use indirect injection. SI engines can use a carburetor or fuel injection as port injection or direct injection. Most SI engines have a single spark plug per cylinder but some have 2. A head gasket prevents the gas from leaking between the cylinder head and the engine block. The opening and closing of the valves is controlled by one or several camshafts and springs—or in some engines—a desmodromic mechanism that uses no springs. The camshaft may press directly the stem of the valve or may act upon a rocker arm, again, either directly or through a pushrod.|$|R
5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the <b>bolt</b> or <b>stud</b> to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's Pass-Thru brands. Lowes calls their socket system Xtreme Access, etc.. Ratcheting box end wrenches can often be employed in the same application but will nearly always be significantly wider.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{mechanical}} shear connectors, mainly headed <b>stud</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{is the most}} common way to achieve steel-concrete composite action.
