50|$|For {{several decades}} now, hacksaw blades have used {{high speed steel}} for their teeth, giving greatly {{improved}} cutting and tooth life. These blades were first available in the 'All-hard' form which cut accurately but were extremely brittle. This limited their practical use to benchwork on a workpiece that was firmly clamped in a vice. A softer form of high speed steel blade was also available, which wore well and resisted breakage, but was less stiff and so less accurate for precise sawing. Since the 1980s, bi-metal blades {{have been used to}} give the advantages of both forms, without risk of breakage. A strip of high speed steel along the tooth edge is electron <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> to a softer spine. As the price of these has dropped to be comparable with the older blades, their use is now almost universal.|$|E

The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|R

5000|$|In 1972, Valiathan {{returned}} to India {{and had an}} uncertain beginning at the Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. Soon after he moved to Indian Institute of Technology Madras where his responsibility was teaching with low priority for research. Several friends and colleagues, including Dr. Hufnagel wondered whether {{he had made a}} foolish mistake in opting to leave the United States. However he received an invitation from the Government of Kerala where the Chief Minister, Shri Achutha Menon, asked him to develop a hospital for specialities in the new, unoccupied building of Sree Chitra Tirunal Center, Trivandrum, and gave him freedom and authority to accomplish the task.The hospital was set up in two years and patients with cardiovascular and neurologic diseases admitted for treatment. Simultaneously the development of cardiovascular devices was initiated {{with the support of the}} Science and Engineering Research Council of the Government of India. As Sree Chitra Institute grew, it received support from prime minister Morarji Desai and was notified as [...] "An Institution of National Importance" [...] by an Act of Parliament within five years of Dr.Valiathan's leadership [...] In 1975, the demand for prosthetic valves was high in the hospital, which could not be met by imported valves in view of prohibitive cost. The state of Kerala had but one licensed abattoir at that time in Koothattukulam, which slaughtered less than 200 pigs per month and made procine valve development unviable. As autopsies were much fewer, homograft valve development was even less viable. Under these circumstances, Dr. Valiathan and his team opted to develop a mechanical valve of tilting-disc design. The currently marketed Chitra-TTK valve is the fourth model in a series that was developed over a decade of effort. In the first model, the major and minor struts were electron <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> and the valve was expected to withstand 360 million cycles of disc movement. Unfortunately, the major strut fractured at the weld after a mere 100,000 cycles due to weld embrittlement. In the second model, the disk was made of single crystal sapphire which was inert and blood compatible. The housing was carved out of a block of titanium. This model failed as well because of extensive wear of titanium struts and escape of the disc. The third model had a housing made of a highly wear- resistant superalloy, [...] "Haynes-25", a cobalt based alloy of chromium, nickel and tungsten. This model went through all the tests successfully and several sheep with the implanted valve were alive and well for months until the death of one animal at 3 months after valve implantation. Necropsy showed that the sapphire disc had fractured and caused the death of the animal. This was a major crisis as critics and media did not spare the Chitra team. However the fourth model was a success and more than 100,000 valves have been implanted in patients (till 2016).The multidisciplinary team at the Sree Chitra Institute led by Dr.Valiathan also developed a vascular graft and a series of disposable devices such as blood bag, oxygenator and cardiotomy reservoir, which are in commercial production in industrial units in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of very narrow weld bead and highly strength overmatching on the fracture toughness of laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> components are investigated. This study {{focuses on the}} difference of plastic constraint in fracture toughness specimen (3 -point bend specimen, 3 PB) and structural components with crack in the weld metal. The equivalent crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) ratio, β, for the correction of CTOD toughness for constraint loss in structural components is numerically analyzed. The narrowness of weld bead induces constraint loss by plastic deformation in the base metal, both the 3 PB and structural components. Nevertheless, {{in the case of}} the wide plate with shallow crack, the highly strength overmatching elevates the opening stress. Therefore, it is found that the β increase with increasing strength mismatch ratio. The influence of highly strength overmatching on β is important for assessment of fracture performance of laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> component. The applicability of β to correction of critical CTOD in laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> components is discussed. The fracture toughness tests with the 3 PB and tension panel (edge through-crack panel) of the laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> joints were conducted at a low temperature in the brittle fracture range.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the porosity formation mechanism during electron beam welding of titanium-based alloys. During the welding of titanium alloys for aerospace engine applications, porosity is occasionally found in the solidified welds. Hence the key factors responsible for porosity formation need to be identified, and guidance to minimise porosity occurrence needs to be provided. The research conducted in this work is twofold. First, porosity formed in electron <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> titanium samples is characterised to rationalise the porosity formation mechanism. Second, models based on sound physical principles are built to aid understanding of porosity formation, and to provide predictive capability. Porosity formed in electron beam welds is characterised using metallographic sectioning, high resolution X-ray tomography, residual gas analysis (RGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (EDS/WDS) analysis. The results confirm porosity formed in electron <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> titanium-based alloys is associated with gas dynamics; hydrogen is very likely to be responsible for porosity formation. A coupled thermodynamic/kinetic model is proposed to study the hydrogen migration behaviour during electron beam welding process, and then the effect of hydrogen on bubble formation is investigated via quantitative modelling, backed up by targetted experimentation...|$|E

40|$|In-vacuum {{electron}} <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> is {{a technology}} that NASA considered as a joining technique for manufacture of space structures. The interaction of energetic electrons with metal produces x-rays. The radiation exposure to astronauts performing the in-vacuum electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> must be characterized and minimized to insure safe operating conditions. This investigation characterized the x-ray environment due to operation of an in-vacuum electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> tool. NASA, in {{a joint venture with}} the Russian Space Agency, was scheduled to perform a series of welding in space experiments on board the United States Space Shuttle. This series of experiments was named the International Space Welding Experiment (ISWE). The hardware associated with the ISWE was leased to NASA, by the Paton Welding Institute (PWI) in Ukraine, for ground based welding experiments in preparation for flight. Two tests were scheduled, using the ISWE electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> tool, to characterize the radiation exposure to an astronaut during the operation of the ISWE. These radiation exposure tests consisted of Thermoluminescence Dosimeters (TLD's) shielded with material currently used by astronauts during Extra Vehicular Activities (EVA) and exposed to x-ray radiation generated by operation of an in-vacuum electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> tool. This investigation was the first known application of TLD's to measure absorbed dose from x-rays of energy less than 10 KeV. The ISWE hardware was returned to Ukraine before the issue of adequate shielding for the astronauts was verified. Therefore, alternate experimental and analytical methods were developed to measure and predict the x-ray spectral and intensity distribution generated by electron impact with metal. These x-ray spectra were used to calculate the absorbed radiation dose to astronauts.
