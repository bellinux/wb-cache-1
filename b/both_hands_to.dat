5|$|During the innings, Bill Edrich was on four when he edged Ray Lindwall to Johnson {{at first}} slip. Johnson got <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the ball above his head, but dropped it. However, the dropped catch was not costly, as Edrich was {{dismissed}} for 18.|$|E
5|$|During {{the lunch}} interval, heavy rain fell, {{before the sun}} began to dry the pitch, making the ball skid through upon England's {{resumption}} at 13/1. Miller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after the resumption, {{but was unable to}} extract an edge. Lindwall reached his peak speed and Edrich edged to first slip, where Ian Johnson got <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the ball above his head, but failed to hold on. Edrich was on four at the time and this was part of a 20-minute passage of play during which England was unable to score. The next ball from Lindwall, Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the fine leg boundary after attempting to hook a bouncer pitched on the line of leg stump. It was to be the first of several times that Washbrook was dismissed while hooking, attracting substantial criticism. Washbrook's fall left England at 15/2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich. Compton square drove Miller to the boundary for four, which prompted a retaliatory bouncer and a negative crowd reaction. Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46. Likewise, Compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild the innings after the two early wickets. During this period Brown made a series of one-handed run-saving stops in the field. The rain had also softened up the pitch and as a result, the playing surface did not offer much bounce.|$|E

25|$|A {{polyphonic}} {{member of}} the guitar family, the Chapman Stick is an electric musical instrument used for music recordings to play various parts such as bass, lead, chords, and textures. The Chapman Stick looks like a wide version of the fretboard of an electric guitar, but having 8, 10 or 12 strings. The player will use <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> sound notes by striking the strings against the fingerboard just behind the appropriate frets for the desired notes. The Chapman Stick was invented in 1969 by American jazz musician Emmett Chapman.|$|E
25|$|The staff sling, {{also known}} as the stave sling, fustibalus (Latin), fustibale (French), {{consists}} of a staff (a length of wood) with a short sling at one end. One cord of the sling is firmly attached to the stave and the other end has a loop that can slide off and release the projectile. Staff slings are extremely powerful because the stave can be made as long as two meters, creating a powerful lever. Ancient art shows slingers holding staff slings by one end, with the pocket behind them, and using <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> throw the staves forward over their heads.|$|E
25|$|The ball mouse {{replaced}} the external wheels {{with a single}} ball that could rotate in any direction. It came {{as part of the}} hardware package of the Xerox Alto computer. Perpendicular chopper wheels housed inside the mouse's body chopped beams of light on the way to light sensors, thus detecting in their turn the motion of the ball. This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted trackball and became the predominant form used with personal computers throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> type on a full-size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when required.|$|E

500|$|After Miller removed John Dewes {{with the}} score at 1/2, Bradman made an early bowling change and {{introduced}} Johnston. Edrich joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to hook a short ball from Johnston. He {{failed to get}} the ball {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around [...] Lindsay Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, after diving sideways and getting <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> the ball. This left England at 2/10. After the lunch break, Johnston dismissed debutant Allan Watkins without scoring after the batsman played across the line to be trapped lbw, leaving England at 6/42. Johnston ended with 2/20 from 16 overs as England were skittled for 52. After being unbeaten without scoring in Australia's innings of 389, Johnston was again among the wickets when England's second innings late on the second day.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{results of}} studies on the pygmy slow loris {{indicate}} that its diet consists primarily of gums and nectar (especially nectar from Saraca dives flowers), and that animal prey makes up 30–40% of its diet. However, one 2002 analysis of pygmy slow loris feces indicated that it contained 98% insect remains and just 2% plant remains. The pygmy slow loris often returns to the same gum feeding sites and leaves conspicuous gouges on tree trunks when inducing the flow of exudates. Slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from [...] {{to as much as}} the gouging process, whereby the loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into the hard bark, may be loud enough to be heard up to [...] away. The marks remaining after gouging can be used by field workers to assess loris presence in an area. Captive pygmy slow lorises also make characteristic gouge marks in wooden substrates, such as branches. It is not known how the sympatric pygmy and Bengal slow lorises partition their feeding niches. The plant gums, obtained typically from species in the family Fabaceae (peas), are high in carbohydrates and lipids, and can serve as a year-around source of food, or an emergency reserve when other preferred food items are scarce. Several anatomical adaptations present in slow lorises may enhance their ability to feed on exudates: a long narrow tongue {{to make it easier to}} reach gum stashed in cracks and crevices, a large cecum to help the animal digest complex carbohydrates, and a short duodenum to help quickly pass potentially toxic exudates. Slow lorises can use <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> eat while hanging upside down from a branch. They spend about 20% of their nightly activities feeding.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{extremely}} {{young or}} physically challenged players may use <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> swing the ball forward from in between their legs.

In recent years, the new two-handed [...] "shovel" [...] style hook release is gaining more popularity, as it generates more revolutions and speed to knock down pins. Another method for novice bowlers is the [...] "bounce pass" [...] technique which is performed by thrusting the ball from your chest with two hands towards the pins. This technique is easily picked up by weaker players but is seldom used because it is frowned upon by the bowling community {{because of the potential}} to damage the lanes and/or ball. Some middle aged bowlers use the ramp in which a bowler will use two hands and push the ball down the ramp onto the lane.|$|E

2500|$|The {{description}} of the Panche is different in Epítome than the Muisca; the Panche are described as a much more war-like people, their rugged terrain worse for the cavalry and the style of warfare different. While the Muisca [...] "fought" [...] using screams and shouting, the Panche are described as fighting silently with slingshots, poisoned arrows and large heavy poles made of palm trees (macanas) swinging them with <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>to</b> hit their enemies.

The habit is described as showing {{what will happen to}} their opponents; fighting like they fought and to instigate fear in the enemy. Of the Panche is described that when they won their battles, they celebrated their victory with festivities, took the children of their enemies to sacrifice them, captured the women and killed the men by poking out the eyes of the combat leaders. The combat of the Panche is described as fiercer as of the Muisca and the combatants walked naked. They had tubes made of animal skins where they held the lances and bow and arrows to shoot. The Panche warriors are described as eating the flesh of their enemies at the battlefield or later at home with their wives and children.
