2500|$|Cioculescu {{made his}} press debut in 1923, {{when he began}} {{publishing}} reviews in the literary supplement of Facla, the magazine created and led by socialist writer N. D. Cocea. As he later recalled, Cocea encouraged him to pursue this activity further, telling him: [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the fabric of a critic." [...] Over the following years, he had numerous articles and regular columns published in several venues, including the left-wing daily Adevărul and Camil Petrescu's weekly Săptămâna Muncii Intelectuale şi Artistice. He was also a frequenter of Sburătorul circle, established by his older colleague, literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pinewood}} derby had {{a sensational}} first year. Murphy and the Management Club of North American Aviation sent out thousands of brochures {{to anyone who}} requested more information. The idea spread rapidly, and competitions were held across the country, mainly with recreation departments and nonprofit organizations including the Los Angeles County Department of Recreation. Of all that early enthusiasm, however, only the Boy Scouts of America made it part of an official program. The National Director of Cub Scouting Service, O. W. (Bud) Bennett, wrote Murphy: [...] "We <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an excellent idea, and we are most anxious to make your material available to the Cub Scouts of America." [...] Within the year, the Boy Scouts of America adopted the pinewood derby for use in all Cub Scout packs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E
