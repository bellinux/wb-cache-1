5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post <b>bail</b> because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide <b>bail</b> funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted <b>bail</b> for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped <b>bail</b> in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the <b>bail</b> fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E

5|$|Stack v. Boyle (1951) is {{the only}} {{case in which the}} Supreme Court has held the <b>bail</b> imposed to have been constitutionally {{excessive}}. There, the Court found $50,000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act. In United States v.

After this, the State Attorney challenged {{the conditions of}} release, trying to achieve that the <b>bail</b> is subject to Blythe staying in the country and/or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished. On August 2, 2012, the appellate court rejected the State Attorney's second complaint and ordered Blythe's immediate release.

5|$|On June 30, 2012, the State Attorney {{brought a}} motion to remand Blythe in pre-trial detention, as he {{considered}} Blythe a flight risk.
