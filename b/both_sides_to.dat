5|$|Further {{periods of}} {{intensified}} anti-German {{feeling in the}} Rhodesias followed the execution by the Germans of the British nurse Edith Cavell in Belgium in October 1915 ("the Crowning Crime", the Bulawayo Chronicle called it), the escalation of bombing raids by German Zeppelins on British cities during 1917, and the British reportage the same year of the Kadaververwertungsanstalt atrocity story—that the Germans supposedly rendered down battlefield corpses from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> make products such as nitroglycerine and lubricants.|$|E
5|$|Propaganda {{was used}} by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> rally {{domestic}} support and demonize enemies during the First World War. PR activists entered {{the private sector in}} the 1920s.

Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe after 1948 when they created European subsidiaries {{as a result of the}} Marshall plan.|$|E
5|$|Coakley's {{rebuttal}} witnesses {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, that very few of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> prepare closing arguments.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had to wait until the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for about two hours before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall apart (as it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. V. Hickman {{took over}} from Caine as {{commanding}} officer on 26 August 1968 {{and the rest}} of the year was uneventful for the RLI. The same was not true, however, for the Rhodesian government, which on 20 September 1968 accepted an invitation from Wilson for a new round of talks, this time aboard HMS Fearless, anchored off Gibraltar, for four days starting on 9 October 1968. These ended without agreement on the evening of 13 October 1968, when Smith flew back to Rhodesia. Unsuccessful attempts by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> salvage an accord from the Fearless talks continued for months afterwards but ultimately Smith's government resolved that compromise was impossible. It prepared a new constitution of its own and on 20 June 1969 called a constitutional referendum, polling public opinion on both the new constitution and the adoption of a republican form of government. The electorate firmly backed both of these proposals. As a result, Rhodesia became a republic with the new constitution in place on 2 March 1970.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{attacked}} the castle in 1139, initially intending to besiege it, as {{the walls were}} considered impregnable to assault. Brien had brought in considerable supplies – contemporaries believed the castle could survive a siege for several years if need be – and Stephen changed his mind, putting up two counter-castles to contain Wallingford {{along the road to}} Bristol, before continuing west. The next year, Miles of Gloucester, possibly acting under orders from Robert of Gloucester, struck east, destroying one of the counter-castles outside Wallingford. The civil war between Stephen and Matilda rapidly descended into an attritional campaign, in which castles like Wallingford {{played a critical role in}} efforts by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> secure the Thames Valley. After the fall of Oxford to Stephen in 1141, Matilda fled to Wallingford, and the importance of the castle continued to grow.|$|E
5|$|The Song dynasty {{managed to}} win several {{military}} victories over the Tanguts {{in the early}} 11th century, culminating in a campaign led by the polymath scientist, general, and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095). However, this campaign was ultimately a failure due to a rival military officer of Shen disobeying direct orders, and the territory gained from the Western Xia was eventually lost. There was also a significant war fought against the Lý dynasty of Vietnam from 1075 to 1077 over a border dispute and the Song's severing of commercial relations with the Đại Việt kingdom. After Lý forces inflicted heavy damages in a raid on Guangxi, the Song commander Guo Kui (1022–1088) penetrated as far as Thăng Long (modern Hanoi). Heavy losses on both sides prompted the Lý commander Thường Kiệt (1019–1105) to make peace overtures, allowing <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from the war effort; captured territories held by both Song and Lý were mutually exchanged in 1082, along with prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman installed Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown batted out of position at No. 6. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same positions. It was a chance for players from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> gain a psychological advantage, but Brown failed to capitalise. He came to the crease with the score at 4/280 to join Keith Miller and scored 26 in a stand of 63 before being dismissed as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings. This was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, against Lancashire, a draw for which Brown was rested.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their strongest possible team. Morris and Barnes retained their positions {{at the top of}} the order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. It was a chance to players from <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests, but Morris looked uncomfortable, managing only five as Australia amassed 552 and enforced the follow on to win by an innings. In the MCC’s second innings, Morris caught Jim Laker from the bowling of Colin McCool. The Lord’s fixture was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Morris continued to struggle, making five and 22, falling twice to England Test paceman Dick Pollard, In the drawn match against Nottinghamshire, Morris continued his form slump, making 16 in the tourists' only innings.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications, Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> negotiate the treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted {{it did not have}} the right to do so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government, but by February 14, 1852, he reported that he did not expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{participation}} in the baronial reform movement, Gloucester still maintained {{the trust of the}} king. He, Gaveston and the Earl of Warenne were the only earls to accompany the king on a Scottish campaign in 1310–11. In March 1311, while the Ordinances were still in the workings, Gloucester was appointed guardian of the realm while the king was still in Scotland. There are signs that he might have fallen out with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster – who was at this point the leader of the opposition against the king – over a feud between two of their respective retainers. When Gaveston once more returned from exile, however, Gloucester sided with the baronial opposition. The earls divided the country into different parts for defence, and Gloucester was given charge of the south. In June 1312, Gaveston was captured by Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who was working in cooperation with Lancaster. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, who had the custody of Gaveston and had guaranteed his safety to the king, appealed to Gloucester, as Gaveston's kinsman, for assistance. Gloucester, however, refused to help, and Gaveston was killed. This act brought the country to the brink of civil war, and Gloucester {{was one of the few}} men who was still trusted enough by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> be able to take on a role as mediator. In the following months, he was among the main negotiators working towards an agreement between the king and the offending earls, an effort that was at least temporarily successful.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January, {{classes in}} Madras University, Annamalai University and other colleges and {{schools in the}} state were {{suspended}} indefinitely. Within the Congress, opinion was divided: one group led by K. Kamaraj wanted the government not to impose Hindi on the Tamils; but others like Morarji Desai did not relent. Home minister Nanda agreed with Bhaktavatsalam's handling of the agitation. Rioting continued throughout {{the first week of}} February and by the second week students lost control of the agitation. Violence continued despite Annadurai's appeal for calm. Efforts were made by <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> find a compromise. On 11 February, C. Subramaniam and O. V. Alagesan, two union ministers from Madras state, resigned protesting the government's language policy. President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan refused to accept the Prime Minister Shastri's recommendation that their resignations be accepted. Shastri backed down and made a broadcast through All India Radio on 11 February. Expressing shock over the riots, he promised to honour Nehru's assurances. He also assured Tamils that English would continue to be used for centre-state and intrastate communications and that the All India Civil Services examination would continue to be conducted in English.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{campaign}} in Croatia {{ended in a}} stalemate, leading <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> accept an internationally supervised ceasefire. By late November, the JNA {{was no longer in}} a position to make substantial advances, while Milošević refused to pursue objectives that he no longer considered achievable. Between September and December 1991, the HV captured many weapons and significantly increased its capabilities. In mid-January 1992, it commanded 155,772 troops and had 216 tanks, 127 other armoured vehicles and 1,108 artillery pieces at its disposal. Even though JNA positions in western Slavonia were on the brink of military collapse, the HV struggled elsewhere and its munitions stockpiles were depleted, while the UN arms embargo prevented its quick resupply. By the end of 1991, the conflict had killed 6,000 Croatians. Another 23,000 were wounded and 400,000 became internally displaced persons (IDPs). Some sources report that there were as many as 600,000 IDPs. The 6,000 killed include 3,761 soldiers. JNA losses were officially reported at 1,279 killed in action, but the figure may have been considerably higher because casualties were consistently under-reported during the war. The HV counter-offensive in western Slavonia created 20,000 Serb refugees. They fled from the area when the JNA ordered the Croatian Serb forces to withdraw, and were subsequently settled in JNA-held Baranja.|$|E

5|$|The eighth {{match of}} the season was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Having been a regular member of the Test team {{since the end of}} World War II, and having taken 29 wickets at 12.03 in his four games on tour, Johnson was selected along with fellow spinner Colin McCool, a leg spinner. This meant that Australia's first-choice team was the same as in the opening match against Worcestershire. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. It was a chance for <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> <b>to</b> gain a psychological advantage over the players who would oppose them in the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted first and Johnson came in at 5/343 to join former South Melbourne and Victorian team-mate and fellow Royal Australian Air Force fighter pilot Keith Miller. The pair put on 165 before Miller fell on the second morning, quickly followed by Johnson at 8/512, trapped leg before wicket by off spinner Jim Laker for 80, but not before Johnson had hit him for three sixes. Bradman's men went on to amass 552. Johnson was the least successful and most uneconomical Australian in the first innings, taking 0/43 from 12 overs as the hosts made 189. Bradman enforced the follow on and Johnson had a better return on the second attempt. The hosts reached 3/128 when Johnson caused a middle-order collapse. He had New Zealand Test batsman Martin Donnelly stumped by Don Tallon, before trapping English Test batsman Len Hutton leg before wicket five runs later. He then removed Ken Cranston to leave the MCC at 6/159. Johnson ended with 3/37 and caught Denis Compton from the pace bowling of Ray Lindwall as Australia bowled out the home side for 205 to win by an innings.|$|E
