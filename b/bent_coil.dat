40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{different}} staining methods for the evaluation of sperm morphology by light microscopy and also to describe the morphometry of the entire sperm in collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu). Semen from 10 males was obtained by electroejaculation and evaluated for sperm motility, vigor, and concentration. Semen smears were prepared through three different staining methods: Bengal rose, brome-phenol blue, and eosin-nigrosin. Smears were evaluated under light microscopy and sperm morphologic alterations were determined in percentage. In addition, sperm morphometric analysis was conducted by light microscopy coupled to image analyzer software. The smears stained with Bengal Rose provide the best results for the visualization of the sperm tail, midpiece, and head. The use of eosin-nigrosin stain did not allow an adequate impregnation, and some sperm presented a few contrasts with the background. A higher incidence of <b>bent</b> <b>coiled</b> tails was verified in the use of brome-phenol blue staining (P< 0. 05). Through morphometric evaluation, it was observed that the tail occupies the greatest proportion (89 %) of the sperm which presents a discretely elongated head.

METHODS: Fresh semen samples were taken from 29 sexually active beef bulls from suspect herds in the Riverina/Upper Murray region. U. diversum was identified using PCR analyses and culture of the organism. RESULTS: Nine of the bulls were PCR-positive for U. diversum but none of these had genital lesions. Sperm from infected bulls showed increased incidence of abnormal tails (<b>bent</b> and <b>coiled),</b> as well as surface abnormalities (i. e. small protuberances or lumps).

Presented on September 9, 2014 at 12 noon in room 1116 of the Marcus Nanotechnology Building. Runtime: 53 : 44 minutesRecent advances in additive manufacturing allow the precise placement of multiple materials at micrometer resolution with essentially no restrictions on the geometric complexity of the spatial arrangement. Complex 3 D solids thus can be created with highly non-regular material distributions in an optimal fashion, enabling the fabrication of devices with unprecedented multifunctional performance. In this work, we exploit these advances and introduce a paradigm of active composites by 4 D printing where the shape of printed 3 D object can change upon external stimuli, thus offering one additional dimension, time, for shape forming and control. In this talk, we demonstrate this concept by printing shape memory fibers (SMF) composites. We directly print a composite in its initial 3 D configuration from a CAD file that specifies the shape memory fiber (SMF) architecture at the lamina and laminate level. Later, the programmed action of the SMFs creates time dependence of the composite configuration change. This process has considerable design freedom to enable creation of composites with complex and controllable anisotropic thermomechanical behavior via the prescribed fiber architecture, shape, size, orientation and even spatial variation of these parameters. We design and print laminates in thin plate form that can be programmed to assume complex three-dimensional configurations including <b>bent,</b> <b>coiled,</b> and twisted strips, folded shapes (origami), and complex contoured shapes with non-uniform, spatially-varying curvature...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the drop break-up process in milk homogenisers. This was done by measurements and calculations of the flow fields in the gap region and by visualisation of drops being broken up. To make visualisation and measurements possible, two scale models of a homogeniser gap were developed. The full-scale model was a direct copy of the gap in a production-scale homogeniser, but with optical access. Normal operational homogenisation pressures could be tested, and drops down to 5 µm in diameter could be visualised. The second model was scaled-up about 100 times ensuring that the relevant dimensionless groups were kept constant, so that the same factors governed the drop break-up process. The scaled-up model was made of transparent plastic and was used for both velocity field measurements and drop visualisation. From these measurements it was concluded that the drops did not break up in the entrance of the gap. Larger drops were elongated to some extent and smaller ones remained spherical. Not much happens in the gap itself. The velocity profile is very flat throughout the gap in a production-scale homogeniser. In a pilot-scale homogeniser the boundary layers have time to grow and the velocity profile is almost developed at the gap exit. The growing shear layers seem to have a limited effect on the drops. During passage through the gap small drops will have time to relax back to their spherical shape, while large ones will leave the gap with almost the same aspect ratio as when they entered it. This study shows that drop break-up takes place in the turbulent jet at the gap outlet. The flow velocity measurements show a very unsteady jet breaking down faster than a jet in a free liquid. Depending on the geometry of the chamber at the gap outlet, the jet can attach to either of the 45 -degree walls and become a wall jet. The turbulence in the jet is very high, with turbulence intensities of 50 - 100 %. Indications were found that flow structures of the size of, or slightly smaller than, the gap height, have very high intensities. Drop deformation experiments and theoretical analyses show that the eddies breaking up the drops range in size from much larger than, to just smaller than, the drop. The larger eddies deform the drop viscously by the velocity gradient created by the eddy. The smaller eddies deform the drop by fluid inertia. The critical phase of the drop break-up process is the initial deformation. If the drop is deformed to an aspect ratio of 3 - 5, the drop is then very quickly elongated into one or more filaments which may be <b>bent,</b> <b>coiled</b> and further deformed before they break up into many small droplets...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of electrical trees in bent sections of mica tapes is described.

The tapes are <b>bent</b> at the <b>coil</b> edges, at places where tapes overlap or due to the taping- and manufacturing process. Possible tape bends were therefore analysed by taking micrographs of industrially made model bars. To investigate the influence on time to breakdown, treeing experiments in needle-plane specimens with barriers of bent and unbent mica tapes were made. The {{results show that the}} tree can penetrate the tape below a certain bending radius, which depends on the tape material. Tree growth through a bent tape can lead to a significantly shorter time to breakdown. The results can be used for manufacturers to specify the minimum allowable tape bending and therefore assure a higher quality of the mica insulation. The results provide also a basis for development of tape materials with a lower sensitivity to damage at regions of tape bending...|$|R

SUMMARY ANSWER: WES for six families with men affected by MMAF syndrome allowed the identification of DNAH 1 mutations in four affected men distributed in two out of the six families but no new candidate genes were identified. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Mutations in DNAH 1, an axonemal inner dynein arm heavy chain gene, {{have been shown to}} be responsible for male infertility due to a characteristic form of asthenozoospermia called MMAF, defined by the presence in the ejaculate of spermatozoa with a mosaic of flagellar abnormalities including absent, <b>coiled,</b> <b>bent,</b> angulated, irregular and short flagella. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a retrospective genetics study of patients presenting a MMAF phenotype. Patients were recruited in Iran and Italy between 2008 and 2015. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: WES was performed for a total of 10 subjects. All identified variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Two additional affected family members were analyzed by direct Sanger sequencing. To establish the prevalence of the DNAH 1 mutation identified in an Iranian family, we carried out targeted sequencing on 38 additional MMAF patients of the same geographical origin. RT-PCR and immunochemistry were performed on sperm samples to assess the effect of the identified mutation on RNA and protein. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: WES in six families identified a causal mutations in two families.

40|$|The initial {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} the late 1960 's at Radiation Dynamics, Inc. (now IBA Industrial, Inc.) showed that by removing the pigment from a radiation curable coating formulation, the same binder system {{could be used as}} a matrix system for electron beam (EB) cured fiber reinforced composites. Recently, the binder systems used for EB curable coatings have also been successfully used (without pigments) as the matrices for EB and X-ray cured fiber composites. Insights gained from the development of coatings were translated into desirable properties for matrix materials. For example, understanding the surface wetting characteristics of a coating facilitated the development of a matrix that would wet fibers; the development of coatings that would adhere to rigid substrates as metal while being <b>bent,</b> as for <b>coil</b> coatings, and which would exhibit impact resistance when cured on a metal also imparted impact resistance to cured composite materials. Thermal analyses conducted on the coating binder cured at low energies were consistent with analyses performed on thick cross-sections as used for matrices. The configuration of the final product then dictated the modality of curing, be it low-energy EB for coatings or higher energy EB or X-ray curing for composites. In industrial radiation chemistry, one deals with monomers and oligomers (similar to 10 (2) and similar to 10 (3) to 10 (4) Daltons molecular weight, respectively). Thus, one can approach the development of coating binders or matrix systems as one would approach the synthesis of organic polymers. The desired final material is a fully cured and cross-linked polymer. In contrast, concepts involved in "formulating" are often derived from dealing with high molecular weight polymers (similar to 10 (5) + Daltons) in which intense mechanical mixing is used to bring different ingredients together. When synthesizing a radiation curable coating or matrix system, greater attention is given to microphase compatibility as reflected in the microhomogeneity of the entire material...|$|R
