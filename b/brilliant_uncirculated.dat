50|$|Two key {{moments in}} Hockey history have been commemorated on Canada’s silver dollar series. The {{first of these}} coins was the Centennial of the Stanley Cup. The Cup was first {{presented}} in 1893 to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association team by Lord Stanley. The RCM issued the coin in 1993, and the proof coin was in a black leatherette case, with a maroon insert and a Certificate of Authenticity. The <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Uncirculated</b> version was in a clear plastic outer case, with a black plastic insert and a silver sleeve.|$|E
50|$|U.S. coin grading {{has evolved}} {{over the years to}} a system of finer and finer grade distinctions. Originally, there were only two grades, new and used. This changed to the letter grading system {{beginning}} with the lowest grade - Basal State (also Poor (PO)), then continuing Fair (Fr), About or Almost Good (AG), Good (G), Very Good (VG), Fine (F), Very Fine (VF), Extremely Fine (EF), Almost or About Uncirculated (AU), Uncirculated (Unc) and up to <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Uncirculated</b> (BU). Gem Uncirculated was roughly equivalent in usage to BU at that time. Numerical grades from 1 to 70 now accompany the verbal grades.|$|E
5000|$|Coin {{dealers and}} {{individual}} coin collectors frequently use the terms <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Uncirculated</b> (often abbreviated as BU), Choice, Select, and Gem to describe Uncirculated (mint state) grades. Some numismatists argue that an unscrupulous subset of coin dealers mislead customers by using such terms. Although an official guide {{does not exist}} for adjectival grades, there appears to be at least some consensus in the numismatic community for the following definitions:However, {{bear in mind that}} if a coin dealer advertises a coin as [...] "Gem Uncirculated", it {{does not necessarily mean that}} a third-party coin grading company would assign an MS-65 or MS-66 grade to the coin.|$|E
50|$|China {{issued its}} first gold coins picturing a panda design in 1982, in sizes of 1, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/10 troy oz. of 99.9 fine gold. Beginning in 1983 another size was added - 1/20 oz. Larger panda coins were issued in some years, {{weighing}} 5 and 12 oz. These popular coins are issued in prooflike <b>brilliant</b> <b>uncirculated</b> quality {{with a different}} design each year. A freeze of the design was announced with the 2001 issues—and thus the 2002 pandas were identical to 2001. But collectors spoke up in behalf of annual changes, and China reverted to their original policy. There are several mints that produce these coins, including but not limited to: Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and Shenzhen. Unlike coins made by U.S. mints that carry mintmarks to distinguish their origin, Chinese mints usually do not employ mintmarks. In certain years there are minor variations—in {{the size of the}} date, style of the temple, etc.—in the coin design that allow the originating mint to be determined.|$|E
50|$|Jefferson nickels {{have been}} minted since 1938 at the Philadelphia and Denver mints {{and from the}} San Francisco mint until 1970. Key dates for the series include the 1939-D, and 1950-D nickels. The 1939-D nickel with a mintage of 3,514,000 coins is the second lowest behind the 1950-D nickel. The cause of the key date of 1939 stems from the new design that excited {{collectors}} the year prior, after the initial hype had settled down fewer nickels were saved. 2,630,000 nickels were minted in Denver in 1950, this remains the lowest mintage for the Denver mint in the series. Despite its low mintage the nickel is not rare, its value {{is thought to be}} connected to the <b>brilliant</b> <b>uncirculated</b> roll boom that burst between 1963 and 1964. On the opposite spectrum, the year 1964 saw the largest combined mintage of nickels to date. The result of the large mintages were due to a widespread shortage of small change that was blamed on coin collectors. the following year, The Coinage Act of 1965 removed all mint marks from nickels that were issued by the mints, this lasted until 1968 when the mintmark was moved from the reverse to the obverse side of the coin.|$|E
