5000|$|Play is {{centered}} on the game board. Dungeonquest is unusual in that the game board is only revealed as play progresses. The <b>board</b> begins <b>blank</b> except for a grid pattern and the treasure at the center. A set of [...] "room tiles" [...] are arranged randomly near the board, face down. Play progresses in turns as each player, controlling an adventurer, selects a tile at random and sets it down on a grid space on the board. Each tile represents a space and {{may be one of}} several different configurations. The space may be a room with several doorways, it may be a turn, a hallway, a dead end, a bottomless pit, a rotating room or several other spaces. In all, the game contains 115 room tiles.|$|R
50|$|The game Quixo {{is played}} on a 5 by 5 board of cubes with two players or teams. On a player's turn, they select a blank cube or a cube with their symbol on it {{that is at the}} edge of the <b>board.</b> If a <b>blank</b> cube was selected, the cube is turned to be the player's symbol (either a X or O). The game ends when one player gets 5 in a row.|$|R
50|$|Each play {{consists}} of a rune of a random color and shape being generated by the computer. The rune must be placed directly adjacent {{to at least one}} other rune (either above, below, or to the left or right; runes located at a diagonal to the square have no meaning), unless the <b>board</b> is totally <b>blank.</b> All runes that are adjacent to the square where a rune is being placed must share its color or shape.|$|R
50|$|So {{called because}} {{in it the}} blank tiles are recycled. If a blank tile is played to {{represent}} a particular letter, a player before his turn {{can pick up the}} blank and replace it by the letter that it represents. For example, if the word STRETTa is on the <b>board</b> (with a <b>blank</b> A), the player may pick up the blank and replace it with an actual A. However, he cannot replace it with an E, I, or O to produce STRETTE, STRETTI, or STRETTO.|$|R

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of printed circuit boards, electronic components are attached to a <b>blank</b> <b>board</b> {{by one or more}} pick-and-place machines. Frequent machine setups, though time consuming, can reduce overall processing time. We consider the Integrated Clustering and Machine Setup (ICMS) model, which incorporates this tradeoff between processing time and setup time and seeks to minimize the sum of the two. Solving this model to optimality is intractable for very large-scale instances. We show that ICMS is NP-hard and consequently propose and test a heuristic based on multi-exchange neighborhood search structures. Initial numerical results are very encouraging.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} antitakeover provisions on discretionary accruals. Prior studies indicate that antitakeover provisions are an example of managerial entrenchment. According to this view, antitakeover provisions {{can be used as}} a tool to conceal the private benefits of managers. Discretionary accruals are popularly recognized as means to hide the true financial performance of a firm. Thus, we expect that antitakeover provisions would exacerbate discretionary accruals. The alternative hypothesis is that antitakeover provisions are more likely to mitigate discretionary accruals. Managers are more likely to manipulate earnings when they are faced with earnings pressures and the possibility of losing their jobs. Antitakeover provisions help managers create long-term oriented and stable business environments by securing and maintaining the current management. Thus, antitakeover provisions diminish the concerns of managers regarding takeover threats, thereby mitigating their tendency to use discretionary accruals. By examining a sample of 4, 720 firm-year observations in the United States from 2007 to 2013, we find that several measurements for antitakeover provisions such as staggered <b>boards</b> and <b>blank</b> check are negatively associated with discretionary accruals. By contrast, golden parachutes, poison pills, and supermajority provisions are positively associated with discretionary accruals. Overall, our study provides evidence that antitakeover provisions play a significant role in determining a firm's discretionary accruals. clos...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} Gilbert's (1998) concept of {{internal and external}} shame, {{and the degree to}} which eye gaze diversion is associated with the activation of shame generally, or is more isolated to when either external (i. e., perceived negative judgements from others) or internal (when shame-evoking evaluations come from the self) shame is experienced. The study also examined experiences of dissociation to ascertain whether there is a relationship between shame and dissociation. It was hypothesised that if shame is associated with internal and external observations, more gaze diversion will occur when participants are looking at themselves in the mirror or at the experimenter than when looking at a <b>blank</b> <b>board,</b> during the shame induction. Secondly, if eye gaze diversion is more strongly related to external shame, participants will look away from the experimenter more, during the shame induction. Thirdly, if eye gaze diversion is more strongly related to internal shame, more gaze diversion will be evident when they view themselves in the mirror during the shame induction. It is also thought that experiences of dissociation will increase after the shame induction. Psychology students from the University of Canterbury (n = 78) completed four measures assessing trait and state shame and dissociation, and listened to audio clips of shame-inducing and neutral scenarios while either viewing themselves in a mirror (internal shame), looking at the researcher (external shame) or looking at a <b>blank</b> <b>board</b> (control). Eye gaze diversion was recorded across scripts and conditions. Although initial analyses did not reach significance, simple effects analyses do indicate that eye gaze diversion is more associated with external shame than internal shame or shame more generally. Furthermore, state dissociation was significantly higher following shame inductions, when compared to the neutral induction. Taken together, results indicate support for hypotheses two and four and do not support hypotheses one and three...|$|R
50|$|The Great Dinky Robbery was an {{incident}} on May 3, 1963, in which four men boarded the Dinky and abducted four passengers. Princeton {{was not yet}} co-educational, and weekend dates from women's colleges usually arrived by train. On a Friday evening, four Princeton University students, riding horses in Western attire, ambushed the train as it was arriving at Princeton station. A convertible was parked across the track, forcing the Dinky {{to come to an}} abrupt halt. The men, including George Bunn Jr., who was armed with a pistol loaded with <b>blanks,</b> <b>boarded</b> the train and persuaded four female passengers to leave with them. The Dinky later resumed its trip and arrived at Princeton station. Although the University administrators were aware of the event and may have known who was involved, they took no official action.|$|R

40|$|Sawing {{solid wood}} (lumber, wooden <b>boards)</b> into <b>blanks</b> is an {{important}} technological operation, which has significant influence on {{the efficiency of the}} woodworking industry as a whole. Selecting a rational variant of lumber cutting is a complex multicriteria problem with many stochastic factors, characterized by incomplete information and fuzzy attributes. About this property by currently used automatic optimizing cross-cut saw is not always rational use of wood raw material. And since the optimization algorithms of these saw functions as a “black box”, their improvement is not possible. Therefore topical the task of developing a new approach to the optimal cross-cutting that takes into account stochastic properties of wood as a material from biological origin. Here we propose a new approach to the problem of lumber optimal cutting in the conditions of uncertainty of lumber quantity and fuzziness lengths of defect-free areas. To account for these conditions, we applied the methods of fuzzy sets theory and used a genetic algorithm to simulate the process of human learning in the implementation the technological operation. Thus, the rules of behavior with yet another defect-free area is defined in fuzzy expert system that can be configured to perform specific production tasks using genetic algorithm. The author's implementation of the genetic algorithm is used to set up the parameters of fuzzy expert system. Working capacity of the developed system verified on simulated and real-world data. Implementation of this approach will make it suitable for the control of automated or fully automatic optimizing cross cutting of solid wood...|$|R
500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a <b>blank</b> <b>board</b> is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?'

60|$|A few dots {{like those}} used by the Bushmen give great {{assistance}} in creating an imaginary picture, as proved by our general habit of working out ideas by the help of marks and rude lines. The use of dolls by children also testifies {{to the value of}} an objective support in the construction of mental images. The doll serves as a kind of skeleton for the child to clothe with fantastic attributes, and the less individuality the doll has, the more it is appreciated by the child, who can the better utilise it as a lay figure in many different characters. The chief art of strengthening visual, as well as every other form of memory, lies in multiplying associations; the healthiest memory being that in which all the associations are logical, and toward which all the senses concur in their due proportions. It is wonderful how much the vividness of a recollection is increased when two or more lines of association are simultaneously excited. Thus the inside of a known house is much better visualised when we are looking at its outside than when we are away from it, and some chess-players have told me that it is easier for them to play a game from memory when they have a <b>blank</b> <b>board</b> before them than when they have not.|$|R
40|$|The {{contest for}} the {{presidency}} in 1864 is depicted as a game of bagatelle (a game similar to pool) between Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln and Democrat George B. McClellan. Lincoln (left) holds a cue "Baltimore" (the site of the Republican national convention) {{and is about to}} shoot a ball on "The Union Board. " He says to running mate Andrew Johnson (upper right), "I'll do the best I can Andy, I can do no more. " Johnson encourages him, "Hurrah for our side, go ahead Old Abe! O aint he bully on the bagatelle? you're only got a few more to make, It's A Sure Thing!!" Johnson points to the scoreboard which reads "Nix" for the "Copper" (i. e., Copperheads or Peace Democrats). The Union side of the <b>board</b> is <b>blank.</b> At left McClellan, dressed as a child, holds a cue "Chicago" (site of the Democratic national convention) and stands on a toppling "Chicago Platform," which appears to have been given a nudge by Lincoln's foot. A "Peace" plank has fallen from it. (McClellan was never entirely committed to the "peace at any price" principle advocated by Copperhead leader Clement L. Vallandigham.) McClellan complains, "This Cue 'is too heavy! and the' Platform's 'shakey!! O! O! I want to go back in the yard!!" His running mate George H. Pendleton (far left) retorts impatiently, "O see here. We cant stand this! Old Abe's getting in all the pots on the board, this game will have to be played over again or there'l be a fight, THAT'S CERTAIN. " At the far right Vallandigham sits with crossed legs, saying to McClellan, "There is nothing the matter with the Cue or the Platform, you had the first red and didn't make anything, now he'll win the game. " Union general Ulysses S. Grant smokes a pipe and stands near the middle of the table. He advises McClellan, "... you travel too near the ground to play on this board, better surrender UNCONDITIONALLY. " A grinning black waiter with a tray of drinks watches Pendleton and McClellan.
