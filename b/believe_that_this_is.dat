5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the great white shark, but most authors currently <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great white shark is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great white shark are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E

25|$|Many {{explanations}} for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see. People tend to view their risks as less than others because they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> what other people want to see.

It results from a dysfunction of cranial nerve VII (the facial nerve). Many <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to a viral infection that results in swelling. Diagnosis {{is based on a}} person's appearance and ruling out other possible causes. Other conditions that can cause facial weakness include brain tumor, stroke, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and Lyme disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{publicity}} {{from the}} anti-war riots crippled Humphrey's campaign from the start, {{and it never}} fully recovered. Before 1968 the city of Chicago had been a frequent host for the political conventions of both parties; since 1968 only one national convention has been held there (the Democratic convention of 1996, which nominated Bill Clinton for a second term). Many <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{due in part to}} the violence and chaos of the 1968 convention.|$|E
25|$|A white berried {{sport of}} Pinot noir was {{propagated}} in 1936 by Henri Gouges of Burgundy, {{and there is}} now 2.5ha planted of this grape which Clive Coates calls Pinot Gouges, and others call Pinot Musigny. There is however no published evidence, nor any obvious reason, to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> other than a (possibly quite fine) form of Pinot blanc, having simply arisen as a selected natural mutation of the original Pinot noir in the Gouges' vineyard.|$|E

25|$|When {{babies are}} born, they are kept indoors {{for seven days}} because Ghanaians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the period in which}} they are most {{vulnerable}} to both physical and spiritual harm. During this period, it is believed that the child is wandering between the spiritual and physical world and may decide {{to go back to the}} spiritual world at any point. They are known as strangers until the end of the seven days when they are acknowledged and welcomed into society with an elaborate naming ceremony, or outdooring ceremony.|$|E

Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government {{will not be able to}} implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia and therefore we reject them.|$|E
25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical sources, Benjamin was only born after Rachel had fasted {{for a long}} time, as a religious devotion {{with the hope of}} a new child as a reward. By then Jacob had become over 100 years old. Benjamin is treated as a young child in most of the Biblical narrative, but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons. Textual scholars <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the result of the genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the Jahwist and Elohist narratives, which make up most of the Joseph narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} {{possible}} inequality was {{the removal of}} women’s softball from the summer Olympics for 2012, which {{was considered one of}} the most popular women’s sports in the summer Olympics. Critics have argued that reinstating women’s softball in the 2016 Olympic Games would be a huge step towards gender equality, and they also suggest requiring each event at the Games to have a women equivalent, not just each sport. For example, if there are 10 men’s boxing events, there should also be 10 women’s boxing events. They <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> necessary because the Olympic Games need to set a high standard for sports programs and countries around the world to follow.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the use of}} {{the term}} priest to {{describe}} the ordained leader of the local parish church in Anglicanism, the term is generally avoided in the Sydney diocese because of its association with the sacrificial priesthood in the Old Testament and, also, its association with Roman Catholicism. The view taught at the diocese's Moore Theological College is that the priestly work has been completed, once for all, by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and that the local church leader is simply a minister of God's people, rather than mediating between the people and God. Sydney Anglicans <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> faithful to the heart of Anglicanism, rather than a break from tradition. When a distinction must be made from bishops, deacons and lay ministers, the term presbyter is often used.|$|E
25|$|All Canadian {{nurses and}} {{prospective}} nurses are heavily {{encouraged by the}} Canadian Nurses Association {{to continue their education}} to receive a baccalaureate degree. They <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the best degree to work towards because it results in better patient outcomes. In addition to helping patients, nurses that have a baccalaureate degree will be less likely to make small errors because they have a higher level of education. A baccalaureate degree also gives a nurse a more critical opinion, which gives him or her more of an edge in the field. This ultimately saves the hospital money because they deal with less problematic incidents. All Canadian provinces and territories except for the Yukon and Quebec require that all nurses must have a baccalaureate degree. The basic length of time that it takes to obtain a baccalaureate degree is four years. However, Canada does have a condensed program that is two years long.|$|E

500|$|Some biographers {{have noted}} that Wagner in his final years {{developed}} interest in the racialist philosophy of Arthur de Gobineau, notably Gobineau's belief that Western society was doomed because of miscegenation between [...] "superior" [...] and [...] "inferior" [...] races. According to Robert Gutman, this theme {{is reflected in the}} opera Parsifal. Other biographers (such as Lucy Beckett) <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not true, as the original drafts of the story date back to 1857 and Wagner had completed the libretto for Parsifal by 1877; but he displayed no significant interest in Gobineau until 1880.|$|E
500|$|Four {{lines of}} the poem survive, {{preserved}} in Hephaestion's Enchiridion, a treatise on meters in Greek poetry. [...] Most scholars <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> only a fragment of the original poem, though Diskin Clay argues that the poem is complete as it is. [...] The poem is composed in an Aeolic meter known as the hagesichorean, in which lines are of the form [...] "x – u u – u – –", where [...] "–" [...] represents a long syllable, [...] "u" [...] represents a short syllable, and [...] "x" [...] represents an anceps – a syllable which can be either long or short.|$|E

There's a large amount of profanity in the movie, which seems a weak attempt to paper over dialogue gaps." [...] Howell revised his opinion in a later review, and more recently stated that [...] "it may just be my favourite Coen Bros. film." ...|$|E
