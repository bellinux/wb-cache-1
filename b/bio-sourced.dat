40|$|International audienceRationaleTo {{develop more}} {{eco-friendly}} laundry detergents, renewable surfactants synthesized from vegetal sources {{are increasingly being}} used. In a more stringent regulation context, the determination of <b>bio-sourced</b> surfactant origin thus appears essential to assess the claims of detergent manufacturers. Radiocarbon determination, the standard method {{for the analysis of}} <b>bio-sourced</b> materials, is an expensive technique, so {{there is a need for}} a cheaper method. MethodsHere, the use of an elemental analyzer linked to isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (EA/IRMS) is evaluated as an alternative approach to the official method. The O- 18, C- 13 and H- 2 isotope-ratio values were determined to investigate the <b>bio-sourced</b> origin of surfactant raw materials and mixtures. ResultsA sample library of 26 commercial surfactants representative of detergent raw materials was first analyzed by EA/IRMS. The O- 18, C- 13 and H- 2 values allowed discrimination of synthetic and <b>bio-sourced</b> surfactants. Moreover, in this latter group, C 4 plant-derived surfactants were distinguished by their C- 13 values. Binary and ternary mixtures made of synthetic and <b>bio-sourced</b> surfactants were also analyzed and indicated a linear relationship between mixture isotope-ratio values and surfactant proportions. ConclusionsIRMS represents a viable alternative to radiocarbon determination for the evaluation of surfactant <b>bio-sourced</b> origin. It is a faster and cheaper technique, allowing discrimination of petroleum- and biomass-derived surfactants and identification of their carbon sources (C 4 or C 3 plants...|$|E

The <b>bio-sourced</b> compounds were not based on triglycerides but were smaller, industrially available molecules similar to classical petro-based monomers. Their polymerization kinetics was studied by photo-DSC and was shown to allow high acrylate conversions even at 25 degrees C. Closely related coatings enriched in alkyl segments, or in monoacrylates to decrease the crosslinking density, were compared. The material composition affects its nanomorphology deduced from X-ray diffraction. Although these changes in composition can slightly shift the mechanical relaxation, it remains wide, and the elastic modulus remains high (> 10 (8) Pa) for all the tested materials. Microscratch experiments highlighted the efficiency of all the new coatings in terms of protection against scratches. Incorporating a monoacrylate, particularly isobornyl acrylate, can improve the scratch resistance especially in terms of critical load (up to 175 % increase compared with a classical petro-based coating) ...|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel {{production}} from abundant <b>bio-sources</b> has drawn {{the attention of}} the academic as well as the industrial communities in recent years. However, {{one of the most serious}} obstacles for using biodiesel as an alternative fuel is the complicated and costly purification processes involved in its production. The difficulties involved in the separation of glycerine and other un-reacted reactants and by-products necessitate the development of new competent low cost separation processes for this purpose. In this work, a low cost quaternary ammonium salt-glycerine-based ionic liquid is proposed as a solvent for extracting glycerine from the transesterification biodiesel product. The separation technique was tested on palm oil-based produced biodiesel with KOH as a reaction catalyst. The study investigated the effect of DES:biodiesel ratio and the DES composition on the efficiency of the extraction process. The lab scale purification experiments proved the viability of the separation technique with a best DES:biodiesel molar ratio of 1 : 1 and a DES molar composition of 1 : 1 (salt:glycerine).

However, viscosity decreased to a plateau before reaching the thermodynamic solubility. The comparison with a model coupling solubility and flow allowed to identify the method limitations, which were attributed to the kinetics of dissolution and mixing.

Innovative efforts to promote osteogenesis are needed. Porcine brain extract (PBE) was reported to enhance the proliferation and differentiation of multiple primary cells. In this study, we aimed to develop a method for collecting PBE and investigate its effects on osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) and bone consolidation in a rat DO model. The PBE was collected from neonatal brain tissues of porcine fetus and was used to treat rBMSCs. Following PBE treatment (700 ng/ml), osteogenic differentiation was assessed. Further, we locally injected PBE (7 μg/ml, 100 μl) or PBS (100 μl) into the gap in a Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rat DO model every three days till termination. X-rays, micro-computed tomography, mechanical testing, histology and immunohischemistry examinations were used to exam {{the quality of the}} regenerates.

The present study was carried out to determine the effect of drying conditions on the chemical composition as well as the physical and functional properties and antioxidant activity of flours of this tuber. Slices of the yellow and mixed sections of the tubers were processed into flours by sun-drying (temperature a parts per thousand 35 A degrees C) and hot air electric drying at varying temperatures (50 A degrees C, 60 A degrees C, and 70 A degrees C) before milling. Drying temperature and technique showed marginal effect on the protein, fat, fiber, ash, and carbohydrate content of taro flours. Color attributes, physical and functional properties, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl radical antioxidant activity, as well as reducing power of flours were found to vary significantly (P < 0. 05) due to either the drying temperature or method. Hot air electric drying at lower temperatures (< 70 A degrees C) produced flour with higher water absorption capacity (WAC), water solubility index (WSI), porosity, bulk density, and preserved antioxidant activity of flour, whereas sun-drying was associated with flours of higher WSI but lower WAC, and lower antioxidant capacity. It was noticed that carotenoids and ascorbic acid contributed to the antioxidant activity in taro flours, and taro flours made of different taro portions showed different antioxidant mechanisms.

Advances in ABE process development in recent years have led to drastic increases in ABE productivity and yields, making butanol production worthy of evaluation for use in motor vehicles. Consequently, chemical/fuel industries have announced their intention to produce butanol from bio-based materials. The purpose of this study is to estimate the potential life-cycle energy and emission effects associated with using bio-butanol as a transportation fuel. The study employs a well-to-wheels analysis tool [...] the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model developed at Argonne National Laboratory [...] and the Aspen Plus{reg_sign} model developed by AspenTech. The study describes the butanol production from corn, including grain processing, fermentation, gas stripping, distillation, and adsorption for products separation. The Aspen{reg_sign} results that we obtained for the corn-to-butanol production process provide the basis for GREET modeling to estimate life-cycle energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.

These new approaches embrace the use of alternative feedstock and sustainable synthetic routes aiming for enhancing biodegradability and recyclability. This shift towards more benign strategies is considered positive from different perspectives. Through the exploitation of bio-based feedstock it is possible to minimize the carbon foot print {{at the same time as}} new tools for material formation are provided. The use of selective catalysts reduces the formation of side-products, minimizes or avoids the use of solvents and diminish energy consumption. At the same time, new polymeric structures can be formed in terms of functionality and architectures.   The work herein presented have focused on the development of sustainable synthetic routes for the formation of bio-based polymeric materials with targeted properties. In order to afford this, two <b>bio-sources</b> have been explored for the retrieval of different epoxy-fatty acids, i. e. outer birch bark and vegetable oils. In order to be able to tailor the final material properties and thus be able to target specific applications, we have relied on the selectivity of lipases to preserve the epoxy-functionalities during synthesis. Through the design of specific polymer architectures, e. g. telechelic oligomers, and branched or linear macromers, different degrees of functionality could be prepared. By covalently reacting the epoxy groups through different polymerization techniques, polymer networks were achieved. The proposed synthetic approach resulted in polymeric materials with wide variety of properties ranging from functional networks, to high Tg materials and adhesives, prepared all from renewable sources.

40|$|Abstract Background Laser bio-stimulation is a {{well-established}} procedure in Medical Acupuncture. Nevertheless {{there is still}} a confusion as to whether it works or the effect is just placebo. Although a plethora of scientific papers published, showing positive clinical results, {{there is still a}} lack of objective scientific proofs about the bio-stimulation effect of lasers used in Acupuncture. The objective of this work was to design and build a body surface electrode and an amplifier for biopotential recording from acupuncture points, considered here as small localized <b>bio-sources</b> (SLB). The design is aimed for studying SLB potentials provoked by laser stimulus, in search for objective proofs of the bio-stimulation effect of lasers used in Medical Acupuncture. Methods The active electrode presented features a new adjustable anchoring system and fractionation of the biopotential amplifier between the electrode and the cabinet's location. The new adjustable electrode anchoring system is designed to reduce the electrode-skin contact impedance, its variation and motion artifacts. That is achieved by increasing the electrode-skin tension and decreasing its relative movement. Additionally the sensing element provides local constant skin stretching thus eliminating the contribution of the skin potential artifact. The electrode is attached to the skin by a double-sided adhesive pad, where the sensing element is a stainless steel, 4 mm in diameter. The fractionation of the biopotential amplifier is done by incorporating the amplifier's front-end op-amps at the electrodes, thus avoiding the use of extra buffers. The biopotential amplifier features two selectable modes of operation: semi-AC-mode with a - 3 dB bandwidth of 0. 32 – 1000 Hz and AC-mode with a bandwidth of 0. 16 – 1000 Hz. Results The average measured DC electrode-skin contact impedance of the proposed electrode was 450 kΩ, with electrode tension of 0. 3 kg/cm 2 on an unprepared skin of the inner forearm. The peak-to-peak noise voltage measured at the amplifier output, with input terminals connected to common, was 10 mV p-p, or 2 μV p-p referred to the input. The common-mode rejection ratio of the amplifier was 96 dB at 50 Hz, measured with imbalanced electrodes' impedances. The prototype was also tested practically and sample records were obtained after a low intensity SLB laser stimulation. All measurements showed almost a complete absence of 50 Hz interference, although no electrolyte gel or skin preparation was applied. Conclusion The results showed that the new active electrode presented significantly reduced the electrode-skin impedance, its variation and motion artifact influences. This allowed SLB signals with relatively high quality to be recorded without skin preparation. The design offers low noise and major reduction in parts, size and power consumption. The active electrode specifications were found to be better or at least comparable to those of other existing designs. </p...|$|R

Acetobacter aceti was grown on a medium with 8 g/l of ethanol as substrate, with tryptone 3 g/l, Yeast extract 5 g/l and K 2 HPO 4 50 mM (pH= 7, 0). At {{the end of the}} exponential phase (about 24 h), the cells were concentrated by centrifugation and re-suspended in the same sterile medium (the final cell concentration factor was 2, O. D. 620 nm= 3) with a similar composition as the one used for the growth phase. 1, 3 PDO was used as the sole carbon source and it was tested at three levels (10, 20 and 40 g/l). Tests were carried out at least in triplicate. It was shown that in 24 h up to 12 g/l of 1, 3 PDO was completely converted into 3 -HP. Maximum conversion rate was achieved when 20 g/l of 1, 3 PDO was used and reached up to 0. 4 g. l- 1. h- 1. The objective was to obtain a complete conversion of glycerol into 3 -HP. Therefore a conversion of 1, 3 PDO and 3 -HP by A. aceti was evaluated before testing the more complex system issued from a culture of Lactobacillus reuteri. It was shown that when up to 20 g/l of the two compounds were added into the medium, 1, 3 PDO was consumed and 3 -HP was produced with a productivity of 0, 3 g. l- 1. h- 1. This productivity reduced quickly as conversion progressed. Finally the conversion by Acetobacter aceti of an effluent of culture of Lactobacillus reuteri was tested. The culture medium was obtained from a fed batch culture of Lb reuteri containing 12 g/l of 3 -HP and 10 g/l of 1, 3 PDO. The effluent was separated into three to cultivate A. aceti: 1. Acetobacter was cultivated in the whole culture of Lb reuteri, 2. The cells of Lb reuteri were removed from the culture medium, this medium was mixed with the medium described in the previous paragraph (1 vol/vol) before cultivation by A. aceti, 3. A. aceti was cultivated without the cells of Lb reuteri and without extra medium. In all 3 cases the bioconversion of 1, 3 PDO happened and between 16 and 19 g/l of 3 -HP was found after 24 hours. In all cases there was 1, 3 PDO remaining, between 4 and 7 g/l, indicating an incomplete bioconversion. The HPLC measurements have shown that when 1, 3 PDO is in excess, some 3 hydroxypropionaldehyde,which is very toxic to the cells, is also present in the medium. An adapted control of the 1, 3 PDO addition to the acetobacter culture may probably prevent this problem...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{report the}} {{elaboration}} of novel <b>bio-sourced</b> ecocatalysts for the Cu catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC). Ecocatalysis {{is based on the}} recycling of metals issued from rhizofiltration of metal rich effluents, and an innovative chemical valorization of the subsequent biomass in the field of catalysis. Taking advantage of the remarkable ability of Eichhornia crassipes to accumulate Cu(II) into its roots, these can be directly used for the preparation of copper containing ecocatalysts, called EcoCu, which appear as highly active catalysts in the CuAAC reaction. Furthermore, the recycling of Cu from the reaction mixture via E. crassipes is carried out ecologically. The resulting EcoCu 2 material displays reusability for the CuAAC reaction under identical experimental conditions without a loss of its catalytic activity...|$|E

These low-density foams offer low thermal conductivity and have an impressive potential for use in insulating materials. They constitute attractive alternatives to conventional polyurethane foams. We investigated CO 2 ’s ability to synthesize the cyclic carbonates {{that are used in}} the preparation of NIPU by melt step-growth polymerization with a <b>bio-sourced</b> amino-telechelic oligoamide and for NIPU foaming. Our study shows that CO 2 is not only sequestered in the material for long-term application, but is also valorized as a blowing agent in the production of NIPU foams. Such foams will contribute to energy conservation and savings by reducing CO 2 emissions. Peer reviewe...|$|E
