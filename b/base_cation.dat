Notwithstanding large emission reductions in the region, {{forest ecosystem}}s in the Potok Dupniański still suffer from very high loads of acidifying input. Soil recovery depends on future emission, and especially on <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> and nitrogen deposition. While higher <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> deposition will promote recovery, continual elevated nitrogen deposition in the future may delay recovery owing to its interference in the biogeochemical cycle (e. g. by increasing <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> uptake from the soil) ...|$|E
40|$|To reduce {{atmospheric}} deposition, in 1990 Congress passed {{amendments to}} the Clean Air Act requiring electric utility power plants to decrease emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, with Phase I beginning in 1995. We analyzed precipitation volume, wet deposition, and concentration of the sum of base cations measured at 12 National Atmospheric Deposition Program sites in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. We compared five-year means prior to and following passage of the amendments and for {{five years after the}} implementation of Phase I. Whereas only one of the monitoring stations recorded a decline in <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> deposition, three sites out of the 12 showed a decline in <b>base</b> <b>cation</b> concentration. None of the sites exhibited a significant change in precipitation volume...|$|E
40|$|Surface (0 – 10 cm) {{samples from}} 7 highly {{weathered}} soils in tropical coastal Queensland were incubated for 3 months {{at room temperature}} and at field moisture capacity with basalt dust applied in 2 size fractions: < 150 μm and 40 μm. The basalt application was mixed at 0, 1, 5, 25, and 50 t/ha to cover situations of moderate applications as well as where the amendment might be banded to achieve high local concentrations. Basalt dust application caused desirable increases in soil pH, reduced the content of exchangeable acidic cations, increased soil cation exchange capacity, and increased the content of <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> in all soils. By determining fundamental surface charge characteristics of these variable charge soils, {{it was possible to}} show that the additional <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> released from the basalt dust were present as exchangeable cations, and that the amounts released were controlled by the number of negatively charged sites available, i. e. soil cation exchange capacity. Selected treatments were then subjected to a strong leaching environment to assess the longevity of the effects obtained. Soil properties remained virtually unchanged by the leaching treatment, except that significant amounts of monovalent K and Na were removed. At the higher rates of application, the amounts of <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> released from the basalt were small in comparison with the actual amounts applied, indicating that the amendment could be effective over a considerable period of time...|$|R
50|$|Many plants produce organic acids. Where plant litter accumulates on or is {{incorporated}} {{to the soil}}, these acids (including acetic acid, humic acid (see http://www.suprahumic.unina.it/), oxalic acid, and tannic acid) are liberated. This is especially acute in soils under coniferous trees such as pine, spruce and fir, which return fewer <b>base</b> <b>cations</b> to the soil than do most deciduous trees.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of increasing cobalt soil contamination (0 mg·kg− 1, 20 mg·kg− 1, 40 mg·kg− 1, 80 mg·kg− 1, 160 mg·kg− 1, 320 mg·kg− 1) after the application of neutralising substances on selected soil properties. In the soil without an addition of neutralising substances, the highest doses of cobalt caused the pH, total exchangeable <b>bases,</b> <b>cation</b> exchange capacity and the degree of base saturation to decrease and the hydrolytic acidity of soil to increase. Among the substances used, zeolite and calcium oxide (particularly) had the most advantageous influence on the analysed soil properties. They caused the pH, total exchangeable <b>bases</b> and <b>cation</b> exchange capacity to increase and the hydrolytic acidity to decrease. Among the other substances, it was charcoal that had the greatest influence on the soil properties, but the way it influenced the total exchangeable <b>bases,</b> the <b>cation</b> exchange capacity of soil and the degree of base saturation were opposite to the way calcium oxide influenced these properties...|$|R
