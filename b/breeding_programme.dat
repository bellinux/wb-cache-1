5|$|This type {{of small}} white terrier {{dates back to}} the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795. In 1819 he {{purchased}} a small white and tan terrier bitch named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford. She formed the basis for his <b>breeding</b> <b>programme,</b> and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of Fox Terrier.|$|E
5|$|In Jersey, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in {{partnership}} with the States of Jersey and the National Trust for Jersey began a project in 2010, aimed at restoring selected areas of Jersey's coastline with the intention of returning those birds that had become locally extinct. The red-billed chough was chosen as a flagship species for this project, having been absent from Jersey since around 1900. Durrell initially received two pairs of choughs from Paradise Park in Cornwall and began a captive <b>breeding</b> <b>programme.</b> In 2012, the red-billed choughs were living free in the central valley area of Durrell Wildlife Park, and the Trust expects colonisation of the coastal areas of Jersey in the following years.|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the self-compatible trait for {{commercial}} apricot cultivars and selections from <b>breeding</b> <b>programmes</b> {{is of great}} importance for apricot breeders and growers. A study on self-incompatibility of the main growing cultivars in Europe as well as selections from European and American <b>breeding</b> <b>programmes</b> has been carried out. Out of 123 cultivars tested, 72 {{were found to be}} self-compatible while 42 were self-incompatible. For nine cultivars results were not conclusive. Many of the self-incompatible cultivars were obtained from <b>breeding</b> <b>programmes,</b> which indicates that not enough {{attention has been paid to}} this undesirable characteristic during the selection processe...|$|R

25|$|Other colors {{have been}} {{developed}} from this initial base set, {{with varying degrees of}} popularity and recognition. In 1989 a cinnamon <b>breeding</b> <b>programme</b> was started in the Netherlands; the first fawn kitten was born in 1998. Cinnamon, fawn, caramel, and apricot Burmese have also been developed in New Zealand, as have tortoiseshell variants of all these colors. A new colour mutation has arisen in Burmese lines being bred in New Zealand and an experimental <b>breeding</b> <b>programme</b> began in 2007. The colour is called russet and appears {{to be the result of}} the dark pigment in the cats' coats fading as they grow, while paler orange pigment remains.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in dairy sheep breeding Most {{of the genetic}} <b>breeding</b> <b>programmes</b> in dairy sheep are focused on increasing milk and milk composition. However, due to the general changes in the objectives of livestock, these programmes {{are more and more}} focused on other traits, especially milk composition traits, udder morphology and somatic cell count. The use of molecular technologies is still very limited according to the results obtained. Their future interest and applicability for the implementation of <b>breeding</b> <b>programmes</b> will depend on the improvements achieved and their technical and economic cost. Their future will be more as a complement (and specially for traits that are not selection criteria) rather than as an alternative to classical genetic evaluation.

Meerkats and crested porcupines are kept in a co-habitated enclosure nearby, and a nearby paddock is home to warthogs.|$|E
25|$|As well as jaguars, Chester Zoo keeps lions, tigers and cheetahs in its big cat collection. The lions are the Asiatic {{subspecies}} {{found only}} in the Gir Forest in India in the wild. The zoo's former resident male Asoka was joined by a female, Asha, from Rome in 2006. The pair have bred on three occasions, but so far their only offspring to survive has been a male cub, Tejas, born and hand-reared in 2007. His upbringing was featured prominently in the first series of Zoo Days. Tejas left Chester Zoo for Besancon early in 2008 {{as part of the}} European <b>breeding</b> <b>programme</b> for this subspecies. Asoka left the zoo in early 2010, he was moved to Rome Zoo as part of the European <b>breeding</b> <b>programme.</b> His replacement is 3-year-old Iblis, who arrived from Planckendael Zoo in Belgium. In late summer 2011, Asha retired to Santillana Zoo and was replaced by four-year females Kiburi and Kumari.|$|E
25|$|The Lion <b>Breeding</b> <b>Programme</b> creates and {{maintains}} breeding centres. It also carries out {{studies of the}} behaviour of the Asiatic lions and also practices artificial insemination.

25|$|This tiny monkey, {{named for}} its {{beautiful}} golden colour and the long hair around its head which resembles a lion's mane, {{is one of the}} rarest primates in the world. Golden lion tamarins, like many of the other tamarins found in South America, are threatened with extinction in their natural habitat. Dublin Zoo is involved in the international <b>breeding</b> <b>programme</b> and helps to fund researchers who study the tamarins in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{was among}} the first zoos in the world to breed white tigers and the common {{reticulated}} giraffe. While it has successfully bred some megafauna, its rate of breeding rare species had not been very successful, often due to lack of initiative and funding.

25|$|Chester Zoo holds a {{large and}} diverse collection.

In addition, Chester holds 265 threatened plant species.|$|E
25|$|Their {{conservation}} status as documented by the IUCN Red List {{is listed as}} vulnerable, having been amended in 2004 from the taxon's previous status as data deficient following some more extensive studies. This reflects the likely increase in disturbances to their habitat caused by human activities, in particular {{on the island of}} Katchal. The Wildlife Institute of India however registered their status in 2002 as critically endangered, reflecting also their concerns that conservation efforts with regards to a defined captive <b>breeding</b> <b>programme</b> were deficient.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, after {{constructing}} a new enclosure for critically endangered Amur leopards, a female leopard (Jade) escaped and fell {{from a tree}} to her death after being shot with a tranquilizer dart only days before the official opening of the exhibit.
