If you still want to download it on a newer operating system the only way is to use an outdated web browser such as Netscape 4.8.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from most music critics. In {{an article for}} The Source, The Ghetto Communicator wrote [...] "This record is harsh, {{but so is the}} world that we live in. For B-boys n'girls who come from the core of the hard, this is the hip-hop album you've been waiting for". Rolling Stones review was decidedly ambivalent, praising the album's sound, but noting that [...] "Wu-Tang... are more ciphers than masterful creations. In refusing to commodify themselves, they leave blank the ultimate canvas—the self." [...] Entertainment Weekly was more enthusiastic, giving the album an A, and writing that [...] "With its rumble jumble of drumbeats, peppered with occasional piano plunking, Enter has a raw, pass-the-mike flavor we haven't heard since rap was pop's best-kept secret."

500|$|The opening chorus has {{an unusual}} structure, which {{includes}} an arioso passage for the bass voice. All instruments except the trumpet play a ritornello, after which a choral fugue pictures the weeping and wailing {{of the text}} in unrelated musical material, rich in chromaticism. In great contrast the following line, [...] "" [...] (But the world will rejoice), is conveyed by the chorus embedded in {{a repeat of the}} first part of the ritornello. The sequence is repeated on a larger scale: this time the fugue renders both lines of the text as a double fugue with the second theme taken from the ritornello, then the ritornello is repeated in its entirety. The bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings three times, with a sudden tempo change to adagio, [...] "" [...] (<b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be sad) as an accompagnato recitative.

[...] Klaus Hofmann compares the recitative's [...] "highly expressive melody and harmony" [...] to Bach's Passions. Finally, the extended sequence of fugue and ritornello with chorus returns transposed, on the text [...] "" [...] (Yet your sorrow shall be changed into joy). According to Alfred Dürr, the architecture of the movement is a large scale experiment combining elements of the older style of a text-related motet with the form of a concerto of instrumental groups and voices, as typically used by Bach.|$|E
