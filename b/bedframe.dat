5|$|This is {{followed}} with Spears performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal <b>bedframe.</b> Spears then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once Spears finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that Spears becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. Spears appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, in Japan, futon {{mattresses}} {{are usually}} either {{placed on a}} <b>bedframe</b> or on the floor, {{without the use of}} springs.|$|E
50|$|Beside {{the shelter}} shed is a three-sided hut of {{corrugated}} iron on a bush timber frame, containing a wood stove and a <b>bedframe.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{wooden frames}} with a middle section {{consisting}} of springs {{held in place}} by wire (to be put into the wooden <b>bedframe</b> as a unit) used to be the standard for most of the 20th century. The springs have mostly been replaced by pre-bent wooden slats (usually glulam made from beech or birch) which are joined to the outer wooden frame by some form of flexible rubber bolt, shoe or socket. This lath floor provides suspension, allows the mattress to ventilate, and can be designed to be vertically adjustable in order to elevate the legs and / or the torso. A more simple approach is to join straight laths with a textile strap {{so that they can be}} rolled up for transport and placed right into the <b>bedframe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pane is {{possibly}} {{best known for}} her performance piece The Conditioning (1973), in which she is laid on a metal <b>bedframe</b> over an area of burning candles. The Conditioning was recreated by Marina Abramović as part of her Seven Easy Pieces (2005) at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The Vibrating Bed - The contestants must {{convert the}} queen-sized bed into a {{vibrating}} bed by attaching a vibrating motor. Matt passes in short order. Ajay fails after erroneously installing the vibrating motor underneath the <b>bedframe</b> rather than fitting {{it to the}} side. Charlene also fails for this reason. Rob, having already injured his hand, injures himself again trying to install it, so he fails (though his installation is correct). Dan also passes with ease.|$|E
50|$|Other rooms contain only a rusting iron <b>bedframe,</b> {{beneath a}} black and white {{photograph}} showing the room as it was found by the Vietnamese. In each photograph, the mutilated body of a prisoner is chained to the bed, killed by his fleeing captors only hours before the prison was captured. Other rooms preserve leg-irons and instruments of torture. They are accompanied by paintings by former inmate Vann Nath showing people being tortured, which were added by the post-Khmer Rouge regime installed by the Vietnamese in 1979.|$|E
50|$|Erin {{receives}} many messages {{after the}} intranet is launched. Some are nice, agreeing {{that what she}} wrote was correct, but much more common were the mean notes. Rosie still supports her, her family along with her. Unfortunately, many other people do not, Jilly especially. Erin agrees that she did write some pretty horrible things about her, including Jilly's bruises from her <b>bedframe</b> that result from her fear of monsters in the night. Jilly thinks Erin released the blog to get even with her, and is embarrassed, enraged, and hurt.|$|E
5000|$|Al-Janabi later {{described}} {{that while}} detained he was punched, kicked, stripped, chained, hung upside {{down from a}} <b>bedframe,</b> kept naked and handcuffed in his cell, and repeatedly deprived of food and sleep. He also {{claimed to have been}} threatened with rape, violent death, and execution and witnessed a mock execution of his brother and nephew. He said that after being discovered by the International Committee of the Red Cross during a surprise inspection in October, he was thereafter hidden withcontractor help from future inspections as a [...] "ghost detainee".|$|E
50|$|Some parents pose {{threats to}} infants {{due to their}} {{behaviors}} and conditions, such as smoking or drinking heavily, taking drugs, a history of skin infections, obesity, or any other specific risk-increasing traits. In addition, there are certain dangerous behaviors that increase SIDS and should be avoided whether placing a baby in a crib or co-sleeping: infants should always sleep on their backs on a firm surface (not waterbeds, pillows, recliners, or couches), mattresses should intersect the <b>bedframe</b> tightly, {{there should be no}} stuffed animals or soft toys near the baby, blankets should be light, a baby's head should never be covered, and other SIDS risk factors should be avoided.|$|E
50|$|A box-spring (or divan in some countries) {{is a type}} of bed base {{typically}} {{consisting of}} a sturdy wooden frame covered in cloth and containing springs. Usually the box-spring is placed on top of a wooden or metal <b>bedframe</b> that sits on the floor and acts as a brace, except in the UK where the divan is more often fitted with small casters. The box-spring is usually {{the same size as the}} much softer mattress that is placed on it. Working together, the box-spring and mattress (with optional bed frame) make up a bed. It is common to find a box-spring and mattress being used together without the support of a frame underneath, the box spring being mounted directly on casters standing on the floor.|$|E

5000|$|Episode 3 - Days 7-10 (September 28) - After Geoff spends another $500 on {{a garbage}} bin (now leaving them with $3500) to address Ron's concerns, {{a trip to}} an {{electronics}} recycling depot by Anthony and Jean-Marc yields nine identical computer monitors, giving Jean-Marc the idea to hang the monitors as a showpiece for the room. While Jean-Marc works on them, Geoff takes Gordie and Anthony to task for not getting the junk they desperately need, being behind schedule on many fronts. This irks the two freecyclers, as the [...] "freecycling to spec" [...] needed for this job contrasts with the traditional method of freecycling renovation (freecycling to hoard supplies, and starting work only after the necessary materials are found). Nevertheless, freecycling trips by {{the two of them}} nets the crew some old plumbing that the crew can reuse for their shower, most (but not all) of the kitchen cabinetry they need, as well as a bathtub that, after Geoff declares it to be unusable (due to the rusted drain {{and the fact that they}} have an existing tub), Michelle repurposes as a sofa. Because they are behind schedule, Geoff, behind the rest of the team's back, commissions a tiler to help tile the bathroom for $1200. In the end, despite being pleased with Jean-Marc's nine-monitor display, Ron is visibly concerned that the work is behind schedule, and the problem is compounded when he orders the teardown of a <b>bedframe</b> that Cam and Ross had taken half a day to build.|$|E
5000|$|One torture method {{which was}} very {{commonly}} used was the [...] "grill" [...] or [...] "La Parrilla." [...] In this torture, electricity was fed from a standard wall outlet through a control box into two wires each terminating in electrodes. The control box gave the torturers the option of adjusting the voltage being administered to the prisoner. The naked prisoner was stretched out and strapped onto a metal <b>bedframe,</b> or a set of bedsprings, and tied down. He or she was subjected to electrical shocks on several parts of the body, especially on sensitive areas like the genitals and on open wounds. The Valech Report includes a testimony of a Chilean man who was interrogated by prison captors. They took off his clothes and [...] "attached electrodes to his chest and testicles. They put something in his mouth so he would [...] "bite his tongue while they shocked him." [...] In another method, one of the wires would be fixed to the prisoner (typically to the victim's genitalia) while another wire {{could be applied to}} other parts of the body. This caused an electric current to pass through the victim's body, with a strength inversely proportional to the distance between the two electrodes. A smaller distance between the electrodes led to a stronger current and thus more intense pain for the prisoner. A particularly barbaric version of the [...] "grill" [...] was the use of a metal bunk bed; the victim was placed on the bottom bunk and on the top bunk, a relative or friend was simultaneously tortured.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Valery {{goes to a}} {{party by}} himself, since his girlfriend (Artemy's niece) needs to study. At the concert Valery meets another female student friend of his named Angelika (Agniya Kuznetsova), the {{daughter}} of a high-ranking Communist Party official, and they drink together. After the party, in search of more alcohol, Valery drives with her to a farm of moonshiners, which {{turns out to be the}} same farm Artemy had visited earlier. Valery tells Angelika to stay in the car while he gets the alcohol. However, instead of returning directly to the car, he gets drunk senseless with the moonshiner, Alexey. Angelika, waiting in the car, notices that she is being watched by a strange man. She gets scared, and tries to get help from Antonina, who gives the girl a shotgun and hides her in a barn. The stranger, who turns out to be a police officer Captain Zhurov (Aleksei Poluyan), enters the barn and takes away the gun. When Sunka tries to defend the girl, Zhurov murders him, then rapes the girl with a bottle (it appears that he himself is impotent). In the morning he handcuffs her, taking her to his flat in Leninsk, and keeps the girl handcuffed to a <b>bedframe</b> in his bedroom, watched over by his deranged alcoholic mother, while he brings local small-time criminals in to rape her, killing one after he fails to [...] "please" [...] the girl. The girl threatens that her fiancé, who is an army paratrooper, will save her. Captain Zhurov finds out, however, that her fiance had just been killed in Afghanistan. He arranges to have the zinc-lined coffin shipped to his apartment where he opens it and throws the corpse on the bed next to the screaming girl.|$|E

Two or three other bundles or sleeping people are visible in the shadows inside the dwelling. Two blankets hang near the doorway. A chair, stroller, <b>bedframe,</b> and other household items sit in a jumble between the dwelling and under another wooden shelter at left. A pan or basket {{on the roof of the}} thatched dwelling is covered with branches. Legible writing includes: [...] . "Squadron [ [...] . ] & Java" [...] Wild grass grows in the background...|$|E

Bottom photos are inside Carolyn's single apartment in East Hollywood. (Bottom left) Mary Lochen with cane and Carolyn Weathers with eye patch (from a contact lens scratch.) Mary and Carolyn had {{walked on the}} beach, eaten a fine dinner and gone to Carolyn's apartment for their first evening of lovemaking. As they were so engaged, the Murphy bed began to rise up straight up. Mary fell off and cut her knee on the metal <b>bedframe.</b> Carolyn had {{to take her to}} the Kaiser emergency room on Sunset for stitches. Mary spent the night at Carolyn's. Instead of making love, they drank coffee and they laughed a lot. And so ended their first date.
