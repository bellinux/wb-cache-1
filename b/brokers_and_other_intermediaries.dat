50|$|Cost Basis Reporting is a {{term used}} in the {{financial}} services industry that refers to identifying the actual cost of a security for income tax purposes. Cost basis reporting became mandatory on January 1, 2011. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 - popularly known as the “bailout bill” - {{was signed into law}} on October 3, 2008 to address the mounting global financial crisis. The Act also had important cost basis ramifications, because Section 403 contained provisions that place significant cost basis-related requirements on <b>brokers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>intermediaries</b> who report their clients’ adjusted cost basis on IRS Form 1099.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fact that}} the {{middlemen}} (search engines) {{have the upper hand}} in the operational definition of invalid clicks is the reason for the conflict of interest between advertisers and the middlemen, as described above. This is manifested in the Tuzhilin Report as described above. The Tuzhilin report did not publicly define invalid clicks and did not describe the operational definitions in detail. Rather, it gave a high-level picture of the fraud-detection system and argued that the operational definition of the search engine under investigations is [...] "reasonable". One aim of the report was to preserve the privacy of the fraud-detection system in order to maintain its effectiveness. This prompted some researchers to conduct public research on how the middlemen can fight click fraud. Since such research is presumably not tainted by market forces, there is hope that this research can be adopted to assess how rigorous a middleman is in detecting click fraud in future law cases. The fear that this research can expose the internal fraud-detection system of middlemen still applies. An example of such research is that done by Metwally, Agrawal and El Abbadi at UCSB. Other work by Majumdar, Kulkarni, and Ravishankar at UC Riverside proposes protocols for the identification of fraudulent behavior by <b>brokers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in content-delivery networks.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{alternative}} {{data sets}} originate {{as a product}} of a company’s operations, these data sets are often less readily accessible and less structured than traditional sources of data. Alternative data is also known as “exhaust data.” The company that produces alternative data generally overlooks the value of the data to institutional investors. During the last decade, many data <b>brokers,</b> aggregators, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>intermediaries</b> began specializing in providing alternative data to investors and analysts.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{frequent}} assertion that commissions paid to <b>brokers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> financial <b>intermediaries</b> lead to unsuitable advice, it is puzzling that {{this practice is}} pervasive. We offer two rationales for why advice may be compensated indirectly through (disclosed or undisclosed) commissions or other payments made by product providers, rather than directly through a flat fee paid by the customer. Indirect compensation may allow product providers and their agents to maximally exploit customers who are naive about the true conflict of interest at the advice stage. Commissions also arise under efficient contracting with wary customers, even though advice will then be biased. Policy intervention that is directed towards making customers pay directly for advice would thus be bene…cial for channels populated (or for products purchased) mainly by naive customers, {{but it may be}} counterproductive otherwise...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} that innovation occurs in networks of heterogeneous actors and requires broad systemic support beyond knowledge brokering {{has resulted in}} a changing landscape in the intermediary domain in the increasingly market-driven agricultural sector in developing countries. This paper presents findings of an explorative case study that looked at 22 organizations identified as fulfilling an intermediary role in the Kenyan agricultural sector. The results show that these organizations fulfill functions that are not limited to distribution of knowledge and putting it into use but also include fostering integration and interaction among the diverse actors engaged in innovation networks and working on technological, organizational, and institutional innovation. Further, the study has identified various organizational arrangements of innovation intermediaries, with some organizations fulfilling a specialized innovation <b>brokering</b> role <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>intermediaries</b> taking on <b>brokering</b> as a side activity, while substantively contributing to the innovation process. On the basis of these findings, we identify a typology of four innovation intermediation arrangements including technology broker, systemic broker, enterprise development support, and input access support. The results indicate that innovation brokering is a pervasive task in supporting innovation and will require policy support to embed it in innovation support arrangements, but without prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach...|$|R
40|$|While Australia 2 ̆ 7 s {{consumer}} policy framework has considerable strengths, {{parts of it}} require an overhaul.
