500|$|A {{little girl}} named Lucie {{lives on a}} farm called Little-town. She is a good little girl, but has lost three pocket {{handkerchiefs}} and a pinafore. She questions Tabby Kitten and Sally Henny-penny about them, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> nothing (especially since Tabby Kitten licks her paw, and Sally Henny-penny flaps back into the barn clucking, [...] "I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!" [...] neither of which is very helpful). Lucie mounts a stile and spies some white cloths lying in the grass high on a hill behind the farm. She scrambles up the hill along a steep path-way which ends under a big rock. She finds a little door in the hillside, and hears someone singing behind it: ...|$|E

2500|$|Tunney {{formerly}} attended Droylsden Academy Secondary School. [...] She said, [...] "I've {{not been}} to school {{for quite a long}} time <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> why I'm away and where I'm going, they're supportive about everything and I sometimes take work with me." ...|$|E
60|$|The village {{could be}} {{distinctly}} seen, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> it was, nevertheless, several miles off.|$|R

2500|$|The Men in Black {{work for}} the above [...] "Office Worker" [...] in {{tracking}} down and murdering all {{of the members of}} the Knights. They are not told the true plan, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that Masami Eiri is somehow involved, despite having been [...] "killed." [...] They see no need for an almighty, all-powerful God—let alone Lain—in the Wired.|$|E
2500|$|Dubinsky {{proved to}} be far more durable than his predecessors. He did not brook dissent within the union and insisted that every {{employee}} of the International first submit an undated letter of resignation, to be used should Dubinsky choose to fire him later. He also acquired the power to appoint key officers throughout the union. As he explained his position at one of the union's conventions: [...] "We have a democratic union [...] <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> who's boss." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{last part}} of the novel is devoted to the {{circumstances}} of Norkus' (or Heini Völker's) death. According to Baird (1992), Schenzinger's version is a [...] "thinly veiled parallel to Resurrection": When his comrades were gathered around his death bed and wonder whether he is still alive, there [...] "suddenly [...] is a scream. Heini is sitting up in bed, his eyes wide open. He is singing. They don't recognise the words, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> the melody. It's the song they sing every day, every evening together, on every march. Everyone knows what it means - death is singing here." ...|$|E
2500|$|So they lefte [...] goodly & pleasante citie, {{which had}} been ther resting place, nere 12 years; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were pilgrimes, & looked not much on these things; but lift up their eyes to ye heavens, their dearest cuntrie, and quieted their spirits.|$|R
60|$|They cried some, of course, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> {{very well}} <b>they</b> {{deserved}} the punishment, {{and it was}} not long before all of them were sound asleep.|$|R
60|$|Neither of {{the boys}} {{understood}} the words which the other spoke; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> very well that they were both listening to {{and talking about the}} roaring.|$|R
2500|$|The {{attack was}} a {{surprise}} to the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade as it was different from previous loyalist attacks. Thomas Mitchell suggested that it was the [...] "most effective attack ever mounted by the loyalists against a republican target". Wright considered Cappagh to have been a successful UVF operation and took personal credit for [...] "wiping them out". He discussed this in the Guardian newspaper:"I genuinely believe that we were very successful, and that may sound morbid <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that we hammered them into the ground and we didn't lose one volunteer. Indeed, members of the security forces had said that we done what they couldn't do, we put the East Tyrone brigade of the IRA on the run. It was the East Tyrone brigade which was carrying on the war in the North, including in Belfast. East Tyrone were decimated, the UVF wiped them out and that's not an idle boast". When asked about the military importance of specific UVF operations, Wright replied, [...] "I would look back and say that Cappagh was probably our best".|$|E
2500|$|The Guardians Charlie Brooker, whilst [...] "struggling {{to absorb}} the sheer scope of [...] hateful idiocy", accused her of [...] "dancing" [...] on Gately's grave before he had even been buried. Caitlin Moran of The Times said the article was [...] "vile". The editor of UK gay {{magazine}} Attitude questioned why Moir linked Gately's death with the recent suicide of the former partner of comedian Matt Lucas, asking [...] "If that's not homophobic, what is homophobia?" [...] The Daily Telegraphs Damian Thompson said [...] "Moir's reputation is in tatters this evening". The PCC contacted the Gately family and investigated if they receive a formal complaint from them, but stated they were {{not in a position}} to act directly on complaints from members of the public. A PCC spokesman said [...] "We're trying to work out what the complaints are. Offensiveness is not within the remit of the PCC – we deal with accuracy and intrusion." [...] However, the column featured only in the British version of the newspaper, being removed from the Irish Mail and replaced instead by positive tributes to the singer's life. According to Sky News, the Gatelys [...] "are aware of the article, they have not read it, they will not read it, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> what is contained in it and they know the sentiment" [...] and [...] "are just very, very disappointed".|$|E
60|$|There--I'm {{called to}} see company. The family seldom require this of me, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> I am not working today.|$|E
60|$|Neither Twinkle nor Chubbins {{felt any}} effect from the magic, nor any {{different}} from ordinary; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were growing smaller, because their eyes were getting closer to the magician.|$|R
5000|$|Professional wrestler Mick Foley {{described}} the Nasty Boys {{in his autobiography}} as [...] "sloppy as hell, {{and more than a}} little dangerous, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> how to brawl." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "They are of {{the same}} way of thinking, I take it. They are not good at inventing any way {{of getting out of}} their troubles; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> how to endure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{they did}} indeed hear, {{but they did}} not understand, for they know not your {{language}}; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> the language of signs, and, by the looks and gestures of the warriors, they guessed what was said and planned." ...|$|E
6000|$|Eskimos {{know nothing}} of a blow [...] "straight from the shoulder," [...] <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> how to cuff. Oolalik brought his open hand down on Gartok's cheek with a pistol-shot crack that tumbled that fire-eater head over heels on the ground.|$|E
5000|$|So {{they left}} that goodly and plesante citie, {{which had been}} their resting place near 12 years; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> were pilgrimes and looked not much on those things, but lift up their eyes to the heavens, their dearest cuntrie, and quieted their spirits.

60|$|Maggie {{had left}} St. Philip's School, and {{had found a}} more congenial post. The two girls {{remained}} friends. They met at evening classes, they studied and somehow encouraged a firm hope each in the other. <b>They</b> did not <b>know</b> whither <b>they</b> were making, nor what <b>they</b> ultimately wanted. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> wanted now to learn, to know and to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{white men}} may be wise and brave, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> not how to aid you, I {{am not so}} {{well-known}} in the town. I will venture into it, and will show them where to go and what to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [181] This is {{obviously}} untrue. Animals {{do not know}} death {{in the sense of}} scientific definition, and probably have no abstract idea of it as a general state; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> and are afraid of its concrete phenomena, and so are most savages.|$|E
6000|$|... "What sort {{of friends}} could I have?" [...] she asked. [...] "The {{girls in the}} chorus with me are very nice, some of them, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> so many people whom I don't, and they are always out to supper, or {{something}} of the sort." ...|$|E
60|$|Foreknowledge to the {{distance}} of {{a year or so}} in either of them might have spoiled the effect of that pretty speech. Never deceive her! <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> nothing, and the phrase had its day.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was not all}} {{success at}} first," [...] said his mother; [...] "there was hard work, and disappointment, and heavy sorrow too; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> how to bear it, and to win through with it." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} raining, {{and the day}} was fast drawing to a close. The {{lightning}} and thunder had passed away to the westward, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> the downfall would last {{at least an hour}} or so longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why, no,' says Ogden; 'they say nobody {{got a good}} {{sight of}} him because he wore a mask. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> it was a train-robber called Black Bill, because he always works alone and because he dropped a {{handkerchief}} in the express-car that had his name on it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} hold on like this," [...] said Angut. [...] "The Innuit are very ignorant, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> many {{things about the}} weather, for they are always {{watching}} it. To-morrow will be warm. We cannot escape. It will be safest and wisest to remain where we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{forced me}} into a corner," [...] McFarlane said to Wayland, peevishly. [...] "I lied out of one night; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that you were here last night. Of course, they were respectful enough so long as I had an eye on them, but their tongues are wagging now." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Judge {{turned his}} face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> {{that he was not}} praying, [...] "Silas," [...] said Mr. Carvel, [...] "we were friends for twenty years. Let us be friends again, before--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was a wild}} kind of life up there, Robert, {{and this}} was {{apparent}} in nothing {{more than in the}} names people used. I daresay some of the people did call her Mrs. Caldigate. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> she was not my wife.' ...|$|R
60|$|To {{those who}} were unaccustomed to the coast, {{it seemed as if}} the {{schooner}} were leaping forward to certain destruction; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> that a sure hand was at the helm, and thought not of the danger but the sublimity of the scene.|$|R
