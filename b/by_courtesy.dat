25|$|When Barton {{retired to}} become one of the {{founding}} justices of the High Court, Deakin succeeded him as Prime Minister on 24 September 1903. His Protectionist Party did not have a majority in either House, and he held office only <b>by</b> <b>courtesy</b> of the Labor Party, which insisted on legislation more radical than Deakin was willing to accept. Deakin was the first PM to call an early election, within two months of becoming the leader, to catch his opponents off guard and take advantage of a large number of urban educated female voters who could cast a ballot for the first time. In April 1904, he resigned without passing any legislation. The Labor leader Chris Watson and the Free Trade leader George Reid succeeded him, but neither could form a stable ministry.|$|E

In their values and stances, they represent a mature classical poetry: passion is balanced <b>by</b> <b>courtesy,</b> transparency by ironies and nuances of design, impersonality by vivid detail, austerity of line by richness of implication.

2500|$|Upon the {{shipwreck}} {{and death}} of his father in 1619, the lad was <b>by</b> <b>courtesy</b> styled Viscount Thurles. The year following that disaster, his mother brought him back to England, and placed him, then nine years of age, at school with a Catholic gentleman at Finchley — this doubtless through the influence of his grandfather, the 11th Earl. It was not long before James I of England, anxious that the heir of the Butlers should be brought up a Protestant, placed him at Lambeth, under the care of George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury. The Ormond estates being under sequestration (as noted {{in the life of the}} 11th Earl) the young Lord had but £40 a year for his own and his servant's clothing and expenses. He appears to have been entirely neglected by the Archbishop — [...] "he was not instructed even in humanity, nor so much as taught to understand Latin".|$|E
