5|$|Combs {{created a}} merit system for state {{government}} workers, ensuring that officials {{could not be}} hired or fired for political reasons. This provision attracted more well-qualified people to public service careers. Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for political gain. While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power. The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county school <b>board</b> <b>members</b> from office; the replacement <b>board</b> <b>members</b> then ousted McGuire.|$|E

5|$|Ford often opposed {{governor}} Mark Sanford's political goals, arguing {{his proposed}} reforms were unwanted by the public, and he mostly opposed Sanford's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor, claiming he {{was removed from}} the interests of citizens. An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly. He also opposed Sanford's goal {{to increase the number of}} roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 immigration reform bill favored by Sanford, stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety. The reform would have required all employers to use state driver's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers. Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor's authority to appoint and remove <b>board</b> <b>members</b> overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for <b>board</b> <b>members.</b> Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.|$|E
