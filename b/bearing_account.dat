40|$|This paper {{develops}} and solves {{a general}} finite horizon trade credit economic ordering policy for an inventory model with deteriorating items under inflation and time value of money when shortages are not allowed. The time horizon {{is divided into}} different cycles {{each of which has}} its own demand rate and its own trade credit period offered from the supplier to his retailer so that the retailer should pay his supplier before or {{after the end of the}} permissible trade credit of that cycle. Up to the end of the trade credit of a cycle, the retailer is free of charge, but he is charged on an interest for those items not being sold before this end. The retailer can also earn the interest of the money from the generated sales revenue in any cycle by depositing such revenue into an interest <b>bearing</b> <b>account.</b> The objective of the retailer is then to minimize his net total relevant costs. A closed form of this net total cost is derived and the resulting model is solved. Then rigorous mathematical methods are used to show that, under some seemingly possible conditions, there exist a unique vector of the relevant decision variables that solve the underlying inventory system. A numerical example which shows the applicability of the theoretical results is given.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{importance}} of household credit in the transmission of monetary policy and in explaining the positive correlation between money and credit services over the business cycle.

There is an explicit financial sector with firms specializing in the production of credit services. Second, the financial sector also contains financial intermediaries who provide interest <b>bearing</b> <b>accounts</b> for households and loanable funds to credit producers. It is shown that monetary injections in this set-up can generate a liquidity effect which positively influences the availability of household credit services and real activity. Furthermore, the model predicts that monetary injections actually lower the real cost of consumption, thus resolving a difficulty with recent liquidity effect models. The potential quantitative importance of this monetary transmission mechanism is analyzed. Housing; Housing - Finance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a {{monetary}} explanation of two business cycle regularities: (i) business and household investment are positively correlated and procyclical and (ii) household investment tends to lead business investment. We construct a general equilibrium framework that explicitly incorporates a credit sector where real resources are employed {{in the production of}} costly household and business credit services. Financial intermediaries provide interest <b>bearing</b> <b>accounts</b> to households and loanable funds for credit producers. It is shown that liquidity effects from asymmetric monetary injections to the financial sector increase the availability of consumer and business credit services. The relative strength of these liquidity effects on business and household spending can provide a mechanism which captures both the direction and timing of their corresponding investments expenditures over the cycle. Furthermore, explaining these observations with a household credit channel also resolves some problematic predictions of existing liquidity effect models. Investments...|$|R

40|$|Centre bearing {{forces and}} wear losses in three piece bogies have been {{simulated}} using VAMPIRE®. Bogie rotational resistance has been modelled at centre bearings and constant contact side bearers accounting for uneven loading during track transitions. The detailed model handles cylindrical centre <b>bearings</b> <b>accounting</b> for rim wall contact {{as well as}} the centre plate planar friction connections and uneven loading. The simulations have been performed for a range of curve radii assuming gauge face lubricated track. Wagons of moderate or high friction resistance to bogie rotation at centre bearings and side bearers have shown altered wheel wear, reducing maintenance cycle times in operations for rollingstock. In this paper, simulation studies have examined the effects of cant deficiency / excess and transition curvature on the wear performance of wagons and individual wheelsets, in particular the high wearing leading wheelsets. Wheel wear is shown to be altered due to changes in bogie rotation friction moments retained through the curve when cant deficiency of the curve is altered. The simulation results also show that transition curvature design can be used to reduce high wheel/rail wear in 3 piece bogies generated by high bogie rotation resistance. In the same way, transition curvature design can be used to alter the wheelset angle of attack during constant curving on 3 piece bogies...|$|R
40|$|High damping {{natural rubber}} (HDNR) bearings, {{commonly}} employed to isolate structures, {{are subjected to}} biaxial horizontal deformations by the seismic motion. If they have virgin material properties, biaxial models including the stress softening due to the Mullins effect {{should be used for}} describing their force–deformation behaviour. Specific studies oriented at characterizing and modelling the biaxial behaviour of HDNR <b>bearings</b> <b>accounting</b> for the stress-softening are very few in number because they would require a large number of virgin isolators or long times of rest between two consecutive tests. Moreover, available studies consider the Mullins effect as an isotropic phenomenon, whereas experimental investigations have shown that it is direction-dependent and thus induces anisotropy of the rubber behaviour. This paper describes an extensive experimental campaign carried out on a large number of small material test pieces aimed at achieving a satisfactory characterization of the biaxial anisotropic response of a highly dissipative rubber compound. These results are then used to develop a two-dimensional constitutive model for the virgin HDNR material accounting for the direction-dependence of the Mullins effect, based on the concept of representative directions applied to the biaxial shear deformation state. Because for commonly employed laminated HDNR bearings under design actions the approximation of uniform simple shear is realistic, the proposed material model {{can also be used to}} simulate the global bidirectional horizontal response of the bearings...|$|R
