5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to lock up on the starting line, ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when a <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of a second before ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship {{with a total of}} five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E

[...] The vote was indecisive (no candidate received {{a majority of the}} votes cast), and the choice was given to the General Court to decide. [...] Its first candidate, James Bowdoin, refused the post, as did the second choice, James Warren, and the choice went to Cushing on the third ballot. [...] He then served in the post, most of the time serving under his friend John Hancock, until his death in 1788. [...] In early 1785 Hancock offered his resignation to the legislature, partly as a political maneuver (although he claimed to be suffering a particularly <b>bad</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> gout at the time). [...] The legislature did not insist that Hancock remain in office, resulting in Hancock actually resigning. [...] Cushing became Acting Governor and served out the last few months of the term. [...] The 1785 election for governor was highly political and divisive; Cushing was portrayed by his opponents (principally Bowdoin and his supporters) {{as little more than a}} creature of Hancock who would do Hancock's bidding. [...] The election was again undecided by the electorate; Bowdoin prevailed in the General Court's decision-making, and Cushing again won the lieutenant governor's office. [...] Bowdoin served two terms, which were dominated by Shays' Rebellion, an uprising caused in part by Bowdoin's harsh fiscal policies and poor economic conditions in the rural parts of the state. [...] In 1787 Hancock returned to politics, trouncing Bowdoin. [...] In each of these elections Cushing was reelected as lieutenant governor.|$|E

40|$|There {{are reasons}} {{for us to}} act in certain ways and think certain things. We can {{recognise}} those reasons {{for what they are}} and respond to them accordingly. This thesis is an investigation of that phenomenon. In particular, it constitutes an attempt to resist certain ways in which our understanding of it can be distorted by letting our account of it be informed by <b>bad</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> responding to reasons: cases in which one takes something to be a reason and responds accordingly by acting or thinking in the way it seems to one to recommend, even though one fails (blamelessly) to act or think for a genuine reason. I examine and reject three ways in which the possibility <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>cases</b> might distort our thinking about the phenomenon at issue. First, we should reject the thought that the subject is able to act or think for the reason that p in both <b>bad</b> <b>cases</b> and good, so that acting or believing for a reason cannot simply be identical to the success condition of responding to a genuine reason. Second, we should reject the thought that the reasons for which we act and think are psychological features of ourselves, because that must be so in <b>bad</b> <b>cases,</b> and what goes for <b>bad</b> <b>cases</b> goes across the board. Finally, we should reject the thought that acting in response to a genuine reason involves only a rationalising explanation of the same type as that which is present in the <b>bad</b> <b>case.</b> The result is a vindication of the position promoted by Raz (2011) : responding to reasons is a matter of acting or thinking in a way than manifests one's knowledge of the reasons there are for one to so act or think, so that the reasons in question, which are usually facts about the external world, explain why one does so qua reasons. <b>Bad</b> <b>cases</b> are a diﬀerent kind of thing entirely...|$|R

40|$|Decentralization is {{commonly}} advocated {{as a means}} to improve primary services and hence accelerate social development. Although solid theoretical arguments support this position, the empirical evidence by and large does not. This paper examines whether local governance can improve public service delivery, and hence social development, empirically with detailed evidence on good and <b>bad</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> public service effectiveness in Bangladesh. We examine the institutional underpinnings of service provision, digging down beneath the formal and informal “rules of the game” to analyze the beliefs, understandings and dispositions that drive social behavior. Such ideas and attitudes set the incentives faced by both producers and users of public services, and hence the degree of accountability that public servants face. We find that changes in attitudes, which led to improvements in social indicators, coincided with rising educational levels, and training and outreach by NGOs. But such changes affected all of Bangladesh in similar ways. Regional variation in social outcomes is explained by the presence in certain areas of a dense web of relationships that enmeshed such advances, and their protagonists, in local systems of authority and legitimacy, strengthening their actions and making local society more susceptible to change...|$|R
