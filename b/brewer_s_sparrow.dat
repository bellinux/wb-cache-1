40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{decline in}} numbers of Henslow’s Sparrows in North America (Sauer et al. 2001) is {{generally}} considered to be due to reduction in the extent of its preferred breeding habitat, “relatively large fields consisting of tall, dense grass, a well-developed litter layer, standing dead vegetation, and sparse or no woody vegetation” (Herkert et al. 2002). Since 1985, however, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has allowed payments to landowners by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to idle croplands and to seed them to various grasses. This has provided habitat that appears to have stabilized Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> numbers {{in some parts of the}} breeding range (Herkert 1997; Herkert et al. 2002; Reinking 2002; McCoy 2000). Nebraska has 472, 000 hectares (l, 166, 000 acres) of CRP grassland, about four times more than the remaining area of tallgrass prairie (Steinauer and Collins 1996), but most is aging, unmanaged, and less attractive to most grassland birds (Negus 2005). To better understand the occurrence of Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> in Nebraska, we surveyed grasslands south and east of Lincoln from May to August 2006. The survey goals were to search for grassland sites that might provide suitable nesting habitat, count Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> at each site, and use point counts to estimate abundance of Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> in this region...|$|R

40|$|We tested how edges affect nest {{survival}} and predator distribution in a native tallgrass prairie system in southwestern Missouri using artificial nests, natural nests of Dickcissels (Spiza americana) and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Ammodramus henslowii), and mammal track stations. Survival of artificial nests was lower within 30 m of forest edge. Nesting success of Dickcissels and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrows</b> was lower within 50 m to a shrubby edge than at greater distances, whereas fates of nests were {{not related to}} distances to roads, agricultural fields, or forests. Evidence from clay eggs placed in artificial nests indicated that mid-sized carnivores were the major predators within 30 m of forest edges. Furthermore, mid-sized carnivores visited track stations most frequently within 50 m of forest edges. Because proximity of woody habitat explained more variation in nest {{survival and}} mammal activity than did fragment size, it appears that edge effects were more pronounced than area effects. Edge effects appeared to be caused mainly by greater exposure of nests to mid- sized carnivores. We argue that, based on edge avoidance behavior, 2 ̆ 2 grassland-interior 2 ̆ 2 species such as the Henslow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> respond to edge effects mainly by a decrease in density, whereas habitat generalists such as the Dickcissel are affected mainly by a decrease in nesting success...|$|R

40|$|The {{grassland}} bird-community {{has declined}} significantly in abundance and diversity in Illinois {{over the past}} century. Reclamation of surface coal-mines in southern Illinois has created ca. 50, 000 ha of grassland habitat that offers surrogate habitat for grassland and shrubland birds. Much of the grassland habitat created by reclamation of mine lands has not been managed and has succeeded to shrubland habitat dominated by both native and non-native shrubs. The purposes of this research were to identify the bird community utilizing reclaimed surface-mines in southern Illinois, and to examine the habitat-associations of the bird community and compare those to previously reported habitat-associations. I examined bird communities, plant structure and composition, and invertebrate communities at grasslands and shrublands at 3 reclaimed surface-mines in southern Illinois. I used 100 -m wide strip-transects to survey the bird community and measured habitat characteristics including: vegetation height and density, litter depth and cover, shrub density and height, and plant composition.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Little {{is known}} about the {{breeding}} biology of the Le Conte 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> (Ammodramus leconteil), probably because of its secretive nature. We provide new information on several aspects of Le Conte 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Sparrow</b> breeding biology, including rates of nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and potential factors affecting breeding densities and nesting success of the species. Our study was conducted in the tallgrass prairie of northwestern Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota during 1998 - 2002. Breeding densities varied among years, but this variation was not clearly linked to climatic patterns. Vegetation had some influence on densities of Le Conte 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrows; densities were highest in grasslands with moderate amounts of bare ground. Prairie patch size and the percentage of shrubs and trees in the landscape had no recognizable influence on density. Nesting success was highly variable among sites and years and increased slightly with distance from trees. Rates of nest parasitism were low (1 of 50 nests parasitized), and clutch sizes were similar to those of other studies of Le Conte 2 ̆ 7 s Sparro...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the impacts}} of {{livestock}} and human activities on riparian zones and associated wildlife have been well documented, {{little is known about}} the impacts that browsing by large native ungulates such as elk and moose may have. In the northern Yellowstone area, some willow stands experience intense browsing by elk and moose whereas others experience medium or very low amounts of browsing. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the species and densities of birds among willow stands that have experienced different intensities of browsing by native ungulates, (2) to measure the relationship between five species of birds and aspects of habitat structure, and (3) to develop and evaluate predictive models that relate presence or absence of the five species to habitat characteristics.

40|$|I {{examined}} {{reproductive success}} and post-fledging dispersal of shrubsteppe-obligate passerines {{to determine if}} either mechanism might contribute to the reduced abundance previously reported for these species in fragmented habitat. During 1999 and 2000, I monitored nests of sage thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus), sage sparrows (Amphispiza belli), and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Spizella breweri) in fragmented, edge, and contiguous shrub steppe habitat in southwestern Idaho. The combination of nest success and relative abundance among sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrows</b> was consistent with trends I would expect if contiguous habitat functioned as a source and fragmented habitat as a sink (only fragmented and contiguous treatments were consistently compared among all species). Nest success of these two species was significantly less in fragmented habitat, whereas relative abundance between treatments was similar. Conversely, nest success and relative abundance of sage sparrows were similar between treatments. I fit logistic regression models of nest success for sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrows</b> using both local and landscape scale predictor variables. Heterogeneity of shrub habitat (Angular Second Moment) was included in models for both species (but at different scales) and was used to create maps predicting the relative probability of nest success for each species in my study area. I examined post-fledging dispersal of sage thrashers from contiguous and edge habitats only, as no birds fledged in fragmented habitat. Twenty individuals from 10 nests (1999, n = 7; 2000, n = 3) were monitored up to 44 days. To evaluate habitat associations of juveniles as they dispersed, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to environmental measures around nests and dispersal locations. No correlation was found between habitat occupied by juveniles and time during the first 30 days away from the nest and habitat variability increased with time. Furthermore, dispersal distances varied greatly among juveniles. Lack of habitat affinity suggests that post-fledging dispersal might not be responsible for lower numbers of shrubsteppe-obligate birds in fragmented habitat. My results suggest that dissimilar reproductive success between fragmented and contiguous habitat could contribute to reduced numbers of shrubsteppe-obligate birds in fragmented habitat. I also {{found no evidence that}} post-fledging dispersal might function to decrease bird densities in fragmented habitat and it may actually facilitate an exchange of individuals between habitats when they are adjacent. This potential source - sink scenario could lower the population equilibrium. Therefore, I recommend that managers should concentrate on preserving habitat conducive to successful reproduction. This might include identifying larger landscape configurations, via Geographic Information System (GIS) applications, that are correlated with high nest success (e. g. in my study, low shrub heterogeneity and high shrub composition was positively related to the nest success of sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sparrows).</b> Subsequently, variables at smaller scales should be evaluated. Until we determine the relationship between natal and breeding habitats of shrubsteppe-obligate passerines, protecting habitats that correlate with high nest success likely is our most effective tool to minimize population declines...|$|R

During 1979 - 2001, we assessed abundance of passerine birds (9 grassland species and 1 shrub-associate species) on 2 brush-invaded, mixed-grass prairie tracts at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge in northwestern North Dakota. Each tract encompassed 90 ha (220 ac) that were being restored through 4 prescribed fires then 3 consecutive years of grazing by cattle. Fires were separated by 2 - 4 years of rest (i. e., nondisturbance) and grazing was initiated 2 years after the last fire.

Assessing the impacts of hybridization can be challenging, however, as determining the relationship between individual fitness {{and the extent of}} introgression in wild populations is difficult.

Biotic stressors associated with nesting in tidal environments suggest an important role for differential adaptation in shaping hybrid zone dynamics, with saltmarsh sparrows predicted to be better adapted to nesting in salt marshes.

To test for reduced survival of hybrid females, we also used capture data to assess the distribution of admixed male and female individuals across age classes.
