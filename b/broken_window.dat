At about 2:15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters unconscious and out of air in their SCBAs. The firefighters were brought to a medical triage set up on the 20th floor. There were attempts at resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful and the firefighters were pronounced dead.|$|E

50|$|<b>Broken</b> <b>windows</b> {{policing}} {{is a form}} {{of policing}} based on <b>broken</b> <b>windows</b> theory. It is also sometimes called quality-of-life policing. William J. Bratton popularized this policing strategy as New York City's police commissioner during the mid-1990s.|$|R
40|$|Originating in the New York City Transit System, "broken windows" {{enforcement}} {{has become}} a widely implemented policing strategy. Research testing the effectiveness of focused enforcement upon minor offenses and "uncivil" behaviors, however, has been inconclusive. There has been no study which has addressed <b>broken</b> <b>windows</b> enforcement as an explanatory factor for clearance rates. Most previous research on clearance rates were completed {{more than two decades}} ago, well before the implementation of structured <b>broken</b> <b>windows</b> enforcement. Utilizing official crime data for the thirty-five largest municipal police agencies in Texas from 1990 through 2004, this research examined the relationship between <b>broken</b> <b>windows</b> enforcement and clearance rates for UCR Part I offenses. Using hierarchical multivariate linear modeling (HMLM) analysis to capitalize upon the longitudinal characteristics of the data allowed examination of the influence of <b>broken</b> <b>windows</b> enforcement across a wide spectrum of agencies over a long time period. <b>Broken</b> <b>windows</b> enforcement showed inconsistent results across the different crime types. <b>Broken</b> <b>windows</b> enforcement had a positive impact on the clearance rates for burglaries and a marginal impact on auto theft clearance rates. In the case of larceny clearance, greater levels of <b>broken</b> <b>windows</b> arrests actually had a negative relationship. For all of the offense categories, the number of sworn officers was negatively related to the clearance rates. Crime per officer measures showed negative significant effect on the clearance rates for the property offense categories. ...|$|R

After Pitt's death in 1806, Ferguson did not so easily retain his seat in Parliament. In the elections of 1806, he retained the seat by just two votes, and his opponent General Alexander Hay demanded he be investigated for bribery and corruption. Ferguson again beat Hay in the contest for the seat in June 1807, but {{this time with a}} more convincing majority of 54 to 39 votes. Ferguson was unopposed in the next three elections. Some records indicate that Ferguson never spoke in the Commons except to complain about a <b>broken</b> <b>window</b> behind his seat causing a draught. He is actually recorded as speaking on at least five occasions over the years.|$|E

25|$|After a {{long day}} searching from house to house, the ATS checked a crib with a <b>broken</b> <b>window</b> on the {{north-eastern}} side of the township. The crib had large hedges on both sides, and a fibrolite shed at the rear. The group spotted Gray briefly at a window, and a battle ensued. Police put a stun grenade through a window, but it bounced off a mattress that Gray had placed as a barricade and landed back near police. Police fired teargas into the crib. Gray began shooting not at police but through the fibrolite shed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} {{raised by}} union supporters is that unionized workers will spend their higher wages, driving {{economic growth and}} creating new jobs. Union opponents respond {{that this is an}} example of the <b>broken</b> <b>window</b> fallacy; union supporters assume that money is more valuable in the hands of unionized workers than in the hands of whoever else would obtain it in the union's absence. There is some evidence that this is not a fallacy, as greater wealth equality seems to be correlated with greater economic growth. Union supporters counter that unions, if organized without violence or government help, are part of the free market; if unions can win higher wages for their workers without coercion, those wages are legitimate.|$|E

25|$|By Knox's account, {{having spent}} the night with Sollecito, she arrived at Via della Pergola7 {{on the morning of}} 2November 2007, finding the front door open and drops of blood in the {{bathroom}} she shared with Kercher. Kercher's bedroom door was locked, which Knox took as indicating that Kercher was sleeping. After showering in the bathroom she and Kercher shared, Knox found feces in the toilet of the bathroom shared by Romanelli and Mezzetti. Knox went back to Sollecito's home and later returned with him to Via della Pergola7. Noticing a <b>broken</b> <b>window</b> in Romanelli's bedroom and alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, Sollecito unsuccessfully tried to force the door open. Sollecito called his sister, a lieutenant in the carabinieri, for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{recycling}} is {{performed by the}} entrepreneurial poor such as the karung guni, zabbaleen, the rag-and-bone man, waste picker, and junk man. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or economies of scale, the poor {{are more likely to}} be driven out of the recycling and the remanufacturing market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor. Like the parable of the <b>broken</b> <b>window,</b> there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.|$|E

Over 400 people were made homeless and there was a major loss of shrimping nets. At least ten people were left homeless in the town of El Mezquital. Homes in Santa Teresa sustained some damage but none were destroyed. Only one person was injured by the storm after shards from a <b>broken</b> <b>window</b> hit the child. Following the storm, General Jesus Ponce de Leon Rodriguez went to survey the damage in Tamaulipas along with a medical team.|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer Shelly Johnson, in {{collaboration}} with director Lurie and the design team, also used lighting and camerawork to signify the shifting of powers. For example, the yard is at first naturally lit and more influenced by daylight, in contrast to Winter's office, which is artificially illuminated by lamps. As the film progresses, the office is more fully infiltrated by exterior light through a <b>broken</b> <b>window.</b> The shift of power is also emphasized through camera techniques. Hand-held cameras were used when filming in the yard to make the audience {{feel as if they}} were [...] "participants in the action". However, a very precise, sterile camera composition was used in the warden's office. The prisoners' world gets more precise during the film, while the colonel's world is filmed more loosely.|$|E

5000|$|James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling first {{introduced}} the <b>broken</b> <b>windows</b> theory {{in an article}} titled <b>Broken</b> <b>Windows,</b> in the March 1982 The Atlantic Monthly. The title comes from the following example: Consider a building with a few <b>broken</b> <b>windows.</b> If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it's unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.Or consider a pavement. Some litter accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of refuse from take-out restaurants there or even break into cars.|$|R
