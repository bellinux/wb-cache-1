500|$|In Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, Thersites compares Menelaus, {{brother of}} Agamemnon, to a louse: [...] "Ask me not what I would <b>be,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were not Thersites; for I {{care not to}} be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant {{has been}} more direct in his {{description}} of Anarky's virtuous attributes: [...] "In my eyes, Anarky's a hero. Anarky's the hero I want to <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was smart enough and physically fit enough." [...] Acknowledging that Anarky's moral perspective was guided by his own, Grant expressed that the conflict between Anarky and other heroes {{is a result of}} their political divisions: [...] "In my eyes, he's a hero, but to others, they see him as a villain. That is because most people might gripe about the political situation, or various aspects of the political situation, and wouldn't advocate the total overthrow of the system under which we live. Anarky certainly does that, and more." ...|$|E
500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} I will ever <b>be.</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E

500|$|The part of John Munch {{was based}} on Jay Landsman, a {{practical}} joker who was known in his homicide unit for his morbid wit. Both Belzer and the character Munch he portrays are cynical, caustic former hippies who are so similar that Belzer declared the character [...] "exactly as I would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a cop". Stanley Bolander was inspired by Detective Donald Worden who, like his on-screen counterpart, was nicknamed [...] "The Big Man". Ned Beatty only met Worden once before taking on the role, {{and he said the}} detective had [...] "an uncluttered mind and a near-photographic memory". Beau Felton {{was based on}} Detective Donald Kincaid, and Felton's clashes with Pembleton were based on Kincaid's real-life strong dislike for Harry Edgerton. Kay Howard was based in part on the female Detective Bert Silver, and in part on the male Detective Rich Garvey, who experienced a real-life string of good luck in solving consecutive cases, just as Howard did in the first season.|$|E
2500|$|Palin {{has stated}} that she {{supports}} a Federal Constitutional Amendment to ban same-sex marriage. This position differed with that of her running mate, John McCain. In a July 31, 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren, Palin was asked about states' rights as they pertained to same-sex marriage, to which Palin responded, [...] "I believe that states have that constitutional right {{to make decisions about}} a variety of issues, {{but when it comes to}} some very fundamental, very cornerstone aspects of our society, of our culture, I personally would love to see a national dialogue about what will America continue to define as marriage. As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's where I would <b>be,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do. It truly is a cornerstone of religion and civilization." ...|$|E

5000|$|Asked by Samuel French, Inc. if {{he could}} name the playwright who had most {{influenced}} him, Heinze said, [...] "If I were darker, it would <b>be</b> Orton. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> more laconic, it would <b>be</b> Pinter. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> more lyrically erudite, it would <b>be</b> Stoppard. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> had ten additional brains, it would be Shakespeare. Hm. Everyone seems to <b>be</b> English. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> more Irish, it would <b>be</b> Beckett. (And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had more savoir faire, it would be Molière.)" [...] He added, [...] "I think all my sources of inspiration are unconventional. It's the feeling of something unconventional that {{makes me want to}} write the play. At least for a full-length play that’s true. I think I wouldn't want to invest the time <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn’t have that feeling." ...|$|R
