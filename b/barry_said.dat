25|$|In {{response}} to the 1972 blaxploitation film Super Fly, Barry quickly formed a protest group named Blacks Against Narcotics and Genocide (BANG). <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> the film was harmful to black youth, and that it glorified drug abuse. BANG called for a boycott of the film.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 Barry {{was elected}} {{as the first}} {{chairman}} of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). He helped develop an organizing project in McComb, Mississippi. The project was both a voter registration and a direct action endeavor. <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> he and other activists lived with the local people {{in order to stay}} safe, as well as to learn {{what it was like to}} live there. They could use that information to organize the members of the SNCC accordingly.|$|E
25|$|On October 31, 2004, Barry {{announced}} that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence of at least a year from his weekly column in order {{to spend more time with}} his family. In December 2005, <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> in an interview with Editor and Publisher that he would not resume his weekly column, although he would continue such features as his yearly gift guide, his year-in-review feature, and his blog, as well as an occasional article or column.|$|E

25|$|Barry then {{attempted}} to anticipate {{some of the}} counter-arguments that might be made. To the argument that someone denying the jurisdiction of a court must also indicate some jurisdiction that is competent, <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> that the customary legal system of the Aboriginal people themselves was the correct jurisdiction. Barry indicated {{he was prepared to}} call witnesses to testify on the methods within the Aboriginal legal system of dealing with such matters, and also argued that although there were certainly differences between the Aboriginal and English legal systems, that did not mean that the former was not a valid jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Chavous {{formally}} {{announced his}} campaign for mayor on February 10, 1998, and raised $117,000 {{in the first month}} of his campaign. Chavous trailed the other leading candidate in the race, Jack Evans, who raised more than $307,000 since early December 1997, as well as restaurateur Jeffrey Gildenhorn, who doanted $400,000 of his own money to his own campaign. More {{than a third of the}} campaign contributions to the Chavous campaign came from individuals living outside the District of Columbia. Chavous said in April 1998 that, if elected, he would focus heavily on education reform. He rejected school vouchers, but promised to fire principals and teachers who did not meet performance standards and create a boarding school for troubled youth. He also said he would disband the police oversight group established by the Financial Control Board, and work to revive commercial areas throughout the city. He later said he would cut a number of taxes levied by the city, including the corporate income tax, and seek passage of a federal law that would replace the current progressive federal income tax on city residents with a flat federal income tax of 15 percent. He also proposed universal early childhood education, and significantly improved city services for Latino residents. By mid-May, a Post poll showed 29 percent of voters favoring a sixth Barry term. Harold Brazil had 16 percent, Kevin Chavous had 15 percent, and Jack Evans had 10 percent. On May 21, <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> he would not seek reelection. The announcement was a boost for Chavous, as polling showed that Barry's supporters were most likely to support him over other mayoral candidates.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack to GoldenEye was {{composed}} and performed by Éric Serra. Prolific Bond composer John <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> that despite an offer by Barbara Broccoli, {{he turned it}} down. Serra's score has been criticised: Richard von Busack, in Metro, wrote that it was [...] "more appropriate for a ride on an elevator than a ride on a roller coaster", and Filmtracks said Serra [...] "failed completely {{in his attempt to}} tie Goldeneye to the franchise's past." [...] The end credits song, Serra's [...] "The Experience of Love", was based on a short cue Serra had originally written for Luc Besson's Léon one year earlier.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Barry</b> Foster <b>said</b> that Heath was the {{inspiration}} for his portrayal of Walter Rusk in Alfred Hitchcock's 1972 film Frenzy; Hitchcock gave him two books written on Heath to read as background for the character.|$|R
2500|$|In 1971, Barry {{announced}} his candidacy for at-large {{member of the}} school board, running against the incumbent, Anita L. Allen. <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to steer the school board back to the [...] "issues of education" [...] and away from problems of personalities. Barry defeated Allen, with 58 {{percent of the vote}} to Allen's 34 percent.|$|E
2500|$|At a party celebrating {{his primary}} victory for his D.C. council seat on April 3, 2012, <b>Barry</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We've {{got to do}} {{something}} about these Asians coming in, opening up businesses, those dirty shops. They ought to go, I'll just say that right now, you know. But we need African-American businesspeople to be able to take their places, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, Barry {{voted against}} a bill {{committing}} Washington, D.C. to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. During his 2008 reelection campaign, Barry had told {{members of the}} Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, the city's largest LGBT political group, [...] "I don’t think you should make [...] a litmus test. But if a bill like that were to come up, I would vote for it." [...] Following his May 2009 vote against recognizing gay marriages, Barry was criticized for what activists believed to be an apparent flip-flop. Councilman Phil Mendelson said he {{was surprised by the}} vote because Barry had signed on as a co-introducer of the marriage bill. <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> his position had not changed and warned that the council needed to move slowly on this issue. Citing his belief that the local African American community is overwhelmingly opposed to gay marriage, [...] "All hell is going to break loose", <b>Barry</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "We may have a civil war. The black community is just adamant against this." ...|$|E

2500|$|An August 2015 {{episode of}} Media Watch argued that [...] "both {{sides of the}} debate have an equal right to be heard". In {{relation}} to attempts to suppress the second TV advertisement mentioned above, host Paul <b>Barry</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Whatever happened to freedom of speech? [...] And was the ad really so offensive?... All pretty mild, surely?... The ad in fact makes hardly any claims at all and in my opinion to say it’s inviting hate is ridiculous".|$|E
2500|$|On February 9, 2009, {{prosecutors}} filed {{a motion}} in federal court to revoke Barry's probation for not filing his 2007 tax return, which violated his probation. According to one prosecutor, Barry has not filed his taxes eight of the last nine years. <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> the reason he did not file his taxes is because of distractions from his medical problems, although he noted that there is [...] "no excuse" [...] for not filing. In an interview, <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> he has been undergoing four-hour dialyses {{three times a week}} as treatment for a problem with his kidney. At that point, a kidney donor had been identified, but the operation had yet to be scheduled. On February 17, WTOP-FM reported that, according to Barry's attorney, Barry had filed his federal and District tax returns for 2007. The same day, Barry was admitted to Howard University Hospital to prepare for a kidney transplant the next day. Barry was released from the hospital on February 27, but he was readmitted on March 2 due to large amounts of air in his abdominal cavity and also due to Barry's complaints of serious pains, both of which were caused by the combination of medications Barry was taking after the operation. Barry was released from the hospital on March 6. On April 17, 2009, the prosecution withdrew their request to revoke Barry's probation.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his funeral}} service, {{his body was}} cremated. His {{brothers}} Barry and Robin ceased performing as a group for a time, but later decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner before twin brother Robin died of liver and kidney failure after a long battle with colorectal cancer on 20 May 2012. Barry and Robin Gibb told the BBC about Maurice's death, [...] "The {{fact that they had}} to operate on Maurice during the shock of cardiac arrest is questionable." [...] <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> [...] "None of the sequence of events have yet made sense to us." [...] Robin Gibb spoke to Mojo magazine about Maurice's death in 2003: [...] "We were kids together, and teenagers. We spent the whole of our lives with each other because of our music. I can't accept that he's dead. I just imagine he's alive somewhere else." ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{longevity}} and consistency, combined with his distinctive racing style and easily recognisable grey coat {{made him a}} popular favourite. On his retirement <b>Barry</b> Hills <b>said,</b> [...] "You could live a lifetime and never have a horse like him again".|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, {{cast member}} Shaun Williamson, {{who was in}} the final months of his role of <b>Barry</b> Evans, <b>said</b> that the {{programme}} had become much grittier over the past ten to fifteen years, and found it [...] "frightening" [...] that parents let their young children watch.|$|R

2500|$|Lucas {{described}} a [...] "used future" [...] concept {{to the production}} designers in which all devices, ships, and buildings looked aged and dirty. Instead of following the traditional sleekness and futuristic architecture of science fiction films that came before, the Star Wars sets were designed to look inhabited and used. <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> that the director [...] "wants {{to make it look}} like it's shot on location on your average everyday Death Star or Mos Eisley Spaceport or local cantina." [...] Lucas believed that [...] "what is required for true credibility is a used future", opposing the interpretation of [...] "future in most futurist movies" [...] that [...] "always looks new and clean and shiny." [...] Christian supported Lucas's vision, saying [...] "All science fiction before was very plastic and stupid uniforms and Flash Gordon stuff. Nothing was new. George was going right against that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Lofty was written with Mead in mind. Producers created the role after Daniel Anthony's decision to quit {{his role as}} nurse, Jamie Collier. They realised the show would be lacking a young, male nurse and decided to cast Mead. Mead explained {{that they were looking}} for a nurse who [...] "had a big heart and cares for his patients with a unique insight". Show writer Matthew <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> that having Mead in mind helped the writing team write for Lofty. The show's executive producer Oliver Kent asked Mead's agent if Mead would read for the role and when his agent told him the news, Mead believed he was [...] "joking". At the audition, Mead read for the show's producer and casting directors. He believed that he had delivered what they wanted, but was not sure he was [...] "in the frame" [...] for the character. He was originally signed to the serial for a year and expressed a possibility in renewing his contract.|$|E
2500|$|In the evening, {{at around}} 6 or 7pm, Dan and Joe kidnapped and handcuffed Anton Weekes, a German-Australian market {{gardener}} who lived nearby, reassuring {{him that he}} would not be hurt if he obeyed. They pushed him to the Sherritts' back door and Joe asked Weekes to knock, which he did. Sherritts' young wife asked: [...] "Who is there?", repeated by Sherritt. Prompted by Joe, Weekes replied: [...] "It is me, I have lost my way", to which Sherritt's wife opened the door. Aaron stood framed in the doorway and joked with his German neighbor. [...] "You must be drunk, Anton. You know that it's over that way", he laughed. As Sherritt raised his arm to point the way for Weekes, he almost immediately afterwards made a movement backwards and said, [...] "Who's that?". Two shots were then fired into the house and Sherritt staggered back, having been hit in the left side of the neck, severing his jugular. One of the shots narrowly missed Sherritt's wife. Byrne followed him in and fired again, hitting him in the chest, and Sherritt collapsed. Sherritt died within a few minutes without another saying a word. His mother-in-law, Ellen Barry, testified to the commission that at this point she knelt down by her son-in-law's head, and Byrne called her by her name (they were well acquainted, Ellen Barry had been a particular friend of Byrne's mother) and threatened to shoot her and her daughter if they did not reveal who was in the bedroom. She asked to go outside and when she did, Byrne took off Weekes' handcuffs, telling her [...] "I am satisfied now, I wanted that fellow." [...] Ellen <b>Barry</b> <b>said</b> that she responded [...] "Well, Joe, I never heard Aaron say anything against you." [...] And he replied [...] "He would do me harm if he could; he did his best." ...|$|E
