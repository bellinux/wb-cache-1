40|$|Shell {{concentrations}} {{are useful}} indicators of relative sea-level changes, systems tracts, and depositional sequence and boundary surfaces. Shellbeds can equally act as archives of paleoenvironmental information and {{aid in the}} reconstruction of past environmental and ecological conditions. These considerations are applied in this study to occurrences of giant oyster reefs and shellbeds in Tertiary sequences in North Island, New Zealand, and in Patagonia, southern Argentina. Large recliner morphotype Flemingostreini Stenzel oysters are common in the Oligocene Orahiri Limestone {{in the vicinity of}} Waitomo, New Zealand. The oysters occur in tabular beds typically 0. 5 - 2 m, but up to 9 m thick within highly indurated biomicritic limestone. Individual valves reach 15 cm in length, 10 cm in width and 2. 5 to 5 cm in thickness. The occurences at Waitomo are characteristic of multi-event shellbeds and can be interpreted as onlap (transgressive lag) and <b>backlap</b> shellbeds within a transgressive systems tract. Shell delta 18 O (- 2. 1 to 1. 4 per mille) and delta 13 C (0. 4 and 2. 5 per mille) values, and minimal seasonal isotopic ranges with little variability, confirm that these oysters lived in a fully marine environment. The environment of Oligocene Flemingstreini Stenzel was probably similar to modern Ostrea chilensis from Foveaux Strait off southern New Zealand, living on coarse shelly and gravelly tide swept substrates in 18 - 40 m water depth, under normal marine salinity conditions and temperatures around 13 oC, forming in situ biostromes of haphazardly packed oyster shells. Specimens of Ostrea patagonica in the Late Miocene Puerto Madryn Formation, Pen nsula Vald s, Patagonia, are held in a weakly calcareous fine sand host. They reach 20 cm in length, 5 cm thick and weigh as much as 3 kg. The reef has a lens (or bioherm) geometry and is composed of articulated, well preserved oysters set in a fine sand matrix. The reef is interpreted as a downlap shellbed within a highstand systems tract. Oyster shell delta 18 O (- 4. 4 to - 3. 2 per mille) and delta 13 C (- 2. 0 to - 3. 2 per mille) values are low and show large seasonal isotopic ranges, with a large amount of variability, collectively supporting a marginal marine setting receiving extensive freshwater input and mixing. The environment of these oysters is comparable with modern Crassostrea gigas reefs at San Blas, Patagonia. Ostrea patagonica occupied a low energy intertidal zone in water depths of only 1 - 2 m. Temperatures ranged from 20 degreesC (summer maximum) to 8 degreesC (winter minimum). The oysters were not cemented firmly to the substrate, but reclined on the muddy sediment and formed an in situ bioherm of loosely packed oysters, with the living animals concentrated over time to the outside of the accumulation. The Pliocene Wilkies Shellbed in the Wanganui Basin, New Zealand, comprises oyster accumulations up to 15 m thick involving the extinct oyster Crassostrea ingens. Individuals are up to 30 cm long, 7 cm thick and weigh as much as 2 kg. The shellbed consists of a lower onlap shellbed (transgressive lag) and an overlying <b>backlap</b> shellbed (biostrome). The widespread shell delta 18 O (- 3. 0 to 3. 0 per mille) and delta 13 C (- 2. 6 to 1. 8 per mille) isotopic values support a range of marginal marine to marine environmental conditions. The lower onlap shellbed had estuarine influence, while the upper part had affinities with a nearshore (less than 40 m) marine setting of more normal salinity. As the thick <b>backlap</b> shellbed migrated shoreward a depth was maintained in which Crassostrea could live in situ within a weakly calcareous very fine muddy sand in favourable conditions of low turbidity and sedimentation. All species of fossil oysters in this study are easily distinguished by the large size and thickness of their valves. The 'reefs' formed by these oysters provided hard substrata for a diverse community of encrusting and boring organisms which includes the likes of Gastrochaenolites (bivalve), Maeandropolydora (polychaete), Clionolithes (boring algae), Entobia (sponge), Leptichnus (bryozoan) and Radulichnus (gastropod). These communities are comparable to those seen on extant oyster reefs. They can thus be termed autogenic ecosystem engineers. Non-random distribution of euendoliths and epiliths on oyster valves may be accounted for by different survival adaptations of larvae. Shell morphotypes and exterior architectures are inferred to have prompted active rugophilic (groove-seeking), geophobic (anti-gravity) and rheophilic (current-seeking) behaviour of larvae, which enhanced their survival rate. Preference for the external surface of shells suggests that traces were created during the life time of the oysters, while most internal traces are post-mortem features...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{siltstone}} successions, 1 – 20 m thick, {{form the}} upper part of sequences in the mid-Pleistocene Castlecliff section (≈ 0 · 98 – 0 · 35 Ma). The siltstones were deposited within a broad shelf embayment at and about glacioeustatic highstands and are interpreted as highstand systems tracts (HST). Shell-rich to relatively shell-poor contacts at the base of Castlecliff HST are interpreted as downlap surfaces, which mark the quenching of transgressive in situ biogenic accumulation (<b>backlap</b> shellbed). Nonetheless, the basal parts of Castlecliff HST successions are enriched in fossil content {{in the context of the}} highstand successions as a whole and represent downlap shellbeds. Castlecliff HST are truncated above by sequence-bounding ravinement surfaces, such that complete sandier-upward successions and subaerial exposure surfaces associated with sequence boundaries sensu stricto are never preserved. Modern highstand sedimentation in the Taranaki Bight offshore from Castlecliff is characterized by a mid-shelf mud depocentre and a coastal shore-connected sand prism, both of which are encroaching upon intervening shell-rich relict and palimpsest transgressive deposits. The mud depocentre is up to 9 m thick, and deposition is influenced by a gyre caused by bathymetric steering of storm-driven currents along the embayed coastline. Modern highstand deposition in the Taranaki Bight, in which the mud depocentre is in part detached from the contemporary shore-connected sand prism, is regarded as an analogue for the deposition of the preserved lower parts of Castlecliff HST. The inferred architecture of Castlecliff HST therefore need not refer to the shore-connected, progradational geometry predicted by traditional sequence models. The model proposed herein may have application to other shelf palaeo-embayments in which mid-shelf focusing of fine-grained sediment has resulted from coastal steering of currents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic stratigraphic {{description of the}} architecture of the early Pliocene Titiokura Formation (emended) in the Te Waka and Maungaharuru Ranges of western Hawke's Bay, and {{presents a}} facies, sequence stratigraphic, and paleoenvironmental analysis of the sedimentary succession. The Titiokura Formation is of early Pliocene (Opoitian-Waipipian) age, and unconformably overlies Mokonui Formation, which is a regressive late Miocene and early Pliocene (Kapitean to early Opoitian) succession. In the Te Waka Range and the southern parts of the Maungaharuru Range, the Titiokura Formation comprises a single limestone sheet 20 - 50 m thick, with calcareous sandstone parts. In the vicinity of Taraponui Trig, and to the northeast, the results of 1 : 50 000 mapping show that the limestone gradually partitions into five members, which thicken markedly to the northeast to total thicknesses of c. 730 m, and concomitantly become dominated by siliciclastic sandstone. The members (all new) from lower to upper are: Naumai Member, Te Rangi Member, Taraponui Member, Bellbird Bush Member, and Opouahi Member. The lower four members are inferred to each comprise an obliquity-controlled 41 000 yr 6 th order sequence, and the Opouahi Member at least two such sequences. The sequences typically have the following architectural elements from bottom to top: disconformable sequence boundary that formed as a transgressive surface of erosion; thin transgressive systems tracts (TSTs) with onlap and <b>backlap</b> shellbeds, or alternatively, a single compound shellbed; downlap surface; and very thick (70 - 200 m) highstand (HST) and regressive systems tracts (RST) composed of fine sandstone. The sequences in the Opouahi Member have cryptic TSTs, sandy siltstone to silty sandstone HSTs, and cross-bedded, differentially cemented, fine sandstone RSTs; a separate variant is an 11 m thick bioclastic limestone (grainstone and packstone) {{at the top of the}} member that crops out in the vicinity of Lake Opouahi. Lithostratigraphic correlations along the crest of the ranges suggest that the Titiokura Formation, and its correlatives to the south around Puketitiri, represent a shoreline-to-shelf linked depositional system. Carbonate production was focused around a rocky seascape as the system onlapped basement in the south, with dispersal and deposition of the comminuted carbonate on an inner shelf to the north, which was devoid of siliciclastic sediment input. The rates of both subsidence and siliciclastic sediment flux increased rapidly to the northeast of the carbonate "platform", with active progradation and offlap of the depositional system into more axial parts of Hawke's Bay Basin...|$|E
40|$|A {{new process}} has been {{developed}} that allows the production of dielectrically isolated power ICs by means of rather standard VLSI and BiCMOS technology on SIMOX substrates. Compared with processes like SDB, EPIC, soot bonding or MSSD this process is of less complexity as procedures like selective epitaxy or mechanical <b>backlapping</b> are not necessary. Furthermore, dielectric isolation permits higher inegration density, no latch up. less leakage current, high temperature operation, large noise immunity, easy circuit design and the integration of vertical DMOS transistors in contrast to conventional junction isolation. Compared with reproted junction isolation processes this technology even needs two masks less for the same variety of devices. Without process options only 11 masks are used...|$|R
40|$|Sediments of the mid-Pliocene (c. 3. 4 – 3. 0 Ma) Tangahoe Formation {{exposed in}} cliffs along the South Taranaki {{coastline}} of New Zealand comprise a 270 m thick, cyclothemic shallow-marine succession {{that has been}} gently warped into a north to south trending, low angle anticline. This study examines the sedimentologic, faunal, and petrographic characteristics of 10 Milankovitch-scale (6 th order), shallow-marine depositional sequences exposed on the western limb of the anticline. The sequences are recognised {{on the basis of}} the cyclic vertical stacking of their constituent lithofacies, which are bound by sharp wave cut surfaces produced during transgressive shoreface erosion. Each sequence comprises three parts: (1) a 0. 2 – 2 m thick, deepening upwards, basal suite of reworked bioclastic lag deposits (onlap shellbed) and/or an overlying matrix supported, molluscan shellbed of offshore shelf affinity (<b>backlap</b> shellbed); (2) a 5 – 20 m thick, gradually shoaling, aggradational siltstone succession; and (3) a 5 – 10 m thick, strongly progradational, well sorted “forced regressive” shoreline sandstone. The three-fold subdivision corresponds to transgressive, highstand, and regressive systems tracts (TSTs, HSTs, and RSTs) respectively, and represents deposition during a glacio-eustatic sea-level cycle. Lowstand systems tract sediments are not recorded because the outcrop is situated c. 100 km east of the contemporary shelf edge and was subaerially exposed at that time. Well developed, sharp- and gradational-based forced regressive sandstones contain a variety of storm-emplaced sedimentary structures, and represent the rapid and abrupt basinward translation of the shoreline on to a storm dominated, shallow shelf during eustatic sea-level fall. Increased supply of sediment from north-west South Island during “forced regression” is indicated from petrographic analyses of the heavy mineralogy of the sandstones. A chronology based on biostratigraphy and the correlation of a new magnetostratigraphy to the magnetic polarity timescale allows: (1) identification of the Mammoth (C 2 An. 2 r) and Kaena (C 2 An. 1 r) subchrons; (2) correlation of the coastal section to the Waipipian Stage; and (3) estimation of the age of the coastal section as 3. 36 – 3. 06 Ma. Qualitative assessment of foraminiferal census data and molluscan palaeoecology reveals cyclic changes in water depth from shelf to shoreline environments during the deposition of each sequence. Seven major cycles in water depth of between 20 and 50 m have been correlated to individual 40 ka glacio-eustatic sea-level cycles on the marine oxygen isotope timescale. The coastal Tangahoe Formation provides a shallow-marine record of global glacio-eustasy prior to the development of significant ice sheets on Northern Hemisphere continents, and supports evidence from marine δ 18 O archives that changes in Antarctic ice volume were occurring during the Pliocene...|$|E
