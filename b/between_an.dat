5000|$|For example, Trobriand Islanders {{prohibit}} both {{sexual relations}} <b>between</b> <b>a</b> {{woman and her}} brother, and <b>between</b> <b>a</b> woman and her father, but they describe these prohibitions in very different ways: relations <b>between</b> <b>a</b> woman and her brother fall within the category of forbidden relations {{among members of the}} same clan; relations <b>between</b> <b>a</b> woman and her father do not. This is because the Trobrianders are matrilineal; children belong to the clan of their mother and not of their father. Thus, sexual relations <b>between</b> <b>a</b> man and his mother's sister (and mother's sister's daughter) are also considered incestuous, but relations <b>between</b> <b>a</b> man and his father's sister are not. [...] A man and his father's sister will often have a flirtatious relationship, and, far from being taboo, Trobriand society encourages a man and his father's sister or the daughter of his father's sister to have sexual relations or marry.|$|R
