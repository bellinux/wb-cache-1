5|$|She wore an {{imported}} black satin dress heavily <b>beaded</b> {{with tiny}} black jet beads, black satin slippers, <b>beaded,</b> and {{had on her}} rarely beautiful diamonds.... She stood before us, seemingly slight, graceful of carriage, and exquisitely beautiful even to critical eyes. Then, still standing, she faced her class as one who knew herself {{to be a teacher}} by divine right. She turned to the student {{at the end of the}} first row of seats and took direct mental cognizance of this one, plainly knocked at the door of this individual consciousness.... This continued until each member of the class had received the same mental cognizance. No audible word voiced the purely mental contact.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. R.F. Herrick bought Kinman's {{traveling}} museum {{collection of}} 186 items, {{including at least}} two of his famous chairs, and displayed them in San Francisco in 1893. She then took the collection to Chicago to display them at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, where she reportedly sold the individual items. The Clarke Historical Museum in Eureka displays a suit of his buckskins, complete with <b>beaded</b> moccasins, as well as a wooden chest he owned. The Ferndale Museum displays several Kinman items, including another of his buckskin suits.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{metalwork}} includes {{personal items}} like the gold lunula or neckplates found at Auchentaggart in Dumfriesshire and Southside, Lanarkshire, which date from about 2000 BCE and {{are similar to}} those found in relatively large numbers in Ireland, but also with examples across Great Britain and in Portugal. Jet <b>beaded</b> necklaces strung in a crescent shape have been found at sites including Poltalloch and Melfort in Argyll and Aberlemno in Angus.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} room, {{like the}} exterior, is oriented east-west. The most prominent decorative element inside is the hand graining detail {{on the wood}} surfaces. An elevated gallery lines the north wall facing the pews which are bisected by 3½ ft (1.1 m) tall, 5 in (13cm) wide <b>beaded</b> board partition. The pews, partition, door, and window trim are all hand grained. The interior walls are covered with 6 in (15cm) pine wainscotting. The original iron stoves have been replaced with oil-burning stoves, set into the original flues.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{entrance to}} the cell in the center along the east wall, the door was replaced with a modern door {{at the time of}} nomination. Inside, a winding staircase leads to the attic. To the north is the kitchen, retaining a hewn summer beam and flared cased posts while sporting modern cabinets and wallpaper. The room to the south also has a visible hewn summer beam and its original casing on the flared posts. The attic is finished with vertically placed <b>beaded</b> boarding, and the roof is framed with hewn rafters.|$|E
5|$|The rim of {{the central}} plain is vegetated by a dense shrubland of Rhagodia baccata (berry saltbush), Atriplex paludosa and Threlkeldia diffusa (coast bonefruit). Nearer the centre, the {{vegetation}} consists of Frankenia pauciflora (seaheath), Muellerolimon salicorniaceum and Tecticornia arbuscula (bulli bulli), although T.arbuscula is replaced by Tecticornia halocnemoides (shrubby samphire) where the soil is shallow. The most low-lying area of the central plain, south of the salt lake, is water-logged in winter; it is vegetated by a dense mat of Sarcocornia quinqueflora (<b>beaded</b> samphire), Sporobolus virginicus (marine couch) and Suaeda australis (seablite).|$|E
5|$|The Gila monster has one close living relative, the <b>beaded</b> lizard (H. horridum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, the evolutionary history of which may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (10,000–8,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the Gila monster appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the Gila monster is better placed in a separate family.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{moved to}} Thika, where he gained {{employment}} with the engineering firm run by Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages {{from a bank}} in Nairobi, 25 miles away. Kenyatta had to leave his job when he again became seriously ill. He stayed {{at the home of}} his friend Charles Kasaja, located at the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission, in order to recuperate. At the time, the British Empire was involved in World War I, and it had recruited many Kikuyu to serve in the British Army. One of those who joined was Kongo, but he disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like many Kikuyu he moved to live among the Maasai, who had refused to fight for the British war effort. Kenyatta had an aunt who had married a Maasai chief and began living with her family. He adopted a number of Maasai customs, and took to wearing the Maasai jewellery, including a <b>beaded</b> belt which was known as kinyata in the Kikuyu language.|$|E
25|$|Formation of {{membrane}} protrusions: Some cell types, under specific conditions, {{may develop}} {{different types of}} long, thin extensions of the cell membrane called membrane protrusions. Three types have been described: microtubule spikes, apoptopodia (feet of death), and <b>beaded</b> apoptopodia (the latter having a beads-on-a-string appearance). Pannexin 1 {{is an important component}} of membrane channels involved in the formation of apoptopodia and <b>beaded</b> apoptopodia.|$|E
25|$|Influenced by the Plains Indians, Western Apaches wore animal hide {{decorated}} with seed beads for clothing. These <b>beaded</b> designs historically resembled {{that of the}} Great Basin Paiute and is characterized by linear patterning. Apache <b>beaded</b> clothing was bordered with narrow bands of glass seed beads in diagonal stripes of alternating colors. They made buckskin shirts, ponchos, skirts and moccasins and decorated them with colorful beadwork.|$|E
25|$|The {{north side}} of the ell is a blank brick wall with a single lower level {{entrance}} that has a brick stairwell and original <b>beaded</b> door. The {{north side of}} the main house has two 6/6 sash windows.|$|E
25|$|The shawls of Shimla {{are very}} well known for their fine quality. The leather craft of Shimla {{comprises}} shoes, slippers and belts. The other arts and crafts of Shimla includes a huge collection of <b>beaded</b> and metal jewellery.|$|E
25|$|As the {{expedition}} approached {{the mouth of}} the Columbia River on the Pacific Coast, Sacagawea gave up her <b>beaded</b> belt to enable the captains to trade for a fur robe they wished to give to President Thomas Jefferson.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the fashion}} items worn by {{characters}} on the show have seen a strong revival {{of interest in the}} UK and elsewhere during the show's run, including starched collars, midi skirts, <b>beaded</b> gowns, and hunting plaids.|$|E
25|$|He began wearing {{colorful}} <b>beaded</b> shirts in concert, originally out {{of necessity}} so everyone in the audience could see him {{without the aid of}} binoculars. Bill Whitten designed and made the shirts for Diamond from the 1970s till approximately 2007.|$|E
25|$|At most residences {{the lady}} of the house put a china jug, with a <b>beaded</b> cloth mesh cover, on the front steps to receive the milk. You were in big trouble if you spilt any milk on to the {{hardwood}} tread or flooring. A milk stain is difficult to remove.|$|E
25|$|Cessna {{thought that}} a less {{expensive}} four-seater aircraft than the existing Cessna 172 would have good market potential. The company designed a simplified four-seat high-wing aircraft using non-tapering wings, extensive use of heavily <b>beaded</b> wing and fuselage skins as well as free-castering nose gear to save weight and decrease the man-hours required for construction.|$|E
25|$|All {{floors are}} hardwood. The bimah and ark have paneled exteriors and <b>beaded</b> interiors. Stairs have square posts and turned balusters. Pews are simple, {{supported}} by gently curved solid end panels. Light {{is provided by}} a centrally located iron chandelier, supplemented by four hanging lanterns, wall sconces and decorative fixtures on the bimah and ark platform.|$|E
25|$|Inside most of {{the area}} was built for {{passenger}} operations. It has a waiting room with a fireplace and chimney, ticket office, two bathrooms and a cross hallway. The walls of the passenger area are decorated in <b>beaded</b> panelling and horizontal trim. Some of the railway's communications equipment remains in the attic, and freight scales remain in that area.|$|E
25|$|Modern craftswomen weave and {{embroider}} traditional garments that command {{very high}} prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots {{were made from}} the skin of dogs or salmon. Ainu culture considers earrings, traditionally made from grapevines, to be gender neutral. Women also wear a <b>beaded</b> necklace called a tamasay.|$|E
25|$|The {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blotting are {{two different}} ways that the purified antigen (or multiple antigens) can be obtained and analyzed. This method involves purifying an antigen through the aid of an attached antibody on a solid (<b>beaded)</b> support, such as agarose resin. The immobilized protein complex can be accomplished either in a single step or successively.|$|E
25|$|An open women's gallery, {{reached by}} two small stairs from the vestibule, extends over {{the rear of}} the sanctuary. It is {{serpentine}} in shape and supported by two round wooden columns. The gallery's outside wall is faced in rectangular panels with small square blocks in each corner; the inside wall is <b>beaded.</b> A raised platform at the rear is built over the vestibule.|$|E
25|$|Turkish costumes {{are usually}} in the bedlah style. Distinctive {{features}} of many Turkish costumes include a V-shaped or triangular belt which may be shaped or contoured around the top edge, {{and a great deal}} of embellishment and <b>beaded</b> fringing on both the bra and the belt. Skirts are often fuller than their Egyptian counterparts, and are likely to be made of chiffon or velvet rather than lycra.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the normal drab coloration of most reptiles, the lizards of the genus Heloderma (the Gila monster and the <b>beaded</b> lizard) {{and many of the}} coral snakes have high-contrast warning coloration, warning potential predators they are venomous. A number of non-venomous North American snake species have colorful markings {{similar to those of the}} coral snake, an oft cited example of Batesian mimicry.|$|E
25|$|Dancer in a café depicts strikingly fashionable {{women and}} men {{at the height of}} Parisian fashion in 1912. The dancer dressed in a directoire-style <b>beaded</b> and {{embroidered}} green silk velvet and chiffon caped evening gown embellished with celluloid sequins and gold trim, her hair coiffed in an elegant chignon, appears on a low stage or table performing for patrons or guests, all fashionably dressed and coiffed in silk and <b>beaded</b> net gowns, silver brocade and lace full-length gowns, ostrich-plumed hats, patterned suit, fedora and black tie. The artist depicts the figures and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the café scene simultaneously. This {{can be seen in the}} deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of chiaroscuro, of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as overdrawing.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{itself is}} painted off-white, with {{the stained glass}} windows, red carpeting, gilding and mahogany trim of the pews providing a contrast. Corinthian columns, creating lateral arcades, provide corbeled support to groin vaults. The arcading partially encloses the balcony. A simulated clerestory level is illuminated by the skylights supplemented by electric lighting in the original wall sconces. The walls themselves are plaster on lath with <b>beaded</b> wainscoting ending in a chair rail.|$|E
25|$|From 1987 {{until the}} early 1990s, the short skirt was the only length {{supported}} by fashion designers. Although skirts of any length were acceptable to wear in the years before, all attention {{was given to the}} short skirt, especially among teenage girls and young women. Shoulder pads became increasingly smaller. Accessories popular in Britain, France and America included bright-colored shoes with thin heels, narrow multicolored belts, berets, lacy gloves, <b>beaded</b> necklaces, and plastic bracelets.|$|E
25|$|Competition costumes vary widely, {{from simple}} designs to heavily <b>beaded</b> or trimmed costumes. Skaters risk a {{deduction}} if {{a piece of}} their costume falls onto the ice surface. An official may stop a program {{if he or she}} deems there to be a hazard. Skaters and family members may design their own costumes, sometimes with assistance from their coach or choreographer, or turn to professional designers. Costumes may cost thousands of dollars if designed by a top-level costumemaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} is sparely furnished. Gently curved wooden pews with scroll armrests and recessed end panels flank {{the center}} aisle, {{leading to the}} altar. Its wooden flooring is now carpeted; the plaster walls have <b>beaded</b> wainscoting. Above, the wooden trusses with chamfered lower chords and collar ties that frame the roof are exposed. At {{the end of the}} aisle is the altar on a raised dais. On it is a wooden lectern with Greek Revival detailing.|$|E
25|$|The actions moves {{ahead to}} 1989, where Selena y Los Dinos {{are playing a}} concert at a fair. Abraham is shocked when Selena peels off her jacket and {{performs}} in a <b>beaded</b> bra. He confronts Selena on the band's bus, but {{she points out that}} her mother helped her make it, and that other fashionable female musicians such as Madonna and Janet Jackson are wearing bustiers too. Abraham relents, and Selena begins to design more and more of her band's attire.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} floor, the {{staircase}} from the entry passage opens {{on a large}} lobby from a two-arched staircase arcade. The lobby extends from the front back to the courtyard and is floored with diagonally laid gray and white marble tiles. The walls, as are old walls in the building, are plastered, and the ceiling has exposed 4x10 <b>beaded</b> ausubo wood beams. Old double four-paneled doors and a transom open to the courtyard. The window in the stairhall has been filled in with glass brick.|$|E
25|$|A pow wow is an {{occasion}} for parades and Native American dancers in regalia, with many dancing styles presented. It is traditional for male dancers to wear regalia decorated with beads, quills and eagle feathers; male grass dancers wear colorful fringe regalia; and male fancy dancers wear brightly colored feathers. Female dancers dance much more subtly than the male dancers. Fancy female dancers wear cloth, <b>beaded</b> moccasins and jewelry, while the jingle dress dancer wears a dress made of metal cones. Inter-tribal dances during the pow wow, allow everyone (even spectators) can {{take part in the}} dancing.|$|E
25|$|The Akha {{people are}} often noted for their very {{recognizable}} sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread with a hand spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad leggings, a short black skirt with a white <b>beaded</b> sporran, a loose fitting black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women {{are known for their}} embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.|$|E
25|$|Gloves (sometimes laced or fingerless) were {{popularized by}} Madonna, {{as well as}} fishnet {{stockings}} and layers of <b>beaded</b> necklaces. Short, tight Lycra or leather miniskirts and tubular dresses were also worn, as were cropped bolero-style jackets. Black was the preferred color. Prior to the mid-1980s, it had been taboo to show a slip or a bra strap in public. A visible undergarment had been a sign of social ineptness. With the new fashion's most extreme forms, young women would forgo conventional outer-garments for vintage-style bustiers with lacy slips and several large crucifixes. This was both an assertion of sexual freedom and a conscious rejection of prevailing androgynous fashions.|$|E
25|$|Modern Gourd Dance regalia {{consists}} of a red and blue blanket draped over the shoulders. (This accessory represents night and day). Some dancers change the blanket to rest over the heart red {{during the day and}} blue after dark. A skunk berry (Ka-hole) and silver <b>beaded</b> bandolier fastened on the left shoulder is draped across the heart. The red skunk berry bandolier was added as a memorial tribute to a battle fought with Cheyenne warriors. The aftermath left the land covered with red blood and is represented by the red skunk berries. A handkerchief bundle of Indian perfume, gathered from the foothills, is tied {{to the back of the}} bandolier.|$|E
25|$|The house {{sits on a}} one-acre (4,000 m²) {{block of}} New Bedford, between County, Madison, Joli Gonsalves and Seventh streets, {{in the middle of}} the County Street Historic District, where its wealthy {{citizens}} built their mansions in the 19th century. It is a three-by-five-bay two-story yellow building with a front porch and balustraded balcony on either end and several tall chimneys emerging from the roof. Inside, many of the original mahogany doors and their walnut veneers remain. The cornerblocks and baseboards have elliptical echinus profiles of the kind commonly found in many Greek Revival interiors. The window muntins have a <b>beaded</b> knife blade profile and the plaster ceiling cornices and medallions also have finely carved ornamentation.|$|E
