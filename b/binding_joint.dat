40|$|The term Joint Venture (IV) is {{one which}} is heard with {{increasing}} frequency and popularity in construction industry. Nowadays, it is widely practiced for largescaled multi-disciplinary infrastructure projects {{as a means to}} share risks and resources by partners. To ran a joint venture effectively and without conflict has proven impossible. It is of great importance that the parties’ objectives and contributions to the venture are properly and clearly described in the joint venture documents. In {{view of the fact that}} the implementation of the Standard or Model Form of Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) is new to the Malaysian construction industry, the purpose of this research is to investigate the needs of forming a legally <b>binding</b> <b>joint</b> venture agreement, to examine the problems encountered and to attempt to develop a model form which will, at the very least, provide introductory reports as to what joint venture agreements are all about and how these can satisfactorily safeguard the interests of the joint venture parties. The methodology of this research adopts from literature review on JVA as well as analysis of the cases law findings on what needs to be incorporated in the model JVA. As a conclusion with this research, the lack of specific legislature, regulations and governing/regulatory body/authority overseeing the formation of JVs has left organizations to resort to their own devices in formulating JVs. This has given rise to, among others, bespoke agreements which have resulted in abuse and unfairness to numerous parties to JVs. Malaysia should seriously consider setting up a formal structure of governance over this form of business relationship. There should also be a standard JV Model Agreement to be used as reference and serve as guidelines during negotiations by the prospective parties to JV...|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{the way in which}} European sectoral social {{dialogue}} has developed over the past 20 years. It tries to determine whether the establishment of Sectoral Social Dialogue Committees in 1998 (SSDCs; currently 40) has affected the nature and/or quantity of texts adopted by these bodies. To this end, two periods are considered: 1990 – 1997 and 1998 – 2009. A first finding is that European sectoral social dialogue has burgeoned since the mid- 1990 s. The establishment of SSDCs therefore forms part of this expansion. Our main finding is that, whereas previously sectoral social dialogue was primarily geared towards ‘joint lobbying ’ documents addressed to the European institutions, it now appears to be generating more documents that reflect ‘reciprocal commitments’. Yet this trend is really only perceptible from 2003 onwards, five years after the first SSDCs were established. The increased number of <b>binding</b> <b>joint</b> texts adopted {{can be explained by the}} Commission having undertaken more consultation (under Treaty Article 154) which opened a window of opportunity for the social partners to sign ‘agreements’. Résumé Cet article se penche sur l’évolution du dialogue social sectoriel européen depuis vingt ans. Il tente de voir si la création, en 1998, de Comités de dialogue social sectoriel (CDSS, il en existe actuellement 40) a eu un effet sur la nature et/ou sur la quantite ́ de textes adoptés au sein de ces CDSS. A cette fin, deux périodes sont examinées: 1990 – 1997 et 1998 - 2009. Un premier con-stat est que le dialogue social sectoriel européen est en phase d’expansion depuis le milieu des années 1990. La création des CDSS s’inscrit donc dans le cadre de cette phase d’expansion. Mais le constat principal est que, alors que le dialogue social sectoriel était auparavant principalement oriente ́ vers l’adoption de textes de « lobbying conjoint » adressés aux institutions européennes, il semble désormais commencer a ̀ produire plus de textes reflétant des « engagements récipro...|$|E

There are two divisions of joints, diarthroses which allow extensive mobility between two or more articular heads, and false joints or synarthroses, joints that are immovable, that allow little or no movement and are predominantly fibrous. Synovial joints, joints that are not directly joined, are lubricated by a solution called synovial fluid that is produced by the synovial membranes. This fluid lowers the friction between the articular surfaces and is kept within an articular capsule, <b>binding</b> the <b>joint</b> with its taut tissue.|$|R

New methods have recently been developed that allow the parallel analysis of T cell reactivity against vast numbers of diVerent epitopes in limited biological material. These technologies are based on the <b>joint</b> <b>binding</b> of diVerentially labelled MHC multimers on the T cell surface, thereby providing each antigen-speciWc T cell population with a unique multicolour code. This strategy of ‘combinatorial encoding’ enables detection of many (at least 25) diVerent T cell populations per sample and should be of broad value for both T cell epitope identiWcation and immunomonitoring...|$|R
40|$|Penalization and sparse model {{selection}} {{have become}} topics of intense research {{interest in the}} era of big data, newly available through ubiquitous computing power, advancing data collection technologies, and internet connectivity. In genomics, chromatin immunoprecipitation, microarrays, and next generation sequencing have made available a wealth of information which continues to accumulate and which we have only begun to understand and fully utilize. We propose two penalized Bayesian tech- niques, one to select a sparse set of DNA binding factors (DBFs) from a large library with enriched binding to the genome in a set of regions of interest and to predict <b>joint</b> <b>binding</b> landscapes for the selected DBFs, and another to predict gene expression from <b>joint</b> <b>binding</b> landscapes. Cellular processes are controlled, directly or indirectly, by the binding of hundreds of different DBFs to the genome. One key to deeper understanding of the cell is discovering where, when, and how strongly these DBFs bind to the DNA sequence. Direct measurement of DBF binding sites (e. g. through ChIP-Chip or ChIP-Seq experiments) is expensive, noisy, and not available for every DBF in every cell type. Naive and most existing computational approaches to detecting which DBFs bind in a set of genomic regions of interest often perform poorly, due to the high false discovery rates and restrictive requirements for prior knowledge. We develop a penalized iterative sampling Bayesian method for identifying DBFs active in the considered regions and predicting a <b>joint</b> probabilistic <b>binding</b> land- scape. Utilizing a sparsity penalization, SparScape is able to select a small subset of DBFs with enriched binding sites in a set of DNA sequences from a much larger candidate set. This substantially reduces the false positives in prediction of binding sites. Analysis of ChIP-Seq data in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and simu- lated data show that SparScape dramatically outperforms the naive motif scanning method and the comparable computational approaches in terms of DBF identification and binding site prediction. We also propose an extension of Bayesian treed regression to predict gene expres- sion from <b>joint</b> <b>binding</b> landscapes. Rather than sampling from the space of possible partitioning trees, we follow a broad optimization approach, forking the growing partitioning tree at each possible split if multiple possible splits yield similar results in the given objective function. After growing the tree, we select variables at each leaf node of each forked partitioning tree, then take the union of these selected variables and the splitting variables at each internal node and re-grow the partitioning tree considering only the selected variables...|$|R

Arthritic <b>joint</b> destruction was inhibited in a sequence-specific and dose-dependent manner by oligonucleotides containing the AP- 1 sequence.

30|$|Today, {{the use of}} cold-formed steel {{members as}} {{structural}} elements has gained much popularity {{in the construction of}} residential and industrial buildings. One proper strategy for improving the seismic behavior of these structures is the use of structural coverage or braces. Braces transmit horizontal forces from floor and ceiling surfaces to the foundation. The overall lateral resistance of structures, hardness and ductility of these systems is not entirely confined to braces; however, the behavior of the wall is under the influence of different members of these structures in the lateral load transfer path such as brace <b>joints,</b> <b>binding</b> sheets, studs, tracks and joints. The National Building Code of Canada (2005) contains a philosophy of basic capacity for seismic design, in which a series of fuse elements is defined in seismic-resistant systems for waste of energy caused by earthquake. Fuse elements are expected to enter the nonlinear region. Other members of the frame are also designed for the capacity of the fuse elements to remain linear and experience minimal nonlinear failure. Usually, elements that play the role of fuse in these structures are braces. In the following, we will address some numerical and laboratory studies conducted by researchers on the behavior of cold-formed steel walls.|$|R

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{excision repair}} protein complex ERCC 1 -XPF {{is required for}} incision of DNA upstream of DNA damage. Functional studies have provided insights into the binding of ERCC 1 -XPF to various DNA substrates. However, because no structure for the ERCC 1 -XPF-DNA complex has been determined, the mechanism of substrate recognition remains elusive. Here we biochemically characterize the substrate preferences of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domains of XPF and ERCC-XPF and show that the binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) /dsDNA junctions is dependent on <b>joint</b> <b>binding</b> to the DNA binding domain of ERCC 1 and XPF. We reveal that the homodimeric XPF is able to bind various ssDNA sequences but with a clear preference for guanine-containing substrates. NMR titration experiments and in vitro DNA binding assays also show that, within the heterodimeric ERCC 1 -XPF complex, XPF specifically recognizes ssDNA. On the other hand, the HhH domain of ERCC 1 preferentially binds dsDNA through the hairpin region. The two separate non-overlapping DNA binding domains in the ERCC 1 -XPF heterodimer jointly bind to an ssDNA/dsDNA substrate and, thereby, at least partially dictate the incision position during damage removal. Based on structural models, NMR titrations, DNA-binding studies, site-directed mutagenesis, charge distribution, and sequence conservation, we propose that the HhH domain of ERCC 1 binds to dsDNA upstream of the damage, and XPF binds to the non-damaged strand within a repair bubble...|$|R

Methods: From January 2014 to December 2014, 84 clinical materials of patients with AMI in Department of cardiology were collected, and 80 cases of normal projects were the control group. IMA was determinated with albumincobalt ion binding assay. The levels of H-FABP and CK-MB of 84 cases of AMI patients and 80 cases of normal subjects were determinated with immunoturbidimetric. The value of IMA, H-FABP and CK-MB of AMI patients were analyzed with subject-specific curve (ROC). Results: The levels of serum IMA, H-FABP and CK-MB of AMI group {{were significantly higher than}} those of the control group. Differences showed statistical significance (P < 0. 05). The levels of serum IMA, H-FABP and CK-MB increased as the increase of coronary lesion vessels in patients with AMI (P < 0. 05). The levels of IMA, H-FABP and CK-MB of the death group were significantly higher than those of the surviving group (P < 0. 05). ROC curve analysis showed that when IMA, H-FABP and CK-MB joint detections of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were greater than singleindex detection (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: The expression levels of IMA, H-FABP and CK-MB are closely related to the occurrence and development of disease progression in patients with AMI.

Furthermore, the hypothesis is validated out that the siRNA binding efficacy on different messenger RNAs(mRNAs) have different conditional distribution, thus the multi-task learning can be conducted by viewing tasks at an "mRNA"-level rather than at the "experiment"-level. Such distribution diversity derived from siRNAs bound to different mRNAs help indicate that the properties of target mRNA have important implications on the siRNA binding efficacy.

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright MIT Press DOI: 10. 1162 /artl. 2008. 14. 1. 121 At {{the heart of the}} {{development}} of fertilized eggs into fully formed organisms and the adaptation of cells to changed conditions are genetic regulatory networks (GRNs). In higher multi-cellular organisms, signal selection and multiplexing is performed at the cis-regulatory domains of genes, where combinations of transcription factors (TFs) regulate the rates at which the genes are transcribed into mRNA. To be able to act as activators or repressors of gene transcription, TFs must first bind to target sequences on the regulatory domains. Two TFs that act in concert may bind entirely independently of each other, but more often binding of the first one will alter the affinity of the other for its binding site. This paper presents a systematic investigation into the effect of TF binding dependencies on the predicted regulatory function of this ???bio-logic???. Four extreme scenarios, commonly used to classify enzyme activation and inhibition patterns, for the binding of two TFs were explored: independent (the TFs bind without affecting each other???s affinities), competitive (the TFs compete for the same binding site), ordered (the TFs bind in a compulsory order), and <b>joint</b> <b>binding</b> (the TFs either bind as a preformed complex, or binding of one is virtually impossible {{in the absence of the}} other). The conclusions are: 1) the laws of combinatorial logic hold only for systems with independently binding TFs; 2) systems formed according to the other scenarios can mimic the functions of their Boolean logical counterparts, but cannot be combined or decomposed in the same way; and 3) the continuously scaled output of systems consisting of competitively binding activators and repressors can be more robustly controlled than that of single TF or (quasi-) logical multi-TF systems.

40|$|Membrane {{neurotransmitter}} transporters {{control the}} concentration of their substrate in the synaptic clefts, through the thermodynamic coupling of uptake to the movement of Na+ and other ions. In addition, excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT) have a Cl- conductance which is gated by the <b>joint</b> <b>binding</b> of Na+ and glutamate, but thermodynamically uncoupled to the flux of glutamate. This conductance is particularly large in the retina-specific EAAT 5 isoform. In the mouse retina, we located EAAT 5 in both cone and rod photoreceptor terminals and in axon terminals of rod bipolar cells. In these later cells, application of glutamate on the axon terminal evoked a current that reversed at ECI, was insensitive to bicuculline, TPMPA, strychnine, DL-AP 5, CNQX and MCPG, but blocked by the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-tBOA. Furthermore, short depolarizations of the bipolar cells evoked a DL-tBOA and Cd 2 + -sensitive current whose amplitude was comparable to the glutamate-evoked current. Its kinetics indicated that EAAT 5 was located close to the glutamate release site. For 2 ms depolarizations evoking maximal responses, the EAAT 5 -mediated current carried between 2 and 8 times more charge as an average inhibitory GABA or glycine postsynaptic current received spontaneously from amacrine cells, with 10 mM or 0. 5 mM intracellular EGTA, respectively. In conditions for which reciprocal inhibition could be monitored, the charge carried by the EAAT 5 current was 1. 5 {{times larger than the}} one carried by the inhibitory postsynaptic currents received from amacrine cells. These results indicate that EAAT 5 acts as a major inhibitory presynaptic receptor at mammalian rod bipolar cell axon terminals. This feedback mechanism could control glutamate release at the ribbon synapses of a non-spiking neuron and increase the temporal contrast in the rod photoreceptor pathwa...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} integrating inventory and distribution optimization together with game theory to effectively manage supply networks. Inventory and distribution simultaneously optimization is a challenging problem aiming at coordinating decisions related to inventory management with those related to transportation scheduling. This problem {{is known as the}} inventory routing problem (IRP) and is an underlying optimization model for supply networks implementing a vendor managed inventory (VMI) strategy. Game theory, and in particular cooperative games, involves several decision-makers willing to coordinate their strategies and share the payoff. In particular, coalitions of decision-makers can make <b>binding</b> agreements about <b>joint</b> strategies, pool their individual payoffs, and redistribute the total in some specified way. In a supply and distribution context, the manager of a franchising business must decide how much inventory to carry. Naturally, the manager of each sales-points wishes to carry an as low as possible amount of inventory {{and at the same time}} have enough inventory to cover all demand and not miss any potential sale. One possibility to achieve these two contrasting goals is to allow cooperation among the sales-points and trade the product at some fair price. Sales-points with an excess inventory may want to sell that surplus to other sales-points in the same cluster or coalition, facing a larger than expected demand. The game consists in determining clusters of sales-points which are willing to cooperate, a fair trade-price, and inventory quantities to be carried by each sales-points to minimize the total costs and maximize the total sales. In other models, the total cost of transportation between a depot and a set of customers must be divided among them and the game considers the synergies in the determination of the individual costs...|$|R
5000|$|Gibson, {{like many}} guitar manufacturers, had long offered semi-acoustic guitars with pickups, and {{previously}} rejected Les Paul and his [...] "log" [...] electric in the 1940s. In apparent {{response to the}} Telecaster, Gibson introduced the first Gibson Les Paul solid body guitar in 1952 (although Les Paul was actually brought in only {{towards the end of}} the design process for expert fine tuning of the nearly complete design and for marketing endorsement http://www.gibson.com/products/gibson/Stories/LesPaul.html). Features of the Les Paul include a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top (much like a violin and earlier Gibson archtop hollow body electric guitars) and contrasting edge binding, two single-coil [...] "soapbar" [...] pickups, a 24¾" [...] scale mahogany neck with a more traditional glued-in [...] "set" [...] neck <b>joint,</b> <b>binding</b> on the edges of the fretboard, and a tilt-back headstock with three machine heads (tuners) to a side. The earliest models had a combination bridge and trapeze-tailpiece design that was in fact designed by Les Paul himself, but was largely disliked and discontinued after the first year. Gibson then developed the Tune-o-matic bridge and separate stop tailpiece, an adjustable non-vibrato design that has endured. By 1957, Gibson had made the final major change to the Les Paul as we know it today - the humbucking pickup, or humbucker. The humbucker, invented by Seth Lover, was a dual-coil pickup which featured two windings connected out of phase and reverse-wound, in order to cancel the 60-cycle hum associated with single-coil pickups; as a byproduct, however, it also produces a distinctive, more [...] "mellow" [...] tone which appeals to many guitarists. The more traditionally designed and styled Gibson solid-body instruments were a contrast to Leo Fender's modular designs, with the most notable differentiator being the method of neck attachment and the scale of the neck (Gibson-24.75", Fender-25.5"). Each design has its own merits. To this day, the basic design of many solid-body electric guitar available today are derived from the original designs - the Telecaster, Stratocaster and the Les Paul.|$|R
