Though in general Marx had a <b>blind</b> <b>faith</b> in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself {{complained that he}} was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.|$|E

25|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>Faith</b> was an English blues rock band, {{composed}} of Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech. The band, {{which was one}} of the first super-groups, released their only album, <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith,</b> in August 1969. They were stylistically similar to the bands in which Winwood, Baker, and Clapton had most recently participated, Traffic and Cream. They helped to pioneer the genre of blues/rock fusion.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{its release}} in July 1969, <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith</b> topped both the UK chart and Billboard's chart for Pop Album in the U.S., and peaked at No.40 on the Black Albums chart – an {{impressive}} feat for a British rock quartet. The album {{sold more than}} half million copies {{in the first month}} of its release and was a huge profit-making device for both Atlantic Records (on their Atco label in the US) and for Clapton and Baker (<b>Blind</b> <b>Faith</b> sales were helping to stimulate demand for Cream albums, also distributed by Atco).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Blind</b> Sighted <b>Faith</b> is an 11-track {{collection}} {{produced by}} nine-time Grammy winner John Porter (The Smiths, Elvis Costello, Ryan Adams). After signing with the Austin, Texas based label Playing In Traffic Records in May 2011, The Dunwells recorded <b>Blind</b> Sighted <b>Faith</b> {{during the summer}} of 2011 at Willie Nelson’s Pedernales Studio in Austin, and Analogue Studios in West Yorkshire, England. <b>Blind</b> Sighted <b>Faith</b> introduced The Dunwells' organic blend of acoustic and electric roots music complete with five-part harmonies. In late June 2012, Playing In Traffic Records struck a joint venture for The Dunwells with Concord Music Group, enlisting the help of the record producer, George Drakoulias to record the band's single [...] "So Beautiful." [...] Playing In Traffic Records and Concord Music Group re-released <b>Blind</b> Sighted <b>Faith</b> with the addition of [...] "So Beautiful" [...] on 28 August 2012.|$|R

25|$|Swedenborg's {{approach}} to demonstrating {{the veracity of}} his theological teachings was to find and use voluminous quotations from the Old Testament and the New Testament to demonstrate agreement between the Bible and his theological teachings. His demonstration of the agreement is found throughout his theological writings since he rejected <b>blind</b> <b>faith</b> and declared true faith to be an internal acknowledgement of the truth.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June 2009, Winwood and Clapton began a 14-date United States summer tour at the Izod Center in New Jersey. Their {{backing band}} {{was similar to}} the one at Madison Square Garden, with Ian Thomas {{replaced}} by Abe Laboriel Jr. and backing vocalists Michelle John and Sharon White added. The former <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith</b> bandmates ran their third European tour from 18 May to 13 June 2010 with drummer Steve Gadd.|$|E

Thanks to <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith's</b> mental powers, the Aryan Brigade was able to uncover and surprise the Task Force. They captured all but Hourman who returned to free them. In the meantime, the Nation had readied its virus for delivery into the atmosphere. J'onn followed the rocket and forced it to detonate in space. All members of the organization were subsequently arrested.|$|R
25|$|Unlike Clapton, Ginger Baker {{had enjoyed}} his <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith</b> {{experience}} {{and looked to}} carry on {{an offshoot of the}} band in the form of Ginger Baker's Air Force with both Grech and Winwood. After a few shows together, Winwood left with Grech and went to Island Records to reunite and reform Traffic (Grech is featured on bass on the Traffic albums The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys and Welcome to the Canteen). Winwood would later go on to have a successful solo career and Grech was a member of various groups before his death in 1990 due to a brain hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginnings}} of <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith</b> begin in mid-1968, with the break-up of Cream. Today {{considered to be}} the first true super group, Cream had become a financial powerhouse, selling millions of records within a few years and bringing international popularity to both the group and each individual member. Despite that success, the band was crumbling from within because of frequent animosity between Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, with Eric Clapton doing his best to mediate. In addition, Clapton had tired of playing commercially-driven blues and hoped to move forward with a new, experimental, less straitjacketed approach to the genre.|$|E
25|$|The cover art {{was created}} by {{photographer}} Bob Seidemann, a personal friend and former flatmate of Clapton, who is known primarily for his photos of Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead. Rumours about the girl's relationship to the band fuelled the controversy; among them were that she was Baker's illegitimate daughter, {{and that she was}} a groupie kept as a slave by the band members. Actually, the young girl was a London suburbanite, who posed upon consent by her parents and for a fee, as described in Seidemann's mini essay about the origins of the <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith</b> album cover artwork.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the longest}} break between studio albums, REZ {{returned}} with a blues-based hard rock/metal sound (closer to their 1978 release Awaiting Your Reply) that would set the pattern for all future releases, and was also indicative of the musical direction lead singer Glenn Kaiser would take in his solo career. The album is highlighted by a cover of <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith's</b> [...] "Presence of the Lord," [...] {{which was the first}} in a string of cover tunes that REZ would include on almost every successive release.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{activities}} of the missionary, like starting a chapel at Cuttack, evoked little response and appreciation from the Hindus. Among the important contributions of the Christian missionaries in Orissa was the spread of modern education. The missionaries, in fact, laid the foundation and were the pioneers of present modern education in Orissa. Missionaries considered education [...] "as auxiliary to preaching". Their aim was to evangelize the entire country and they believed that by the spread of education, superstitions, beliefs, <b>blind</b> <b>faiths,</b> and idolatry could be erased from the native mind and thereof the circulation of sacred scriptures would be feasible. Indirectly, took education {{as a tool for}} gradual destruction of Hinduism and replace it with Christian religion.|$|R
25|$|Opening acts for {{the band}} {{included}} the bands Free, Taste and an R rock act called Delaney & Bonnie. Because Clapton liked the soulful, folksy-sounding blues of Delaney & Bonnie, he began spending {{most of his time}} with them instead of <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith,</b> letting Winwood take a more prominent role in the band. Clapton even began sitting in on their opening sets, sometimes simply playing percussion, and showing more interest in them than his own band. Baker has since said it was obvious that Clapton was going to leave the band as soon as the tour was over.|$|E
25|$|The {{electric}} guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix (a veteran of many American {{rhythm and blues}} and soul groups from the early-mid-1960s) and his power trios, The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Band of Gypsys, has had broad and lasting influence {{on the development of}} blues rock, especially for guitarists. Eric Clapton was another guitarist with a lasting influence on the genre; his work in the 1960s and 1970s with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, The Yardbirds, supergroups <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith,</b> Cream and Derek and the Dominos, and an extensive solo career has been seminal in bringing blues rock into the mainstream. By this time, American acts such as The Doors and Janis Joplin further introduced mainstream audiences to the genre. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd is known for incorporating a mixture of blues rock, progressive rock and psychedelic rock into his guitar work. Gilmour, who has received universal acclaim (from both critics and fans alike) for his guitar work, has described Hendrix as a huge inspiration for his style of playing.|$|E
25|$|Before {{his career}} as a solo artist, Clapton became famous as a guitarist in several bands, {{including}} The Yardbirds (1963–65), John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers (1965–66), Cream (1966–68), <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith</b> (1968–69) and Derek and the Dominos (1970–71). Clapton released his debut solo album in 1970 Eric Clapton, which charted at number 17 in the US charts and at number 14 in the British charts. Four years later he released his second album 461 Ocean Boulevard, which received two gold certifications in the US and UK and peaked at number 1 in the US charts. His 1977 album, Slowhand, named after his nickname given by Giorgio Gomelsky, received three times Platinum in the United States. His most commercial recognised period was from 1989 through 2000, where his albums received at least five certifications and peaked in several countries in the top 10. Eric Clapton's best-selling album to date is the live album Unplugged, which has sold more than ten million copies in the United States alone. It is one of the best-selling live albums in the United States.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} two clearly divided {{sections}} – the first will explore {{the concept of}} colonial history as a metaphor - likened to a cruising shark. The domain of this powerful shark is the oceans of history – its practice, understanding, delivery and ownership. The {{second part of the}} paper will examine two aspects of Keith Windschuttle’s book The Fabrication of Aboriginal History with which I take issue namely the massacre at Risdon Cove in 1804 and secondly, Windschuttle’s denigrating and uninformed appraisal of the relationship between Aboriginal men and women. I will state upfront that it is Windschuttle’s <b>blinding</b> <b>faith</b> in the objectivity of the empirical record that is his Achilles heel. He does not recognise or consider that the archival record can be biased or recorded by those with a vested interest. This sort of naïve historical understanding is seriously flawed...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blind</b> Sighted <b>Faith</b> is {{the debut}} album by English folk-rock band The Dunwells. The album was {{released}} on 14 February 2012 on Playing In Traffic Records.

500|$|... "Weight Gain 4000" [...] {{served as}} a {{commentary}} on American consumerism, the equation of personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. This satire is particularly demonstrated by Cartman's <b>blind</b> <b>faith</b> in the Weight Gain 4000 bodybuilding supplement product despite strong evidence that the product fails at its primary function. Specifically, the product promises to build muscle, and Cartman believes it has fulfilled this function even after he only becomes extremely overweight. This <b>blind</b> <b>faith</b> is also illustrated by the complete disregard Cartman demonstrates for warnings that Weight Gain 4000 carries a risk of permanent damage to the liver and kidneys. The tremendous amount of product Cartman buys is further indicative of American purchasing habits.|$|E
500|$|For {{contractual}} reasons, on UK pressings of All Things Must Pass, Clapton's participation on {{the first}} two discs of the album remained unacknowledged for many years, although he was listed among the musicians appearing on the Apple Jam disc in Britain. Harrison was unaware of Collins's contribution until putting together the 30th anniversary reissue of the album in 2000, at which point he offered Collins his belated thanks.

I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of <b>blind</b> <b>faith</b> than intelligent conviction.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, who often criticized Bill Laswell's production. AllMusic wrote, [...] "Ultimately, Burning {{sounds more like}} a compromised major label Laswell project than a Swans album, to its overall detriment", calling the album a [...] "general disappointment". On the other hand, Trouser Press was favorable, writing: [...] "The Burning World benefits {{a great deal from}} the world music instrumentation and structural abilities Laswell brings to it. The arrangements are uniformly strong, the gentler sounds don't strike one as a compromise and the cover of <b>Blind</b> <b>Faith's</b> [...] "Can't Find My Way Home" [...] is both apt and surprising", ultimately calling the album [...] "a nice one that's almost as haunting as it wants to be." [...] Rosemary Passatino of Spin praised the album, commenting: [...] "Shockingly, Burning World is unbashedly pretty as it is dark." [...] She also described the album as [...] "elegant" [...] and [...] "surprisingly tender." ...|$|R
