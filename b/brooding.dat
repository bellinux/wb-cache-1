5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, {{and defend}} territories. They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that is either {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of incubation and of <b>brooding</b> and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|<b>Brooding</b> {{species are}} most often ahermatypic (not reef-building) in areas of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is {{negatively}} buoyant, sinking on to the waiting egg carriers who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks. Synchronous spawning events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E
5|$|Females {{lay between}} three and seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, {{sheltering}} but not actually <b>brooding</b> them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>broods</b> {{were formed}} by the Overmind, with the {{direction}} of each <b>brood</b> being delegated to a cerebrate. A <b>brood</b> was engineered for a specific function, which impacted its numerical strength and the diversity of its strains. The Terrans gave the Great War <b>broods</b> reporting names based on beasts found in Earth mythology. The Command Wing <b>broods</b> were responsible for defending the Overmind and searching for new species for assimilation. These <b>broods</b> did not engage in front-line combat unless necessary. The Command Wing included the Tiamat <b>Brood,</b> Baelrog <b>Brood,</b> and Fenris <b>Brood.</b> The Attack Wing <b>broods</b> were the Swarm's front-line forces, meant to conquer and occupy worlds. The wing's primary <b>broods</b> were amongst {{the largest in the}} Swarm. The Attack Wing included the Garm <b>Brood,</b> Jormungand <b>Brood,</b> and Surtur <b>Brood.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brood</b> XIX is one {{of three}} extant <b>broods</b> of 13-year cicadas. The other two are <b>Broods</b> XXII and XXIII, {{expected}} to re-emerge in 2014 and 2015 respectively. [...] A fourth 13-year <b>brood,</b> <b>Brood</b> XXI (The Floridian <b>Brood)</b> was last recorded in 1870 in the Florida panhandle, but is believed to be now extinct.|$|R
50|$|In Amalgam Comics, the <b>Brood</b> is {{combined}} with Brother Blood to form Brother <b>Brood,</b> and with the Cult of Blood to form the Cult of <b>Brood.</b> The <b>Brood</b> appear alongside Brother <b>Brood,</b> but are presented as supernatural rather than extraterrestrial.|$|R
5|$|Gaga grounds {{this sort}} of {{spectacle}} with her voice. She is still a fearsome singer when she chooses to be, {{which is to say}} rarely on records but often in concert... What she gave the faithful was easy to digest: largely bulletproof pop, swinging back and forth between <b>brooding,</b> panting torch songs delivered at top volume and grand-scale 1980s-style digital rock with a nightclub twist.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{first visited}} Tahiti in 1891, and {{attracted}} by the beauty of Tahitian women undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (<b>brooding</b> or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.|$|E
5|$|Macroolithus eggs {{have been}} found {{containing}} oviraptorid dinosaur embryos resembling Heyuannia. Multiple other associations between oviraptorid and elongatoolithids (including other eggs containing embryos, parents <b>brooding</b> on nests, {{and a pair of}} shelled Macroolithus-like eggs preserved within an oviraptorid's pelvis) confirm that the parent of Macroolithus was an oviraptorid.|$|E
50|$|Given {{the chance}} to lower the <b>Brood's</b> numbers further, they {{discovered}} that the Annihilation event had caused the interstellar ecosystem to destabilize, since the <b>Brood,</b> dangerous as they are, served as natural predators for even worse species. These remaining species are now breeding {{out of control and}} present a greater threat than the <b>Brood</b> ever did. With no other choice, the X-Men act to prevent the <b>Brood</b> extinction. According to Bishop, there would be a race of benevolent <b>Brood</b> in the future, prompting the X-Men to willingly serve as <b>Brood</b> hosts, so that they could instill them with the same compassion felt by No-Name. After being connected with the hive-mind, the X-Men learned of a nearby <b>Brood</b> who was born with ability to feel compassion, making him the <b>Brood</b> equivalent of a mutant. While such <b>Brood</b> are typically destroyed upon birth, this one was permitted to live, given the <b>Brood's</b> dwindling numbers. After rescuing the <b>Brood</b> mutant and defeating the <b>Brood</b> in battle and allowing them to escape, the X-Men had their <b>Brood</b> embryos removed, to be raised aboard the Peak, with the <b>Brood</b> mutant acting as their mentor.|$|R
50|$|The {{positions}} of <b>brood</b> patches can vary with many having a single <b>brood</b> patch {{in the middle}} of the belly while some shorebirds have one patch on each side of the belly. Gulls and Galliformes may have three <b>brood</b> patches. Pelicans, penguins, boobies and gannets do not develop <b>brood</b> patches, but instead cradle the eggs on their feet when incubating. <b>Brood</b> parasitic cuckoos do not develop <b>brood</b> patches. In species where both parents incubate, <b>brood</b> patches may develop in both sexes.|$|R
50|$|In entomology, {{the term}} <b>brood</b> {{is used to}} refer to the embryo or egg, the larva and the pupa stages in the life of {{holometabolous}} insects. The <b>brood</b> of honey bees develops within a bee hive. In man-made, removable frame hives, such as Langstroth hives, each frame which is mainly <b>brood</b> is called a <b>brood</b> frame. <b>Brood</b> frames usually have some pollen and nectar or honey in the upper corners of the frame. The rest of the <b>brood</b> frames cells may be empty or occupied by <b>brood</b> in various developmental stages. During the <b>brood</b> raising season, the bees may reuse the cells from which <b>brood</b> has emerged for additional <b>brood</b> or convert it to honey or pollen storage. Bees show remarkable flexibility in adapting cells to a use best suited for the hive's survival.|$|R
5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males will defend the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit {{aggressive}} behavior and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the <b>brooding</b> period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites are {{generally}} silent, {{except in the}} breeding season when their calls, though weak, can be persistent. They primarily utter clear whistled 'chee, chee, chee' calls in flight and while hovering, or a hoarse wheezing 'skree-ah' when perched. The call has been confused {{with that of a}} silver gull. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by females and large young, and <b>brooding</b> females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E
5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail {{to the side of}} the nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over <b>brooding</b> duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brood</b> XIII (also {{known as}} <b>Brood</b> 13 or Northern Illinois <b>Brood)</b> {{is one of}} 15 {{separate}} <b>broods</b> of periodical cicadas that appear regularly throughout the midwestern United States. Every 17 years, <b>Brood</b> XIII tunnels en masse {{to the surface of}} the ground, lays eggs, and then dies off in several weeks.|$|R
40|$|Question: How is {{variation}} in offspring size (between <b>broods)</b> related to <b>brood</b> size? Hypotheses: Variance in offspring size (between <b>broods)</b> should {{decrease with increasing}} <b>brood</b> size as predicted by Charnov and colleagues' (Charnov and Downhower, 1995; Charnov et al., 1995) small <b>brood</b> invariant. The range in resources put towards reproduction (for mothers producing a certain <b>brood</b> size) should be invariant over <b>brood</b> size (Downhower and Charnov, 1998). We also test assumptions underlying these predictions. Data studied: We use previously collected data on six parasitoid wasp species. Conclusions: As predicted, variance in offspring size among <b>broods</b> decreased with increasing <b>brood</b> size. However, this decrease did not follow closely the quantitative predictions of Charnov and colleagues (Charnov and Downhower, 1995 : Charnov et al., 1995). We found some support for the prediction that the range in resources invested in reproduction is invariant over <b>brood</b> size. The assumption that mean offspring size is constant over <b>brood</b> size was violated in three of six species. The assumption that resources are shared equally between individuals within a <b>brood</b> generally held. © 2005 Meghan A. Guinnee...|$|R
5000|$|Simply {{keep the}} <b>brood</b> nest open. In {{preparation}} for swarming, bees fill the <b>brood</b> nest with honey. The queen stops laying to be trim enough to fly, and her newly unemployed nurse bees go with her. The concept {{of this method}} is to open the <b>brood</b> nest to employ those nurse bees and get the queen laying again and redirect this sequence of events. This is done by any number of slight variations from empty frames in the <b>brood</b> nest, frames of bare foundation in the <b>brood</b> nest or drawn combs in the <b>brood</b> nest, or moving <b>brood</b> combs to the box above to cause more expansion of the <b>brood</b> nest.|$|R
5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} tucked under their arms. This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved {{on top of their}} nests, likely <b>brooding</b> in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E
5|$|It is a migratory {{passerine}} which {{winters in}} southern and western Europe, southern Asia and north Africa. Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named onomatopoeically for its simple chiff-chaff song. It {{has a number}} of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for <b>brooding</b> and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends his territory against rivals, and attacks potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante was {{the next}} choice, {{increasing}} the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a <b>brooding</b> Mummy. This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, {{making it to the}} final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brood</b> XXII (also {{known as}} The Baton Rouge <b>Brood)</b> is a <b>brood</b> of 13-year {{periodical}} cicadas, last seen in 2014 in a geographic region centered on Baton Rouge, LA {{as well as}} other locations in Southeast Louisiana and Southwest Mississippi. Periodical cicadas (Magicicada spp.) are often referred to as [...] "17-year locusts" [...] because most of the known distinct <b>broods</b> have a 17-year life cycle. <b>Brood</b> XXII is one of only three surviving <b>broods</b> with a 13-year cycle. The next emergence of The Baton Rouge <b>Brood</b> is expected in 2027.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brood</b> X (<b>Brood</b> 10), the Great Eastern <b>Brood,</b> {{is one of}} 15 <b>broods</b> of {{periodical}} cicadas {{that appear}} regularly throughout the eastern United States. It has the greatest range and concentration {{of any of the}} 17-year cicadas.|$|R
50|$|Social colony: In {{the social}} colony {{where there are}} two <b>broods</b> in one cycle, there are {{different}} sex ratios for each <b>brood.</b> The first <b>brood</b> will contain 75-100% females to provide plenty of workers for the nest to help the mother produce a second <b>brood.</b> The second <b>brood</b> is slightly male-biased, resulting in a sex ratio of about 60% males. The products of the second <b>brood</b> will act as reproductives (both the males and females).|$|R
5|$|The {{affair with}} Sejanus {{and the final}} years of treason trials {{permanently}} damaged Tiberius' image and reputation. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia of the bureaucracy established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became paranoid, and {{spent a great deal of}} time <b>brooding</b> over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from Dacia and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.|$|E
5|$|The <b>brooding</b> anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, {{starting}} life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{build the}} nest; the {{building}} periods {{can be as}} brief as three days to as long as four weeks. Egg count differs by location; the number has been as low as two and as high as five. Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. Both sexes incubate but the female is mainly responsible {{as well as being}} the sole provider of <b>brooding.</b> Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved-billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. In situations where food is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first. The fledging period ranges from 11 to 18 days.|$|E
40|$|<b>Brood</b> overlap can be {{an optimal}} {{solution}} to the intraseasonal trade-off in the allocation of time between successive <b>broods.</b> In line with life-history theory, the extent of <b>brood</b> overlap should be adjusted according to the individual {{costs and benefits of}} the simultaneous investment into 2 <b>broods.</b> Phenotypic quality can affect these costs and benefits. In barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), male tail streamer length is a phenotypic quality trait, which is related to reproductive decisions, resulting in pairs with long-tailed males showing higher annual output than those with short-tailed males. We predict that the extent of <b>brood</b> overlap in barn swallows is positively associated with the male's tail ornamentation. Using radiotelemetry, we assessed the duration of postfledging care and juvenile survival and quantified <b>brood</b> overlap with unprecedented accuracy. <b>Broods</b> of pairs with highly ornamented males overlapped to a larger extent than those of pairs with short-tailed males. <b>Brood</b> overlap depended on the reproductive value of the previous <b>brood</b> and on female phenotypic quality. Clutch initiation after a short interbrood interval was associated with a great <b>brood</b> overlap. Short duration of postfledging care but not <b>brood</b> overlap reduced fledgling survival in first <b>broods,</b> and earlier second <b>broods</b> were associated with enlarged clutches. Thus, pairs with long-tailed males managed to increase clutch size and survival of the second <b>brood</b> by an early onset without incurring survival costs in the first <b>brood.</b> This is in line with the hypothesis that <b>brood</b> overlap enforces differential annual reproductive output among individuals varying in phenotypic quality.

50|$|In 1898, {{entomologist}} C. L. Marlatt assigned Roman numerals to 30 different <b>broods</b> of periodical cicadas: 17 distinct <b>broods</b> with a 17-year lifecycle, {{to which}} he assigned <b>brood</b> numbers I through XVII (with emerging years 1893 through 1909); plus 13 <b>broods</b> with a 13-year cycle, {{to which he}} assigned <b>brood</b> numbers XVIII through XXX (1893 through 1905).|$|R

5|$|By {{the late}} Paleozoic, the crinoids and blastoids were the {{predominant}} echinoderms, and some limestones {{from this period}} are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major extinction events {{that occurred during the}} late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the Early Jurassic {{and the beginning of the}} Middle Jurassic. A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of Cryptasterina hystera and Cryptasterina pentagona has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and <b>brooding</b> and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.|$|E
5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of brown pelican populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by <b>brooding</b> birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore, punk, and garage rock {{were the}} roots of {{alternative}} rock, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle. Seattle's local scene produced grunge music, a dark and <b>brooding</b> style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative rock. With {{the addition of a}} more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became wildly popular across the United States in 1991. Three years later, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums Dookie, Smash, Let's Go, Stranger than Fiction and Punk in Drublic) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{standard}} crossover operator in genetic programming (GP), Tackett [19] introduced the <b>brood</b> recombination crossover method. The key parameter in {{this method is}} the <b>brood</b> size. This paper investigates {{a number of new}} developments of <b>brood</b> size in the <b>brood</b> recombination crossover method in GP. We first investigate the effect of different fixed <b>brood</b> sizes, then construct three dynamic models for setting the <b>brood</b> size. These developments are examined and compared with the standard crossover operator on three object classification problems of increasing difficulty. The results suggest that the <b>brood</b> recombination methods with all the new developments outperforms the standard crossover operator for all the problems. As the <b>brood</b> size increases, the system effective performance can be improved. When it exceeds a certain point, however, the effective performance will not be improved and the system will become less efficient. Investigation of three dynamic models for the <b>brood</b> size reveals that a variable <b>brood</b> size which is dynamically set with the number of generations can further improve the system performance over the fixed <b>brood</b> size...|$|R
25|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that {{asynchronous}} hatching may also reduce sibling rivalry. Experimentally manipulated synchronous <b>broods</b> produced more aggressive chicks; chicks in asynchronous <b>broods</b> were less violent. This pattern of behavior arguably occurs through a clearly established <b>brood</b> hierarchy in asynchronously hatched siblings. Although asynchronous hatching is not vital {{for the formation of}} <b>brood</b> hierarchies (the experimentally synchronous <b>broods</b> established them as well), it does aid in efficient <b>brood</b> reduction when food levels are low. Subordinate chicks in asynchronous <b>broods</b> die more quickly, thus relieving the parents of the burden of feeding both offspring when resources are insufficient to properly do so.|$|R
50|$|Periodical cicadas are {{assigned}} to <b>broods</b> based on their year of emergence and life-cycle length. The other three 13-year species (M. tredecim, M. tredecassini, and M. tredecula) are represented in {{all three of the}} extant 13-year broods: <b>Brood</b> XIX (emerging in 2011), <b>Brood</b> XXII (emerging in 2014), and <b>Brood</b> XXIII (emerging in 2015). M. neotredecim was first discovered in 1998 in <b>Brood</b> XIX, where it occurs toward {{the northern part of the}} range, showing a narrow range of overlap with the more southern species M. tredecim.
