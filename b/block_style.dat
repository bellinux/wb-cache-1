25|$|Multiband {{compressors}} {{are primarily}} an audio mastering tool, but their inclusion in digital audio workstation plug-in sets is increasing their use among mix engineers. On-air signal chains of radio stations commonly use hardware multiband compressors to increase apparent loudness {{without fear of}} overmodulation. Having a louder sound is often considered an advantage in commercial competition. However, adjusting a radio station's multiband output compressor requires some artistic sense of style, plenty of time, and good ears. This is because the constantly changing spectral balance between audio bands may have an equalizing effect on the output, by dynamically modifying the on-air frequency response. A further development {{of this approach is}} programmable radio output processing, where the parameters of the multiband compressor automatically change between different settings according to the current programme <b>block</b> <b>style</b> or the time of day.|$|E

500|$|Unlike many of {{the large}} {{manufacturers}} of the day, Balabushka's emphasis was on playing ability and fine craftsmanship, reflecting the values he had held during his years in the woodworking business. He was an innovator in cue construction, cue finishes and cue design. Balabushka's cues were not the elaborately decorated attempts at building art that became a mainstay of the cue market starting in the 1980s and onward. Rather, most Balabushka cues are relatively plain and without grand ornamentation flourishes. Many of his trademark construction techniques have become standard in the industry, {{such as the use}} of Irish linen for wrap material and <b>block</b> <b>style</b> checkered-pattern ringwork above a cue's wrap, commonly employing alternating ebony and ivory, pieces which are eponymously named [...] "Bushka rings." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, James’s {{first solo}} {{exhibition}} of quilts was shown at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts and included Tossed Salad, Razzle Dazzle, Elaborated Tangram, and Night Sky I. [...] With {{the exception of}} Night Sky I, the quilt tops were assembled with varied combinations of hand and machine piecing using straight-edged shapes—squares, triangles, and trapezoids. [...] Night Sky I, however, was a whole cloth quilt that was quilted entirely with curvilinear lines. [...] Influenced {{by the work of}} Robert and Sonia Delaunay, the sequel, Night Sky II, recreated the quilted lines of Night Sky I in a pieced top that incorporated curved seams, instead of straight-edged pieces, and marked a new approach in James’s technique and style. [...] The piece was selected for the “Young Americans: Wood, Plastic, Fiber, Leather” exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City in the fall of 1977. [...] Over the next couple of years, James continued to explore the possibilities of curved piecing in three other quilts that became a part of his Sky series: Aurora, Moonshadow, and Dawn Nebula. [...] All were notable, as well, for having asymmetrical settings, {{despite the fact that they}} were assembled in the standard quilt <b>block</b> <b>style.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... (* Example Allman code {{indenting}} {{style in}} Pascal *)procedure dosomething(x, y: Integer);begin while x = y do begin something (...) somethingelse (...) end;end;Consequences of this style {{are that the}} indented code is clearly set apart from the containing statement by lines that are almost all whitespace and the closing brace lines {{up in the same}} column as the opening brace. Some people feel this makes it easy to find matching braces. The <b>blocking</b> <b>style</b> also delineates the block of code from the associated control statement. Commenting out or removing a control statement or block of code, or code refactoring, are all less likely to introduce syntax errors via dangling or missing braces. Also, it is consistent with brace placement for the outer-function block.|$|R

40|$|Work {{stealing}} is {{a common}} technique used in the runtime schedulers of parallel languages such as Cilk and parallel libraries such as Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB). Depth-restricted work stealing is a restriction of Cilk-like work stealing in which a processor blocked on a task at depth d can only steal tasks from other processors at depth greater than d. To support programs coded in a <b>blocking</b> <b>style,</b> i. e., code without explicit continuations, TBB imposes a depth restriction on work stealing to limit the stack space used by a computation. We present a lower bound on the completion time of a computation executed using a depth-restricted work-stealing scheduler. In particular, we construct a computation which on P processors runs a factor of Ω(P) slower with depth-restricted work stealing as compared to unrestricted work stealing. On this pessimal computation, depth-restricted work stealing asymptotically serializes execution while unrestricted work stealing achieves linear speedup...|$|R
