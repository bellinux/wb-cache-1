No details are given of Othelake's career as Ireland King of Arms, although he certainly had a connection with Ireland as an officer of arms to the Earl of March in 1381. The historical evidence does not even make clear how long Othelake served in the position.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders recaptured the {{fortress}} on 24 May 1191 {{after a short}} siege commanded by King Richard the Lionheart. Authority over Darum was assigned to Count Henry I of Champagne, <b>but</b> <b>Richard</b> later had {{the fortress}} demolished in July 1193 prior to withdrawing his forces from Ascalon. The Ayyubids rebuilt the fortress soon after {{in order to use}} it as a bridgehead to reconquer territories lost in Palestine during the Third Crusade. Nonetheless, in 1196, Sultan al-Aziz Uthmanbdecided to have it demolished in case of its capture by the Crusaders. According to 15th-century historian al-Maqrizi, this decision resulted in public resentment since travelers and merchants had significantly benefited from the fort's protection. In 1226, Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi visited Darum and noted it was one of the cities of Lot and contained a ruined castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1878 the Cremation Society of Great Britain {{bought an}} {{isolated}} {{piece of the}} LNC's Brookwood land and built Woking Crematorium on the site. The crematorium was completed in 1879 <b>but</b> <b>Richard</b> Cross, the Home Secretary, bowed to strong protests from local residents and threatened to prosecute if any cremations were conducted. As a consequence the crematorium was not used other than for the experimental incineration of livestock. The 1884 trial of William Price established that human cremation was not unlawful in England, and on 26March 1885 the first human cremation took place at Woking. Although the LNC was hostile {{to the idea of}} cremation, Woking Crematorium was the only operational crematorium in the country. Since the Necropolis Railway provided the easiest way to transport bodies and mourners from London to the Woking area, transport to and from Woking Crematorium soon began to provide a significant source of revenue for the LNC.|$|E

5|$|On April 24, 2007, the Raptors {{won their}} first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 {{victory over the}} New Jersey Nets, but lost the series 4–2. The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court {{advantage}} in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets {{took charge of the}} series, winning games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip away and had a chance to win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, <b>but</b> <b>Richard</b> Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{clashed with}} Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York, over the {{respective}} {{rights of the}} two sees throughout his time as archbishop. In 1175, at a council held in London, there was a fight between their supporters. King Henry II managed to secure a truce for five years between the two archbishops <b>but</b> <b>Richard</b> was soon embroiled in another dispute. This one was with Roger, abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury and revolved around {{whether or not the}} abbey depended directly on the pope or if the archbishop had jurisdictional rights over the abbey. In the end, the papacy arranged a settlement that left the abbey dependent on the pope direct, but gave the archbishop spiritual authority over the churches of the Isle of Thanet, which had previously been held by the abbey.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} likely rebuilt as a castle in 1305, when John de Segrave, 2nd Baron Segrave, Nicholas' son, {{was granted a}} licence by King Edward I of England to crenellate the {{property}} (decorating a parapet with rectangular gaps in the wall through which archers could fire; largely a status symbol by that time) and to build a moat and wall. The property was also extended with a chapel and several outbuildings at around the same time. Further rebuilding was undertaken in 1354, when another licence to crenellate was received. In {{the second half of}} the 14th century, the castle was inherited by Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who, in 1398, accused Henry of Bolingbroke (later King Henry IV) of treason against King Richard II. The two noblemen were to take part in a duel at Gosford Green, between Caludon Castle and Coventry, <b>but</b> <b>Richard</b> II banished both before the duel could take place. After Henry took the throne, he stripped Mowbray of the dukedom, and Mowbray died in exile shortly afterwards. Mowbray was succeeded by John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, who was restored to the dukedom.|$|E

5|$|Seven years later, Asbel learns from Cheria {{that his}} father died {{defending}} Lhant from an invasion by Fendel. The two return to Lhant and are saved from Fendel's army by Sophie and later Hubert with the Stratha military. Hubert reveals Stratha has been ordered by Windor to secure Lhant and assumes the position of Lord after banishing Asbel from the village. Hearing rumors of Richard's death, the party investigate and find him in the castle's secret passage. Richard explains his father was killed by his uncle, Cedric, who then assumed the throne. The three travel to meet a trusted Duke and are joined by Pascal, a prodigy from an engineering tribe known as the Amarcians. With the Duke's army, the party overthrows Cedric and Richard regains the throne. Richard orders an invasion of Lhant to rid it of Stratha's control forcing the party to betray him. Acknowledging Hubert's efforts as Lord of Lhant, Asbel and the party, joined by Malik Caesar, travel to Stratha {{to negotiate with the}} government to formally instate Hubert as Lord. The government agrees on the pretense that Pascal fixes Stratha's valkines, a large crystal which supplies a life sustaining energy known as eleth; Pascal succeeds <b>but</b> <b>Richard</b> appears and absorbs the valkines' eleth, and flees. The party learn Windor's valkines has also been absorbed and plan to intercept Richard at the final valkines in Fendel. Hubert joins the party as they travel to Fendel but fail to stop Richard. Deducing the Lastalia, the planet's core, is Richard's target, the party find Richard there; Richard mortally injures Sophie before sealing the entrance to the Lastalia.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey to}} the Eastern Mediterranean was inevitably long and eventful. Travelling overland, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, drowned in the Saleph River, and few of his men reached the Eastern Mediterranean. Travelling by sea, Richard the Lionheart, King of England conquered Cyprus in 1191 in {{response}} to his sister and fiancée, who were travelling separately, being taken captive by the island's ruler, Isaac Komnenos. Philip II of France was the first king to arrive at the siege of Acre; Richard arrived on 8June 1191. The arrival of the French and Angevin forces turned the tide in the conflict, and the Muslim garrison of Acre finally surrendered on 12July. Philip considered his vow fulfilled and returned to France to deal with domestic matters, leaving most of his forces behind. <b>But</b> <b>Richard</b> travelled south along the Mediterranean coast, defeated the Muslims near Arsuf, and recaptured the port city of Jaffa. He twice advanced to within a day's march of Jerusalem before judging that he lacked the resources to successfully capture the city, or defend it in the unlikely event of a successful assault, while Saladin had a mustered army. This marked the end of Richard's crusading career and was a calamitous blow to Frankish morale. A three-year truce was negotiated that allowed Catholics unfettered access to Jerusalem. Politics in England and illness forced Richard's departure, never to return, and Saladin died in March 1193. Emperor HenryVI initiated the German Crusade to fulfil the promises made by his father, Frederick, to undertake a Crusade to the Holy Land. Led by Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, the army captured the cities of Sidon and Beirut. However, in 1197 Henry died and most of the Crusaders returned to Germany to protect their holdings and take part in the election of his successor as Emperor.|$|E

25|$|Combining {{elements}} of boogie, gospel and blues, the song introduced several of rock music's most characteristic musical features, including its loud volume and vocal style emphasizing power, and its distinctive beat and rhythm.

25|$|According to the Mayflower {{passenger}} list, {{just over}} a third of the passengers were Puritan Separatists who sought to break away from the established Church of England and create a society along the lines of their religious ideals. Others were hired hands, servants, or farmers recruited by London merchants, all originally destined for the Colony of Virginia. Four of this latter group of passengers were small children given into the care of Mayflower pilgrims as indentured servants. The Virginia Company began the transportation of children in 1618. Until relatively recently, the children were thought to be orphans, foundlings, or involuntary child labor. At that time, children were routinely rounded up from the streets of London or taken from poor families receiving church relief to be used as laborers in the colonies. Any legal objections to the involuntary transportation of the children were overridden by the Privy Council. In 1959, it was conclusively shown that the four More children were sent to America because they were deemed illegitimate. Three of the four More children died in the first winter in the New World, <b>but</b> <b>Richard</b> lived to be approximately 81, dying in Salem, probably in 1695 or 1696.|$|E
