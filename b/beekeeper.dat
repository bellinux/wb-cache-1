Busch did learn elementary arithmetic from his uncle, although science lessons might have been more comprehensive, as Kleine, like many other clergymen, was a <b>beekeeper,</b> and published essays and textbooks on the subject— Busch demonstrated his knowledge of bee-keeping in his future stories. Drawing, and German and English poetry, were also taught by Kleine.|$|E
5|$|Since U.S. <b>beekeeper</b> Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his hives to {{different}} areas of the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to determine occupational and sociological structures of <b>beekeepers</b> in Thracian Region of Turkey. The data was obtained through interviews and questionnaires applied to 201 <b>beekeepers</b> distributed in 19 districts of the region. According to survey results, <b>beekeepers</b> have, on average, an age of 51, an educational background of 6 grades and their experience in beekeeping extends {{over a period of}} 11 years. 65. 68 % of <b>beekeepers</b> are graduates from primary school, for 40. 3 % of the <b>beekeepers</b> interviewed, experienced ones in the field constitute the main source of information and 29. 3 % of <b>beekeepers</b> attended the course, 45. 94 % of <b>beekeepers</b> need to be informed include combatting against bee diseases and pests. The survey reveals that 71. 7 % of <b>beekeepers</b> in the region are farmers and 48. 76 % of <b>beekeepers</b> are members of the agricultural chamber. 97. 5 % of <b>beekeepers</b> are engaged in part-time beekeeping activity for subsistence and 90. 1 % of all <b>beekeepers</b> are engaged stationary beekeeping...|$|R
50|$|Backyard <b>beekeepers</b> produce 40% of all honey worldwide. Beehive {{management}} issues {{resulting in}} colony losses {{are a major}} concern for backyard <b>beekeepers.</b> According to a 2014-15 national survey, backyard <b>beekeepers</b> lost 52% and commercial <b>beekeepers</b> lost 32% of colonies. Backyard <b>beekeepers</b> face more colony losses in the winter than in the summer but for commercial <b>beekeepers</b> {{there is not much}} variation in loss by season. Roughly 22% of backyard <b>beekeepers</b> have identified starvation as one of the main causes for colony losses. Honey bee starvation is an especially challenging problem for beginning <b>beekeepers.</b> Starvation may be caused by unfavorable weather, disease, long distance transportation or depleting food reserve. Starvation may be avoided by effective monitoring of hives and disease prevention measures.|$|R
40|$|Social and {{economic}} auditing of beekeeping in Uttara Kannada conducted between May 2008 – May 2011, showed that all <b>beekeepers</b> practiced beekeeping with Apisceranaindica {{and it is}} profitable as subsidiary industry. Most <b>beekeepers</b> {{of the study area}} acquired training in beekeeping from KVIC (57. 97 %), KVIB (3. 9 %) in collaboration with <b>Beekeepers</b> Cooperative Societies. NGO and trained <b>beekeepers</b> also played significant role in beekeeping training. The survey on the socio-economic aspects revealed that, 93 % of <b>beekeepers</b> are happy with job satisfaction. 97. 6 % members of family liked beekeeping and 68 % spouses participated in beekeeping. Only 3. 6 % <b>beekeepers</b> were involved in the preparation of value added products; 65. 1 % of <b>beekeepers</b> were not happy with loan facilities; and 80. 7 % of <b>beekeepers</b> were satisfied with marketing condition...|$|R
5|$|Losses had {{remained}} stable since the 1990s at 17–20% per year attributable {{to a variety}} of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. The first report of CCD was in mid-November 2006 by a Pennsylvania <b>beekeeper</b> overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses of nearly all of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might {{no longer be able to}} pollinate or produce honey.|$|E
5|$|Nell's story {{alternates}} {{between the}} perspectives of Nell Golightly, a seventeen-year-old girl, and the poet Rupert Brooke. The novel begins as Nell's father dies while tending to the family's bee hives. Because she is the oldest child and her mother is long dead, Nell Golightly decides finds {{a job as a}} maid at The Orchard, a boarding house and tea room outside of Cambridge which caters to the students at the University there. There she, along with several other young women, serves guests and cleans the facilities. She also helps a local <b>beekeeper</b> tend his hives.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the <b>beekeeper</b> is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was conducted on the}} present status of beekeeping in Tekirdağ province. The data was obtained through the questionnaires applied to 312 <b>beekeepers</b> situated in centre of Tekirdağ, Malkara, Çorlu, Saray region. It is aimed to present a glance look on the status and clarify the problems of <b>beekeepers.</b> It was also aimed to obtain general characteristics of beekeeping in Tekirdağ using the results of questionnaire sampled in this region. Economic and social welfare of <b>beekeepers</b> and status of beekeeping in the Tekirdağ and solution to their problems were investigated by direct interview with <b>beekeepers.</b> The 13 % of total <b>beekeepers</b> has never taken any education, While 50 % of total <b>beekeepers</b> had 5 years of education, 15 % of total <b>beekeepers</b> had 8 years of education, 20 % of total <b>beekeepers</b> had 11 years of education, 2 % of total <b>beekeepers</b> had university education, Average number of modern and primitive type hives for the <b>beekeepers</b> were 40 and 5 respectively.

50|$|Queen breeders are {{specialist}} <b>beekeepers</b> who raise queen bees {{for other}} <b>beekeepers.</b> The breeders maintain select stock with superior qualities {{and tend to}} raise their bees in geographic regions with early springs. These <b>beekeepers</b> may also provide extra bees to <b>beekeepers</b> (honey producers, pollinators, or hobby <b>beekeepers)</b> who want to start new operations or expand their farms. Queen breeders use Jenter kits {{in order to produce}} large numbers of queen bees quickly and efficiently.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>beekeepers</b> produce {{commodities}} (farm products) for sale. Honey is {{the most}} valuable commodity sold by <b>beekeepers.</b> Honey-producer <b>beekeepers</b> try to maintain maximum-strength colonies of bees in areas with dense nectar sources. They produce and sell liquid and sometimes comb honey. <b>Beekeepers</b> may sell their commodities retail, as self-brokers, or through commercial packers and distributors. Beeswax, pollen, royal jelly, and propolis may also be significant revenue generators. Taiwanese <b>beekeepers,</b> for example, export tonnes of royal jelly, the high-nutrition food supplement fed to queen honeybees. Modern <b>beekeepers</b> seldom keep honeybees exclusively for beeswax production. Beeswax is harvested along with honey and separated for sale.|$|R

25|$|Two {{species of}} honey bee, A. mellifera and A. cerana indica, are often maintained, fed, and {{transport}}ed by beekeepers. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as the crop needs pollinating {{and allowing the}} <b>beekeeper</b> to charge for the pollination services they provide, revising the historical role of the self-employed <b>beekeeper,</b> and favoring large-scale commercial operations.|$|E
25|$|Some {{pesticide}} authorities recommend, {{and some}} jurisdictions require, that notice of spraying {{be sent to}} all known beekeepers in the area, so they can seal the entrances to their hives and keep the bees inside until the pesticide has {{had a chance to}} disperse. This, however, does not solve all problems associated with spraying and the label instructions should be followed regardless of doing this. Sealing honey bees from flight on hot days can kill bees. <b>Beekeeper</b> notification does not offer any protection to bees, if the <b>beekeeper</b> cannot access them, or to wild native or feral honey bees. Thus, <b>beekeeper</b> notification as the sole protection procedure does not really protect all the pollinators of the area, and is, in effect, a circumventing of the label requirements. Pesticide losses are a major factor in pollinator decline.|$|E

25|$|Chilled brood is not {{actually}} a disease, {{but can be}} a result of mistreatment of the bees by the <b>beekeeper.</b> It also can be caused by a pesticide hit that primarily kills off the adult population, or by a sudden drop in temperature during rapid spring buildup.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the need for development of educational materials for <b>beekeepers</b> by evaluating the following: the current status of the management of honey bee colony genetics in the United States; the self-perceived information needs of beekeepers; and the most acceptable formats for educational materials. The sample defined was 255 hobbyist, part-time and commercial <b>beekeepers</b> that were registered participants at national and regional beekeeping association meetings during 1990. Results indicated that commercial <b>beekeepers</b> prefer different formats of educational materials than hobbyist and part-time <b>beekeepers.</b> Other important findings include the following: (1) few <b>beekeepers</b> manage colony genetics, (2) <b>beekeepers</b> that do not manage colony genetics would be willing to manage colony genetics if their operations were threatened, and (3) self-perceived information needs appear to reflect a response to self-perceived threats. Additionally, <b>beekeepers</b> in all classes indicated that research findings were not presented in an acceptable format...|$|R

This allows <b>beekeepers</b> to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable <b>beekeepers</b> to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for <b>beekeepers).</b>|$|R

25|$|The album's {{debut at}} no. 5 {{is the same}} debut {{position}} as The <b>Beekeeper</b> (2005), although American Doll Posse sold fewer units its week of release.

25|$|Although {{the color}} is {{sometimes}} randomly chosen, professional queen breeders use a color that identifies the year a queen hatched, which helps them to decide whether their queens are too old to maintain a strong hive {{and need to be}} replaced.

Sometimes tiny convex disks marked with identification numbers (Opalithplättchen) are used when a <b>beekeeper</b> has many queens born in the same year.|$|E
25|$|American Doll Posse was {{met with}} {{generally}} favourable reviews, with most criticism being directed not at the musical content, but towards the extensive concept as a potential turn-off for casual listeners. Another point of critique for some reviewers was the album's 23 tracks and long running time. Most reviewers were pleased that both the lyrics and the musical production was noticeably more edgy and confrontational than previous album The <b>Beekeeper</b> (2005).

40|$|Honey {{bees are}} a key managed {{pollination}} service resource in crop agriculture, providing flexible, highly generalist and resilient pollination service delivery to {{a broad range of}} UK crops.
