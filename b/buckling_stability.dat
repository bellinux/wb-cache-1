TRME packages usually work under heavy compressive loads. TRME have high compression stiffness, which are several orders of magnitude greater than their shear stiffness.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} composite {{plates and}} shells are increasingly replacing traditional metallic ones. The manufacturing process and {{service of the}} composite laminates frequently lead to delamination. Delamination reduces the stiffness and strength of composite laminates because they allow out of plane displacement of plies to occur more easily. Dynamic stability analysis {{is an integral part}} of most engineering structures. The present work deals with the study of the effects of free vibration, <b>buckling</b> and dynamic <b>stability</b> of delaminated cross ply composite plates and shells. A first order shear deformation theory based on finite element model is developed for studying the instability region of mid plane delaminated composite plate and shell. The basic understanding of the influence of the delamination on the natural frequencies, nondimensional buckling load and non-dimensional excitation frequency of composite plates and shells is presented. In addition, other factors affecting the vibration, buckling and dynamic instability region of delaminated composite plates and shells are discussed. The numerical results for the free vibration, <b>buckling</b> and dynamic <b>stability</b> of laminated cross-ply plates and shells with delamination are presented. As expected, the natural frequencies and the critical buckling load of the plates and shells decrease with increase in delamination. Increase in delamination also causes dynamic instability regions to be shifted to lower excitation frequencies...|$|R

40|$|The <b>buckling</b> <b>stability</b> {{analysis}} of long cylindrical shells with random imperfections subjected to axial load is treated using two different approaches. The first study {{is based on}} a Lyapunov method which enables one to establish sufficient conditions for <b>buckling</b> <b>stability</b> of a long cylindrical shell with axisymmetric random imperfections. A perturbed system of equations in the neighborhood of the prebuckling solution is investigated. By reducing the problem to a system of integral equations, it is observed that the stability boundary value problem of a long shell {{is similar to that of}} a dynamical system with random parametric excitations. Initial imperfections were assumed to have Gaussian distribution and an exponential cosine correlation function. The critical load was obtained as a function of the root mean square of the imperfections. Results obtained are qualitatively similar to those of Koiter for a periodic imperfection (Ref. 1). The second part is based on the approximate method of truncated hierarchy. The prebuckling state of equilibrium for asymmetric imperfections is found by a successive substitution technique. A homogeneous variational system of equations is set up in order to examine the existence of bifurcation in the neighborhood of the equilibrium state. These last equations involve random parametric terms. The truncated hierarchy method is applied and characteristic equations are obtained. Various exponential cosine correlation functions associated with asymmetric imperfections are examined numerically. Qualitatively the results obtained are as anticipated...|$|E

Composite structural components are often subjected to various environmental loads during their service life. The presence of temperature and moisture concentration may significantly reduce the stiffness and strength of the structures and may affect some design parameter such as vibration and stability characteristics of the structures. To avoid the typical problems caused by vibrations and stability, {{it is important to}} determine natural frequency, critical buckling load and excitation frequency of the composite laminated structures, under hygrothermal conditions. Therefore the vibration, <b>buckling</b> and dynamic <b>stability</b> behavior of laminated composite shells subjected to hygrothermal loadings are studied in the present investigation.
