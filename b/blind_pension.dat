40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{highlight}} the neuro-ophthalmological dangers associated with horse riding, and working around horses, and the importance of wearing adequate headgear to protect the rider from neuro-ophthalmic injuries. It raises the questions of whether the current laws regarding helmet use are satisfactory, and whether helmets currently used are of an adequate standard. The records over a 20 -year period of one neuro-ophthalmologist in Adelaide were reviewed producing 22 patients with neuro-ophthalmological sequelae of head injuries as a result of horse-related accidents. There were 22 patients (16 female, six male), one of whom was involved in three separate accidents, Of these, seven were professional riders and 15 amateur. In 20 of the 24 accidents, patients were either thrown or fell from the horse. Helmets were worn in 15 of the accidents. All the patients had closed head injuries of varying severity. The most common neuro-ophthalmological complication found was a fourth-nerve palsy in 11 patients. Five patients had a significant loss of vision and two of these were severe enough to warrant a <b>blind</b> <b>pension.</b> Horse riding and working around horses constitute an occupation or recreation with inherent dangers. Previous studies have shown that wearing of protective headgear reduces the risk and severity of head injuries, and helmet use should be vigorously promoted. The current laws and practices regarding helmet use are not uniform and seem to be inadequate. The current standard for equestrian safety helmets (AS/NZS 3838 : 1998) embodies improvements on earlier helmet standards and certainly increases the rider's chances of surviving a severe impact. Nevertheless, serious brain injuries have occurred in wearers of approved helmets, and further research is desirable to ensure the optimum degree of protection compatible with rider acceptance...|$|E

His wife asked the Libertador to grant her a pension for her husband's {{sacrifice}} to the Nation. Bolívar personally asked congress for this and in 1820 a pension was given to her in his name. His daughter, Indalecia Camacho, who was also <b>blind,</b> received a <b>pension</b> from Congress on May 26, 1869. His niece, Juana Martínez Camacho, married Antonio Ricaurte.|$|R
50|$|Murray {{was born}} in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK to a cooper father and shop worker mother in 1976. Brought up in the Wester Hailes area of Edinburgh, he {{attended}} Dumbryden Primary School, then Wester Hailes High School. Upon completing his secondary school education, Murray read Social Policy and Law at the University of Edinburgh's Academy of Government. He graduated with an honours degree (BA) aged twenty. While studying at university, he had a part-time job in a local fish & chip shop before setting up and running a pizza delivery service. After graduation, Murray worked for Royal <b>Blind</b> in <b>pensions</b> management, before being head-hunted by an Edinburgh-based internet television station (Worldart.com) during the dot-com boom where he helped {{to build a new}} online TV station. Despite his efforts, the company ran out of funding and was made redundant; he then founded his own event management business (100 mph Events Ltd). Murray also organised a student exchange programme in Nepal to fund school buildings and staff. In 2003, Murray stood in the council elections for Liberton winning the seat for Labour at the age of 27; he later represented the larger Liberton & Gilmerton Ward from 2007-2010.|$|R
40|$|Delivering Aid {{examines}} local welfare practices, policies, {{and debates}} {{during the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in a diverse collection of western communities including Protestant cash-crop homesteaders, Catholic Hispanic subsistence farmers, miners in a dying mining center, residents in a dominant regional city, Native Americans on an Indian reservation, and farmers and workers in a stable mixed economy. Krainz investigates how communities used poor relief, mothers 2 ̆ 7 <b>pensions,</b> <b>blind</b> benefits, county hospitals, and poor farms, as well as explains the roles that private charities played in sustaining needy residents. Delivering Aid challenges existing historical interpretations of the development of America 2 ̆ 7 s welfare state. Most scholars argue that the Progressive Era was a major transformation in welfare practices due to new theories about poverty and charity. Yet drawing on evidence from local county pauper books, Krainz concludes that by focusing on implementation welfare practices show little change. Still, assistance varied widely since local conditions [...] settlement patterns, economic conditions, environmental factors, religious practices, existing relief policies, and decisions by local residents [...] shaped each community 2 ̆ 7 s welfare strategies and were far more important in determining relief practices than were new ideas concerning poverty.
