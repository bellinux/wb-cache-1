50|$|On 2 October, {{however, the}} {{directors}} announced the bank's closure. An examination after the closure showed net liabilities of over £6m (= £500 million at 2005 prices), together with extensive loans on poor security, and speculative investments in Australasian farming, mining stocks and American railway shares. In addition, false reports of gold holdings {{were made to}} the authorities, balance sheets and profit and loss statements falsified, and the share price held up by secret purchases of the Bank's own stock.

5000|$|A {{criminal}} overdraft {{can result}} {{due to the}} account holder making a worthless or misrepresented deposit at an automated teller machine {{in order to obtain}} more cash than present in the account or to prevent a check from being returned due to non-sufficient funds. United States banking law makes the first $100 immediately available and it may be possible for much more uncollected funds to be lost by the <b>bank</b> the following <b>business</b> <b>day</b> before this type of fraud is discovered. The crime could also be perpetrated against another person's account in an [...] "account takeover" [...] or with a counterfeit ATM card, or an account opened in another person's name as part of an identity theft scam. The emergence of ATM deposit technology that scans currency and checks without using an envelope may prevent this type of fraud in the future.|$|R
