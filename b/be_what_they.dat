25|$|The Allied {{general staff}} and key statesmen, after {{capturing}} the original invasion plans, were initially jubilant {{that they had}} potentially won a key victory in the war before the campaign was even fought. Contrarily, General Gamelin and Lord Gort, {{the commander of the}} BEF, were shaken into realizing that whatever the Germans came up with instead would not <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had initially expected. More and more Gamelin became convinced that the Germans would try to attempt a breakthrough by concentrating their mechanized forces. They could hardly hope to break the Maginot Line on his right flank or to overcome the allied concentration of forces on the left flank. That only left the centre. But most of the centre was covered by the river Meuse. Tanks were useless in defeating fortified river positions. However at Namur the river made a sharp turn to the east, creating a gap between itself and the river Dyle. This Gembloux Gap, ideal for mechanized warfare, was a very dangerous weak spot. Gamelin decided to concentrate half of his armoured reserves there. Of course the Germans might try to overcome the Meuse position by using infantry. But that could only be achieved by massive artillery support, the build-up of which would give Gamelin ample warning.|$|E
500|$|Lisa does {{scientific}} research on nerds and discovers that {{the odor of}} the chemical nerd pheromone [...] "" [...] attracts bullies like Francine, proving that both nerds and bullies are predisposed to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are. Lisa then tests the poindextrose extracted from the nerds on famous boxer Drederick Tatum by putting it on his clothes when he visits the school. This causes Nelson to start punching Tatum uncontrollably {{and give him a}} wedgie. Lisa demonstrates her experiment at Professor Frink's science conference, the [...] "12th Annual Big Science Thing", using an antidote on herself and making Francine peaceful and friendly towards her, the antidote being just salad dressing which covers up the smell of the poindextrose. The audience is impressed and Lisa is awarded a gift certificate from J. C. Penney for her research. However, the salad dressing soon runs out and Francine goes on a rampage beating up all the scientists in the room, and ends threatening to beat the viewer of the episode.|$|E
2500|$|Economy of force. The counter-insurgent regime {{must not}} overreact to guerrilla provocations, since this may indeed <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> seek {{to create a}} crisis in {{civilian}} morale. Indiscriminate use of firepower may only serve to alienate the key focus of counterinsurgency- {{the base of the}} people. Police level actions should guide the effort and take place in a clear framework of legality, even if under a State of Emergency. Civil liberties and other customs of peacetime may have to be suspended, but again, the counter-insurgent regime must exercise restraint, and cleave to orderly procedures. In the counter-insurgency context, [...] "boots on the ground" [...] are even more important than technological prowess and massive firepower, although anti-guerrilla forces should take full advantage of modern air, artillery and electronic warfare assets.|$|E

2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that out in the world, although {{everybody wants to be}} their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. Everyone you meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want us to be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where we want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Ooni of Ile-Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuwade, the Olubuse II, at the {{launching}} of Ekiti State Historical and Royal Compendium in December, 2013, bemoaned the growing revisionism of Ekiti history by few senior traditional rulers in Yoruba land ‘claiming to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are not’ [...] which ought to be ‘set aside.’ [...] He counsels that ‘until we can put such people in order, {{it will be impossible}} to have a lasting peace in Yoruba land.’ [...] Ooni further remarked thus: ‘the very foundation of the historical antecedents of progenitors and founders of the dynasty are being daily twisted, concocted, reconfigured and rewritten only for personal egos, selfish reasons and individual satisfaction.’ The foregoing statement is fallout of the characteristics and framework of power politics and interaction patterns thst persist among Ekiti Obas and their people since the 19th century. It also suggests that it is a mirage and inconceivable historical assumption that Ekitiland is totally united and subordinate to each other.|$|E
2500|$|John S. Carlile of transmontane Alleghany County, like Willey an Unconditional Unionist, {{stressed}} that western Virginians {{were committed to}} slavery as “essential to American liberty.” But he would not run away from devotion to the Union. “This government that we {{are called upon to}} destroy has never brought us anything but good. No injury has it ever inflicted on us. No act has every been put upon the statute book of our common country, interfering with the institution of slavery in any shape, manner or form, that was not put there by and with the consent of the slave-holding States of this Union…” If Virginia joined the Confederacy, the North would no longer be bound by the Constitution to stand by slavery and slave-holding states, and it would join with England, France and Spain to extinguish slavery everywhere. Thomas Jefferson's grandson, George Wythe Randolph, now a Richmond lawyer, made a secessionist speech, observing that although the Republicans had captured the United States Government “in strict accordance with Constitutional forms”, it was merely sectional. “The Government, then…is constitutionally revolutionized, and requires a counter-revolution to restore it.” But “Let [...] go with us into a Southern Confederacy, and receive protection from Northern industry, and they will <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> ought to be—the manufacturers and miners of a great [...] nation.” We should go into the Confederacy, “we are told it will bring war. On the contrary it will tend to avert war…Neutrality is impossible and would be dishonorable.” ...|$|E
