50|$|Modern {{home buyers}} often find that {{existing}} K&T systems lack {{the capacity for}} today's levels of power use. First-generation wiring systems became susceptible to abuse by homeowners who would replace <b>blown</b> <b>fuses</b> with fuses rated for higher current. This overfusing of the circuits subjects wiring {{to higher levels of}} current and risks heat damage or fire.|$|R
40|$|The semi-conductor fuses in this {{research}} are fabricated on a submicron process. A voltage potential is applied across the fuse, {{in order to achieve}} a blow. This current peaks with a short pulse in the order of tens of milliamps which has a long decrease to zero current flow, resulting in a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse.</b> A <b>fuse</b> <b>blows</b> due to the pinching together of electrically insulating material which initially surrounds the conducting pathway. The pinch cuts across the conductor, and so halts the current flow. In small-geometry fuses a cavity also forms during the blowing process. The company wishes to understand the <b>fuse</b> <b>blow</b> process mathematically in order to develop a model that can accurately simulate the <b>blowing</b> of the <b>fuses.</b> This report records the thermal, electrical, solid and fluid mechanics of the blowing process that was discussed at the Study Group, with remarks on possible future research for modelling the process...|$|R
5000|$|The larger end cap (the [...] "bottom" [...] of the bottle) has at its centre a small {{spring-loaded}} button {{retained by}} a thin wire, {{which serves as a}} [...] "fuse blown" [...] indicator. When the <b>fuse</b> <b>blows,</b> the wire breaks and the indicator button is ejected by the spring. A missing or displaced indicator thus pinpoints a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse.</b> The removable part of the fuse holder has a small window to allow inspection of the indicator without removal of the fuse. The indicator button usually has a coloured dot indicating the fuse rating (see table).|$|R
25|$|After {{completing}} his undergraduate studies, in September, 1896 de Forest began {{three years of}} postgraduate work. However, his electrical experiments {{had a tendency to}} <b>blow</b> <b>fuses,</b> causing building-wide blackouts. Even after being warned to be more careful, he managed to douse the lights during an important lecture by Professor Charles Hastings, who responded by having de Forest expelled from Sheffield.|$|R
5000|$|Electrical {{breakdown}} {{is often}} associated with the failure of solid or liquid insulating materials used inside high voltage transformers or capacitors in the electricity distribution grid, usually resulting in a short circuit or a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse.</b> Electrical breakdown can also occur across the insulators that suspend overhead power lines, within underground power cables, or lines arcing to nearby branches of trees.|$|R

50|$|In {{percolation}} theory, random fuse {{networks have}} been studied. The current density {{might be too}} low in some areas, and too strong in others. The analysis can therefore be used to smooth out potential problems in the network. For instance, high-speed computer analysis can predict <b>blown</b> <b>fuses</b> and correct for them, or analyze patterns {{that might lead to}} a power outage. It is difficult for humans to predict the long term patterns in complex networks, so fuse or diode networks are used instead.|$|R

Kohler's achievement with the greatest technological impact was patent 3243753 making possible the polyswitch, an automatically resetting circuit protection device which shuts off a circuit when a current overload is sensed but automatically resets when the surge is over, thus avoiding <b>blown</b> <b>fuses</b> and machine stoppages ...|$|R

2500|$|Fuse {{selection}} {{depends on}} the load's characteristics. Semiconductor devices may use a fast or ultrafast fuse as semiconductor devices heat rapidly when excess current flows. The fastest <b>blowing</b> <b>fuses</b> are designed for the most sensitive electrical equipment, where even a short exposure to an overload current could be very damaging. [...] Normal fast-blow fuses are the most general purpose fuses. [...] The time delay fuse (also known as anti-surge, or slow-blow) are designed to allow a current which is above the rated value of the fuse to flow {{for a short period}} of time without the <b>fuse</b> <b>blowing.</b> [...] These types of fuse are used on equipment such as motors, which can draw larger than normal currents for up to several seconds while coming up to speed.|$|R
25|$|Fuses {{have the}} {{advantages}} of often being less costly and simpler than a circuit breaker for similar ratings. The <b>blown</b> <b>fuse</b> must be replaced with a new device which is less convenient than simply resetting a breaker and therefore likely to discourage people from ignoring faults. On the other hand, replacing a fuse without isolating the circuit first (most building wiring designs do not provide individual isolation switches for each fuse) can be dangerous in itself, particularly if the fault is a short circuit.|$|R

50|$|Northern lights {{appeared}} {{in much of}} the eastern United States, creating brightly lit night skies. Telegraph service in the United States was slowed and then virtually eliminated around midnight of the 14th due to <b>blown</b> <b>fuses,</b> and damaged equipment. On the other hand, radio waves were strengthened during the storm due to ionosphere activation, allowing for some strong intercontinental reception. Electric lights did not seem to have been noticeably affected. Undersea cables also suffered from the storm. Damage to telegraph systems were also reported in Europe and the southern hemisphere.|$|R

25|$|Generally every AC {{power line}} {{transformer}} {{acts as an}} isolation transformer, and every step up or down {{has the potential to}} form an isolated circuit. However, this isolation would prevent failed devices from <b>blowing</b> <b>fuses</b> when shorted to their ground conductor. The isolation that could be created by each transformer is defeated by always having one leg of the transformers grounded, {{on both sides of the}} input and output transformer coils. Power lines also typically ground one specific wire at every pole, to ensure current equalization from pole to pole if a short to ground is occurring.|$|R

In comparison with inertia-type single-preset-trip-point mechanical maximum-acceleration-recording devices, circuit weighs less, occupies less space, and records accelerations within narrower bands of uncertainty. In comparison with prior electronic data-acquisition systems designed for same purpose, circuit simpler, less bulky, consumes less power, costs {{and analysis of}} data recorded in magnetic or electronic memory devices.

50|$|Bourque, Cam Neely and Keith Crowder led the Bruins {{to another}} Cup Final {{appearance}} in 1988 against the Edmonton Oilers. The Bruins {{lost in a}} four-game sweep, but a memorable moment in the would-be fourth game ensued, when {{in the second period}} with the game tied 3-3, a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse</b> put the lights out at the Boston Garden. The rest of the game was cancelled and the series shifted to Edmonton. The Oilers completed the sweep, 6-3, back at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in what was originally scheduled as Game Five. The event is considered to be the reason the Bruins began work on a new arena.|$|R
50|$|An {{inrush current}} limiter is a {{component}} used to limit inrush current to avoid gradual damage to components and avoid <b>blowing</b> <b>fuses</b> or tripping circuit breakers. Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors and fixed resistors {{are often used}} to limit inrush current. NTC thermistors {{can be used as}} inrush-current limiting devices in power supply circuits when added in series with the circuit being protected. They present a higher resistance initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on. As current continues to flow, NTC thermistors heat up, allowing higher current flow during normal operation. NTC thermistors are usually much larger than measurement type thermistors, and are purposely designed for power applications.|$|R

50|$|Since the ammeter shunt has a {{very low}} resistance, mistakenly wiring the ammeter in {{parallel}} with a voltage source will cause a short circuit, at best <b>blowing</b> a <b>fuse,</b> possibly damaging the instrument and wiring, and exposing an observer to injury.|$|R
25|$|Another {{test was}} electronic; {{they were asked}} to {{influence}} the burnout point of a common fuse. After they were given a chance to work it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the <b>fuse</b> until it <b>blew.</b> The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the <b>fuses</b> to <b>blow</b> immediately once they got used to it. In fact, they were simply palming the already <b>blown</b> <b>fuses</b> and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down {{on one end of the}} fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as psi effects.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the [...] {{broadcast}} from Wembley Stadium suffered technical problems and failed during The Who's {{performance of their}} song [...] "My Generation", immediately after Roger Daltrey sang [...] "Why don't you all fade..." [...] (the last word was cut off when a <b>blown</b> <b>fuse</b> caused the Wembley stage TV feed to temporarily fail). The Who played with Kenney Jones on drums and it was their first performance since they'd officially disbanded after their 1982 'farewell' tour. The Who's performance included an at times chaotic but still blistering version of [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again". The band's performance was described as [...] "rough but right" [...] by Rolling Stone, but they would not perform together again until the 1988 BPI Awards.|$|R
