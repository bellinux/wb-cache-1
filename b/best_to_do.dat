If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, it would be <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create supply shortages that would be felt by PAVN/NLF forces 12–18 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.|$|E

25|$|Newly bought {{fabric is}} often washed before being cut or sewn. If not pre-washed, {{there is a}} risk of the fabric dyes {{bleeding}} during later washing.

Washing, and subsequently drying, the fabric will also shrink some fabrics, so it is <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this before cutting the fabric into the shapes and sizes needed. The fabric must be ironed flat before cutting to prevent creases or wrinkles from altering measurements.|$|E

Connie's visits with Paul become more frequent, {{to the point that}} she is late to pick up Charlie from school. Following this incident, she realizes she can no longer carry on the affair. Unsuccessfully trying to end the affair over the phone, Connie decides it would be <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in person. She spots Paul with another woman walking down the street as she approaches his neighborhood in her SUV. After following and then confronting Paul, their argument ends in a tryst in the stairwell of his apartment building. At the same time, Edward is standing outside Paul's apartment building, where Edward and Connie narrowly miss each other as she leaves out the backdoor. Edward goes to Paul's apartment and confronts him, revealing that he is Connie's husband. Edward asks to come into Paul's apartment, and after Paul lets him in, he gives Edward some vodka and they talk about Connie. Edward asks how Paul and Connie met, and while walking around the apartment, Edward is stunned to see a snow globe by the bed, which he recognizes as a gift he gave to Connie. Paul reveals that Connie gave it to him as a gift. Feeling sick and disoriented, Edward sits down on the bed and Paul asks if he would like some water. Edward suddenly has a mental breakdown and hits Paul with the snow globe, severely fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.|$|E

The song was written by Lewis and Toby Gad, who also produced the track. Lyrically, [...] "Thunder" [...] is about finding the strength to pick yourself up after falling on difficult times.

500|$|Boyd is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, {{and has been}} used on the left-wing throughout {{the majority of his}} career. He has described himself as a winger, but has stated that he prefers to play [...] "in the hole" [...] because the position allows him to get more time on the ball. He has expressed his willingness to [...] "play anywhere" [...] to help the team, believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong-points. He said [...] "I have played {{on both sides of the}} park and will always try my <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a good job regardless of where the manager plays me". Under former Peterborough United manager, Jim Gannon, Boyd was given a [...] "free-role", essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers. Gannon said [...] "if we can get him free in attacking areas he can be a great creative force". Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he [...] "is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do", and as a result, during Gannon's short spell at Peterborough, was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3–4–1–2 formation. Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first half of Stevenage's 2006–07 campaign. He is predominantly left-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his left-foot, but is also comfortable using his right. Kieran Trippier, Boyd's teammate at Burnley, said of Boyd: [...] "He's great to play with, with a good left foot and a great engine".|$|E

2500|$|In Confucianism, {{the concept}} of li {{is closely related to}} yì (...) , which is based upon the idea of reciprocity.

While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good.
