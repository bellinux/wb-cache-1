50|$|In large {{castings}} it is economical to use {{two different}} sands, {{because the majority}} of the sand will not be in contact with the casting, so it does not need any special properties. The sand that is in contact with the casting is called facing sand, and is designed for the casting on hand. This sand will be built up around the pattern to a thickness of 30 to 100 mm. The sand that fills in around the facing sand is called <b>backing</b> <b>sand.</b> This sand is simply silica sand with only a small amount of binder and no special additives.|$|E
40|$|Received 18. 02. 2013; {{accepted}} in revised form 07. 05. 2013 More and more foundry plants applying moulding sands with water-glass or its substitutes for obtaining the high-quality casting surface at the smallest costs, {{consider the possibility}} of implementing two-layer moulds, in which e. g. the facing sand is a sand with an organic binder (no-bake type) and the <b>backing</b> <b>sand</b> is a sand with inorganic binder. Both kinds of sands must have the same chemical reaction. The most often applied system is the moulding sand on the water-glass or geopolymer bases – as the <b>backing</b> <b>sand</b> and the moulding sand from the group of self-hardening sands with a resol resin – as the facing sand. Investigations were performed for the system: moulding sand with inorganic GEOPOL binder or moulding sand with water glass (as a <b>backing</b> <b>sand)</b> and moulding sand, no-bake type, with a resol resin originated from various producers: Rezolit AM, Estrofen, Avenol NB 700 (as a facing sand). The LUZ apparatus, produced by Multiserw Morek, was adapted for investigations. A special partition with cuts was mounted in the attachment for making test specimens for measuring the tensile strength. This partition allowed a simultaneous compaction of two kinds of moulding sands. After 24 hours of hardening the highest values were obtained for the system: Geopol binder- Avenol resin...|$|E

The studies presented in this article related to castings weighing from 1 to 300 kg made from ductile iron of grades 400 - 15 and 500 - 7, using two-layer moulds, where the facing and core sand was the sand with an alkaline organic binder, while <b>backing</b> <b>sand</b> was the sand with an inorganic geopolymer binder. A simplified method of sand reclamation was applied with possible reuse of the reclaim as an addition to the <b>backing</b> <b>sand.</b> The castiron spheroidising treatment and inoculation were selected taking into account the specific conditions of Hardtop Foundry. A pilot batch of castings was made, testing the gating and feeding systems and using exothermic sleeves on risers. The study confirmed the validity of the adopted concept of making ductile iron castings in layer moulds, while maintaining the content of sand with an organic binder at a level of maximum 15 %...|$|E

40|$|Steel casts in Z. N. POMET were {{produced}} in moulds {{made of the}} moulding sand Floster. This sand did not have good knocking outproperties, required a significant binder addition (4. 5 - 5. 0 parts by weight), and the casting surface quality gave rise to clients objections. Therefore a decision of implementing two-layer moulds, in which the facing sand would consist of the moulding sand with an alkalineorganic binder while the <b>backing</b> <b>sand</b> would {{be made of the}} moulding sand with an inorganic binder also of an alkaline character - wasundertaken. The fraction of this last binder in the moulding sand mass would be smaller than that of the binder used up to now (waterglass). The application of two moulding sands of the same chemical character (highly alkaline) should facilitate the reclamation processand improve the obtained reclaimed material quality, due to which {{it would be possible to}} increase the reclaim fraction in the mouldingsand (up to now it was 50 %). The results of the laboratory investigations of sands with the RUDAL binder are presented in the paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} grain size in {{superalloys}} {{is critical in}} the manufacture of gas turbine blades. The aim of the present research is to provide the technology for producing complicated hollow turbine blades with fine surface grains and better comprehensive mechanical properties. By melt superheating treatment and coating the internal surfaces of shell mould using a cobalt aluminate-bearing coating material, the influence of cobalt aluminate as inoculant on the surface grain sizes of turbine blade was studied with addition of cobalt aluminate: 0, 35 %, 45 % – 65 % and 100 % respectively. At the same time, the effects of cooling circumstances of the blades on surface grain sizes were also experimented under the same addition of cobalt aluminate. The results showed that the melt superheating treatment plays {{a significant role in the}} grain size and carbide morphology; and fine surface grains were obtained when the internal surfaces of shell mould were coated using cobalt aluminate coatings. When the addition of cobalt aluminate in coating is between 45 % - 65 %, and the melt is poured into preheated shell moulds with fine silica sand as <b>backing</b> <b>sand,</b> the blades satisfied the surface grain size requirement is over 90 %. In addition, comparisons of the surface grain size and the mechanical properties were also conducted between home-made and foreign-made blades...|$|E

50|$|The stamper {{was next}} trimmed to size, and the <b>back</b> <b>sanded</b> smooth, {{to ensure a}} smooth finish to the mouldings, and improve contact between the stamper and the press die. The edge was then pressed {{hydraulically}} to form another lip to clamp the edge down on the press. The stampers would be used in hydraulic presses to mould the LP discs. The advantages of this system over the earlier more-direct system included ability to make {{a large number of}} records quickly by using multiple stampers. Also, more records could be produced from each master since stampers would eventually get damaged, but rarely wear out.|$|R
