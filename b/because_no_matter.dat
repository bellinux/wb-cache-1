[...] For her six years in Congress, Ferraro had an average 78percent [...] "Liberal Quotient" [...] from Americans for Democratic Action and an average 8percent rating from the American Conservative Union. The AFL-CIO's Committee on Political Education gave her an average approval rating of 91percent.|$|E

Semigran wrote, [...] "I give Chris Colfer all {{the credit}} in the world, <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> what the material, he knocks {{it out of the}} park every time." [...] James Poniewozik of Time agreed that given the episode's material, [...] "it's important to have it {{in the hands of an}} actor as good as Chris Colfer". The scene with Kurt, Burt, Finn and Blaine was singled out by Jenna Mullins of E! Online, who observed that it [...] "quickly turned into much more than just prom ensembles. It's the jumps from quirky to heavy that make Glee special, and I love watching the cast handle so much in one scene." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gravitational mass is {{measured}} by comparing {{the force of gravity}} of an unknown mass to the force of gravity of a known mass. This is typically done with some sort of balance. Equal masses will match on a balance because the gravitational field applies to them equally, producing identical weight. This assumption breaks down near supermassive objects such as black holes and neutron stars due to tidal effects. [...] It also breaks down in weightless environments, <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> what objects are compared, it will yield a balanced reading.|$|E
2500|$|The core duty of {{a trustee}} is {{to pursue the}} {{interests}} of the beneficiaries, or anyone else the trust permits, except {{the interests of the}} trustee himself. Put positively, this is described as the [...] "fiduciary duty of loyalty". The term [...] "fiduciary" [...] simply means someone in a position of trust and confidence, and because a trustee is the core example of this, English law has for three centuries consistently reaffirmed that trustees, put negatively, may have no possibility of a conflict of interest. Shortly after the United Kingdom was formed, it had its first stock market crash in the South Sea Bubble, a crash where corrupt directors, trustees or politicians ruined the economy. Soon after, the Chancery Court decided Keech v Sandford. On a much smaller scale than the recent economic collapse, Keech claimed he was entitled to the profits his trustee, Sandford, had made by buying the lease on a market in Romford, now in East London. While Keech was still an infant, Sandford alleged he had been told by the market landlord {{that there would be no}} renewal for a child beneficiary. Only then, alleged Sandford, did he inquire and contract to purchase the lease in his own name. Lord King LC held this was irrelevant, <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how honest, the consequences of allowing a relaxed approach to trustee duties would be worse.|$|E

40|$|A central yet often {{overlooked}} aspect of {{an income tax}} is that it acts as insurance against the risk of low income. Because a person’s payments to government are a function of income, he can be assured that {{in a time of}} low income, his tax payments will decrease and transfers will increase, while the standard benefits of governments continue to flow. <b>Because</b> everyone, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how successful, faces some risk of lost income, that assurance provides us an insurance benefit, even if our income never actually drops...|$|R

40|$|This article first {{provides}} {{a review of}} fatherhood in the gender and organization literature on work and family, and the body and (in) visibility. It observes how organizational assumptions which frame fathers as breadwinners, ignoring their paternal role, remain extraordinarily persistent <b>because</b> policies (<b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how long established) do not necessarily change social attitudes and behaviours. The article then draws upon original qualitative data to demonstrate how while male workers may feel valued as employees, they often feel invisible at work in their paternal role. Fathers perceive that, while family-friendly policies might in theory be available to ‘parents’ these are in practice targeted at working mothers. The article considers why working men's paternity is so often ignored, as though fathers are a ghost in the organizational machine. A recommendation {{for the establishment of}} a fatherhood and motherhood passport is made...|$|R

5000|$|In {{reaching}} their conclusion, the Court also examined the wider {{question of whether}} laws proscribing or limiting Sunday trading were constitutional. They held that such laws did not violate the division between church and state, <b>because</b> - <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> the historical roots of such laws - the laws existed as constituted {{in order to fulfill}} a secular objective. In other words, even if Sunday trading laws were originally intended to facilitate and encourage church attendance in the colonial United States, the laws as presently constituted were intended to improve the [...] "health, safety, recreation, and general well-being" [...] of citizens. The present purpose of the laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all; the fact that this day is of particular significance for one or more religions does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals in this manner.|$|R

50|$|Due to its {{resistance}} to harsh environmental conditions, especially low temperature, low moisture, and radiation tolerance, Chroococcidiopsis has been {{thought of as}} an organism capable of living on Mars. Scientists have speculated about the possibly of introducing Chroococcidiopsis to the Martian environment {{to aid in the}} formation of an aerobic environment. In addition to oxygen production, Chroococcidiopsis could aid in the formation of soil on the Martian surface. On Earth, soil is formed from the decomposition of organic <b>matter.</b> On Mars, <b>because</b> <b>no</b> organic <b>matter</b> is present, the organic material from the microbes themselves would provide the necessary organic matter. The soil and oxygen produced by these organisms could one day provide the conditions necessary for humans to grow food on Mars, possibly allowing for permanent human civilizations on the planet. On a shorter time scale, cyanobacteria such as Chroococcidiopsis could be used in closed systems to produce resources for manned outposts on Mars without altering the planet's surface or atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} problem, however, {{arises from}} the high viscosity of the liquid and the corresponding reduction {{in its ability to}} remove CO2. All uses of liquid breathing for diving must involve total liquid ventilation (see above). Total liquid ventilation, however, has difficulty moving enough liquid to carry away CO2, <b>because</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how great the total pressure is, the amount of partial CO2 gas pressure available to dissolve CO2 into the breathing liquid can never be much more than the pressure at which CO2 exists in the blood (about 40 mm of mercury (Torr)).|$|E

My work on estimating mentor-follower relationships [1] and on the dimensions and growth of developer competen-cies [2] suggests how the teaching and mentorship could be improved in a research environment as well. The prac-tice and motivation are the two inseparable cornerstones for gaining competence: the motivation ensures more practice and the practice leads to expertise gain and motivates further practice at the next competence area or level.

40|$|The chapter {{addresses}} {{gender as}} an issue in open, online, and distance learning environments, specifically the role of gender in learner support. The concept of open and distance education has always {{been associated with the}} ideal of providing educational opportunities for minority groups and those who cannot access the educational system in the regular way. As we move from traditional ODL toward increasingly “virtual ” learning environments, there is no less need for concern regarding the effects of gender and the equitable participation of women in online education. Gender is an issue in Open, Online, and Distance Learning Environments simply <b>because</b> – <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how “virtual ” they are – these environments are part of the “real” world and therefore gendered. Learner support, in particular, has to acknowledge gender as a category which shapes the provision of online education and which affects students and their ability to participate fully in open, online and distance learning. With regard to ODL students, evaluation studies show persistent gender differences in three areas: (1) access to, and control over ICTs available resources and the gendered division of labour; (2) know-how and computer literacy, confidence, language and writing skills; and (3) learning styles, communication preferences, and usage of ICTs...|$|R
