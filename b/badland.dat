5|$|Ben and Abi {{continue}} their relationship, but Ben is still secretly seeing Paul. Babe Smith (Annette <b>Badland)</b> offers Abi {{work in the}} pub kitchen, and Abi tells Babe that {{she is able to}} {{turn a blind eye to}} Ben's homosexuality as long as he loves her. However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him out of the room and confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, but as she is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground. Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.|$|E

25|$|Eberth and {{the other}} {{researchers}} considered Hilda a prime site for a continuous bonebed for two reasons, one related to its history, one related to its present geography. First, during the Cretaceous the area was situated closer to the Western Interior Seaway where more sediment would have been deposited than at Dinosaur Provincial Park. Secondly, the modern Hilda area lacks the rough <b>badland</b> terrain that breaks up many probably equivalent deposits in Dinosaur Provincial Park.|$|E
25|$|The park is {{situated}} in {{the valley of the}} Red Deer River, which is noted for its striking <b>badland</b> topography. The park is well known for being one of the richest dinosaur fossil locales in the world. Fifty-eight dinosaur species have been discovered at the park and more than 500 specimens have been removed and exhibited in museums around the globe. The renowned fossil assemblage of nearly 500 species of life, from microscopic fern spores to large carnivorous dinosaurs, justified its becoming a World Heritage Site in 1979.|$|E

25|$|Phil {{clashes with}} Sharon when she {{continually}} puts her work at The Albert before their relationship, {{only beginning to}} become more involved with the bar when she is unimpressed at his {{lack of interest in}} her work. Closing up one night after an event, two men break in and vandalize the bar, and when Sharon attempts to defend herself alone, she is severely beaten and left for dead. She is later hospitalised with a ruptured spleen, leaving Phil distraught, but he later admits to Shirley that he arranged for the men to scare Sharon at the bar, but believed the bodyguards that he hired for her would have protected her, and did not realise that she would be hurt.

However, she later changes her mind and asks Marcus to return all Phil's money to his accounts, unaware that Phil has seen them. After meeting with his accountant, Phil is angry and tells Shirley what he has discovered only for their conversation to turn to passion. However, Phil later decides that since Sharon is returning the money, it should not matter to him as he still wants to go through with the wedding. They later marry, but are oblivious to Shirley's bitterness, as she attempted to persuade him to be with her, rather than Sharon, only hours before the wedding. After the reception, Shirley enters their house and confronts them, leaving Sharon devastated when she realises Phil has been cheating behind her back even after he asked her to marry him. However, she decides that she still loves Phil and wants to be with him.

The band released their self-titled debut album in 1989.

500|$|Babe was {{introduced}} as the maternal aunt of established regular characters Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White), and Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), although Mick was later {{revealed to be}} Babe's great-nephew.

500|$|Speaking {{of how she}} {{received}} the role, <b>Badland</b> recalled that she had previously worked with Treadwell-Collins on an independent film so she was requested for a [...] "chat" [...] with him, before they read through scenes from the show. She was subsequently offered the role of Babe, with <b>Badland</b> describing the process as [...] "terrifying".

40|$|<b>Badlands</b> {{have long}} been {{considered}} as model landscapes due to their perceived close relationship between form and process. The often intense features of erosion have also attracted many geomorphologists because the associated high rates of erosion appeared to offer the opportunity for studying surface processes and the resulting forms. Recently, the perceived simplicity of <b>badlands</b> has been questioned because the expected relationships between driving forces for erosion and the resulting sediment yield could not be observed. Further, a high variability in erosion and sediment yield has been observed across scales. Finally, denudation based on currently observed erosion rates would have lead {{to the destruction of}} most <b>badlands</b> a long time ago. While the perceived simplicity of <b>badlands</b> has sparked a disproportional (compared to the land surface they cover) amount of research, our increasing amount of information has not necessarily increased our understanding of <b>badlands</b> in equal terms. Overall, <b>badlands</b> appear to be more complex than initially assumed. In this paper, we review 40  years of research in the Zin Valley <b>Badlands</b> in Israel to reconcile some of the conflicting results observed there and develop a perspective on the function of <b>badlands</b> as model landscapes. While the data collected in the Zin Valley clearly confirm that spatial and temporal patterns of geomorphic processes and their interaction with topography and surface properties have to be understood, we still conclude that the process of realizing complexity in the “simple” <b>badlands</b> has a model function both for our understanding as well as perspective on all landscape systems...|$|R

She questioned whether Babe could be [...] "an optimist and doesn't fully consider the damage she can cause." [...] Kathy Beale (Taylforth) decides to tip the authorities and after a series of undercover investigations, the police arrest Babe, Mick and Shirley. In her interview, Babe blames Mick and tells the police she was [...] "only acting on instructions". Despite this, they all spend the night in police custody. <b>Badland</b> revealed that Babe [...] "was assuming she could {{find a way out of}} it" [...] when blaming Mick because [...] "it's about staying alive in that moment." [...] She explained that Babe's actions stem from a fear of being arrested and said, [...] "For all she has ever been up to, she has never been in a prison cell so it was about her staying afloat in that precise moment."

When Shirley discovers Babe's actions, she tells her to leave so Babe tries to steal money from the pub's safe. Shirley catches her in the act and announces her actions to Mick. Babe pleads with Mick for another chance, but when she calls Linda a [...] "stuck-up cow", Mick escorts her out. <b>Badland</b> explained that Babe does this because she is [...] "absolutely desperate". Outside the pub, Babe curses the family and exclaimed, [...] "I hope you lose everything and your precious pub", which caused media outlets to question whether it foreshadows speculation the family would lose their pub. <b>Badland</b> believed that [...] "with all the threats she made, Babe might be back at some point."
