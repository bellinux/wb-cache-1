25|$|The North America Nebula (NGC 7000) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} nebulae in Cygnus, because it is visible to the unaided eye under dark skies, as a <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> in the Milky Way. However, its characteristic shape is only visible in long-exposure photographs – it is difficult to observe in telescopes because of its low surface brightness. It has low surface brightness because it is so large; at its widest, the North America Nebula is 2 degrees across. Illuminated by a hot embedded star of magnitude 6, NGC 7000 is 1500 light-years from Earth.|$|E
25|$|The Gamma Cygni Nebula (IC 1318) {{includes}} both bright and dark nebulae {{in an area}} of over 4 degrees. DWB 87 is another of the many bright emission nebulae in Cygnus, 7.8 by 4.3 arcminutes. It is in the Gamma Cygni area. Two other emission nebulae include Sharpless 2-112 and Sharpless 2-115. When viewed in an amateur telescope, Sharpless 2–112 appears to be in a teardrop shape. More of the nebula's eastern portion is visible with an O III (doubly ionized oxygen) filter. There is an orange star of magnitude 10 nearby and a star of magnitude 9 near the nebula's northwest edge. Further to the northwest, there is a dark rift and another <b>bright</b> <b>patch.</b> The whole nebula measures 15 arcminutes in diameter. Sharpless 2–115 is another emission nebula with a complex pattern of light and dark patches. Two pairs of stars appear in the nebula; it is larger near the southwestern pair. The open cluster Berkeley 90 is embedded in this large nebula, which measures 30 by 20 arcminutes.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope's Faint Object Camera {{captured}} an ultraviolet {{image with}} a resolution superior to that obtained by ground-based interferometers—the first conventional-telescope image (or [...] "direct-image" [...] in NASA terminology) {{of the disk}} of another star. Because ultraviolet light is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, observations at these wavelengths are best performed by space telescopes. Like earlier pictures, this image contained a <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> indicating a region in the southwestern quadrant [...] hotter than the stellar surface. Subsequent ultraviolet spectra taken with the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph suggested that the hot spot was one of Betelgeuse's poles of rotation. This would give the rotational axis an inclination of about 20° to the direction of Earth, and a position angle from celestial North of about 55°.|$|E
40|$|Radio-bright regions {{near the}} solar poles are {{frequently}} observed in Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) maps at 17 GHz, and often {{in association with}} coronal holes. However, the origin of these polar brightening has not been established yet. We propose that small magnetic loops {{are the source of}} these <b>bright</b> <b>patches,</b> and present modeling results that reproduce the main observational characteristics of the polar brightening within coronal holes at 17 GHz. The simulations were carried out by calculating the radio emission of the small loops, with several temperature and density profiles, within a 2 D coronal hole atmospheric model. If located at high latitudes, the size of the simulated <b>bright</b> <b>patches</b> are much smaller than the beam size and they present the instrument beam size when observed. The larger <b>bright</b> <b>patches</b> can be generated by a great number of small magnetic loops unresolved by the NoRH beam. Loop models that reproduce <b>bright</b> <b>patches</b> contain denser and hotter plasma near the upper chromosphere and lower corona. On the other hand, loops with increased plasma density and temperature only in the corona do not contribute to the emission at 17 GHz. This could explain the absence of a one-to-one association between the 17 GHz <b>bright</b> <b>patches</b> and those observed in extreme ultraviolet. Moreover, the emission arising from small magnetic loops located close to the limb may merge with the usual limb brightening profile, increasing its brightness temperature and width.

2500|$|The gelada {{is large}} and robust. It is covered with buff to dark brown, coarse hair and has a dark face with pale eyelids. Its arms and feet are nearly black. Its short tail ends in a tuft of hair. Adult males have a long, heavy cape of hair on their backs. The gelada has a hairless face with a short muzzle that is closer to a chimpanzee's than a baboon's. It can also be {{physically}} distinguished from a baboon by the <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> of skin on its chest. This patch is hourglass-shaped. On males, it is bright red and surrounded by white hair; on females, it is far less pronounced. However, when in estrus, the female's patch will brighten, and a [...] "necklace" [...] of fluid-filled blisters forms on the patch. This {{is thought to be}} analogous to the swollen buttocks common to most baboons experiencing estrus. In addition, females have knobs of skin around their patches. Geladas also have well developed ischial callosities. There is sexual dimorphism in this species: males average 18.5kg (40.8lb) while females are smaller, averaging 11kg (24.3lb). The head and body length of this species is 50–75cm (19.7–29.5in) for both sexes. Tail length is 30–50cm (11.8–19.7in).|$|E
60|$|The moon {{began to}} shine--that {{wonderful}} African moon, which turns night to day--throwing {{a network of}} long, black shadows of trees and rocks across the game track I was following. Right ahead of me was a particularly dark patch of this shadow, caused by a projecting wall of cliff, and beyond it an equally <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> of moonlight. Somehow I misdoubted me of that stretch of gloom, for although, of course, I could see nothing there, my quick ear caught the sound of movements.|$|E

60|$|Except {{at certain}} points, where the {{moonlight}} {{found its way}} through open spaces in the verdure, the grassy path which he was now following wound onward in shadow. How far he had advanced he had not noticed, {{when he heard a}} momentary rustling of leaves at some little distance in advance of him. The faint breeze had died away; the movement among the leaves had been no doubt produced by the creeping or the flying of some creature of the night. Looking up, at the moment when he was disturbed by this trifling incident, he noticed a <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> of moonlight ahead as he advanced to a new turn in the path.|$|E

It has been discovered that Mr. Matthew Sharpin left the house in Rutherford Street five minutes after his interview outside of it with Sergeant Bulmer, his manner expressing the liveliest emotions of terror and astonishment, and his left cheek displaying a <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> of red, which looked as if it might have been the result of what is popularly termed a smart box on the ear. He was also heard by the shopman at Rutherford Street to use a very shocking expression in reference to Mrs. Yatman, and was seen to clinch his fist vindictively as he ran round the corner of the street. Nothing more has been heard of him; and it is conjectured that he has left London with the intention of offering his valuable services to the provincial police.|$|E

60|$|Presently, {{from the}} middle {{distance}} a <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> of colour set in a whirl of dust drew rapidly nearer and resolved itself into a group of cavalry officers extending their chargers in a smart gallop. They were well mounted and sat their horses to perfection, and they made a brave show as they raced past Yeovil with a clink and clatter and rhythmic thud, thud, of hoofs, and became once more a patch of colour in a whirl of dust. An answering glow of colour seemed to have burned itself into the grey face of the young man, who had seen them pass without appearing to look at them, a stinging rush of blood, accompanied by a choking catch in the throat and a hot white blindness across the eyes. The weakness of fever broke down at times the rampart of outward indifference that a man of Yeovil's temperament builds coldly round his heartstrings.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{an ideal}} {{atmosphere}} for a bedroom. The air was heavy with many chemical odours, that of methylated spirit predominating. Nor were the decorations of my chamber very sedative. The odious line of glass jars with their relics of disease and suffering stretched {{in front of my}} very eyes. There was no blind to the window, and a three-quarter moon streamed its white light into the room, tracing a silver square with filigree lattices upon the opposite wall. When I had extinguished my candle this one <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> {{in the midst of the}} general gloom had certainly an eerie and discomposing aspect. A rigid and absolute silence reigned throughout the old house, so that the low swish of the branches in the garden came softly and smoothly to my ears. It may have been the hypnotic lullaby of this gentle susurrus, or it may have been the result of my tiring day, but after many dozings and many efforts to regain my clearness of perception, I fell at last into a deep and dreamless sleep.|$|E
60|$|It was {{along the}} {{broadest}} of these paths that Arthur Donnithorne passed, under an avenue of limes and beeches. It was a still afternoon--the golden light was lingering languidly among the upper boughs, only glancing {{down here and}} there on the purple pathway and its edge of faintly sprinkled moss: an afternoon in which destiny disguises her cold awful face behind a hazy radiant veil, encloses us in warm downy wings, and poisons us with violet-scented breath. Arthur strolled along carelessly, with a book under his arm, but not looking {{on the ground as}} meditative men are apt to do; his eyes WOULD fix themselves on the distant bend in the road round which a little figure must surely appear before long. Ah! There she comes. First a <b>bright</b> <b>patch</b> of colour, like a tropic bird among the boughs; then a tripping figure, with a round hat on, and a small basket under her arm; then a deep-blushing, almost frightened, but bright-smiling girl, making her curtsy with a fluttered yet happy glance, as Arthur came up to her. If Arthur had had time to think at all, he would have thought it strange that he should feel fluttered too, be conscious of blushing too--in fact, look and feel as foolish {{as if he had been}} taken by surprise instead of meeting just what he expected. Poor things! It was a pity they were not in that golden age of childhood when they would have stood face to face, eyeing each other with timid liking, then given each other a little butterfly kiss, and toddled off to play together. Arthur would have gone home to his silk-curtained cot, and Hetty to her home-spun pillow, and both would have slept without dreams, and to-morrow would have been a life hardly conscious of a yesterday.|$|E

50|$|One of many {{examples}} of indicator traits is the condition-dependent patch of red feathers around the face and shoulders of the male house finch.
