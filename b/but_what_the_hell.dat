Not all of it worked, but enough of it did... that I was left happy." [...] He opined that if the episode gave more time to Kathy being represented by Teddy Ruxpin [...] "I would have given 'Sun Tea' my stamp of approval". In regards to the environment story, Sepinwall said it [...] "tied in nicely with both Frank's disgusting jars and the apartment plot". Nick Catucci [...] of New York magazine said that the episode was [...] "chockablock with great mini-sketches, gags, and flights of fancy."

I never heard but one worse roarer in my life, and that was a roan: it belonged to Pegwell, the corn-factor; he used to drive him in his gig seven years ago, and he wanted me to take him, but I said, 'Thank you, Peg, I don't deal in wind-instruments.'

During my four years service I had risen from the rank of AC2 (the lowest rank possible) to AC1 (not the highest), but I was fortunate inasmuch as, owing to the shortage of accommodation at White City, I was allowed to 'live out' in civilian digs."By the grace of God the play went like a bomb - even three 'doodlebugs' [...] dropped during the performance.

5000|$|In interviews, Bill Leeb {{went into}} more detail of some songs. [...] "Afterlife" [...] {{reflects}} Leeb's {{relationship with his}} father and themes like mortality.

It took me twenty years to hunt him down, and on the last tour of Europe we finally hooked up. He said he wanted to come to Canada, which I thought was cool. After two days, I found out he had leukemia. It took me twenty years to find him, and then he died after seven weeks." [...] For Leeb, the lyrics also constituted a new approach. [...] "The song is very personal. I usually write about more general stuff ..., so it's the first time I wrote such personal lyrics, and I wasn't sure if Front Line was the right place for it, <b>but</b> I figured <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell,</b> it's my band." [...] The song [...] "Angriff" [...] was inspired by the band's visits in Russia and [...] "is peculiar in that the chorus is performed in German", as noted music magazine Side-Line. Leeb attributed this choice to his Austrian origin: [...] "Actually, since I {{was born and raised in}} Vienna, Austria, German was always my first language, it only seemed natural to eventually reclaim my heritage and do a song in my mother tongue." ...|$|R

It's also effective when you slow something down and then slam 'em into the dash. A lot of Alice stuff is written that way - [...] "Them Bones" [...] is a great off-time song.|$|R
