5|$|Montagu {{outlined}} three {{criteria for}} the document that contained {{the details of the}} falsified plans to land in the Balkans. He said that the target should be casually <b>but</b> <b>clearly</b> identified, that it should name Sicily and another location as cover, and that it should be in an unofficial correspondence that would not normally be sent by diplomatic courier, or encoded signal.|$|E

The green slopes that he envisioned and built on his courses were the single best defense of a hole.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus aelleni is a small, brown Miniopterus species. The head may be {{slightly}} lighter in color than the body. Some {{hairs on the}} underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus griveaudi is similar in color, but M.manavi is darker and M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis are lighter. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, the base is narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, the sides of the tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, <b>but</b> <b>clearly</b> visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s central banks in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for central banks because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity <b>but</b> <b>clearly</b> demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E

25|$|Although Hildesheimer {{was noted}} as having these {{similarities}} to Modern Orthodox Judaism, {{it is noteworthy}} that his philosophy concerning education was even less similar than was Hirsch's.

25|$|Consider a {{periodic}} tiling by unit squares (it looks like infinite graph paper). Now cut one square into two rectangles. The tiling obtained {{in this way}} is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. <b>But</b> <b>clearly</b> this example is much less interesting than the Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an aperiodic tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrary large periodic parts.|$|E
25|$|With Zeno {{far from}} Constantinople, Aspar had {{increased}} his influence by having his son Patricius appointed Caesar and married to Leo I's younger daughter, Leontia (470). Sources are contradictory on the causes, <b>but</b> <b>clearly</b> state that in 471, Leo I had Aspar and Ardabur treacherously killed, certainly with Zeno's and Basiliscus' approval, {{as in the}} eve of the murders, the two generals had moved closer to Constantinople (Zeno was at Chalcedon). After their death, Zeno returned to Constantinople and was appointed magister militum praesentalis.|$|E
25|$|John Dickson became {{in effect}} {{the driving force}} of the Dulas Valley Mineral Railway, and he saw that the line would only reach its {{potential}} if it extended at each end. In the1863 session of Parliament, therefore, the company promoted a Swansea and Neath and Brecon Railway. Swansea docks were as yet undeveloped <b>but</b> <b>clearly</b> had much greater potential than Neath. Extension north-eastward to Brecon would connect there with the Brecon and Merthyr Railway, itself connecting with a chain of other lines reaching to Hereford and beyond.|$|E

25|$|The {{probable}} date of c. 1400 BC {{ascribed to}} the giant chalk horse carved into the hillside turf at Uffington, in southern England, {{is too early to}} be directly associated with Epona a millennium and more later, <b>but</b> <b>clearly</b> represents a Bronze Age totem of some kind. The West Country traditional hobby-horse riders parading on May Day at Padstow, Cornwall and Minehead, Somerset, which survived to the mid-twentieth century, even though Morris dances had been forgotten, may have deep roots in the veneration of Epona, as may the British aversion to eating horsemeat. At Padstow formerly, {{at the end of the}} festivities the hobby-horse was ritually submerged in the sea.|$|E
25|$|Their father’s {{death in}} 1910 and, perhaps, {{improved}} finances, prompted Alexander and Victor {{to return to}} classrooms and complete professional training. Alexander graduated in May 1912. Incidentally, Alexander’s and Victor’s graduation drafts of 1911-1912 are the only architectural drawings actually signed by each brother individually, and thus provide insight into each brother’s own stylistic preferences that later blended under the ‘’Vesnin brothers’’ trademark. Specifically, Alexander demonstrated proficiency in Russian Revival art <b>but</b> <b>clearly</b> mediocre, run-of-the-mill work in the neoclassical manner. Nevertheless, in 1912–1913 the Vesnin firm established itself among the Neoclassical Revival movement, {{as evidenced by the}} 1913 Historical Exhibition where their drafts were displayed along with works by Ivan Fomin, Ivan Zholtovsky and other masters of the style.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe had, by October 1942 flown over 20,000 {{individual}} sorties but {{its original}} strength (in {{the shape of}} Luftflotte 4 with 1,600 aircraft) had fallen 40% to 950 aircraft. The bomber units had been hardest hit having only 232 out of a force of 480 left. The Luftwaffe still held air superiority <b>but</b> <b>clearly</b> its strength was being eroded. The Russian output of aircraft continued unabated—no matter how many enemy machines were destroyed, more appeared, while its own much smaller losses, particularly among the crews, were becoming serious. The Luftwaffe's Sturzkampfgeschwader made maximum effort during {{this phase of the}} war flying 500 sorties per day and causing heavy losses among Soviet forces losing just an average of one Stuka per day.|$|E
