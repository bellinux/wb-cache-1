The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures {{have been known to}} live for up to 30 years in captivity.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>ruff</b> (Centrolophus niger) is a medusafish, {{the only}} member of the genus Centrolophus. It is a mesopelagic fish found in all {{tropical}} and temperate oceans at depths of 50 to 1,000 m. Its length is typically up to 60 cm, but it may reach 150 cm. Other common names include rudderfish and blackfish.|$|E
50|$|The urial (Ovis orientalis vignei), {{also known}} as the arkars or shapo, is a {{subspecies}} group of the wild sheep Ovis orientalis. Noticeable features are the reddish-brown long fur that fades during winter; males are characterized by a <b>black</b> <b>ruff</b> stretching from the neck to the chest and large horns. It is found in western central Asia. The other subspecies group of O. orientalis is the mouflon (Ovis orientalis orientalis group). The two groups have often been considered separate species.|$|E

50|$|The {{houbara bustard}} or North African houbara (Chlamydotis undulata) {{is a large}} bird in the bustard family. This bustard is found in arid {{habitats}} spread across northern Africa and Southeast Asia with a population on the Canary Islands. They are dull brown with black markings on the wings with a greyish neck and a <b>black</b> <b>ruff</b> {{along the side of}} the neck. Males and females appear very similar but males are larger and heavier. This species formerly included MacQueen's bustard which is found further east and sometimes known as the Asian houbara as a subspecies.|$|E
40|$|The benthic {{realm of}} the inner shelf was also swept incessantly and trampled by bottom {{trawlers}} leading to habitat degradation, destruction with an ultimate impact on the food web, by-catch and other commercially important species through recruitment/growth overfishing. The present DSL investigation chiefly aims to measure the micronekton, their behaviour, migration, biology and predator - prey interactions in space and time. Many earlier surveys by government agencies such as FAO/UNDP, FSI, DOD in the EEZ by using demersal trawl / midwater trawl revealed the existence of rich grounds of a few unfamiliar demersal fishes like bull�s eye, green eye, <b>black</b> <b>ruff,</b> drift fish in the outer shelf and slope upto 500 m depth. In view of the importance, vastness and magnitude of living resource potential, as verified from global research results, the deep scattering layer of Indian EEZ was subjected to preliminary survey and investigation on the biomass and bio composition during 1985 - 86 on board Department of Ocean Development�s vessel FORV Sagar Sampada...|$|E

40|$|Nuptial {{ornament}} diversity was {{studied in}} 1814 individual male Ruffs that {{were caught in}} their spring staging areas in Friesland, The Netherlands. Ornaments (hereafter called plumages) comprised of a ruff, two head tufts and facial wattles. Individual feathers {{were found to be}} plain (white, black or one hue), or patterned with black and only one hue. Patterns of feathers varied modestly within males, and greatly between males. The colour of a male's ruff plus head tufts consisted of black and/or white and/or only one other hue. Ruff, head tufts and facial wattles differed in coloration and pattern between individuals. Using seven criteria we counted 801 different plumage variants. Nevertheless, except for wattle colour, characteristics did not combine at random. Some combinations of characteristics, such as a white ruff with white head tufts, occurred much more often than expected by chance. Other combinations, such as a white ruff with black head tufts, a <b>black</b> <b>ruff</b> with white head tufts, and a regular ruff pattern with an irregular pattern, were rare. Mostly there was conformity between ruff and head tufts: they were identical or had reversed primary and secondary colours. Nuptial plumage characteristics were only weakly associated with body size. Some associations between nuptial plumage and the timing of moult were remarkable: only white males and males with a plain ruff pattern tended to have completed moult by the time of their capture in April. We discuss our findings, including the extreme diversity of nuptial plumages among individuals, in the light of development, genetics and function...|$|E

50|$|While predators {{may be a}} large {{threat to}} the <b>black</b> and white <b>ruffed</b> lemur, the {{principal}} threat to their survival comes from the human inhabitants of the island. Since they are comparatively large to other species of lemurs they are hunted as bushmeat by poachers and village men who are looking to feed their families. Another threat to the lemurs is the agricultural practices of the local community. The slash-and-burn method of agriculture is very devastating to the natural habitat of the <b>black</b> and white <b>ruffed</b> lemur.|$|R
