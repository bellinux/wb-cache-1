50|$|A game by Spin Master with Lego-compatible figurines and builds. The game {{takes place}} in a small town called Sick City, which is under fire by a villain named Omega Overlord. Various heroes fight against him, and his goons {{combining}} with each other to fight them off. There were various multi-packs and special <b>blind</b> <b>bags</b> containing the toys. While the game itself was free, the additional figures would cost money/ There were only three waves of figures, all of which were released in 2015. Following the third wave's release, no additional information about the series was released, and it was assumed to be discontinued. The line was based on a 2015 cartoon series of the same name.|$|R
50|$|Lego Minifigures Online was a massively {{multiplayer}} {{online game}} developed {{and published by}} Funcom, which was released on 29 June 2015. The game {{was based on the}} Lego Minifigures theme, allowing the player to unlock, and to play, as various characters from the theme, while also incorporating elements from classic Lego themes, such as castle, and space, and also involving new themes, like mythology. In addition to unlocking new minifigures through normal gameplay, the player was able to unlock minifigures by purchasing physical Lego Minifigures <b>blind</b> <b>bags,</b> which contain special codes that, once entered, allowed the character to be unlocked instantly. All online services for the game were shut down on 30 September 2016.|$|R

Players can use up to three environment enhancements (Hexagonal Power Discs) that can only be used in the toy box mode and up to two character enhancements (Circular Power Discs) per character. The environment enhancements can alter the terrain, change the background [...] "sky," [...] add new vehicles or add new weapons. The character enhancements will alter things about the character such as damage done, replenish health, allow for faster experience gain for leveling and so on. One Power Disc is included with the Starter Pack while additional discs are sold in <b>blind</b> <b>bags</b> each containing two discs.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in July 2005, Woot began {{occasionally}} {{offering a}} <b>blind</b> grab <b>bag</b> officially called [...] "Random Crap", {{in lieu of}} typical product sales. While today its accompanying picture of a paper lunch bag with a question mark has kept its unofficial name [...] "Bag of Crap", (BOC) it was originally dubbed [...] "Bag of Crap" [...] {{during the early years}} of the site when a physical bag of some kind (notebook, iomega zipper bags, etc.) was sold with the 1-3 [...] "craps" [...] and was part of what you were buying. Today, the BOC contains at least three [...] "crappy" [...] items and one bag whose value and quality are not guaranteed, but sometimes expensive items are included. The BOC typically triggers millions of order requests and sells out within seconds, causing server lag and even a server crash. During the January 25, 2011 selling, the website received a record 3.1 million requests, and the product was sold out within eight seconds.|$|R
30|$|In [12], two {{adaptive}} step-size gradient adaptive filters were presented. In these algorithms, {{the step}} sizes were changed using a gradient descent algorithm designed {{to minimize the}} squared estimation error. This algorithm had fast convergence, low steady-state MSE, and good performance in nonstationary environment. The <b>blind</b> adaptive gradient (<b>BAG)</b> algorithm for code-aided suppression of multiple-access interference (MAI) and narrow-band interference (NBI) in direct-sequence/code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) systems was presented in [13]. The BAG algorithm {{was based on the}} concept of accelerating the convergence of a stochastic gradient algorithm by averaging. The authors shown that the BAG had identical convergence and tracking properties to recursive least squares (RLS) but had a computational cost similar to the LMS algorithm. In [14], two low complexity variable step size mechanisms were proposed for constrained minimum variance (CMV) receivers that operate with stochastic gradient algorithms and are also incorporated in the channel estimation algorithms. Also, the low low-complexity variable step size mechanism for blind code-constrained constant modulus algorithm (CCM) receivers was proposed in [15]. This approach was very useful for nonstationary wireless environment.|$|R
