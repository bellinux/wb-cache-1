5|$|Welcome to Alflolol (<b>Bienvenue</b> sur Alflolol) brings Laureline's rebellious {{nature to}} the fore; unlike Valérian, {{she has not}} been born and raised by Galaxity and is {{prepared}} not only to question Galaxity's authorities but to rebel openly against them when their orders run contrary to her sense of morality. It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Valérian with no thought for the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in Ambassador of the Shadows (L'Ambassadeur des Ombres), which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped Valérian and the Earth Ambassador. Later, when acting as independent agents, it is Laureline who questions the ethics of some of the jobs they are forced to take to make ends meet, notably in The Living Weapons (Les Armes Vivantes).|$|E
25|$|<b>Bienvenüe's</b> {{project was}} nearly {{completed}} during the 1920s. Paris planned three new lines and extensions of most {{lines to the}} inner suburbs, despite the reluctance of Parisians. <b>Bienvenüe's</b> inner circular line having been abandoned, the already-built portion between Duroc and Odéon {{for the creation of}} a new east-west line that became line 10, extended west to Porte de Saint-Cloud and the inner suburbs of Boulogne.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bienvenüe's</b> {{construction}} of the Métro was widely praised and has been described admiringly as a work [...] "worthy of the Romans". He eventually accumulated many honors for his engineering accomplishments, including the Grand Prix Berger of the Academy of Arts and Sciences (1909) and the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor (1929).|$|R
25|$|After her capture, La <b>Bienvenue</b> was {{appointed}} a prize crew under Captain Robert Faulkner. She was subsequently commanded by Captain James Carpenter, then on 4 May she was handed {{to the newly}} promoted post-captain, Henry William Bayntun. La <b>Bienvenue</b> was later taken to England, arriving at Sheerness on 24 September. She was registered and renamed HMS Undaunted 30 March 1795 and sold at Deptford on 24 July having served only 16 months as a British ship.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bienvenüe</b> also {{planned a}} {{circular}} line, the ligne circulaire intérieure, {{to connect the}} six main-line stations. A section opened in 1923 between Invalides and the Boulevard Saint-Germain before the plan was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Two {{stations}}, due {{to their}} depth underground, have lifts: Abbesses and Lamarck – Caulaincourt. Five stations have unique décor, each based around a single theme: Abbesses, Concorde, Assemblée nationale, Montparnasse – <b>Bienvenüe</b> and Pasteur.|$|E
25|$|Auber {{is built}} {{in the style of}} the {{traditional}} vaulted métro station as pioneered by Fulgence <b>Bienvenüe,</b> with central tracks and lateral platforms. The difference in engineering terms is that Auber (along with Charles de Gaulle - Étoile and Nation stations) was constructed at depth, entirely underground, and on a far larger scale than any métro station.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prevent a future storm surge from {{entering}} the IHNC via the GIWW from Lake Borgne, the IHNC Lake Borgne Surge Barrier was built near {{the confluence of the}} GIWW and MRGO. This $1.1 billion project was finished in 2013. The barrier has navigable gates in the GIWW and Bayou <b>Bienvenue.</b> These gates can be shut when a storm surge is expected.|$|E
25|$|On 20 April 1896, Paris {{adopted the}} Fulgence <b>Bienvenüe</b> project, {{which was to}} serve only the city proper of Paris. Many Parisians worried that {{extending}} lines to industrial suburbs would reduce {{the safety of the}} city. Paris forbade lines to the inner suburbs and, as a guarantee, Métro trains were to run on the right, as opposed to existing suburban lines, which ran on the left.|$|E
25|$|La <b>Bienvenue</b> was a 20-gun French warship {{launched}} at Le Havre in 1788 {{that made}} several changes in ownership and name during military {{conflict with the}} British. She briefly became La Royalist in October 1792 before reverting to her original name in January the following year. She was serving as a prison ship at Martinique when she was captured by the British in 1794.|$|E
25|$|After setting sail from Mauritius for France in December 1791, La <b>Bienvenue</b> {{was seized}} by her crew, {{handed over to the}} British and renamed. She was retaken by the French Royalist forces on 4 October 1792 at St Kitts and was renamed Royaliste; her {{original}} name was restored in January 1793. She served as a prison ship at Martinique from July that year until she was recaptured by the British.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1825, Chase was {{promoted}} to captain. Between 1824 and 1828, he was superintending engineer of forts at the Rigolets, Chef Menteur, <b>Bienvenue</b> and Bayou Dupre Passes to New Orleans. He also conducted inspections of improvements on the Ohio River in 1825, on the Great Raft in the Red River in 1828 and on sites for lighthouses between Lake Ponchartrain, Louisiana and Mobile Bay, Alabama in 1829.|$|E
25|$|Bienvenüe's project {{consisted}} of 10 lines, which correspond to today's lines 1 to9. Construction {{was so intense}} that by 1920, despite a few changes from schedule, most lines had been completed. The shield method of construction was rejected {{in favor of the}} cut-and-cover method in order to speed up work. <b>Bienvenüe,</b> a highly regarded engineer, designed a special procedure of building the tunnels to allow the swift repaving of roads, and is credited with a largely swift and relatively uneventful construction through the difficult and heterogeneous soils and rocks.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 1794, a British fleet under Sir John Jervis and escorting 7,000 troops under Sir Charles Grey, {{arrived at}} the island of Martinique. In spite of the strong {{opposition}} from the occupying forces and difficult terrain, the island was substantially under British control by 28 February, save for two forts covering the town of Fort Royal. A siege was conducted by both British Army and Royal Navy forces, supported by gunfire from Jervis' fleet which was now occupying the harbour. On 20 March, British Grenadiers and Light Infantry took the town while British sailors attacked and occupied the coastal fort. The landward fort surrendered a few days later. It was on 17 March 1794, during the occupation of the harbour and {{just prior to the}} landings, that La <b>Bienvenue</b> was taken.|$|E
500|$|Because it looped twice {{near the}} coastline, Hurricane Juan brought {{extensive}} rainfall from eastern Texas {{to the western}} Florida Panhandle. In Texas, the highest precipitation total was [...] at a station southwest of Alto. The highest rainfall related to Juan in the United States was , recorded in Galliano, Louisiana. Farther east, there were more reports of high rainfall, measured at [...] and [...] in Biloxi, Mississippi and Fairhope, Alabama, respectively. In Florida, the highest rainfall was [...] near Pensacola. As well as the heavy rainfall, Juan produced heightened tides along the Gulf Coast, peaking at 8.2ft (2.5m) in Bayou <b>Bienvenue</b> in Louisiana. Tides peaked at around 3.3ft (1m) in the other coastal states, although offshore winds caused below-normal tides in western Louisiana and Texas after Juan exited the area. The storm also spawned a few tornadoes, most of them weak. Two were in Mississippi, each damaging a mobile home and downing several trees, and at least three occurred in Alabama, causing isolated building and tree damage.|$|E

2500|$|After Falguière, {{the line}} veers back {{south-east}} in a [...] radius bend underneath the boulevard du Montparnasse. It connects with line 13 at Montparnasse – <b>Bienvenüe,</b> and exit leads toward the Tour Montparnasse. Before the station, a two-way tunnel branches right (i.e., south), {{the beginning of}} a planned branch line to la Porte de Vanves (which later became line C of the Nord-Sud Company). This branch was in turn integrated into the original line 14 of the Métropolitain system, and became a part of line 13 when 13 and 14 were joined at the Seine. The Vanves branch now serves as a depot and workshop.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{junction}} with Line 4 at Montparnasse – <b>Bienvenüe,</b> Line 12 goes north-west underneath the Boulevard du Raspail; at [...] long. After the Rue du Bac station, it runs north underneath the Boulevard Saint-Germain until the river Seine, under which it (and the tunnel of RER Line C) passes via a 4 per cent descent and 3.5 per cent climb, to reappear on the Right Bank. After Concorde, the tunnel burrows {{below that of}} Line 1, then follows a twisting route through Rue Saint Florentin, then Rue du Chevalier-de-Saint-George and finally Rue Duphot before reaching Madeleine, named after the Église de la Madeleine, where the bend necessitates curved platforms.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 March, Fillon was placed under formal {{investigation}} for misuse of public funds, embezzlement, and failure to comply with HATVP disclosure requirements. On 16 March the investigation into Fillon was extended to [...] "aggravated fraud, forgery, and falsification of records". In particular, the probe sought to determine whether documents seized during {{a search of the}} National Assembly in March were forged in order to corroborate the veracity of Penelope Fillon's work as a parliamentary assistant. The investigation was also expanded into possible influence-peddling related to Fillon's consulting firm 2F Conseil, which was previously hired by billionaire Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, owner of the Revue des deux Mondes, which employed Penelope Fillon. In 2013 de Lacharrière also provided a €50,000 loan to François Fillon, who failed to declare it as legally required. On L'Émission politique on 23 March, Fillon said that <b>Bienvenue</b> Place Beauvau, a book co-authored by Didier Hassoux of Le Canard enchaîné, suggested President Hollande ran a shadow cabinet to spread rumours about his opponents, a claim Hassoux subsequently denied. On 24 March, Marc Joulaud, Fillon's former substitute, was formally placed under investigation for embezzlement of public funds. Penelope Fillon was placed under formal investigation for complicity in and concealment of embezzlement and misuse of public funds, as well as aggravated fraud, on 28 March.|$|E
