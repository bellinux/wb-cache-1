40|$|Coronary hemodynamic {{effects of}} {{controlled}} acute aortic insufficiency were studied in 40 open chest dogs {{with and without}} graded coronary diameter narrowing. An adjustable <b>basket</b> <b>device</b> was used to regulate aortic insufficiency, creating three groups: group 1, mild to moderate aortic insufficiency (regurgitant fraction 50 %); and group 3, aortic insufficiency with mean aortic pressure restored to control levels. Mean coronary blood flow was similar to control values in group 1, but was higher in groups 2 and 3. The en-docardial/epicardial flow ratio was similar with and without aortic insufficiency. With graded coronary narrowing greater than 80 %, coronary flow and endocar-dia 1 /epicardial flow ratio decreased with or without aortic insufficiency. However, endocardial/epicardial flow ratio usually decreased more during aortic insufficiency. Peak reactive hyperemic flow after release of a 10 second coronary occlusion also decreased during aortic insufficiency. The amount of decrease compared with control values {{was related to the}} magnitude of aortic insufficiency. This value with no coronary narrowing in group 1 was similar to peak reactive hyperemic flow with a 60 % coronary narrowing during the control period. In group 2, peak reactive hyperemic flow was similar to that with an 80 % coronary narrowing during the control period. Restoring mean aortic pressure to control values in group 3 did not restore peak reactive hyperemic flow to control values. These data suggest that coronary flow reserve assessed with coronary narrowings or during reactive hyperemia is decreased during aortic insufficiency. The decrease in coronary flow reserve was more pronounced as the magnitude of aortic insufficiency increased...|$|E
50|$|Trams use {{in place}} of the pilot a device called a fender. Objects lying on the tram track get hit by a sensor bracket, which {{triggers}} the lowering of a <b>basket</b> shaped <b>device</b> to the ground preventing overrunning of the obstacles by dragging it along the road surface in front of the wheels.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental {{study was conducted}} dealing with refilling start <b>baskets</b> (capillary <b>devices)</b> with settled fluid. A computer program was written to include dynamic pressure, screen wicking, multiple-screen barriers, standpipe screens, variable vehicle mass for computing vehicle acceleration, and calculation of tank outflow rate and vapor pullthrough height. An experimental apparatus was fabricated and tested to provide data for correlation with the analytical model; the test program was conducted in normal gravity using a scale-model capillary device and ethanol as the test fluid. The test data correlated with the analytical model; the model is a versatile and apparently accurate tool for predicting start basket refilling under actual mission conditions...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in popularity since 2005, pellet availability and cost may be an issue. This is an important consideration when buying a pellet stove, furnace, pellet <b>baskets</b> or other <b>devices</b> known in the industry as Bradley Burners. However, current pellet production is increasing and there are plans to bring several new pellet mills online in the US in 2008-2009.|$|R
50|$|This wood {{is used by}} Native Americans of the North East {{for making}} <b>baskets</b> and other <b>devices.</b> The Shakers also made {{extensive}} use of the Black Ash for creating baskets. Also called Basket Ash, Brown Ash, Swamp Ash, hoop ash, and water ash.It is also a popular wood for making electric guitars and basses, due to its good resonant qualities.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to design, fabricate and test an integrated cryogenic test article incorporating both fluid and thermal propellant management subsystems. A 2. 2 m (87 in) diameter aluminum test tank was outfitted with multilayer insulation, helium purge system, low-conductive tank supports, thermodynamic vent system, liquid acquisition device and immersed outflow pump. Tests and analysis performed on the start <b>basket</b> liquid acquisition <b>device</b> and studies of the liquid retention characteristics of fine mesh screens are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the validity of}} the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory, using 12 different single-product <b>baskets</b> of Apple <b>devices.</b> Given the presented advantages of Apple indices as PPP measurement in comparison to the most prominent informal index- the Big Mac index (BMI), they are therefore pointed out to be more adequate modern measures of PPP. Presented study investigates if the theory holds for different products within the same niche across 37 countries. Furthermore, this paper presents results of cross country ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis of the data for 6 different Apple products. Results point out that most-favoured nation (MFN) duty rates and sales taxes together with additional duties and taxes are main factors that affect currency valuation against the U. S. dollar. In contrary to BMI, Apple indices indicate real undervaluation of most of the national currencies against the U. S. dollar and have also shown to be more supportive to the PPP validity than the BMI...|$|R
40|$|Cryogenic fluid {{management}} (CFM) is {{a technology}} area common to virtually every space transportation propulsion concept envisioned. Storage, supply, transfer and handling of sub-critical cryogenic fluids are basic capabilities {{that have long}} been needed by multiple programs and the need {{is expected to continue}} in the future. The use of magnetic fields provides another method, which could replace or augment current/traditional approaches, potentially simplifying vehicle operational constraints. The magnetically actuated propellant orientation (MAPO) program effort focused on the use of magnetic fields to control fluid motion as it relates to positioning (i. e. orientation and acquisition) of a paramagnetic substance such as LO 2. Current CFM state- of-the-art systems used to control and acquire propellant in low gravity environments rely on liquid surface tension devices which employ vanes, fine screen mesh channels and <b>baskets.</b> These <b>devices</b> trap and direct propellant to areas where it's needed and have been used routinely with storable (non-cryogenic) propellants. However, almost no data exists r,egarding their operation in cryogenics and the use of such devices confronts designers with a multitude of significant technology issues. Typical problems include a sensitivity to screen dry out (due to thermal loads and pressurant gas) and momentary adverse accelerations (generated from either internal or external sources). Any of these problems can potentially cause the acquisition systems to ingest or develop vapor and fail. The use of lightweight high field strength magnets may offer a valuable means of augmenting traditional systems potentially mitigating or at least easing operational requirements. Two potential uses of magnetic fields include: 1) strategically positioning magnets to keep vent ports clear of liquid (enabling low G vented fill operations), and 2) placing magnets in the center or around the walls of the tank to create an insulating vapor pocket (between the liquid and the tank wall) which could effectively lower heat transfer to the liquid (enabling increased storage time) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endoscopic {{lithotripsy}} {{is often}} prolonged {{secondary to the}} retrograde migration of calculous fragments. Various balloons, <b>baskets,</b> and other <b>devices</b> {{have been used to}} prevent this migration. Our purpose is to analyze the effect of the Accordion(®) on stone migration and overall efficiency during lithotripsy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 21 patients with a total of 23 distal ureteral stones. Patients underwent lithotripsy using an endoscopic impact lithotriptor. The Accordion was randomly used in 11 of these 21 patients. Data were collected regarding stone migration, stone size, stone ablation, ureteral clearing, and lengths of time for various stages of each procedure. RESULTS: Patients who were treated with the Accordion device experienced significantly less retrograde migration during fragmentation (P= 0. 0064). When stone volume was taken into account (but not on a per stone basis), ablation and ureteral clearing were also expedited, and fewer lithotripter 2 ̆ 2 hits 2 ̆ 2 and basket 2 ̆ 2 sweeps 2 ̆ 2 were needed. CONCLUSION: The Accordion device is effective in preventing the migration of stone fragments during endoscopic ureteral lithotripsy. Our data suggest that this device may also increase efficiency of the fragmentation and clearance of ureteral calculi...|$|R
