40|$|Abstract — Usually, the bipedal robots use {{knee joints}} {{with only one}} degree of freedom. However, several <b>biomechanical</b> <b>researches</b> have proved the human knee joint {{is a very complex}} {{articulation}} with more than one degree of freedom. Indeed, in the sagittal plain the human knee articulation allows a rolling and a sliding of the thigh on the shin. Moreover, we can use for a bipedal robot a closed structure, which gives an additional degree of freedom in translation for the knee joint in the sagittal plane. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} study two different bipedal robots. One with single axis knee joints and an other with four-bar knee joints. These bipeds are defined in the sagittal plain and are composed of two shins, two thighs and a trunk but they have no feet or arms. In the two cases, we use a parametric optimization method to produce reference cyclic trajectories in order to compare the energy consumption of the bipedal robots. A Poincaré return map is defined for the walking gaits of the bipedal robots in order to study the influence of the two different knees on their orbital stability. I...|$|R
40|$|This article reviews {{studies of}} Fixion {{expandable}} nail biomechanical properties {{in case of}} long bones fractures osteosynthesis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to systematize <b>biomechanical</b> <b>researches</b> dedicated to the expandable nail. There were found seven biomechanical studies published between 2005 and 2008. Among them, six studies are devoted to mechanical experiments, and one is a comment to the published study. In four papers, the authors compared biomechanical properties of expandable and locked nails. Expandable nail proved to be a highly effective device for fixation of long bone fractures. However, in case of mid-shaft fractures Fixion nail was significantly less stable than standard locked nails. This conclusion was obtained for humeri, tibia and femur. Stiffness of bone-implant system for expandable nail in case of torsional loads was significantly lower than the similar parameter of standard implant in case of transverse fracture models. Expandable Fixion nail rod should be used with great caution for osteosynthesis of long bones transverse shaft fractures. In contrast, in the case of oblique and spiral fractures, when contact area between fragments is sufficiently high and can share loads between nail and bone fragments, the expandable nail should be used...|$|R

40|$|Purpose NiftySim, an {{open-source}} {{finite element}} toolkit, {{has been designed}} to allow incorporation of high-performance soft tissue simulation capabilities into biomedical applications. The toolkit provides the option of execution on fast graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware, numerous constitutive models and solid-element options, membrane and shell elements, and contact modelling facilities, in a simple to use library. Methods The toolkit is founded on the total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (TLEDs) algorithm, which {{has been shown to be}} efficient and accurate for simulation of soft tissues. The base code is written in C ++++, and GPU execution is achieved using the nVidia CUDA framework. In most cases, interaction with the underlying solvers can be achieved through a single Simulator class, which may be embedded directly in third-party applications such as, surgical guidance systems. Advanced capabilities such as contact modelling and nonlinear constitutive models are also provided, as are more experimental technologies like reduced order modelling. A consistent description of the underlying solution algorithm, its implementation with a focus on GPU execution, and examples of the toolkit’s usage in biomedical applications are provided. Results Efficient mapping of the TLED algorithm to parallel hardware results in very high computational performance, far exceeding that available in commercial packages.

40|$|During {{throwing}} {{motion the}} athlete puts enormous stress {{on both the}} dynamic and the static stabilisers of the shoulder. Repetitive forces cause adaptive soft tissue and bone changes that initially improve performance but ultimately may lead to shoulder pathologies. Although {{a broad range of}} theories have been suggested for the pathophysiology of internal impingement, the reasons are obviously multifactorial. This review aims to critically analyse the current literature and to summarise clinically important information. The cardinal lesions of internal impingement, articular-sided rotator cuff tears and posterosuperior labral lesions, have been shown to occur in association with a number of other findings, most importantly glenohumeral internal rotation deficit and SICK scapula syndrome, but also with posterior humeral head lesions, posterior glenoid bony injury and, rarely, with Bankart and inferior glenohumeral ligament lesions.

40|$|Background/Aim. New optical stereometric methods {{based on}} both contact and noncontact {{mechanisms}} for displacement measurement have become common methods in <b>biomechanical</b> behavior <b>research</b> of biomaterials, bone and soft tissue. The {{aim of this}} study was to register and measure possible deformations of the lower jaw (mandible) with the intact dental arch using optical metrology method. Methods. The system for full field measurement of deformations (strains) comprised of two digital cameras for a synchronized stereoview of the specimen, and the Aramis software. Results. The maximum mandibular bone strains were measured in the regions of the lower first premolar and the lower second molar. In the action force of 500 N simulated in the region of the first lower premolar the intensity of deformation was 86 μm. The value of maximum strain in the bone around the molars was 24 μm for the force of 500 N acting on the second lower molar. When it comes to premolars, 3 - 5 times stronger deformation was observed in the region of the first lower premolar, compared to the deformation values of the second lower premolar area. Conclusion. Under loading of the applied forces the measured strains were in the elastic deformation area, meanning that the dependence of force and deformity is linear. The highest values of strain measurements obtained by the optical method were found in the jaw bone tissue around the loading teeth, and the bony regions of the triangle and mental region. According to the obtained results from the Aramis processing software it can be concluded that this method is applicable in a variety of biomedical research...|$|R

This {{may be a}} concern because when we simultaneously walk and text, the risks of injury and accidents increase {{due to the fact}} that we aren’t fully aware of our environment.

Ten students who attend Iowa State University were recruited for this study. We had them perform four different walking conditions with three trials each: normal walking, slow walking, holding a cell phone as if they were texting, and texting while walking.
