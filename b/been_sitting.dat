5|$|In mid-2006, an RAAF F-111 {{was chosen}} to scuttle the North Korean ship Pong Su which had been {{involved}} in one of Australia's largest drug hauls in recorded history. The ship had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> in Snails Bay, off Birchgrove, while the government considered its fate, and it was decided in March 2006 it would be scuttled by air attack. The Pong Su was sunk on 23 March 2006 by two GBU-10 Paveway II laser-guided bombs.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{both the}} Cunard Line and the White Star Line were {{experiencing}} financial difficulties. David Kirkwood, MP for Clydebank where the unfinished hull 534 had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> idle {{for two and}} a half years, made a passionate plea in the House of Commons for funding to finish the ship and restart the dormant British economy. The government offered Cunard a loan of £3 million to complete hull 534 and an additional £5 million to build a second ship, if Cunard merged with White Star.|$|E
5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> in Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of}} the Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E

5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
5|$|Mr. McGregor {{does not}} notice the substitution, and carries the sack home, {{continually}} counting the six rabbits. His wife claims the skins for herself, intending to line her old cloak with them. But when she {{reaches into the}} sack and feels the vegetables and discovers them, she becomes very, very, angry. Then, as a result, she accuses her husband of playing a trick with her. And Mr. Mc Gregor becomes very angry too, and he throws a rotten vegetable marrow out through the window, hitting {{the youngest of the}} eavesdropping bunnies who has <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> on the window-sill (leaving the Mc Gregors to argue). Their parents decide it is time to go home. At Christmas, they send the heroic little wood mouse a quantity of rabbit-wool. She makes herself a cloak and a hood, and a muff and mittens.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> up when she received both injuries.|$|E
5|$|The paratroopers' first {{assault on}} the palace met with {{surprising}} resistance. The Presidential Guardsmen who stood between the rebels and Diệm were estimated at between 30 and 60, but they managed to repel the initial thrust and kill seven rebels who attempted to scale the palace walls and run across the grass. The rebels cordoned off the palace and held fire. They trucked in reinforcements and the attack restarted at 7:30, but the Presidential Guard continued to resist. Half an hour later, the rebels brought in five armored vehicles and circumnavigated the palace. They fired at the perimeter posts, and mortared the palace grounds. However, the exchange had petered out by 10:30. In the meantime, the rebels had captured the national police offices, Radio Saigon and the barracks of the Presidential Guard. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest, meaning that Diệm's saviours {{would have to come}} from outside Saigon. However, the rebels also suffered a setback when Hong was killed during the battle for the police headquarters. He had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> in his jeep behind the frontline when he was hit by stray gunfire.|$|E
