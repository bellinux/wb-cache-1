25|$|Alternating current (AC) is an {{electric}} current which periodically reverses direction, {{in contrast to}} direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, {{and it is the}} form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a wall socket. A common source of DC power is a <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> in a flashlight.

40|$|In battery applications, every {{electrical}} connection of <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> {{is important because}} it influences functionality, efficiency, and safety. Increased contact resistances generate more heat at the affected terminals and if contact resistances of parallel-connected <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> differ the current divides unequally. Amongst different techniques, detachable connections are easy to handle and have advantages for service, repair and recycling. Usually, detachable {{electrical connection}}s are based on the functional principle of press contacts. So, press contacts are frequently used for consumer batteries in electronic devices, for pouch <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> in scientific tests, and for large <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> with screw connections. This paper focusses on the electrical contact resistance of press contacts for <b>battery</b> <b>cells.</b> A novel measuring method to assess the contact resistance itself is presented. Common terminal and connector metals for <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> and the dependence of their contact resistances on the contact pressure, surface roughness, and contact area are investigated and compared with welding techniques. Only if these dependencies are considered, contact resistances as low as for welded connections are achieved. Furthermore, due to its hard passivating Al 203 surface film, aluminum contacts need a certain surface roughness. The obtained results can serve for modeling and development of battery assemblies...|$|R

Some models (such as the UX32) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold, for example if the device is left on and unattended. The result is that the charger will fail to recharge the battery even when plugged in, leaving the machine in a near-complete unresponsive off-state. The machine can often be revived by pressing the power-on key for 10 seconds, whereupon it will start recharging.|$|E
500|$|For the 2011/2012 model years, {{the battery}} pack stores [...] of energy {{but it is}} {{controlled}} or buffered via the energy management system to use only [...] of this capacity to maximize {{the life of the}} pack. For this reason the battery pack never fully charges or depletes, as the software only allows the battery to operate within a state of charge (SOC) window of 65%, after which the engine kicks in and maintains the charge near the lower level. The minimum SOC varies depending on operating conditions. When more power is required, such as mountain mode, the lower limit of the SOC will rise to 45% to ensure there is enough power available. The battery capacity was increased to [...] for the 2013 model year, the SOC window will be increased to use [...] of the total battery energy, and the buffer to ensure battery life will not be reduced. These changes will increase the Volt's all-electric range but charging will take slightly longer.

The carmaker evaluated about twenty-five different <b>battery</b> <b>cell</b> chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium-ion battery makers around the world.

By the end of October 2007 CPI (LG Chem) delivered their finished battery pack prototypes, and A123 delivered theirs by January 2008.

The pulse frequency for controlling the battery charge duration is dynamically controlled within a certain range in order to inject the maximum charge current into the <b>battery</b> <b>cells.</b> The optimal frequency is determined in order to minimize battery impedance. The adaptation of the proposed pulse duty and frequency decreases the concentration of the polarization by sensing the runtime characteristics of <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> so that it guarantees a certain level of safety in charging the distributed <b>battery</b> <b>cells</b> within the operating temperature range of 5 – 45 °C.
