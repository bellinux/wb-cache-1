40|$|The {{intermediates}} and the rate-limiting {{step in the}} crystallization of deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin {{have been}} determined by a kinetic study {{with the use of}} electron microscopy. In slowly stirred solutions of deoxygenated hemoglobin S [Pumphrey, J. & Steinhardt, J. (1977) J. Mol. Biol. 112, 359 [...] 375], the sequential appearance of fibers have a diameter of approximately equal to 210 A, bundles of aligned fibers in well-ordered arrays, "thick" fibers of approximately equal to 470 A diameter, and microcrystals is observed. Only the fibers having a diameter of approximately equal to 210 A and bundles of aligned fibers are assigned as kinetically important intermediates of the fiber-to-crystal transition. Addition of microscopic seed crystals obtained from slowly stirred solutions of deoxyhemoglobin S to a solution composed of only fibers and hemoglobin monomers results in more rapid crystallization than in control solutions. Addition of seed crystals after the formation of <b>bindles</b> of aligned fibers does not alter the overall kinetics of crystallization. The results demonstrate that alignment of fibers is the rate-limiting step in the crystallization process and results in formation of nucleation sites for crystal growth...|$|R

50|$|In modern {{popular culture}} the <b>bindle</b> {{is portrayed as}} a stick with cloth or a blanket tied around one end for {{carrying}} items, with the entire array being carried over the shoulder, allowing for force {{to be transferred to}} the shoulder and so leading to a more long lasting and comfortable grip, especially with larger heavier loads.

40|$|The {{changes of}} {{morphological}} and anatomical characteristics of Scots pine needles {{as well as}} their fluctuating asymmetry (FA) were studied in pine stands under the influence of industrial emissions of Krasnoyarsk. Observations were made in forest-steppe zone on windward pine forest edges in the conditions of long-term anthropogenic effect. Background site was pine stand 100 km from the city outside the direction of wind pollution. The investigations were carried out in 2013 – 2014 in pure pine stands of grass type, V–VI class of age. For every model tree the needle lengths in pairs were measured, as well as the cross section area of needle, area of central cylinder and conducting <b>bindles</b> areas and the number of resin canals. Indices of fluctuating asymmetry were calculated by method of Palmer and Strobeck (1986). The content of copper, nickel, zinc, cobalt, aluminum, cadmium, lead, fluorine and sulfur were analyzed in needle samples in parallel. The dimensions of needles and its internal structure elements showed the tendency to decrease under the influence of urban industrial emissions in comparison with background sites. On the other hand, there were adaptations of morphological and anatomical parameters of physiologically active needles to the changing environment through a compensatory mechanism. Fluctuating asymmetry indices of needles parameters were found to vary both in technogenic conditions and background ones. The variations were caused by abiotic factors of habitats and levels of technogenic loadings in these stands. Correlation analysis revealed relations between concentrations of heavy metals, aluminum and fluorine and morphological and anatomical characteristics of needles and FA indices. The most unfavorable effects were produced by high concentrations of lead and fluorine...|$|R

50|$|Destruction {{abandoned}} his realm and his responsibilities some time {{around the turn}} of the seventeenth century. The reason for this was the onset of the human Age of Reason, which would eventually culminate in the invention of the atomic bomb. Destruction was unwilling to be responsible for the destruction this would cause, and therefore left the family. He did not cease to exist as the active aspect of Destruction, he simply stopped directing the affairs over which he has control. As he says, destruction did not stop, it was merely no longer his fault. Destruction features most prominently in Brief Lives, in which his siblings Morpheus and Delirium set out to track him down. When they finally meet they do not exactly argue but talk at cross-purposes; Destruction's choice of path baffles and to some degree infuriates Morpheus, while Destruction finds it hard to comprehend Morpheus' position and concentrates on trying to impart to him some wisdom on the necessity of change and self-knowledge. Delirium just wants her brother back; she is reliant on her siblings for support, particularly her elder brothers. In the end, Destruction simply leaves, packing his sword into a <b>bindle,</b> stepping into the sky and vanishing.|$|E

50|$|At first I didn't believe it, {{despite the}} {{evidence}} I'd assembled by then, proving that Officer Beutel, {{the former head}} of the Santa Barbara Police Department's Drinking Driver Team and two-time Top DUI officer in the county had falsified police reports, committed perjury on a DMV form, witnessed at least five forged blood test waivers, withheld evidence from two suspects in violation of Brady rules, and pre-checked DUI forms before going into the field, suggesting a pre-determined mindset to frame innocent drivers.I'd uncovered additional evidence regarding the accountant-turned-cop possibly committing bankruptcy fraud in 2000 and perjury in the course of divorce proceedings just months before she donned the uniform of the Santa Barbara Police Department in 2005.Knowing all of that, I refused to accept that a sworn officer of the law could do something as repugnant as planting drugs on a suspect, much less heroin. Still, as with all the evidence in this investigation, I vetted the allegation with an open mind.Over the months since then, as more and more information surfaced, including a videotape from County Jail where the discovery of the drug took place, I came to believe that it wasn't just possible, but probable that someone in law enforcement — perhaps Officer Beutel — had intentionally planted that <b>bindle</b> of black tar heroin at the feet of the DUI suspect, causing the District Attorney's Office to charge her on additional charges beyond driving under the influence.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{organizations}} have used stickers to publicize their philosophy or cause. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which during its colorful history has pioneered {{a variety of}} creative tactics, calls its stickers silent agitators, or silent organizers. Professor Eric Margolis has written {{about the history of}} such media,Wobbly organizers were revolutionary fish swimming in the sea of <b>bindle</b> stiffs and tramp workers. The Wobbly card was a ticket to ride the rails. [...] "Side door coaches," [...] as box cars were called, were plastered with paper stickers, [...] "silent organizers," [...] that Wobs put up everywhere they passed: [...] "Join the One Big Union," [...] "I Will Win," [...] "Win a World." [...] Silent agitators were produced by the millions. Professor Margolis described the way such stickers were used when the Wobblies called a strike in 1927:Bill Lloyd, Superintendent at the Puritan Mine (in Colorado's northern coal field), went to work one chilly Autumn morning to discover Wobbly stickers pasted on every timber and cross beam in the place: [...] "Join the Wobblies, Join the Wobblies," [...] he said indignantly, [...] "From the bottom of the shaft clear to the working faces, see, they had these posters."Big Bill Haywood described in his autobiography how the IWW issued stickers to propagandize against the war.

I’d also like to thank Silvain Pion and INRIA Sophia-Antipolis for a wonderful research opportunity. The following fundamental problem is of theoretical interest and has applications in graphics, computer aided design, and the analysis of polynomial surfaces: Suppose we are given (1) a function F: Rn → R, (2) an interval formulation of F and ∇F, (3) an axis aligned closed hypercube B 0 ⊂ Rn, and (4) a distance ǫ> 0. Assuming 0 is a regular value of F, and some additional conditions on F, find a piecewise linear approximation V of {F = 0 } in the sense that it lies within ǫ of and is isotopic to B 0 ∩ {F = 0 }. It is often the topological condition which is difficult to ensure. We present a theorem which introduces a new test for topological accuracy. Making use of this, we develop a family of algorithms very similar in form to the Vegter-Plantinga algorithm. They are correct for all n and we implement a variation which is practical when n ≤ 4. This is the first known numeric (as opposed to algebraic) algorithm which ensures the topological guarantee with n> 3. When n ≤ 3 this algorithm produces a mesh with densities similar to those produced by the Vegter-Plantinga algorithm. For n = 2 we describe an advancing boxes algorithm which is based on subdivision followed by an advancing front style progression. It has several unique characteristics, including an ability to ensure good approximations of surface normals and no requirement for precise sign determination of F...|$|E
40|$|Children {{working in}} {{agriculture}} {{have always been}} a part of the rural culture and work ethos of the United States, especially on the Great Plains. Many teenagers still detassel corn or walk the beans in the summer months to earn spending money or money for college. But what about the children who work as migrant laborers in commercialized agriculture? These children, even today, typically go untracked by governmental agencies. The children may lag behind in school because of their family 2 ̆ 7 s migrations and their frequent absences from school to work in the crops. Unlike the child who works during the summer to earn supplemental income, the migrant family 2 ̆ 7 s wage is often tied to the labor of the child worker. While the majority of commercially grown crops today are worked by migrants on the coasts, the use of child labor in commercialized agriculture in the Great Plains has a long and checkered history. A history of child labor in the early sugar beet industry in the Great Plains traces two different trends that intersect in the period between 1890 and 1920. The first trend was the movement of sugar beet production away from small family farms to large commercial farms in the North Platte Valley of Nebraska and the South Platte Valley of Colorado in the 1890 s. The Great Western Sugar Company and the American Sugar Company, among others, owned the land and recruited the labor to work the beets. The second trend was the arrival of German-Russian families in the 1890 s, and later the arrival of Mexican workers in the Midwest, especially after the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Both groups with their large families played leading roles in the cultivation of this important American crop. Sugar companies hired heads of families knowing that children would also be employed in the fields in order for the families to earn a living wage. In 1905 the private New Yorkbased National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) began looking at child labor in berry picking, and by 1911 had expanded their investigations questioning whether the work of child beet workers was simply family farm chores or actually a form of industrialized agricultural child labor. The investigations of the NCLC, which often included photographs by Lewis Hine, became a part of a decadeslong effort to include agricultural workers in child labor reforms. The legislative highlight of this reform effort was passage during the New Deal of a federal child labor law called the Jones-Costigan Act of 1934. JonesCostigan and the subsequent Sugar Act of 1937 restricted subsidies to farmers who used children in cultivating sugar beets. This legislation did more to protect children in the sugar beet industry than did efforts to unionize agricultural workers in the 1930 s or the mechanization of sugar beet growing during World War II. There was no labor organization among sugar beet workers in the period between 1890 and 1920. Labor organization among agricultural workers has an irregular history, with efforts to organize on the Great Plains even more sporadic than those on the coasts. Before World War I the radical labor union, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), attempted to organize bindlestiffs, mostly wheat harvesters, in the Midwest and Western states through their Agricultural Workers Organization. Bindlestiffs were adult male harvest hands who carried all their goods in a bundle, or <b>bindle.</b> On the East Coast, the IWW looked into conditions of migrant workers on the truck and tobacco farms through its Agricultural Workers 2 ̆ 7 Industrial Union. Because of the crackdown on radical organizations after the war, most of the IWW 2 ̆ 7 s successes involving migrant workers were short-lived at best, and none specifically involved sugar beet workers...|$|E
