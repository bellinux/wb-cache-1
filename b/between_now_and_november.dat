40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2013, one of {{the main}} areas of focus for NESCent was {{sustainability}} and transition. Earlier this year, the Provosts of Duke University, North Carolina State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill met with the NSF site visit panel at NESCent and subsequently encouraged us to submit a proposal continuing a science synthesis center. The final version of the proposal was delivered to the Provosts in mid-October 2013. We have also had success securing funds from foundations and federal funding agencies to support a variety of activities at NESCent. 	December 2013 : last deadline for Catalysis Meeting and Sabbatical Scholar proposals 	January 2014 : last deadline for graduate fellowship proposals 	Short-term Visitor proposals accepted through April 2014 Given that NSF funding formally ends in November 2014, December 2013 will be the last deadline for Catalysis Meeting and Sabbatical Scholar proposals. Similarly, the last Graduate Fellowship proposal deadline will be in January 2014. We will continue to accept Short-term Visitor proposals at least until April 2014. All meetings and times of residence are expected to be completed by November 2014. In addition to a full schedule of meetings and courses, NESCent will be organizing Evolution 2014, the annual joint conference of the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), the Society for Systematic Biology (SSB), and the American Society of Naturalists (ASN). the conference will be held in raleigh from June 20 to 24, in conjunction with the satellite iEvoBio conference (June 24 to 25). Much of the science done at NESCent continues to have a high impact within the scientific community. This is evident in the quality of NESCent’s publication output; the center’s h-index (a metric reflecting both publication volume and citation frequency) is high, currently at 57. In 2013, NESCent supported 18 of 39 proposals for Working Groups, Catalysis Meetings, Sabbaticals and courses and 28 of 31 applications for Short-term Visits and Graduate Fellowships. As of September 15, 2013, NESCent had 622 participants at the center who attended 32 scientific meetings (21 Working Group meetings and 11 Catalysis Meetings), as well as several meetings by groups involved in evolutionary synthesis but that were not supported by NESCent funds. By the end of 2013, the center will have hosted 13 postdoctoral fellows, 5 sabbatical scholars, 1 triangle research fellow, 10 short-term visitors, 6 graduate students, and several visiting and resident scientists. Currently we have 45 meetings that are or will be scheduled <b>between</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>November</b> 2014, in addition to 9 resident postdoctoral scholars and 5 resident sabbatarians. We will have no new incoming postdocs, but 6 of our current postdocs are likely to complete their full terms, and we have two sabbatarians who have just been awarded residency for 2014. We also plan one more round of applications for Catalysis Meetings and Sabbatical Scholars in February 2014, and we anticipate a continued set of robust applications for Short-term visitors through November 2014...|$|E

40|$|The {{privatisation}} of Melbourne’s trams {{and trains}} {{has been an}} expensive failure. By June 2006, the privatised system will have cost $ 1. 2 billion more in public subsidies than continued operation by the former Public Transport Corporation; by 2010 this difference will blow out to $ 2. 1 billion. This is not counting the above-inflation fare rises {{at the end of}} 2003. Services have not improved, despite claims to the contrary; nor are the claims of a capacity crisis on the rail system correct. Private bus services consume large subsidies to provide poor services which carry low patronage levels. Private operators are blaming the system’s problems on insufficient subsidies, and are lobbying for increases. But the reverse is the case: train, tram and bus operators will receive $ 1. 2 billion this year in subsidies and fares – more per head than first-class overseas public operators such as Vancouver’s Translink. Privatisation has not served the public interest. The State government is preparing a ‘transport and livability statement’, which will reiterate proposals for public transport improvements and extensions from previous documents, such as Melbourne 2030 (released in October 2002). Regardless of the merits of these proposals, they cannot be delivered affordably or effectively under the current institutional arrangements. The tram and train franchise agreements were released (quietly) late last year and we have analysed their contents. The franchises will expire on 30 November 2008, unless the state government gives notice that it wants to extend them. Such notice must be given by 30 November 2007 (only 19 months from now), but can be given at any time. If no such notice is given, then Melbourne’s trains and trams will revert to public ownership at 3 am on 30 November 2008 without the risk of compensation claims. We recommend that instead of extending or renewing the franchise agreements, the state government replace them with a new public transport agency modelled on the very best in the world, such as those in Vancouver, Zurich or even Perth. We make detailed recommendations about the best way of establishing a dynamic, efficient, accountable public body to spend the annual $ 1. 2 billion budget. The new public transport agency would have a small staff, no more than 30 or so, selected from the best people in the world. It would also have a governing board that meets in public and shares information with the public. The agency would need to be established well before the franchises expire in 2008, so it could ‘hit the ground running’ when it takes over the operation of services. It would then be charged with upgrading, integrating and extending trains, trams and buses to world’s-best standards. We are presenting these proposals to the Victorian community and the state government for consideration <b>between</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> 30 <b>November</b> next year (the last day on which the government can give notice that it wants to extend the Yarra Trams and Connex franchises). In the meantime, we call on the government not to extend the franchises, so the community has a chance to have a say about putting the public interest back into public transport...|$|R
