60|$|Having a quiet hour <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> for Berne, I'll try to {{tell you}} what has happened, for some of it is very important, as you will see.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we must go, anyway, or the Major {{will be very}} disagreeable," [...] said Patsy. [...] "Good-bye, Myrtle; {{we shall}} see you again <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the train." ...|$|E
30|$|Proof. The {{proof is}} {{completely}} similar as that <b>before,</b> so <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> out the details.|$|R
6000|$|... "As you justly remark, Miss Worth," [...] he observed, [...] "this sort {{of thing}} has been done <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> will <b>leave</b> it there for the present. Will you come this way with me, if you please, Captain Granet? I won't trouble you, Miss Worth, or you, Sir Meyville. You might not like {{what we are going}} to see." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{could not}} talk of our {{plans for the}} future without being overheard by Job Lord, and this would have been, so I argued, in the highest degree dangerous, for there was yet the {{possibility}} he might succeed in making his escape <b>before</b> <b>we</b> could <b>leave</b> the town, in which case he would have us at a disadvantage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we must name {{this place}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> it," [...] said Anne, {{yielding}} to the indisputable logic of facts. [...] "Everybody suggest {{a name and}} we'll draw lots. Diana?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there more}} to say on this subject <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> it? On {{referring}} to your letter, I find you have raised one other point, which may be worth a moment's notice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right, Ebony, right. I am selfishly {{thinking}} only {{of myself}} at the present moment. But let us hope we may manage to do these poor Christians good <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the land." ...|$|E
5000|$|So it was {{the night}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were to <b>leave</b> to return to America. Mom was packing. And there had been talk about our {{passports}} and our papers weren't in order and, you know, there were issues. But {{everything was going to}} work out. It was going to be all right. And then the night <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were to <b>leave,</b> <b>we</b> were in the bedroom. Mom was packing. And my dad came in and said that's it. <b>We</b> weren't <b>leaving.</b> <b>We</b> were in Iran until we died. And we were in his country. We had to abide by his rules. And from then on, he was a completely different person. To me, that's when my daddy died. You know, he was, from that moment on, completely changed. Mahtob Mahmoody, November 29, 2015 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{not afraid}} of you," [...] said Phil, firmly. [...] "We've told you that <b>before.</b> <b>We</b> intend to <b>leave</b> you alone, and {{the best thing you}} can do is to leave us alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon you're about right; but at {{the same}} time, it stands us in hand to be ready if they should take it into their ugly heads to kick up a row. After we've made sure they're really gone I'll take two of the boys ashore an' bring off a cask of water. It's got to be done <b>before</b> <b>we</b> can <b>leave,</b> an' now's as good a time as any." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect that's so," [...] said Walthew thoughtfully. [...] "I wish I knew, because I {{must see}} Don Martin {{and make a}} trip to Rio Frio <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the coast for good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you're {{frightened of}} course I'll {{get out of}} the way," [...] Jake replied half angrily; [...] "but <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> this town I'll show you how much reason there is for being afraid." ...|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. Well, but <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> Mr. Badman's {{wife and}} children, I have a mind, if you please, to inquire {{a little more}} after one thing, the which I am sure you can satisfy me in.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a place," [...] {{answered}} Sir Andrew. [...] "Wulf, {{take him}} to it, and to-morrow, <b>before</b> he <b>leaves,</b> <b>we</b> will speak again. Till then, farewell, holy Nicholas." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Charley Hexam {{has gone}} to get a book or two he wants, and will {{probably}} be back <b>before</b> me. As <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> my house empty, I took the liberty of telling him I would leave the key here. Would you kindly allow me to do so?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Before</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>we</b> went in a {{body over}} the house, which looked desolate indeed. As the {{servants}} had all gone to Cornwall {{there had been no}} attempt at tidying-up; every room and passage in which we had worked, and all the stairways, were strewn with paper and waste, and marked with dirty feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't worry," [...] {{answered}} his twin. [...] "I guess we'll {{get enough of}} that <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> Colby Hall. Remember, you've got {{to learn how to}} drill, and march, and shoot at a target, and all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} what the risks are," [...] he answered. [...] "I do. Come and walk outside with me, Mr. Pratt. We have half an hour <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave.</b> My people were more than ordinarily punctual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{see how it}} is with me, Miles--feeble as an infant, {{and almost}} as troublesome. You must bear with me, for you will be my nurse. One promise I must have, dearest, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the evening}} Mr. Dusante {{came to me}} {{to say that he was}} very glad to find that the westward train would leave Ogden City early in the morning, so that he and his family would start on their journey some hours <b>before</b> <b>we</b> should <b>leave.</b> [...] "This suits my plans exactly," [...] he said. [...] "I have left the ginger-jar, {{securely}} wrapped, and addressed to Mrs. Lecks, with the clerk of the hotel, who will deliver it to-morrow immediately after my departure. All our preparations are made, and we purpose this evening to bid farewell to you and our other kind friends, from whom, I assure you, we are most deeply grieved to part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{prisoner}} {{will have}} to travel by coach, of course. You can travel with him, if you like, {{and put him in}} irons, and thus avert all chances of his escaping on the road. But"--and here Chauvelin made a long pause, which had the effect of holding his colleague's attention still more closely--"remember that we shall have his wife and one of his friends with us. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> finally <b>leave</b> Paris tomorrow <b>we</b> will explain to the prisoner that at the first attempt to escape on his part, at the slightest suspicion that he has tricked us for his own ends or is leading us into an ambush--at the slightest suspicion, I say--you, citizen Heron, will order his friend first, and then Marguerite Blakeney herself, to be summarily shot before his eyes." ...|$|R
40|$|Our most {{powerful}} tool is our liberal arts education,” said Cheetham, {{the daughter of}} 1974 and 1975 Connecticut College graduates Thomas and Joan Cheetham. “We’ve been taught to think critically about the very foundations of modern society: to question our actions and our ideas, and the thoughts and deeds of those who came <b>before</b> us. When <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> here today, our most immediate challenges may be renting that first apartment and getting that first job. But our biggest challenge is one we’ll face {{for the rest of}} our lives: to use our educations to chase our passions and cling to them for dear life. ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{looked at}} him gravely and sadly. [...] "I must speak to you privately, Mr. Keller. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the room, permit me to send for the nurse. You may safely trust her to perform the last sad duties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have {{at least}} the sympathy of many nations who are {{powerless}} to interfere," [...] Selingman said quietly. [...] "I read your pamphlet, Mr. Henriote, with very great interest. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> to-night, I shall make a proposal to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{not going}} to drink wine any more, dear. It's awful to think how-- I'll come to the store to-morrow and get you. I want you to pick out an {{automobile}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave.</b> That's {{all we need to}} buy here." ...|$|E
60|$|Of Lizzie, and {{her future}} career, {{something}} further {{must be said}} in the concluding chapters of this work. She has been our heroine, and we must see her through her immediate troubles <b>before</b> <b>we</b> can <b>leave</b> her; {{but it may be}} as well to mention here, that although many threats had been uttered against her, not only by Mr. Camperdown and the other attorneys, but even by the judge himself, no punishment at all was inflicted upon her in regard to her recusancy, nor was any attempt made to punish her. The affair was over, and men were glad to avoid the necessity of troubling themselves further with the business. It was said that a case would be got up with the view of proving that she had not been ill at all, and that the Scotch doctor would be subjected to the loss of his degree, or whatever privileges in the healing art belonged to him;--but nothing was done, and Lizzie triumphed in her success.|$|R
6000|$|Again {{there were}} {{preliminaries}} {{to be settled}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> could <b>leave</b> El-Wijh for the interior. Shaykh Mohammed Afnán had been marrying his son; and the tale of camels came in slowly enough. On the day after our return from El-Haurá the venerable old man paid us a visit aboard Sinnár. He declares {{that he was a}} boy when the Wahhábi occupied Meccah and El-Medínah--that is, in 1803-4. Yet he has wives and young children. His principal want is a pair of new eyes; and the train of thought is, [...] "I can't see when older men than myself can." [...] The same idea makes the African ever attribute his sickness and death to sorcery: [...] "Why should I lose life when all around me are alive?"--and this is the idea that lies at the bottom of all witch-persecution. Two pair of spectacles were duly despatched to him after our return to Cairo; and M. Lacaze there exhibited a capital sketch of the picturesque, white-bearded face, with the straight features and the nutcracker chin, deep buried in the folds of a huge red shawl.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{a falling}} {{out with the}} owners of Twisted Nerve and simply {{outgrowing}} the label, the band signed to EMI in October 2001. Commenting on leaving the label, Gorton revealed that [...] "it costs {{money to go to}} America and we just couldn't do {{what we wanted to do}} with Twisted Nerve. We didn't get ads, video's or big tours" [...] and that [...] "They don’t treat us with respect, they aren’t prepared to put up any money for anything. They always threatened to cancel the tour support just <b>before</b> <b>we</b> went away, <b>leaving</b> us in a shambles. They refuse to speak to us, yet when they do we are treated like kids". Label co-owner Damon Gough responded by attacking the band during an appearance in Manchester.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no draught," [...] Saton answered. [...] "You {{want the}} truth and you shall have it. See, there are five men present."--He counted rapidly with his forefinger. [...] "One {{of them will be}} dead <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True." [...] Fomar nodded. [...] "Well, perhaps we'll {{know the}} answer <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> here. What a strange situation! All our {{reasoning}} tells us that no life could exist; the whole planet burned dry, the atmosphere itself gone, completely poisoned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{asked my}} father that, and he said most likely by next Monday. He will want to give us all some {{instructions}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave.</b> And {{he wants us to}} read this book," [...] and Shep drew a small volume from his pocket.|$|E
6000|$|There {{remained}} {{work to do}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> could <b>leave</b> El-Muwaylah. The two Shaykhs, Alayán and Hasan el-Ukbi, were to be {{paid off}} end dismissed with due ceremony; provisions were to be brought from the fort to the cove; useless implements {{to be placed in}} store; mules to be embarked--no joke without a pier!--and last, but not least, the ballastless Mukhbir was to be despatched with a mail for Suez. The whole Expedition, except only the sick left at the fort, was now bound southwards. The Sayyid and our friend Furayj accepted formal invitations to accompany us: Bukhayt, my [...] "shadow," [...] with Husayn, chef and romancer-general, were shipped as their henchmen; and a score of soldiers and quarrymen represented the escort and the working-hands. Briefly, the Sinnár, though fretting her vitals out at the delay, was detained two days (March 19--20) in the Sharm Yáhárr. Amongst other things that consoled us for quitting the snug dock, was the total absence of fish. At this season the shoals leave the coast, and gather round their wonted spawning-grounds, the deep waters near the Sha'b ("reefs"), where they find luxuriant growths of seaweed, and where no ships disturb them.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} was {{appointed}} to leave Liverpool. It had been arranged that, <b>before</b> <b>leaving,</b> <b>we</b> should meet the ladies of the Negroes' Friend Society, an association formed {{at the time of}} the original antislavery agitation in England. We went in the carriage with our friends Mr. and Mrs. E. Cropper. On the way they were conversing upon the labors of Mrs. Chisholm, the celebrated female philanthropist, whose efforts for the benefit of emigrants are awakening a very general interest among all classes in England. They said there had been hesitation on the part of some good people, in regard to coöperating with her, because she is a Roman Catholic.|$|R
60|$|On {{the night}} <b>before</b> <b>we</b> were to <b>leave</b> Lesso, whence Ragnar had already gone, Athalbrand saw me staring at Iduna. This, indeed, was not wonderful, as I {{could not take}} my eyes from her lovely face, and {{when she looked at}} me and smiled with those red lips of hers I became like a silly bird that is bewitched by a snake. At first I thought that he was going to be angry, but {{suddenly}} some idea seemed to strike him so that he called my father, Thorvald, outside the house. Afterwards I was sent for, and found the two of them seated on a three-cornered, flat stone, talking in the moonlight, for it was summer-time, when everything looks blue at night and the sun and the moon ride in the sky together. Near by stood my mother, listening.|$|R
