5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including wall-mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Buzz impresses {{the other}} toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel left out. As Andy prepares {{for a family}} outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody {{attempts}} to trap Buzz <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk,</b> but ends up accidentally knocking him out a window, and the other toys rebel against Woody by accusing him of knocking Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody instead and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched {{a ride on the}} car as well, and fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to {{make their way to the}} restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck, where Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are salvaged by Andy's mischievous neighbor, Sid Phillips.|$|E
25|$|The studio set changed {{frequently}} – various themes {{included a}} treehouse (1995), a chip-van, a hair salon called On The Noggin (1999), No. 10 Celebrity Square, a UFO and a newsroom – the presenter {{tended to be}} sat <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> (or counter in the chip-van), with any puppets perched between desk and the locked-off studio camera.|$|E

Previous Nevada governors were also interviewed and they said that they felt it was necessary that they spent most of their time in the office.|$|E
500|$|During Amin's time in power, {{popular media}} outside of Uganda often portrayed {{him as an}} {{essentially}} comic and eccentric figure. In a 1977 assessment typical of the time, a Time magazine article described him as a [...] "killer and clown, big-hearted buffoon and strutting martinet". The comedy-variety series Saturday Night Live aired four Amin sketches between 1976–79, including {{one in which he}} was an ill-behaved houseguest in exile, and another in which he was a spokesman against venereal disease. In a Benny Hill show transmitted in January 1977, Hill portrayed Amin sitting <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> that featured a placard reading [...] "ME TARZAN, U GANDA".|$|E

[...] In the simulation, Lieutenant Saavik commands the starship [...] on a rescue mission {{to save the}} crew of the damaged ship Kobayashi Maru. When the Enterprise enters the Klingon Neutral Zone to reach the ship, it is attacked by Klingon cruisers and critically damaged. The simulation is a no-win scenario designed to test the character of Starfleet officers. Later, Dr. McCoy joins Kirk on his birthday; seeing Kirk in low spirits, the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command and not grow old <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E

50|$|The chancel has {{undergone}} {{the most dramatic}} changes over the years. Originally, it was only eight feet deep and a semi-circular platform extended {{into the body of}} the church. It had a raised central pulpit <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> reading <b>desk</b> and communion table.|$|R
2500|$|Chapman and Cleese also {{specialised}} in sketches {{where two}} characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects, {{such as in}} the [...] "cheese shop", the [...] "dead parrot" [...] sketch and [...] "Argument Clinic", where Cleese plays a stone-faced bureaucrat employed to sit <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> and engage people in pointless, trivial bickering. All of these roles were opposite Palin (who Cleese often claims is his favourite Python to work with)—the comic contrast between the towering Cleese's crazed aggression and the shorter Palin's shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese–Palin dynamic is reversed, as in [...] "Fish Licence", wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Felt {{was offered}} the command of all U.S. forces in the Pacific and Far East, and he jumped at the {{opportunity}} to avoid spending {{the rest of his}} career <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk.</b> Upon becoming commander in chief of Pacific Command on July 31, 1958, Felt immersed himself in the details of its operation, bombarding his staff with scribbled black pencil missives dubbed [...] "Feltgrams" [...] that invariably concluded, [...] "Advise me [...] What do you think? No? Why? Resp'y, F." [...] Although his job title was officially abbreviated as [...] "CINCPAC", he was informally nicknamed [...] "CINCFELT" [...] within the command, due to his larger-than-life personality. During his tenure as CINCPAC, Felt directed American military operations in three regional hotspots: Taiwan, Laos, and Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} defeat of the Confederates in New Mexico, General and Mrs. Canby were reassigned back East where Canby spent more than a year in bureaucratic service in Pennsylvania, New York, and Washington, D.C. {{sometimes}} as an unofficial administrative assistant to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. It was not until 1864 that Canby was allowed out from <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk,</b> and he and Mrs. Canby were sent to the Trans-Mississippi region, eventually finding a home in New Orleans where Louisa stayed while her husband supported the Union's impending defeat of Confederate forces, which happened to include the remnants of Sibley's brigade; although, by this time, Sibley himself had been court-martialed for dereliction of duty during the Battle of Bisland. (Relieved of his command, he had gone to Richmond, Virginia.) ...|$|E

2500|$|On 5 January 2013, a 53-minute {{video was}} {{released}} on YouTube in which al-Douri encouraged recent Sunni protests in Nineveh and Anbar provinces against Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, saying that [...] "the people of Iraq and all its nationalist and Islamic forces support you until the realization of your just demands for {{the fall of the}} Safavid-Persian alliance." [...] The message, which showed the Ba'athist leader sitting <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> with a small Saddam era flag on it, was partially broadcast on the Al Arabiya news channel. In the video, released just before the Iraqi Army Day on 6 January, Douri claimed to be somewhere in Iraq's Babil Province. However, former U.S intelligence officials believe it was filmed in Damascus, Syria. Hours after the tape was released, Iraqi military intelligence arrested Abdul Rahman Mohammed Ibrahim, the nephew of al-Douri, in Saladin Province.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} {{examples}} of parodies involving Hitler. Bing Crosby and the Andrew Sisters reference Hitler in the song, Hot Time in the Town of Berlin. [...] "Der Fuehrer's Face" [...] is an elaborate parody on Nazism created by musical comedian Spike Jones. It {{is one of his}} most well-known tunes. A novelty rap song entitled [...] "To Be or Not to Be (The Hitler Rap)" [...] performed by Mel Brooks is on the movie To Be or Not to Be's soundtrack album, but it was not in the movie itself. By typing Hitler Rap into YouTube, one can view the music video, a popular YouTube favorite. Mel Brooks dressed as Hitler sings from <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> while male dancers in pants, harnesses and SS caps made of black leather and female dancers in fishnet stockings dance wildly with each other around Hitler on a large dance floor with a checkerboard design.|$|E
2500|$|KRON's news {{operations}} were {{handled by the}} Chronicle until it launched its own news department in September 1957. It operated from a studio inside the Chronicle building at Fifth & Mission streets (the station's news department was located 30 feet from the Chronicle city desk). Appropriately for a station once owned by the Chronicle, KRON-TV {{has long been a}} very news-intensive station. it produced six daily newscasts at the time, including the Shell-sponsored 6 p.m. newscast Shell News, with Tom Franklin reporting from the studio at the Chronicle and in filmed field reports. Franklin began the broadcast standing next to a map of the San Francisco Bay Area, with lights illuminated on the map next to the various cities that the newscast was to feature stories from. Franklin anchored most of the program from <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> <b>desk</b> that had a large Shell logo next to a [...] "Tom Franklin" [...] name plate, with a Shell [...] "X-100" [...] oil can that sat atop the desk. Live segments were used for late bulletins from the Chronicle city desk or for local and regional stories not suitable for film treatment. Some of the stories covered by Shell News in 1957 included the end of the [...] "pedestrian scramble" [...] system at downtown San Francisco street intersections, the end of the San Francisco-Oakland Southern Pacific railroad passenger ferry and the final game of the San Francisco Seals baseball team (to be replaced by the San Francisco Giants in 1958). In the 1960s, KRON-TV had anchors Art Brown and Jerry Jensen (who later moved to KGO-TV), and Linda Richards, who wrote predicted temperatures backwards on sliding glass panels with maps drawn on them, for viewers to see the weather forecast. Ed Hart, and later Frank Dill, reported sports with a focus on only the area's professional teams. KRON's early morning news digests in the 1960s utilized sign language by Peter Wechsberg and Jane Norman.|$|E
