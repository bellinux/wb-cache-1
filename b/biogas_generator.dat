40|$|This work studies optimal {{flow control}} of a micro grid {{consisting}} of households equipped with μ-CHP devices and gas and heat buffers. Agricultural wastes from households are used to produce biogas by a <b>biogas</b> <b>generator.</b> The produced biogas is, then, utilized to fulfill local demand of heat {{and power of the}} households. Excess biogas can be upgraded and sold to the low pressure gas grid. Excess electricity produced by the μ- CHPs of households can be also sold to the electricity grid. The aim of the control process is to maximize the estimated profit of the households while avoiding overloading gas and electricity grids and avoiding the biogas shortage. The decisions on the supply and consumption levels are done in both centralized and distributed fashions using model predictive control (MPC). The distributed MPC (dMPC) is developed from the centralized MPC (cMPC) by employing dual decomposition method combined with the projected sub-gradient method. In dMPC, each household makes decisions based on its local information, yet still needs to coordinate its supply and consumption bids to the grid operators and the <b>biogas</b> <b>generator.</b> The coordinations are formulated for synchronous and asynchronous implementations. With the distributed scheme, the grid operators and the biogas producer can manage households’ supply and consumption levels via dynamic pricing to obey the grid capacity constraints. We perform extensive simulations to investigate the behavior of dynamic pricing modified by the grid operators and the <b>biogas</b> <b>generator.</b> Furthermore, we provide numerical results to compare the performance of cMPC, synchronous dMPC, and asynchronous dMPC using realistic estimates of the selling prices and demand patterns...|$|E

We compared many different biodigester systems to select the most efficient and economical design for The Fundacion Paraguaya. During the research and development phase, we addressed such cultural constraints as language barrier and budget, as well as ensured such a design met with expert approval from professionals in the chemical engineering field for its functionality. As a result of our research, we were able to successfully design a biodigester and provide a materials list as well as instructions on how to use and maintain it. The design consists of a series of storage tanks that serve as containers for the manure as it decomposes. The methane generated this way rises up during the decomposing process and is captured in a common holding container (a plastic bag). The chosen digester design is in the format of a continuous batch system. We chose this method because it allows the manure to sit for 30 days, the minimum time it takes to sanitize the slurry, as well as provides a continuous production of methane.

40|$|Increase {{of power}} demand and {{greenhouse}} gas emission from nonrenewable energy resources change the direction to use of renewable energy resources as micro grids. The solar and wind energy is free, infinite, and environment friendly. Due to the uncertain nature of renewable energy resources i. e. solar energy and wind energy, a system cannot depend entirely on single renewable energy resource. Therefore, a hybrid power system, with two or more renewable resources of energies is a better choice for isolated loads. In this thesis, feasibility of hybrid power system consisted of solar panel and wind turbine energy storages and <b>biogas</b> <b>generator</b> is studied for a virtual high-rise building. Two cases were studied in this thesis work i. e. case Tampere, Finland and case Colorado, United States of America. Solar irradiance and wind speed measurements are collected for year 2016 from these two places and then energy generation is calculated and compared with electrical load required by a virtual high-rise building. Each case {{is divided into three}} subcases and one year is divided into three quarters (i. e. January to April, May to August and September to December). Hybrid power systems based on renewable energy sources can be effective option to provide continuous energy supply to electrical loads in a high-rise building. In addition, an application is developed to calculate the payback time of the hybrid power system. Hybrid power system is based on renewable energy resources and so its CO 2 generation is also less than nonrenewable energy resources. As the duration of daytime and wind speed is different around the globe, there is difference in the behavior of hybrid power system in both case studies. The hybrid power system provides a very feasible solution for energy demands of high-rise building. Solar and wind energy has become the least expensive renewable energy technologies and requires one-time investment and need less maintenance cost in existence and has attract the interest of scientists and educators the world over.

The two cities have currently a contamination problem and biogas emerges as opportunity for both waste management and energy generation. There are approximately 274 500 tonnes/year of residue that can be used to produce biogas. This amount of residue can generate approximately 33, 500, 000 m 3 of biogas. The advantages and disadvantages of five different digester types (the smaller tubular digester, the fixed dome digester, the floating drum digester and the bigger German AEV digester and a Swedish digester) were investigated to see if they could be an option for use in Bolivia. The German AEV digester is better when compared to the Swedish unit from Flotech in case a larger biogas digester would be implemented. Among the smaller digesters, the tubular digester already has access to the necessary resources and knowledge, and they can be operated at a cheap price. The fixed dome digester and the floating drum digester are  not used in Bolivia at present, and there is no knowledge in the country about how to implement them.  There are technical, social and economic issues related to an eventual installation of a big digester in Bolivia including transportation logistics and costs, how to motivate the population to sort out the different residues, and also the state subvention of natural gas production that lowers the price of biogas required to make it competitive. To see if it is economically viable to build a functional <b>biogas</b> <b>generator</b> for this area, economic data were compared. The analysis shows that the fixed dome and floating drum digester are much better economic investment than the tube digester. The bigger digesters are economically viable without financial aid if there is a market for the by- product fertiliser in Bolivia.

40|$|Hotel {{sector is}} one of the main revenue earners in current Sri Lankan economy. This sector is rapidly growing post war period. Since {{tourists}} arrive Sri Lanka comes for diverse reasons hotels are located in all around the country to attracting these tourist groups and mostly this industry is located adjacent to environmentally sensitive places such as virgin forests, beaches and archeologically significant locations. Due to this number of protests and demonstrations also happened in certain places for opposing this industry expecting that there would be environmental damages sometime ago. Therefore, proper environmental management practices are of paramount importance. Waste disposal is one major area which needs to be addressed first and foremost. Waste generated in this industry can be divided into solid waste and waste water. Furthermore, solid waste can be divided into biodegradable and non degradable waste. Waste water is generated from the laundry, kitchen, toilet /bathroom cleaning etc. Some of the waste categories depend on the occupancy of the hotels and some depend on the reception functions which are held in hotels (ex. Kitchen waste generated after wedding functions etc). However, it is impossible to minimize this type of waste generation or to educate the guests on waste generated issues due to the nature of the industry and high competition in this sector. Therefore, best possible options remains are to have proper waste management system to run this industry in sustainable manner. If there is a way to reuse waste generated then there will not be much impact to the industry. Conversely Cleaner Production (CP) and Industrial Ecology (IE) principles are being used successfully in manufacturing sector for many years to address the waste generated in those industries. Hence in this research these two concepts are used in local hotel sector to manage waste generated. that shows that diesel and LP gas consumption can be reduced considerably. There are number of ways waste is reused in productive manner. Out of them energy harnessing from biogas generators are significant. The <b>biogas</b> <b>generator</b> which converts all biodegradable waste generated to useful flammable biogas Methane (CH 4). This gas is used completely as a fuel to pre-heat water which is used in steam boiler for laundry purposes thereby reduces diesel consumption for boiler firing considerably.

A pilot project is carrying out in one of the leading hotels in Kandy and preliminary studies were done with already established hotel which has bio gas generator in Uva province.

The study performs simulation and optimization to obtain a system design of a hybrid renewable energy system for application on the farm Desembarco del Granma in the Villa Clara province in the central part of Cuba, for three different cases of biomass availability. The energy resources considered are solar PV, biogas, and wind. A field study is carried out to evaluate the energy load and the biomass resource available for biogas production of the farm Desembarco del Granma, and the feasibility of biogas electrification is evaluated for the three different scenarios of biomass availability. The field study methodology includes semi structured interviews and participant observation for information collection. The farm Desembrero del Granma is estimated to have a scaled annual average electrical load of 264 kWh/day with peak load 26. 34 kW, while the scaled annual average deferrable load of the farm was estimated to be 76 kWh/day with a peak load 16 kW. The thermal load was find to consist primarily of energy for water heating and cooking. The thermal demand for cooking was estimate to be 4. 5 kWh per day, while the thermal load for water heating was not estimated. The thermal energy need for water heating is assumed to be provided for by solar thermal energy, and is not included in the energy system models of this study. For the modeling, the thermal demand for cooking is assumed to be provided by combustion of biogas. System simulation and optimization in regard to energy efficiency, economic viability and environmental impact is carried out by applying the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER) simulation and optimization software tool. For two of the biomass scenarios, the optimized energy systems received in HOMER were identical; hence only two biomass scenarios were analyzed. The first one represents the current biomass collected and the biogas production capacity of the farm (including the one not yet utilized), and the second one represents the amount of biomass available if the animals would be gathered in the same place all of the time. A PV-wind hybrid energy system with 100 kW PV installed capacity, 30 kW wind power installed capacity consisting of 10 wind turbines of the size 3 kW, a battery bank of 100 batteries (83. 4 Ah/ 24 V), and a 100 kW inverter is considered the most feasible solution for the current biomass scenario. For the increased biomass scenario, a PV-biogas hybrid energy system configuration of 5 kW PV installed capacity, a 60 kW <b>biogas</b> <b>generator,</b> and an inverter of the size 10 kW is considered the most feasible option. Biogas electrification is shown to not be economically feasible for the current biomass scenario during the conditions modeled in this study, but for the increased biomass scenario biogas electrification was shown to be a feasible option.

Polygeneration technology is being developed that can address all of these issues with a single system, by utilizing the exhaust heat from a <b>biogas</b> electricity <b>generator</b> to remove arsenic from water via membrane distillation and using excess biogas as a cooking fuel. History is full of stories of investment in developing countries gone horribly wrong. Thorough market research and analysis can help prevent that in the future. This thesis demonstrates the process of determining beneficial components of business models for the deployment of polygeneration technology in Bangladesh. This involves understanding the existing business models used for providing rural services in Bangladesh and assessing which of these models would be more sustainable for biogas based polygeneration systems within the socio-economic and institutional context of rural Bangladesh. This is achieved through the development of a set of sustainability indicators and an interview questionnaire for providers of rural services in Bangladesh, which was applied during a field study in early 2013. The sustainability indicator scores were calculated and analyzed in the context of strategic management tools, such as the Business Model Canvas. The combination of the quantitative and qualitative aspects of these case studies highlights crucial business model elements. Based on the results of the sustainability indicators for the field sites included in the study, community and cooperative business models provide a sustainable structure for the multiple products and inputs inherent in a polygeneration system.

The solar pump needs to have specifications that allow it to pump 2. 5 cubic meters per hour and at a great vertical height because the aquifer head is currently 70 meters below ground and declining. The reduced borehole water use, {{a result of a}} grey water system and low flow fixtures at the Centre, comes to about 25 - 28 m 3 per day. Therefore a pump with the above specifications is required. However, the upfront cost (anywhere from $ 2, 000 to $ 6, 000) (Alibaba. com, 2011) is likely to vii have a payback period of less than two years up to six years due to costs savings accomplished by eliminating the need for the diesel-powered pump, as $ 1, 200 per year is saved from diesel use reductions. The solar thermal water heating system has an upfront capital investment of approximately $ 15, 000 US. These systems, 220 liter tanks with 2. 3 m 2 solar arrays would be placed on the rooftops of the buildings that provide hot showers to both the visitors and the Centre Director’s home. There is not money saved on diesel use reduction in this case, as the current system contains solar flat plate collectors (many in disrepair) and wood-burning stoves. What is saved is the health and environmental hazard of burning wood from the surrounding land to fuel the current heaters. Energy The energy portion of this report evaluated several options for Mpala’s electricity system {{now and in the future}} in an attempt to find sensible solutions that will provide inexpensive and long lasting power to Mpala. The Research Centre management hopes to provide the current visitor capacity with reliable and adequate energy service, as well as scale the system up to provide a larger number of guests in the future. Thus Mpala, with its new system should be able to support the entire additional load. For this reason, in all our analyses, we considered double the current power load at Mpala. The following is an outline of the approach we took to solve the issues at Mpala, and the steps we took to complete our analysis. The existing system at Mpala is an off-grid power system that is powered primarily by diesel generators and includes a small portion of solar PV and hydro-power. The Mpala Research Centre (MRC) itself meets its load with solar PV, two diesel generators and batteries, whereas the Ranch uses hydro power from a turbine, back-up generators and very little solar PV. There are many issues with the current system. In general, the power supply is intermittent and not sufficient to meet the entire load. The population at the Centre and the Ranch is expected to increase in the next few years due to the growing popularity of the Research Centre and Conservancy, The system is not well monitored and thus there are large amount of inefficiencies. At MRC, the generators consume diesel to power the entire area. This is especially problematic due to the growing prices of diesel. The batteries are also not managed to the optimal efficiency, and therefore have to be replaced from time to time. viii At the Ranch, the turbine is not consistently in working condition and will have to be replaced. Also, in recent years the Ewaso Ngiro river to which the turbine is fixed has been running dry for almost half the year. Our initial approach was to track down all the inefficiencies in the current system and as a first step we performed a thorough energy audit of the Ranch and Centre during our stay in Mpala. The results of the energy audit showed us the most energy consuming buildings and the most problematic areas in the system. Once the problem areas were spotted, we took a two pronged approach to solve the issues at Mpala, namely o Reduce power load - make the current system more efficient. o Renewable sources – use more renewable sources to meet the new, more efficient system with less power load. Our first approach was to analyze the consumption of energy by the existing lighting throughout the Centre. We evaluated different products available and found that LED light bulbs provided the most economic and energy efficient solution over time. For our second approach, we analyzed all of the renewable sources available at Mpala and picked only the ones that are most useful for Mpala’s electricity system. Among wind, hydro, solar and biogas, we concluded that everything except wind has great potential for the system at Mpala. The next step was to use these sources to meet the newly reduced load. To do this, we used a simulation software program namely HOMER to compare the various systems that could be made for Mpala with the renewable sources available at Mpala. HOMER stands for Hybrid Optimization of Electric Renewables and is a tool provided by National Renewable Energy Labs, Department of Energy of the United States. It is an excellent tool that can {{be used to}} analyze, simulate and optimize various combinations of off-grid hybrid renewable energy systems and is used all over the world. The scenarios explored and analyzed using HOMER could be broadly divided into those that use transmission lines, and those that are independent of transmission lines. With transmission lines, the scenarios explored include different hybrid systems which utilize several forms of renewable energy sources, as well as some diesel, that provide security and options for Mpala. While at first glance, the use of transmission lines appears to provide more stability and security to the system, we will show how this might not be the case for Mpala. Due to the ix extensive existence of wildlife at Mpala, which presents a risk to both the equipment and the animals, using underground transmission is the only viable option. However, using an underground transmission system can prove to be 5 - 10 times more expensive and more difficult to lay and maintain. According the Kenya Electricity Transmission Board, underground transmission lines also last only for half as long as compared to regular transmission lines. For Mpala, we estimate that these lines will have to be replaced at least eight times if laid underground over a period of 100 years. For our analysis however, we assumed that these lines will not be replaced and will last for all 100 years. Despite this assumption, the upfront costs and operational costs are high for a transmission system. The cost for transmission was calculated using a $ 20, 000 cost/km and the actual distance was found using UTM coordinates. We analyzed a total of six scenarios for both overhead and underground transmission. They are o All in one – uses all renewable sources and some diesel o Only Solar PV o Solar PV and backup generators o Only Hydropower o Hydropower and backup <b>generators</b> o Only <b>Biogas</b> Each of these scenarios was then compared to the existing system at Mpala. The results for each of these scenarios are indicated with error bars to account for the above stated assumption that transmission lines will not last for all 100 years without replacement. We next moved on to analyzing systems that do not use transmission. The most obvious sources for these being solar and biogas energy. The HOMER results for Solar and Biogas showed that Biogas is the cheaper option due to which a more detailed study of the Biogas system was performed. The biogas scenario was designed such that it will use a separate system for MRC and a separate system for the Ranch. Each of these systems will contain a biogas digester to process the dung to <b>biogas</b> and a <b>generator</b> to produce electricity from biogas. The dung is obtained from the ‘bomas’ at Mpala, the place where cattle are housed at night. This system will require the use of trucks to carry the dung from the boma to the MRC and Ranch generator sites. x Due to Mpala’s more than 2, 000 heads of cattle and six bomas, there is a large potential for biogas. From our analysis, we found that using just one boma could power the entire MRC and Ranch. A complete ‘use phase analysis’ was performed to estimate the total carbon dioxide emissions reduced in the process of using biogas as fuel. The major savings were from the elimination of diesel at MRC and from the diversion of dung from undergoing anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion of dung will produce methane which according to the IPCC fourth assessment report, has a Global Warming Potential that is 25 times that of carbon dioxide when evaluated over a period of 100 years (Forster et al., 2007). Using biogas without transmission could provide very cheap electricity and the upfront costs (which are also low) could be recovered within 1. 5 years due to cheap operating costs. In the process, it will also have a total emissions savings that are as high as 15, 400 kg/year. If Mpala decides to power the villages also with biogas, these emission savings will greatly increase and thus Mpala could look into potential funding using the Clean Development Mechanism, but Mpala would need to create a development mechanism similar to what we discuss in our Behavior and Education section. However, CDM was outside the scope of our analysis and only briefly mentioned here. Our team will also discuss the costs and benefits of each of these systems and show how using scenarios that do not use transmission or considering other ways of energy storage can prove to be cheaper and more reliable for Mpala. The system, the existing or the new one, cannot function to its best ability if it is not understood by the people operating the system and by those who are benefiting from it. Education is thus a very important component of the new system to come. Education could be in the form of training local personnel to work the systems and teaching the people using the system to run their own. We have touched upon these options briefly and taken examples of some previous good work that we thought would be suitable for Mpala. This masters project group hopes this work can be used to improve the systems at Mpala, but also be considered as potential energy and water systems in surrounding communities in the region. Our goal was to propose the most feasible and affordable methods to provide selfsustaining, long-lasting resource systems in Kenya. ...|$|R
