Two literary groups were established, the Faisalabad Union of Column Writers and Faisalabad Union of Journalists, to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> printed media personalities for the purpose of providing training to budding writers from the city.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable {{effort was made to}} <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Planning {{for digital}} {{terrestrial}} television in Australia {{can be traced back}} to 1993, when a group of specialists was drawn from the then-Australian Broadcasting Authority, Department of Transport and Communications, in addition to broadcasters and manufacturers. The ABA Specialist Group was intended to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> studies taking place in a number of Australian forums and investigate potential options and policies relating to digital television.|$|E

5|$|Cromwell's programme, {{assisted}} by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, {{was not merely}} against the clergy {{and the power of}} Rome. He persuaded Henry that safety from political alliances that Rome might attempt to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> lay in negotiations with the German Lutheran princes. There also seemed to be a possibility that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E
5|$|His staff {{searched for}} volunteers in the Unteroffiziersschulen (non-commissioned {{officers}} schools) and supplementary units. They {{were able to}} <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from the threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 the University of Art and Design Helsinki {{founded the}} Institute of Design Leadership and Management and {{established}} an international training program. The International Design Management Conference was {{organized in the}} same year by them.

5|$|In 1998, Cornell University Medical College's {{affiliate}} hospital, New York Hospital, {{merged with}} Presbyterian Hospital (the affiliate hospital for Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons). The combined institution operates today as NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. Despite the clinical alliance, {{the faculty and}} instructional functions of the Cornell and Columbia units remain distinct and independent. Multiple fellowships and clinical programs have merged, however, and the institutions are continuing {{in their efforts to}} <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> departments, which could enhance academic efforts, reduce costs, and increase public recognition. All hospitals in the NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System are affiliated with one of the two colleges.|$|E
5|$|Nixon is {{assigned}} to General Leslie Groves (Brian Donlevy), who is placed {{in charge of the}} project. Groves has to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> the scientific, industrial and defense communities to build the atomic bomb. In 1945, following the death of Roosevelt, the new president, Harry S. Truman (Art Baker), continues to support the atomic project, now moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. When refined uranium-235 is obtained, the first atomic bomb is built and tested successfully in the New Mexico desert. Facing stiff resistance in the Pacific War, Truman orders the use of the atomic bomb against Japan in July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} United Nations headquarters, the Swiss Confederation is host to many UN agencies, like the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and about 200 other {{international}} organisations, including the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization. The annual {{meetings of the}} World Economic Forum in Davos <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> top international business and political leaders from Switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world, including health and the environment.

5|$|Limousins {{ability to}} adapt to {{different}} environments contributed greatly to the breed's current success outside France. In most cases, Limousin bulls or their semen are now imported to improve locally bred Limousins. Today, the breed is present in about 70 countries around the world, and in all latitudes ranging from Finland in the north to South Africa in the south. Limousin breeders' associations exist {{in many of these}} countries, of which 29 are members of the International Limousin Council (ILC). The ILC was founded at Limoges in 1973 by Louis de Neuville, the Limousin breed ambassador. In 1989, EUROLIM was formed to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> all of the herd books of European Limousins.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer brought {{together}} intellectuals {{at the height}} of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including Freeman Dyson, and the duo of Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of parity non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as T. S. Eliot and George F. Kennan. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{years after}} their defeat, with Roman {{dominance}} of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Camerinum in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War. With this success in hand they managed to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome, {{all of whom were}} probably keen to prevent any one faction dominating the entire region. The army that faced the Romans at the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC included Samnites, Gauls, Etruscans and Umbrians. When the Roman army won a convincing victory over these combined forces it must have become clear that little could prevent Roman dominance of Italy and in the Battle of Populonia (282 BC) Rome destroyed the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} conceived by Jun Maeda, who also wrote the screenplay and composed {{some of the}} music, with original character design by Na-Ga. Both Maeda and Na-Ga are from the visual novel brand Key, and Charlotte is the second original anime series created by Key following Angel Beats! in 2010. Maeda had thought up the concept for Charlotte long before he was approached in early 2012 to work on another anime series after Angel Beats!. Maeda narrowed down the number of main characters compared to Angel Beats! and attempted to put more of a focus on their behavior. Instead of employing the same staff that had worked on Angel Beats!, the aim for Charlotte was to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> a staff that would add a new variety to the creative process to prevent being influenced by the work done on Angel Beats!.|$|E
5|$|According to Schafer, Brütal Legend {{had been}} in {{development}} since 2007, prior to the completion of Psychonauts. Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E

5|$|In the primary, Rhea {{achieved}} {{a plurality of}} the votes, but not a majority. Chandler had the next highest vote total, and the two faced {{each other in a}} run-off on September 7, 1935. In the run-off, Chandler defeated Rhea, securing the nomination for governor. President Roosevelt, not wanting Democratic factionalism to cost him votes in the 1936 presidential election, attempted to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> the Laffoon and Chandler factions, but to little avail. Laffoon and Rhea, along with most of Laffoon's administration, bolted the party and supported Republican nominee King Swope. Despite losing the support of his predecessor, Chandler {{went on to win the}} general election. In his last days in office, Laffoon issued pardons for Denhardt and others charged in connection with the National Guard's interference with the primary in Harlan County. These were among a record 560 pardons issued by Laffoon, most of which were to relieve prison crowding.|$|E
5|$|On September 13, 2012, {{long time}} Tory MHA and former cabinet {{minister}} Tom Osborne {{announced he was}} leaving the PC Party to sit as an independent. He cited Dunderdale's leadership {{as the reason for}} his defection and said that the turning point for him was the debate over Bill 29. Osborne said that while he voted in favour of the new legislation he did not support it. On October 19, 2012, Dunderdale shuffled her cabinet and Justice Minister Felix Collins, who was responsible for Bill 29, was shuffled out of the Justice portfolio and became Minister of Intergovernmental and Aboriginal Affairs. Though the portfolio change was considered to be a demotion Dunderdale stated that Collins' handling of Bill 29 was not connected to his move. At the time of the cabinet shuffle Dunderdale also created the Office of Public Engagement, which will <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> different departments to aid in communications efforts. The new office will also be responsible for access to information.|$|E
5|$|Porter was {{interested}} in reforming the sport of horse racing, and expended much effort in the newspaper trying to <b>bring</b> <b>together</b> horsemen in the {{various parts of the}} country. Although the effort did not bear fruit, the Spirit became a repository for information of interest to those involved in horse racing, printing statistics and results of races. Porter was also involved in attempts to publish an American stud book for race horses in the United States, similar to the General Stud Book that was published in England documenting the pedigrees of Thoroughbred horses. In February 1837, Porter announced in the Spirit the projected coverage of the project, which was to be edited by Wiley Jones Stratton, who was secretary to the National Jockey Club in Washington, D. C. But this project never materialized, and Porter turned to Patrick Nesbitt Edgar in January 1838 to take over the project. But Edgar did not finish the work, and by 1842, the project was abandoned.|$|E
