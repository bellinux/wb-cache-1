Workers and larvae can be infected by parasites; examined workers were seen with late-stage pupae of an unidentified parasite in their thoraces. In some nests of the green-head ant, some myrmecophilous insects such as the beetle Chlamydopsis longipes are sometimes seen living inside colonies.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow's {{breeding}} season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus {{has been recorded}} breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its {{breeding season}}, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in <b>black</b> <b>kite</b> nests, {{taking advantage of the}} territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest.|$|E

25|$|Other raptors, {{large and}} small, are often {{outright}} dominated by golden eagles. In Eurasia, the relative paucity of mid-sized Buteo species {{is thought to}} be due to the radiation of large Aquila eagles that already occupied the large raptor niche and outcompeted them. In North America, where there are no Aquila eagles other than the golden eagle, Buteo species are more diverse with at least 3 large hawks (the red-tailed, Swainson's (Buteo swainsoni) and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis)) that occur in similar habitats and sometimes eat similar prey as both each other and golden eagles. On occasion, golden eagles will kleptoparasitize or even predate these three Buteos. Other small to medium-sized diurnal raptors are known to occasionally be hunted by golden eagles, including ospreys (Pandion haliaetus), <b>black</b> <b>kite</b> (Milvus migrans), hen harriers (Circus cyaneus), Eurasian sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus), Cooper's hawks (Accipter cooperii), northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus), common buzzards (Buteo buteo), long-legged buzzards (Buteo rufinus), upland buzzards (Buteo hemilasius), rough-legged buzzards, Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), American kestrels (Falco sparverius), merlins (Falco columbarius), prairie falcons and gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus). Occasionally, golden eagles may even boldly predate these smaller species during migration in mid-flight, as was recorded at Hawk Mountain Sanctuary with a red-shouldered hawk. It is thought that on rare occasions, more nimble, smaller raptors like rough-legged buzzards and harriers can kleptoparatisize golden eagles. Interestingly, northern goshawks in Scandinavia rely on grouse to about the same extent as golden eagles there and even hunt in similar forest edge habitats there. However, the goshawks primarily hunt neonatal and fledgling grouse (30% and 53% of their take of grouse) rather than adult grouse (17% of their prey) in late summer when grouse dominate other birds in their diet, whereas the eagles seem to mainly adult grouse and hunt them aseasonally. Similarly, hen harriers may become somewhat specialized at taking young red grouse, whereas the eagles are more likely to take adults.|$|E
40|$|Differences {{in visual}} {{capabilities}} {{are known to}} reflect differences in foraging behaviour even among closely related species. Among birds, the foraging of diurnal raptors {{is assumed to be}} guided mainly by vision but their foraging tactics include both scavenging upon immobile prey and the aerial pursuit of highly mobile prey. We studied how visual capabilities differ between two diurnal raptor species of similar size: Harris's hawks, Parabuteo unicinctus, which take mobile prey, and <b>black</b> <b>kites,</b> Milvus migrans, which are primarily carrion eaters. We measured visual acuity, foveal characteristics and visual fields in both species. Visual acuity was determined using a behavioural training technique; foveal characteristics were determined using ultra-high resolution spectraldomain optical coherence tomography (OCT); and visual field parameters were determined using an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique. We found that these two raptors differ in their visual capacities. Harris's hawks have a visual acuity slightly higher than that of <b>black</b> <b>kites.</b> Among the five Harris's hawks tested, individuals with higher estimated visual acuity made more horizontal head movements before making a decision. This may reflect an increase in the use of monocular vision. Harris's hawks have two foveas (one central and one temporal), while <b>black</b> <b>kites</b> have only one central fovea and a temporal area. <b>Black</b> <b>kites</b> have a wider visual field than Harris's hawks. This may facilitate the detection of conspecifics when they are scavenging. These differences in the visual capabilities of these two raptors may reflect differences in the perceptual demands of their foraging behaviours...|$|R

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>kites</b> {{are most}} often seen gliding and soaring on {{thermals}} as they search for food. The flight is buoyant and the bird glides with ease, changing directions easily. They will swoop down with their legs lowered to snatch small live prey, fish, household refuse and carrion, for which behaviour they are known in British military slang as the shite-hawk. They are opportunist hunters and {{have been known to}} take birds, bats, and rodents. They are attracted to smoke and fires, where they seek escaping prey. This behaviour has led to Australian native beliefs that kites spread fires by picking up burning twigs and dropping them on dry grass. The Indian populations are well adapted to living in cities and are found in densely populated areas. Large numbers may be seen soaring in thermals over cities. In some places, they will readily swoop and snatch food held by humans. <b>Black</b> <b>kites</b> in Spain prey on nestling waterfowl especially during summer to feed their young. Predation of nests of other pairs of <b>black</b> <b>kites</b> has also been noted. Kites have also been seen to tear and carry away the nests of baya weavers in an attempt to obtain eggs or chicks.|$|R

500|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} reaches {{breeding}} maturity {{within a year}} from hatching, and typically builds its nest in a cavity in an old tree or rock face.

500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, <b>black</b> <b>kite,</b> red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

2500|$|In the Iberian peninsula, the Eurasian eagle-owl {{is part of}} {{a complex}} guild of predators that have evolved to survive mostly on European rabbits. Among this guild, golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) were {{recorded}} per one study to rely on rabbits for 40% of the diet, the eagle-owl for 49% of the diet, the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) for 50% of the diet, the Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) [...] for 61% of the diet and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) for 79% of the diet. Elsewhere, the Spanish imperial eagle and eagle-owl are considered to outflank the golden and even the Bonelli’s eagle as the most specialized avian predator of rabbits in the Iberian region. Other predators, such as common buzzard (Buteo buteo), [...] northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) <b>black</b> <b>kite</b> (Milvus migrans) Iberian wildcat (Felis silvestris tartessia), red fox, stone marten (Martes foina) and introduced Egyptian mongoose also prey heavily on rabbits in Spain, but are more generalized and less reliant than the above predators. All these powerful predators do not generally compete directly for food but conflicts may ensue over the rights to territories and nesting sites amongst the birds. Being nocturnal in activity, however, the Eurasian eagle-owl does not tend to compete as directly as do the three eagle species and even these are discreetly segregated by habitat preferences, the goldens preferring open, steep cliffs, the Bonelli's favoring densely vegetated areas mixed with rocky spots and the imperial favoring relatively flat open woodlands. Among these eagles, the golden eagle tends to have the most similar habitat preferences to the Eurasian eagle-owl and across a broad band of overlapping distribution, the two are considered nearly ecological equivalents by day and night. However, good-sized female golden eagles are up to twice as heavy as an average eagle-owl, so seem to have a considerable advantage in size and power. Conversely, to support their large size and large territory needs, the golden eagle cannot survive on small and diverse prey nearly as successfully as the eagle-owl. Among the Iberian peninsula rabbit-eating guild, the species with wider ranges, the eagle-owl and the golden and Bonelli's eagles, have had some degree of success living off of alternate prey following the devastation of the rabbit population due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease. The two rabbit predators endemic to Iberia, the Iberian lynx and Spanish imperial eagle, have been devastated by the reduction and other causes and both are threatened species today.|$|E
