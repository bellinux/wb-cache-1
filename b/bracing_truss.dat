5000|$|The Capita Centre is {{rectangular}} (with varying {{floor plans}} {{as there is}} a diagonal light shaft through the building) and consists of 34 levels, with a total floor area of 24450 m² sq ft. The building is constructed of composite structural steel and concrete, with its support structures making it unique as it wears its structure on the outside as an outer skeleton. The external columns or lateral <b>bracing</b> <b>truss</b> are unique because they exist outside the core of the building. This building’s design is discussed in detail by Harry Seidler in a 1993 lecture (synchronised with illustrations nos 13-24) recorded by UK architectural journalist Monica Pidgeon whose film archive is available online. www.pidgeondigital.com ...|$|E
5000|$|Frame {{designs are}} the most {{significant}} element of this simple device. For the most part wheels have changed very little since the 19th century. The early English machines (as opposed to the American versions), such as Edwards, Kendrick, Brown, Boggs, and Ranalah, etc., had cast iron frames. These wheels, made during the 19th Century, had Babbitt metal plain bearings, making them difficult to push and pull the metal through when operated at high pressures. Later, when ball bearings came into use, the machines became more suitable for hard and thick material, such as 1/8” steel. Despite the advantages of cast iron, it has {{less than half the}} stiffness (Young's modulus) of steel and sometimes must be replaced by steel when a stiffer frame is needed. Steel frames made of solid flame-cut plate, or frames built-up of cut-and-welded plates, are common designs. Steel tubing, generally of square section, has been used for wheeling machine frames during the past 30 years, in the US particularly, where sheet metal shaping has become a hobby as well as a business. Tube-framed machines are reasonably-priced and are available either as kit-built machines or can be built easily from plans. The stiffest tubular frames have a fully triangulated external <b>bracing</b> <b>truss.</b> They are most effective on thinner or softer materials, such as 20 ga steel or [...]063" [...] aluminum. Cast frame machines, like the one pictured, are still available.|$|E
50|$|The arch <b>brace</b> <b>truss</b> is made {{by adding}} two braces between the rafters and collar. This puts the collar and the braces in tension.|$|R
50|$|Lacking a tie beam, the arch-braced (arched <b>brace)</b> <b>truss</b> gives a {{more open}} look to the {{interior}} of the roof. The principal rafters are linked by a collar beam supported by a pair of arch braces, which stiffen the structure and help to transmit the weight of the roof down through the principal rafters to the supporting wall. A double arch <b>braced</b> <b>truss</b> has a second pair of arched braces lower down, from the rafter to a block or inner sill: This form is called a wagon, cradle, barrel or tunnel roof because of this cylindrical appearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} built using Credit Valley and Indiana limestone. The roof is {{supported}} by arch <b>braced</b> <b>trusses</b> and beams made of dark stained British Columbia fir. It originally featured two windows near the entrance depicting the patrons of the church, Thomas Aquinas and John Henry Newman.|$|R
50|$|Hammer beam trusses {{can have}} a single hammerbeam or {{multiple}} hammerbeams. A false hammerbeam roof (truss) has two definitions: 1) There is no hammer post on the hammer beam as sometimes found in a type of arch <b>brace</b> <b>truss</b> or; 2)The hammer beam joins into the hammer post instead of the hammer post landing on the hammer beam.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper level}} {{classrooms}} {{at the ends}} of the east and west wings feature timber arched <b>braced</b> <b>trusses</b> springing from semi-circular impost blocks, diagonally boarded timber ceilings with exposed rafters, and timber cornices with quatrefoil motifs. The four classrooms either side of the Great hall on the upper floor and several on the ground floor have sheeted ceilings with dark timber coverstrips.|$|R
25|$|Straight or curved {{one-dimensional}} elements {{with physical}} properties such as axial, bending, and torsional stiffnesses. This type of element {{is suitable for}} modeling cables, <b>braces,</b> <b>trusses,</b> beams, stiffeners, grids and frames. Straight elements usually have two nodes, one at each end, while curved elements will need at least three nodes including the end-nodes. The elements are positioned at the centroidal axis of the actual members.|$|R
50|$|A steel {{detailer}} is {{a person}} who produces detailed drawings for steel fabricators and steel erectors. The detailer prepares detailed plans, drawings and other documents for the manufacture and erection of steel members (columns, beams, <b>braces,</b> <b>trusses,</b> stairs, handrails, joists, metal decking, etc.) used in the construction of buildings, bridges, industrial plants, and nonbuilding structures. A steel detailer's projects are usually commercial, residential, public, industrial or municipal; low-rise residential projects..|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the church has an open roof structure consisting of arched <b>brace</b> <b>trusses</b> with the ceiling lined in unpainted, stained diagonal timber boarding. Timbers used in the construction and furnishings of the church, such as cedar, are now rare or irreplaceable. Timber fittings include the pews, rails, pulpit and altar. Stained glass windows {{are located in the}} gabled sections in the north and south walls and the apse.|$|R
5000|$|The AC was {{conceived}} in mid-1916, being {{derived from the}} Type N via the unbuilt Type U. It differed from earlier single-seat Morane-Saulnier aircraft in that it had ailerons for lateral control rather than wing warping, and because of its rigid wing bracing, with a wire <b>braced</b> <b>truss</b> of steel tubes supporting the wings from below. [...] It appeared in autumn of that year, and {{was found to be}} aerodynamically clean.|$|R
50|$|The 38-story {{structure}} {{combines a}} steel moment frame and a steel and reinforced concrete core for lateral stiffness. The concrete core shear walls {{extend up to}} the 17th floor, and diagonal core <b>bracing</b> (shear <b>trusses)</b> extends to the 29th floor.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the church has an open roof structure consisting of arched <b>brace</b> <b>trusses</b> with the ceiling lined in painted, diagonal timber boarding and acoustic tiles. The walls are lined in hardboard that has an ashlar-like profile and has a timber panelled dado. A pair of automatic, glass and timber framed doors separate the porch from the nave. The nave is carpeted, has a central aisle and recent timber pews. The choir and organ {{are located in the}} chancel, along with the pulpit, baptismal font, communion table, carved timber memorial chairs, war memorial boards and flags. The organ pipes are centrally located {{at the back of the}} chancel and are covered with a timber grille.|$|R
2500|$|Early European truss bridges used {{king post}} and queen post configurations. Some early German bridges {{included}} diagonal panel <b>bracing</b> in <b>trusses</b> with parallel {{top and bottom}} chords. [...] To {{solve the problem of}} deterioration of the wood upon exposure to weather, various forms of covering came to be employed.|$|R
5000|$|Internally, {{the church}} has {{rendered}} walls, arched <b>braced</b> <b>trusses</b> supported by corbels, and raked boarded timber ceilings with roses to the central section. A large pointed arch with expressed extrados and drip mould opens to the chancel, which houses a large ornate pipe organ, in front {{of which is a}} raised pulpit. Many of the lancets contain stained glass or leadlight panels. The entrance vestibules and narthex have encaustic tiled floors, and three pointed arches separate the narthex and the nave. These arches have timber screens, with the side arches containing doors. A partitioned [...] "crying room" [...] has been constructed in the centre of the narthex, with a viewing panel inserted into the timber screen of the centre arch. The church contains a number of commemorative plaques, including First and Second World War memorials.|$|R
5000|$|The underframes {{consisted}} of a heavy assembly of steel sections, with angle used to form <b>bracing</b> <b>trusses.</b> These were placed close to the centre line of the vehicle rather than beneath the solebars, as was characteristic of previous vehicles. The original bogies were a double bolster type, which like the carriages mounted upon them, were designated [...] "BR Mark 1" [...] (BR1 for short). These proved unsatisfactory and a new cast-steel design was introduced from 1958 (often {{referred to as the}} Commonwealth type). This gave a superb ride with minimal tyre wear, but was heavy. The final batches of locomotive hauled Mk1s, and many Mk1 EMU vehicles, were built with the Swindon-designed B4 bogie. Later on, many BR1 bogied vehicles were retrofitted with the B4 bogie, and a comfortable ride could then be relied on, as was evident in the later EMU vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the church has an open timbered ceiling lined with diagonally laid boards that have been painted in an ochre colour. At each fifth rafter there are arch <b>braced,</b> scissor <b>trusses</b> that are tied at eaves level by metal rods. Each arched brace continues below {{the line of the}} clerestory and lands on a timber post. A second line of arches runs perpendicular to the roof trusses between the aisle posts {{along the length of the}} side aisles. These slender, pointed timber arches spring from moulded capitals on the aisle posts. The side aisle rafters also have arched bracing members in keeping with the <b>truss</b> <b>bracing.</b> The wide, gently pointed chancel arch springs from a timber moulding that runs around the sanctuary, forming a sill to the eastern windows.|$|R
50|$|Most early saltboxes, as {{with many}} other types of New England colonial houses, are timber-frame. Timber framing, or post-and-beam construction, {{involves}} joining large pieces of wood with woodworking joints, such as mortise-and-tenon joints, or with wooden pegs, <b>braces,</b> or <b>trusses.</b> Metal nails were sparingly used. The exterior of a saltbox was often finished with clapboard or other wooden siding. The Josiah Day House in West Springfield, Massachusetts is constructed of brick.|$|R
40|$|A {{sequence}} of ground shakings occurred from October, 1831 to March, 1832 in Central Italy. Due {{to the high}} intensity and the repetition of the events, the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, Assisi was damaged severely, suffering {{the collapse of the}} vaults of central and left naves. After the first emergency interventions, engineer-architect Luigi Poletti (1792 - 1869) was appointed to design the retrofitting and restoration works. From an architectural point of view the works carried out by Poletti were rather respectful, but from a structural point of view they introduced interesting innovations. Contrary to the collapsed construction, Poletti rebuilt the roof over the central nave with an original raised tie beam and iron <b>braced</b> <b>truss,</b> not resting on the below vault, while the vault had now a tapered transversal section. Poletti's solution are considered from a structural point of view, performing numerical simulations by means of limit analysis and finite element models, with reference to his original drawings, to previous and following earthquake damages, and to contemporary technical literature. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} and ornamental parts are built of Bath Stone, the exterior {{being of the}} Grit Stone of the neighbourhood. The clerestoriel nave of five bays is approximately 50 feet in height, 56 feet long and 50 feet wide. The arcades are of cylindrical columns rising to pointed arches. The windows are in the Geometrical Decorated style. The roof is a unique forest of wind <b>bracing</b> wooden <b>trusses.</b> The chancel roof consists of scissors-beam trusses.|$|R
50|$|The overall span {{measures}} 115 ft, {{carrying a}} 15.58 ft wide roadway. In cluding the approach spans, the bridge has a total length of 191 ft. The bridge rests on stone piers and abutments, with timber pile piers and abutments supporting the timber stringer approach spans. The bridge deck is timber, laid {{perpendicular to the}} span. The bridge features decorative cresting and lattice lateral <b>bracing.</b> The <b>truss</b> uses rigid horizontal and vertical members and rod bracing for the diagonals.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the damage {{regionalization}} and localization in the suspension Tsing Ma Bridge deck using modal data. The steel bridge deck is a continuous structure between anchorages through welding connections of 96 deck units, each generally 18 m long, 41 m wide and 7. 5 m high. The deck section adopts a double-deck box with truss stiffening and non-structural edge fairing. Covered with orthotropic deck plates, two 7. 2 m deep longitudinal trusses spaced at 26 m centres support the carriageways to provide bending stiffness. Vierendeel cross-frames, 4. 5 m apart, are supported on longitudinal diagonally <b>braced</b> <b>trusses</b> to carry the railways, and longitudinal central vents are provided in {{the upper and lower}} deck to enhance stability. Plane diagonal bracing spans the upper and lower vents and acts with the orthotropic plates to provide lateral stiffness. As about ten thousand of structural members are involved in the bridge deck, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a specific damaged member from a one-stage identification scheme by taking all structural members as design variables. In this study, a two-stage identification method is proposed and implemented using simulation data for damage detection of the Tsing Ma Bridge deck...|$|R
50|$|In 1946, {{work began}} at the {{direction}} of the French military government for the design, the construction of a temporary bridge. A combined single-track railway and road bridge was built parallel to the old bridge and 28 m upstream of it. The main stream was crossed by six spans of twin <b>braced</b> <b>trusses</b> with the railway running on the lower truss. The main span, which was closest to the Worms bank, had a length of 48.6 m and the remaining five spans had a total length of 61.2 m. The general clearance of the spans was 7.42 m, while the clearance of the main span was 7.5 m. The superstructure was supported on truss piers built on pile caps on top of steel piles. Part of the approach bridge was rebuilt to connect with the new bridge. It was composed of eight spans, each 24.0 m long. The superstructure consisted of a 1.7 m-thick plate girder beneath the tracks. The bridge was opened on 15 October 1948. After the completion of the Nibelung Bridge (Nibelungenbrücke) for road traffic in 1953, the bridge was used only by the railway.|$|R
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen protruding from the walls. The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched <b>braced</b> wooden <b>trusses.</b> The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{parts of}} the present {{building}} date from c. 1230 and include the chapel and solar (with barrel vaulted timber roof) and undercroft (northwest wing) and the southeast wing, originally the kitchens and servants' quarters. The great hall is a substantial room of 44 by 20 ft and is divided into five bays by <b>braced</b> collar-beam <b>trusses</b> in the walls at the side. Other similar trusses are hidden above the bedroom ceilings. These bedrooms have original fireplaces connected to mid-level chimney stacks.|$|R

5000|$|The timber {{roof was}} {{revealed}} when a later plaster ceiling was removed. [...] This {{dates from the}} 15th century and {{is a combination of}} arch <b>braced</b> <b>trusses</b> with cambered tie beams. Oak panelled galleries dating from around 1705 are over the west end and the south aisle, the former containing the organ, and the latter box pews. A carved oak crest dated 1622 is near the communion rail. The stone font is dated 1890 and the oak pulpit is also from the 19th century. [...] On the walls are wall memorials. The brass candelabrum, dated 1708, is the oldest in any church in Cheshire. [...] The stained glass in the east window dates from 1921, and was designed by Horatio Walter Lonsdale. There are monuments in the church dated 1715, 1801, and 1836. [...] The organ was built in 1851 by Richard Jackson and was rebuilt around 1900 by A. Young, and again in 1972 by L. Reeves. [...] There is a ring of six bells, four of which by are Richard Sanders and date from 1709. The other two bells are dated 1858 and were cast by G. Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. [...] The parish registers begin in 1613 and the churchwardens' accounts from 1812.|$|R
50|$|Truss Bridge #155 is a {{camelback}} truss bridge, 160 {{feet long}} and dividedinto eight panels, with the two trusses joined by a system of portal,lateral, and sway <b>braces.</b> The <b>truss</b> system ispin-joined.

The remains of theearthen base and timber support for the central pier of an earlierbridge may be seen below the bridge.|$|R
40|$|Node-to-segment {{formulations}} {{are widely}} used for solving problems involving contact between multiple solid bodies. An essential aspect of these formulations is ensuring the transition of the contacting node from one segment to the next. However, node-to-segment formulations are prone to numerical issues such as problems with convergence due to sudden changes in the contact force during such transitions. Most approaches in the literature utilize ad hoc techniques to resolve such issues, primarily by defining different special cases for different situations. ^ In this study, a penalty-based formulation is used, {{in conjunction with a}} smoothed contact constraint, to overcome the numerical issues associated with such transitions. Further, to avoid ill-conditioning due to hard contact between multiple segments, a softening parameter is used to regularize the contact constraint. The proposed approach eliminates the need to distinguish between different special cases of node-to-segment contact and enables the use of a single formulation. In particular, problems involving contact between components of reticulated structures, modeled as a network of planar truss elements, are studied. These include contact between elements of a <b>braced</b> <b>truss</b> and the indentation and sliding of a cellular material with a lattice micro-structure. The performance of this approach, in terms of the error in contact enforcement, restoring forces, and the computational effort required, is studied with numerical examples of different types of non-smooth contact problems. ...|$|R
50|$|An {{even more}} {{impressive}} residence on palatial scale was Raglan Castle. The earliest building is the freestanding hexagonal great tower, which {{is surrounded by a}} moat. It was probably built by Sir William ap Thomas before 1445. It would have served the function of a strongly defended tower house. This was followed in 1461-69 by the enlargement of the castle by Sir William Herbert with a gatehouse to the NE and to the SW a range of sumptuously decorated state apartments. Further apartment ranges were built round the SW court. The two sets of apartments were approached by an impressive main staircase. From about 1549 to 1559 these buildings were extended, by William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester, particularly around the Pitched Stone Court and also with the long-gallery with its elaborately decorated Renaissance fireplaces. The slighting of the castle in the English Civil War and its subsequent partial demolition make it hard to appreciate Raglan as one of the major domestic buildings of Wales. Another early house connected with the Herbert family was Tretower Court in Breconshire. It was here that William Herbert settled his step brother Roger Vaughan who built a house, which was to develop round a courtyard and continued being added to until the 17th century. Recently the arched <b>braced</b> <b>truss</b> roof of the great hall has been dated by Dendrochronology to c. 1455.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} winter storm events during early Janu y, 1999 {{resulted}} in significant accumulations of precipitation {{in many areas}} of New York State. Several agricultural structures failed {{as a result of the}} excessive snow load. Many of these were post-frame buildings constructed to house dairy cattle. A field investigation was conducted with the objective of evaluating why the buildings failed. A total of seven buildings were evaluated and are presented in this paper. Most buildings failed because of insufficient <b>bracing</b> of <b>truss</b> members. In all instances, buildings that had been repaired or replaced exhibited insufficient bracing and/or inadequate structural connections...|$|R
50|$|These {{ships were}} {{constructed}} of wood in traditional shipbuilding fashion, although iron <b>braces</b> and <b>trussed</b> {{were used for}} increased longitudinal strength. They were armed with a traditional arrangement of broadside, smoothbore muzzle-loading guns, and in common with contemporary Royal Navy practice for small ships, these guns were carronades (with {{the exception of a}} pair of small long guns on the focsle as chasers). Twenty 32-pounder carronades were mounted on the upper deck and a further six 18-pounder carronades were placed on the quarterdeck. The sail plan was an entirely conventional ship rig, and they were complemented with 175 men and boys.|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{building}} is not well documented, {{although the majority of}} the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century wooden building. The current front wall was added in the 16th century. It {{has been used as a}} merchant's house and possibly a shop and school. It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings, hence the title Tribunal, however there is no evidence this ever occurred. One of the ground floor rooms still has the window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era. The front room upstairs has an arched <b>braced,</b> wooden, <b>truss</b> roof.|$|R
50|$|According to Severud Associates, the {{structural}} engineering consultants, {{it was the}} first tall building to use high strength bolted connections, the first tall building to combine a braced frame with a moment frame, one of the first tall buildings to use a vertical <b>truss</b> <b>bracing</b> system and the first tall building to employ a composite steel and concrete lateral frame.|$|R
50|$|The church {{interior}} is impressive; the nave {{is separated from}} the aisles by octagonal columns supporting pointed arches. The nave is spanned by timber <b>braced</b> <b>trusses</b> with a king post and quatrefoil motifs to the haunches (the part of the arch between {{the top of the}} arch and the supporting pier); an ornamental timber fretwork truss/arch is centred over the chancel. Simpler scissor trusses run the length of the aisles. The diagonally boarded timber ceiling with exposed rafters is finished with a timber frieze with quatrefoil motifs. The side walls have diamond-glazed coloured-glass edged tracery windows, with smaller half-lights over the doors. Above the altar is a large stained glass window depicting the Resurrection of Jesus. The pointed arched doors are timber-framed and boarded. The chancel contains a richly carved Gothic-inspired Oamaru stone altar which sits on a stepped marble base bounded by a marble balustrade with brass gates. Less elaborate marble altars are located at the ends of the aisles. A stepped timber choir and organ loft is located {{at the other end of}} the church; it is supported by two colonnettes (thin columns), and is accessed by stone spiral stairs enclosed by a rendered brick wall. The loft balustrade is carved with quatrefoils, and has a continuous fretwork music stand at handrail level. The organ has richly carved timber surrounds. A timber-panelled reconciliation room is located to the north-eastern corner. The church also contains some fine furnishings including cedar pews decorated with gothic motifs and fretwork, a marble baptismal font, and an ornamental holy water stand.|$|R
