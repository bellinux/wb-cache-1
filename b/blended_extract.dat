The subject of {{the research}} is hardwood sulfate pulp produced by OJSC “Mondi Syktyvkar” – the largest paper producer in Russia. Three different pulp samples were investigated: • Pulp sample 1 – unbleached sulphate pulp after cooking: • Pulp sample 2 – sulphate pulp after the first bleaching stage (hydrogen peroxide in acid medium as a bleaching agent) : • Pulp sample 3 – sulphate pulp after the second bleaching stage (hydrogen peroxide in alkali medium as a bleaching agent). Sample 1 came directly from “Mondi Syktyvkar”, samples 2 and 3 were produced in the laboratory of Chemical Department, Syktyvkar Forest Institute. The pulp samples were further analyzed by different methods: extractive substances content were determined, aldehyde groups content was found by a photocolorimetric method, Kappa number was determined by permanganate index, and finally electron microscopy of the three samples was done. Further, residual lignin extraction from sulphate pulp was conducted, and the lignin samples obtained were conducted by ÑÍ 3 ÑÎÎÍ-Í 2 Î – ZnCl 2 <b>blend.</b> <b>Extracted</b> residual lignin was estimated by Komarov’s method, the amount of carboxyl groups in lignin was determined by potentiometry method, lignin molecular weight was calculated by cryoscopy method. Finally, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods were used to analyze extracted lignin spectrum. During the bleaching process, the lignin content of the pulp decreased from 16 to 9 Kappa units. Also, {{a reduction in the}} amount of aldehyde group was observed after the second bleaching stage compared to the first stage. Komarov’s method showed that residual lignin content decreased from 6 to 4 % for unbleached and bleached pulp (after I bleaching stage) respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{proposed}} predictive {{format for}} the ten-sile compliance, Db(t), of polymer blends {{is based on}} (1) a two-parameter equivalent box model (EBM) and (2) calcu-lations of the phase continuity of components in blends by using modified equations of the percolation theory. The input data encompass (1) selected parameters characterizing the creep of parent polymers and (2) critical volume frac-tions v 1 cr and v 2 cr of constituents in blends (delimiting the interval of phase cocontinuity). To describe the effects of time and stress on tensile compliance, a routinely used em-pirical equation was found suitable. Parameters characteriz-ing the creep of parent polymers and their <b>blends</b> were <b>extracted</b> from generalized dependencies obtained through the superposition of time dependencies of tensile compli-ance assessed {{for a series of}} applied stresses and recon-structed with regard to the strain-induced free-volume ex-pansion.

The comparison of experimental and calculated compliance de-pendencies shows that the proposed format plausibly pre-dicts the blend creep behavior over the studied interval of 0. 1 – 10, 000 min. The upswing in blend compliance after a long period of creeping is attributed to the redistribution of stresses acting on the constituents {{in the course of the}} creep under a constant load.

Speaking in the preface to the quarto of 1737 of the correspondence he reprinted from what he calls the surreptitious editions, he says [...] "for the chasms in it, we had not the means to supply them, the author having destroyed too many letters to preserve a series." [...] He intends us to infer that the selection was not his own, though the passage is virtually an admission that the collection of P. T. was the collection deposited with Lord Oxford, or there could not have been such an identity between them as that none of the gaps in the P. T. volume could be filled up from the bound book in the Oxford library. [...] "Nor," [...] he continues, [...] "would he go about to amend them, except by the omission of some passages improper, or at least impertinent to be divulged to the public, or of such entire letters as were either not his, or not approved of by him." [...] He would have us believe that they had been dragged before the world in their first crude state, without a single subsequent touch from his pen, though he had previously amended them with studious care--had culled the best passages, <b>blended</b> <b>extracts</b> from two or three letters into one, and constantly corrected composition which had been originally laboured. Some of his ambitious epistles, like his letter to Arbuthnot of July 26, 1734, were no doubt mere essays, which were only written when they were committed to the press. In the quarto of 1741, he repeated the device he had employed in the quarto of 1737. He pretended in both cases that the correspondence he printed himself had been printed by others without his knowledge, and in defiance of his wish. He next adopted and republished the letters he affected to repudiate, and having already revised them to the uttermost, asserted that he could not be induced to revise them at all. So completely had truth with him been swallowed up in vanity. [...] "Had he," [...] he tells us in the preface to the quarto of 1737, [...] "sat down with a design to draw his own picture, he could not have done it so truly, for whoever sits for it, whether to himself or another, will inevitably find his features more composed than his appear in these letters; but if an author's hand, like a painter's, be more distinguishable in a slight sketch than a finished picture, this very carelessness will make them the better known from such counterfeits as have been, and may be, imputed to him."

The objective {{in this study}} was to determine if the antiproliferative effects are mediated, in part, through the activation of AMPK signalling and inhibition of its downstream targets, lipogenesis and mTORC 1 complex. By increasing the phosphorylation of AMPK in CWR 22 Rv 1 and PC 3 prostate cancer cell lines, Zyflamend decreased de novo lipid biosynthesis by decreasing the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and the expressions of fatty acid synthase and SREBP- 1 c, with a concomitant up regulation of fatty acid oxidation. In addition, via AMPK, Zyflamend inhibited the activity of mTORC 1 complex by directly phosphorylating raptor. Treatment with AICAR (activator of AMPK), siRNA knockdown, pharmacological inhibition, and overexpression of AMPK were used to confirm the up regulation of AMPK by Zyflamend.

The results obtained exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of protein denaturation by both extracts, the 1 : 1 blend as well as the reference drug. The EC 50 for extracts as well as those for the blend and the reference drug were determined by the dose-response curve using Graphpad Prism 5. 0 software...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{emissions}} {{have been}} shown to elicit a variety of toxicological effects, and alternative fuels (i. e., biodiesel) are currently being assessed to determine their ability to reduce the risks of adverse health effects. Exhaust emissions were generated using ULSD and biodiesel <b>blended</b> fuels and <b>extracts</b> of diesel PM (i. e., filters and PUFs) were separated into polar aromatic and non-polar neutral compounds. Mutagenic activity was assessed using the Salmonella mutagenicity assay, and Ah-receptor agonism was assessed using the DRCALUX assay. Results indicate that organic extracts of diesel/biodiesel particles contain direct- and indirect-acting polar aromatic mutagens as well as polar and non-polar Ah-receptor agonists. The mutagenicity of direct-acting compounds decreases with increasing concentrations of biodiesel in the fuel; however, there is no change in the indirect-acting mutagenicity. Furthermore, the ability of polar and non-polar compounds to induce the Ah-receptor increases with increasing concentrations of biodiesel in the fuel. These results provide an initial framework for evaluating the toxicological hazards of biodiesel emissions...|$|R
40|$|In {{relation}} to future energy demand and fossil fuel crisis particularly in India, biomass is gaining its importance for possible utilization as co-fuel. This study focuses {{the use of}} „low temperature biomass char ‟ instead of raw biomass in the <b>blends</b> to <b>extract</b> some specific advantages like lowering of grinding energy, intensification of heat energy, proper adjustment of „VM and fuel ratio ‟ etc. In the present investigation corn cob char and saw dust char were examined for their possible use in co-combustion with a typical high ash Indian coal. Combustion behaviour of different binary blends of „coal and biomass chars ‟ were examined in detail {{with the help of}} simultaneous DSC/TGA (Differential Scanning Calorimetry/Thermogravimetric Analyser) instrument. Characteristic combustion parameters of parent coal, biomass char and their blends were compared. Kinetic parameters for the combustion of all the blend samples were evaluated in the defined burning zone. Deviation of the experimentally observed burning rate curves from theoretically evaluated rate pattern for all the blends have been shown in this paper and synergistic effects of co-combustion were highlighted which signifies improvement of reactivity. Lowering of activation energy in major combustion zone was also observed for the coal / biomass char blends in most of the cases. On overall basis, this study reflects the improvement of combustion performance with the increase in proportion of biomass char. As a matter of fact such study helps in the process of the identification potential blend-combination and selection of blend proportion to derive som...|$|R
40|$|Background: Isolated fucoidans from brown marine algae {{have been}} shown to have a range of immune-modulating effects. This {{exploratory}} study aimed to determine whether a seaweed nutrient complex containing a <b>blend</b> of <b>extracts</b> from three different species of brown algae plus nutrients is safe to administer and has biological potential as an immune modulator. The study was undertaken as an open-label combined Phase I and II study. Methods: Participants (n = 10) were randomized to receive the study medication at either a 100 mg (n = 5) or 1000 mg (n = 5) dose over 4 weeks. The primary outcome measurement was in vivo changes in lymphocyte subsets. The secondary outcome measures were ex vivo changes in T-lymphocyte (CD 4 and CD 8) activation, phagocytosis of granulocytes and monocytes, T helper 1 /T helper 2 cytokines, and serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity. Results: The preparation was found to be safe over the 4 weeks at both doses tested. There were no clinically relevant changes to blood measurements of hemopoietic, hepatic, or renal function. Immunomodulatory measurements showed no dose response between the two doses. The combined results from the two doses demonstrated a significant increase in cytotoxic T cell numbers and phagocytic capacity in monocytes, and a significant decrease in levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6. A separate analysis of the 100 mg dose (n = 5) alone showed a significant linear component over time (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) for phagocytosis by both granulocytes and monocytes. Conclusion: The seaweed nutrient complex was safe to use when taken orally over 4 weeks. The preparation was demonstrated to have potential as an immune modulator, and this bioactivity deserves further exploration...|$|R
40|$|Zingiber officinale and Sygzium aromaticum {{are well}} known and widely used herbs, which {{possesses}} health promoting properties {{as well as several}} other interesting bioactive constituents. The use of flavonoids and other natural antioxidants, as a therapeutic option, is found desirable and increasingly being practiced. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the anti-inflammatory effects of ethanolic extracts of Zingiber officinale and Sygzium aromaticum and a 1 : 1 blend of the two extracts against the denaturation of protein in vitro. The test extracts of varying concentrations were incubated with egg albumin under controlled experimental conditions and subjected to determination of absorbance to assess the anti-inflammatory property. A standard anti-inflammatory drug, Ibuprofen, was used as reference drug. The results obtained exhibited a concentration- dependent inhibition of protein (albumin) denaturation by both extracts, including the 1 : 1 <b>blend</b> of the <b>extracts.</b> From the present findings it can be concluded that both Zingiber officinale and Sygzium aromaticum possessed marked anti-inflammatory effect against the denaturation of protein, in vitro; with Zingiber officinale extract being more effectiv...|$|R
