Oleic acid injections effected a severe lung injury predominately in the dependent lung regions, increasing venous admixture from 6 ± 1 to 54 ± 8 % (p < 0. 05), and reducing dynamic respiratory system compliance from 19 ± 0 to 12 ± 2 ml/cmH 2 O (p < 0. 05). A two to fivefold increase in sound transfer function amplitude was seen in the dependent (p < 0. 05) and lateral (p < 0. 05) lung regions; no change occurred in the nondependent areas. High within-subject correlations were found between the changes in dependent lung sound transmission and venous admixture (r = 0. 82 ± 0. 07; range 0. 74 0. 90) and dynamic compliance (r =- 0. 87 ± 0. 05;- 0. 80 - 0. 93).

The correlations between <b>broadband</b> <b>sound</b> pressure <b>signals</b> and <b>broadband</b> turbulence signals along the jet axis and the shear layer are calculated. The normalized correlations {{are found to be}} significant between the pressure emitted in the downstream direction and centreline flow quantities. They are much smaller in the cases involving flow quantities along the shear layer, and fall for large emission angles. The maximum correlations obtained between centreline turbulence and downstream sound pressure are observed just {{at the end of the}} potential core for time delays corresponding to the times of propagation evaluated along ray paths. They also appear to be lower as the Mach number is reduced, and to be enhanced as the Reynolds number is decreased. These correlation levels can reasonably be attributed to the noise source which is predominant at small emission angles. This source is therefore located on the jet centreline at the end of the potential core, in a flow region which is shown to be characterized by a dominant Strouhal number over a large axial distance, by a strong level of intermittency, and by a high convection velocity. This supports the contention that the downstream jet-noise component is connected to the periodic and intermittent intrusion of vortical structures into the jet core...|$|R

Four groups of alewives were subjected to different frequencies of sounds ranging from 110 to 150 kHz at sound pressure levels (SPLs, given in decibels (dB) in reference to 1 mu Pa) ranging from 125 to 180 dB. Each group of 20 or 25 fish was tested in a cage that was suspended in a flooded rock quarry. During the day, alewives schooled and strongly avoided pulsed tones (500 ms pulses, 1, 000 ms apart) of 110 and 125 kHz at or above 175 dB, a continuous tone of 125 kHz at 172 dB, and pulsed <b>broadband</b> <b>sound</b> between 117 and 133 kHz at or above 157 dB.

40|$|This study {{primarily}} {{investigated the}} flow and aeroacoustics {{associated with the}} slat of a three-element aerofoil in approach conditions. The study assessed importance of several factors and examined their aerodynamic impacts. The factors investigated were aerofoil incidence, slat angle, slat cusp geometry, fixing transition and blowing in the slat cove. A combination of experimental and computational techniques investigated the factors selected. The experimental work employed PIV, pressure tap, a force balance, flush mounted microphones and an acoustic array. The computational work used DES along with the FW-H acoustic analogy to obtain the far-field directivity. Tonal features occurred at high incidence and originated at the slat trailing edge, due to the blunt trailing edge and gap, and at the reattachment point. Fixing transition removes the tone at the reattachment point and reduces the slat gap tone at the trailing edge but does not remove the tone generated by the blunt trailing edge. All of the tones found, only occurred at certain slat and wing settings. <b>Broadband</b> <b>sound</b> was present in all conditions but had a strong dependence on the incidence of the wing. The sound was loudest with the wing at ? = 5 o with a reduction as the wing incidence was increased. The <b>broadband</b> <b>sound</b> also reduced as the slat angel decreased from ?S = 23 o.
