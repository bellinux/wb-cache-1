5|$|Polygon is an American {{video game}} website that publishes news, culture, reviews, and videos. At its October 2012 launch as Vox Media's third property, Polygon sought to {{distinguish}} itself from competitors <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{stories of the}} people behind the games instead of the games themselves. They also produced long-form magazine-style feature articles, invested in video content, and chose to let their review scores be updated as the game changed.|$|E

His closest competitor, Ivory Williams, received a ban for marijuana usage, leaving Chambers as a strong favourite. He was the fastest in all rounds of World 60m competition and surged ahead of Mike Rodgers in the final to win his first world title {{with a time of}} 6.48seconds. Banned from the 2010 Commonwealth Games, he set his sights on making the team for the 2010 European Athletics Championships.|$|E
5|$|Development started <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game's hardware. The staff first debated {{what type}} of monitor to use: black and white or color. They {{reasoned}} that using advanced technology would better establish them as good designers and chose a color monitor. The developers estimated that the game would require 4colors, but instead chose hardware that could display each pixel in 16colors. At the time, the designers believed {{that was more than}} they would ever need for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|E

5|$|In January 1654, the anti-Polish {{alliance}} of Pereiaslav was concluded between the rebellious Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Alexis of Russia, {{who was in}} control of a well-equipped army that was undergoing modernization. In 1654, when Charles X Gustav succeeded his cousin Christina on the Swedish throne, Russian forces were advancing into the unprotected Commonwealth, and <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northeast these drew close to the Swedish sphere of interest at the Baltic coast. Seeing the great success on the Russian side, Sweden also decided to intervene, among other reasons using the explanation that it was to protect the Protestant population in Poland. Having a close relationships with the Prince of Transylvania, Sweden had intentions to defeat the Catholic Poland. Sweden also drew the rising Cossack Hetmanate to its side that stood in the strong opposition to the Polish government and promised military support if the Cossacks will break with the Russians. Bohdan Khmelnytsky sent an expedition headed by the Kiev colonel to Halychyna which soon turned back due to mutiny within its ranks. The leader of Hetmanate {{did not participate in}} actions due to poor health conditions.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{initially}} {{began their}} wartime operations <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> activities {{of immigrants and}} carrying out border security, but quickly widened their operations. Unlike during the Boer War, the mounted police at first were forbidden to volunteer for military duty abroad, {{and the size of}} the force was instead temporarily increased to 1,200 men. The force investigated rumours of conspiracies associated with the Central Powers, but, since most mounted police did not have links within the relevant ethnic communities, they instead used secret agents and informants to gather intelligence, supported by a few undercover officers. Meanwhile, tensions grew between temperance campaigners and soldiers over the implementation of the liquor laws. The police barracks in Calgary were attacked in October 1916 by a crowd of over two hundred soldiers and civilians, who were trying to release six soldiers arrested for alcohol offences. The building was destroyed, one police officer was shot and several more injured.|$|E
5|$|The version by Aiken {{is perhaps}} the best known stage adaptation, {{released}} {{just a few months}} after the novel was published. This six-act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own, without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece. Most of Aiken's dialogue is lifted verbatim from Stowe's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer, George C. Howard. Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage. This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film. <b>By</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stark and desperate situations of his characters, Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences. By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe's novel, Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery.|$|E

25|$|Intellectualization: A form of isolation; {{concentrating on}} the {{intellectual}} components of a situation so as to distance oneself from the associated anxiety-provoking emotions; separation of emotion from ideas; thinking about wishes in formal, affectively bland terms and not acting on them; avoiding unacceptable emotions <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intellectual aspects (isolation, rationalization, ritual, undoing, compensation, and magical thinking).|$|E
25|$|BPR {{seeks to}} help {{companies}} radically restructure their organizations <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground-up design {{of their business}} processes.

Re-engineering emphasized a holistic focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full-scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes.|$|E

25|$|<b>By</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> comic {{aspects of}} the Home Guard in a cosy south coast setting, the TV series {{distorted}} the popular perception of the organisation.

Accounts from Home Guard members and their regimental publications, inspired Norman Longmate's history The Real Dad's Army (1974).|$|E
25|$|The {{second reason}} {{has to do}} with precedent. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court upheld the {{constitutionality}} and validity of several land laws. Invalidating the California Alien Land Law would have required overturning these decisions – something that the Court is typically loath to do, especially so shortly after the decision dates. In this case, the Court was able to address the unfairness of the application of the law <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> petitioners’ first contention, and effectively ignore the broader implications.|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} then {{assigned}} to Judge David Andrew Pine, who heard the steel companies' motions for a preliminary injunction. From a tactical perspective, both sides {{focused on the}} wrong issues: In its papers, the government stressed the ultimate constitutional issue of whether the President {{had the power to}} seize the mills; the steel companies appeared to be shying away from that issue <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> equities and asking the Court merely to enjoin the federal government from entering into a collective bargaining agreement with the Steelworkers.|$|E

25|$|Contrasting {{research}} {{finds that}} strategies to regulate and control emotions, {{in order to}} enhance resilience, allows for better outcomes in the event of mental illness. While initial studies of resilience originated with developmental scientists studying children in high-risk environments, a study on 230 adults diagnosed with depression and anxiety that emphasized emotional regulation, showed that it contributed to resilience in patients. These strategies focused on planning, positively reappraising events, and reducing rumination helped in maintaining a healthy continuity. Patients with improved resilience were found to yield better treatment outcomes than patients with non-resilience focused treatment plans, providing potential information for supporting evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions that may better handle mental disorders <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aspect of psychological resilience.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{highlights}} {{a particularly}} challenging arena for knowledge governance, <b>by</b> <b>focussing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{issues associated with}} large-scale R&D programmes of 'open innovation'. The chapter develops a theoretical framework for analysing these governance challenges <b>by</b> <b>focussing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interplay between the knowledge processes and inter-organizational relationships involved. This framework is subsequently applied to a casestudy of a major open innovation programme, namely, a major interfirm research programme sponsored by the European Union (EU) in the aerospace sector. Analysis of this case suggests that the stability and fit of governance mechanisms may be less important than their ability {{to adapt to the}} dynamics of the innovation process, and particularly to shifts between the open and closed networks which offer very different routes to appropriating value from that process...|$|R

25|$|Based on the {{philosophy}} {{used by the}} U.S. military to boost its own size in response to World War II — that an army can be built faster <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> training on its leadership rather than enlisted men — CMATT has pursued a similar strategy of focusing recruitment and training on commissioned and non-commissioned officers for the remaining 23 Iraqi battalions. Upon successful completion of officer training, these groups of officers will form the battalion's leadership cadre, which will then be responsible for overseeing its own recruitment, training, and readiness of its enlisted men. It is hoped that having the Iraqi leadership train its own will overcome problems faced by CAATT's training process; namely recruitment, desertion, and unit loyalty.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. Early reading {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes {{all the words}} the child has been exposed to and their meanings. <b>By</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> principle of linking specific sounds and characters, the child {{has the ability to}} recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E
25|$|Creating Shared Value: Creating Shared Value (CSV) is a {{business}} concept intended to encourage businesses to create economic and social value simultaneously <b>by</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> social issues that {{they are capable of}} addressing. In 2006, Nestlé adopted the CSV approach, focusing on three areas– nutrition, water and rural development– as these are core to their business activities.
