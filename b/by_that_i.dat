500|$|On draft day, Phillips {{made good}} on his promise not to draft Taylor and the Saints instead {{selected}} Heisman Trophy-winning halfback George Rogers with the first pick, leaving the Giants with the decision of whether to select Taylor. To the raucous approval of the crowd in attendance at the draft (which was held in New York City), the Giants selected him. Privately, Taylor was hesitant about playing for New York as {{he had hoped to}} be drafted by the Dallas Cowboys, and was unimpressed with a tour of Giants Stadium he was taken on, after the draft. Publicly, however, he expressed excitement about the opportunity to play in the city. Taylor changed his stance after he was drafted as Harry Carson made a point to reach out to him, and Taylor said he [...] "talked to some players and coaches" [...] and [...] "got things straightened out." [...] One of the factors that the Giants said they considered in selecting Taylor was his solid reputation. [...] "He was the cleanest player in the draft. <b>By</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mean there was no rap on him", said head coach Ray Perkins. [...] "Great potential as a linebacker, a fine young man, free of injuries." [...] Taylor chose to wear number 56 because he was a fan of Cowboys linebacker Thomas Henderson. As it would turn out, Taylor would have the longer and more successful career while Rogers, although successful in his own right with several 1,000-yard rushing seasons and two Pro Bowl selections, was injury-prone and forced to retire following the 1987 season with the Washington Redskins.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{positive}} assessments, [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] {{produced more}} variety within critical opinion. In his [...] "commendable" [...] 8.6 {{out of ten}} rating review, Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters—from Lana's apparent self-consciousness, to Cheryl's eccentric and [...] "odd" [...] persona, and Krieger's past. Ultimately, Bonaime professed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor; [...] "'Space Race, Part II' doesn’t {{have some of the}} big laughs that the first part featured. <b>By</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana’s puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast." [...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. [...] "Archer ended its third season tonight with the conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'. And, man, from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants, you knew you were in for a solid ending." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming of Nefarious {{was started}} in 2007, marking Nolot's film debut. The initial plan {{was to create a}} short film, but the project was {{expanded}} when Exodus Cry realized the scope of the issue they were documenting. Nolot, a leader in Mike Bickle's International House of Prayer, travelled to 19 countries to collect material for the film. These filming locations included countries in the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Asia. Nolot attested to having found it difficult to produce the film due to the subject matter; he stated that [...] "there is not a day that goes <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not mindful of the horrific tragedies we uncovered." [...] He further said that he did not make the film for money or for fame but did so in order to rouse people to action against human trafficking, an issue that he feels to be of great importance. Nolot said {{that the purpose of the}} film is [...] "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in terms of what they can be doing … to take a stand against this injustice." [...] Steve Willis and Matthew Dickey were the film's cinematographers. Willis, founder of Underpin Photography, also served as photographer while Dickey filled the roles of associate producer and editor, also directing the re-enactment scenes. Actors in these re-enactment scenes included Bill Oberst Jr., Christian Simpson (as Christian J. Simpson), Allison Weissman, Sarah Agor, and Jess Allen. John Samuel Hanson composed the film score for Nefarious after having worked on such other projects as 16 Blocks, Constantine, The Book of Eli, and Lost. As of January 2012, Nolot was producing two sequels to Nefarious.|$|E

Regenvanu argued that the executive of existing parties was controlled by veteran politicians, inhibiting the rise of new, younger politicians. Regenvanu stated that a core objective of the party would be [...] "to try and put good leaders into parliament and into politics at all levels. And <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mean leaders who are prepared to put the public interest first". In addition, the party would campaign on strengthening the guarantee of indigenous land ownership, and on promoting and facilitating indigenous participation in business.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Michael O'Sullivan {{thought the}} film was [...] "creepy, {{at least for the}} first two-thirds or so, in a {{moderately}} satisfying, if predictable, way ... But the narrative corner into which this movie... paints itself is a simultaneously brilliant and exciting one. Well before the film neared its by turns dismal and ditzy conclusion, I found myself knowing—yet hardly able to believe—what was about to happen." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times found it to be [...] "moody and sometimes ideologically provocative" [...] and added, [...] "Knowing has its grim moments—and <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mean the sort of cringe- (or laugh-) inducing lines of dialogue that have haunted disaster films through the ages ... So visually arresting are the images that watching a deconstructing airliner or subway train becomes more mesmerising than horrifying." ...|$|E

2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised <b>by</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|Kinney {{said that}} there are lyrics on the album that deal with {{original}} vocalist Layne Staley. He elaborated, [...] "There's not a day that goes <b>by</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't think of him. And there's a lot to address, with all of that stuff coming to the forefront. A lot has happened since 1995; a lot has happened in our lives and we've never talked about it or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but a lot has happened since the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|E

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told what}} {{happened}} in [...] after Moses asked to behold God's Presence in [...] Moses foretold that he would behold God's Glory and make atonement for the Israelites' iniquities on Yom Kippur. On that day, Moses asked God (in the words of [...] ) [...] "Show me, I pray, Your Glory." [...] God told Moses that Moses {{was not able to}} see God's Glory lest he die, as [...] reports God said, [...] "men shall not see Me and live," [...] but for the sake of God's oath to Moses, God agreed to do as Moses asked. God instructed Moses to stand at the entrance of a cave, and God would cause all God's angels to pass before Moses. God told Moses to stand his ground, and not to fear, as [...] reports, [...] "And He said, I will make all My Goodness pass before you." [...] God told Moses that when he heard the Name that God had spoken to him, then Moses would know that God was before him, as [...] reports. The ministering angels complained that they served before God day and night, and they were unable to see God's Glory, but this man Moses born of woman desired to see God's Glory. The angels arose in wrath and excitement to kill Moses, and he came near to death. God intervened in a cloud to protect Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And the Lord descended in the cloud." [...] God protected Moses with the hollow of God's hand so that he would not die, as [...] reports, [...] "And it shall come to pass, while My Glory passes <b>by,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with My hand." [...] When God had passed by, God removed the hollow of God's hand from Moses, and he saw traces of the Shechinah, as [...] says, [...] "And I will take away My hand, and you shall see my back." [...] Moses began to cry with a loud voice, and Moses said the words of [...] "O Lord, O Lord, a God full of compassion and gracious [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] Moses asked God to pardon the iniquities of the people in connection with the Golden Calf. God told Moses that if he had asked God then to pardon the iniquities of all Israel, even to the end of all generations, God would have done so, as it was the appropriate time. But Moses had asked for pardon with reference to the Golden Calf, so God told Moses that it would be according to his words, as [...] says, [...] "And the Lord said, ‘I have pardoned according to your word.'" ...|$|E
