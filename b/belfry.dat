Riley fights {{his way into the}} <b>belfry</b> and while he's embattled, Buffy crashes through a window, fighting. He turns to attack and finds himself face to face with Buffy. She fights while he stares, unmoving. When a minion pins her down she sees and recognizes the box from her dream and gesticulates wildly for Riley to destroy it. When he does so, the stolen voices escape. Buffy screams until the heads of The Gentlemen and their minions explode.|$|E

5|$|Its façade {{was simply}} {{decorated}} by narrow pilasters and niches of saints. A bas relief of the church's secondary patron, San Vicente Ferrer, was prominently {{located on the}} center of the facade. A string of finely cut coral stones, molded into flowers, could be seen on the lower cornice of the facade. Beside the façade was an extension of a bulky <b>belfry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The square, massive Norman tower has three-arched <b>belfry</b> {{windows on}} each face, surmounted by corner turrets, and a conically-shaped tower of {{octagonal}} proportions, topped again {{by a short}} steeple. The tower was a main viewing point for the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) which linked the Paris Observatory with the Royal Greenwich Observatory using trigonometry. Cross-channel sightings were made of signal lights at Dover Castle and Fairlight, East Sussex.|$|E
5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. On the rear outer {{corners of the}} towers are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the <b>belfry</b> stage.

5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a <b>belfry.</b> Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
5|$|Birkin becomes {{accepted}} into the Nonconformist family of Mr Ellerbeck the station master (Jim Carter), with whom he dines on Sundays; the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church, which has consigned the penniless Birkin {{to sleep in the}} church <b>belfry.</b> Ellerbeck's children eventually persuade Birkin to preach a sermon at a nearby Methodist chapel. Birkin also forms an emotional, albeit unspoken, attachment to Alice Keach (Natasha Richardson), the young wife of the vicar. The vicar himself (Patrick Malahide) is portrayed unsympathetically as an obstruction to the work in the church, viewing the medieval painting as symptomatic of the superstition prevalent in the community.|$|E

5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, tall, {{free-standing}} wooden towers called Bergfriede were commonly {{built by}} the 11th century, either as part of motte-and-bailey designs or, as part of Hohenburgen castles, with characteristic inner and outer courts. Bergfriede, which take their name from the German for a <b>belfry,</b> had similarities to keeps, but are usually distinguished from them on account of Bergfriede having a smaller area or footprint, usually being non-residential and being typically integrated into the outer defences of a castle, rather than being a safe refuge of last resort.|$|E
5|$|The 20thcentury {{has seen}} {{continued}} maintenance and restoration. In 1922, the Chester War Memorial {{was installed in}} the cathedral grounds and dedicated to the fallen soldiers of the First World War and later the Second World War. In 1973–75 a detached <b>belfry,</b> designed by George Pace, was erected in {{the grounds of the}} cathedral. In 2005 a new Song School was added to the cathedral. During the 2000s, the cathedral library was refurbished and relocated. It was officially reopened in September 2007. The cathedral and the former monastic buildings were designated as GradeI listed buildings on 28July 1955.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{is built}} in the 13th century English Gothic style in coursed ragstone with a red-tiled roof and a central wooden <b>belfry,</b> topped by a splayed-foot spire and small dormers at the west end. The plan is of an aisle-less nave with a lower chancel, north chapel and south porch with a stair tower for the gallery (all at {{the west end of}} the church), with a sacristy linking it to the presbytery in the {{north-east}} corner. The windows are of Bath stone.|$|E

5|$|The Sicilian <b>belfry.</b> Belfrys {{were not}} placed beside {{the church in}} a campanile tower as is common in Italy, but on the façade itself, often surmounting the central pediment, {{with one or more}} bells clearly {{displayed}} beneath its own arch, such as at Catania's Collegiata (Illustration 1). In a large church with many bells this usually resulted in an intricately sculpted and decorated arcade at the highest point of the principal façade (Illustration 3). These belfries are among the most enduring and characteristic features of Sicilian Baroque architecture.|$|E
5|$|The early frescoes {{inside the}} cathedral were {{restored}} in the 18th century. Stepanos Lehatsi (Stephen of Poland) illustrated the <b>belfry</b> in 1664. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Armenian painters created frescoes of {{scenes from the}} old testament and Armenian saints. Naghash Hovnatan painted parts of the interior between 1712 and 1721. His paintings on the dome and the painting of the Mother of God under the altar have survived to this day. Other members of the prominent Hovnatanian family (Hakob, Harutyun and Hovnatan) created paintings throughout the 18th century. Their work was continued by the succeeding generations of the same family (Mkrtum and Hakob) in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower at}} {{the west end of}} the church dates from the early 17th century. It sits next to the {{south-west}} corner of the nave, aligned with the south wall, because the former church plan included a north aisle; the north wall of the tower meets the nave at its roof ridge. It is castellated and constructed of coursed roughly-dressed stone. It has two diagonal buttresses, two angled buttresses and four corner pinnacles. There are slate <b>belfry</b> louvres {{on each side of the}} tower and clock faces on the north and south sides.|$|E

It has ten altars, an elegant dome, and two <b>belfries,</b> {{one on each}} side of the façade. It was consecrated by Bishop Fra Vincenzo Labini on 13 October 1782 during the tenure of office of Rev. Antonio Mizzi - a hard-working and highly loved parish priest. The works done by this priest comprise two out of the four bells that hung in the church's <b>belfries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The town centre, {{which has}} seen {{significant}} regeneration {{over the past}} decade, is dominated by its distinctive town hall (Hôtel de Ville) at Place du Soldat Inconnu. It {{was built in the}} Flemish Renaissance style between 1911 and 1925 to commemorate the unification of the cities of Calais and Saint Pierre in 1885. A previous town hall had been erected in 1818. One of the most elegant landmarks in the city, its ornate 74 metre (246ft) high clock tower and <b>belfry</b> can be seen from out to sea and chimes throughout the day and has been protected by UNESCO since 2005 as part of a series of belfries across the region. The building parts have also been listed as a series of historic monuments by government decree of 26 June 2003, including its roofs and <b>belfry,</b> main hall, glass roof, the staircase, corridor serving the first floor, the rooms on the first floor (including decoration): the wedding room, the VIP lounge, the lounge of the council and the cabinet room. The hall has stained glass windows and numerous paintings and exquisite decor. It houses police offices.|$|E
5|$|The west {{tower is}} surmounted with crenellations and pinnacles and is {{supported}} by stepped buttresses at each corner. The buttresses are constructed from flint and stone, and have arched insets on the faces. They rest on stone plinths, each bearing carved shields, that on the north buttress with an inaccurate rendering of {{the arms of the}} see, and the other with a cross and a dolphin. The tower has three Perpendicular windows in the <b>belfry</b> and a large Perpendicular window in its western face, giving light to the west end of the nave.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} precolonial Guyangan Cave System in Banton, the {{province}} also has several heritage sites built during the Spanish colonial period. In Romblon town, the forts of San Andres and Santiago served as fortifications against Muslim pirates in the 17th century, while the St. Joseph Cathedral and <b>Belfry</b> houses a centuries-old {{image of the}} Santo Niño de Cebú or the Holy Child. Both heritage sites were declared National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum. The town also has two Spanish-era bridges that were declared Important Cultural Treasures. A similar fort in Banton, the centuries-old Fort San Jose and Banton Church, {{were built in the}} 1600s and was also used as defenses against Muslim pirates.|$|E
