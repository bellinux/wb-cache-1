He ordered her not to attack the Turtles nor make any {{dealings}} with the Kraang behind his back, and was livid when his adoptive daughter disobeyed him. He returned in [...] "The Manhattan Project," [...] with Tiger Claw, a Japanese circus performer who was mutated into Shredder's deadly assassin and new first lieutenant. Tiger Claw {{was able to bring}} Splinter before him, but complication from a Kraang operation in the city and the Turtles' own efforts rob Shredder of his chance to kill his old foe once again. In [...] "The Wrath of Tiger Claw," [...] Shredder and Tiger Claw attempted to use Karai to set a trap for the Turtles, but when she saw a photograph of Hamato Yoshi, Tang Shen, and herself as an infant, she realized that the Turtles were telling the truth and sided with them, resulting in her being captured while buying them time to escape Tiger Claw. Shredder still cared about his adoptive daughter, though, as seen in [...] "The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto," [...] where he visited her in her cell and explained why he kept everything a secret and hoped that she will one day understand. After his helmet, the titular Kuro Kabuto, was stolen by professional thief Anton Zeck on behalf of Steranko, Shredder found Zeck's calling card on a glued-down Rahzar and ordered the entire clan before him. Explaining the helmet's history as a special Foot Clan relic, he had the clan hunt for Zeck, sending Fishface with Stockman-Fly and Rahzar with Tiger Claw. Leonardo later confronted Shredder with the Kabuto for a trade and kept him <b>busy</b> <b>long</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the other Turtles to get to Karai. However, the [...] "Karai" [...] Shredder traded them with {{turned out to be a}} dummy rigged with a bomb as the Turtles evaded it. In [...] "Vengeance is Mine," [...] Shredder attempted to use the real Karai as bait for a trap that would mutate the Turtles into snakes that would kill Splinter, but the plan backfired when Karai was exposed to the mutagen, turning into a snake and almost attacking Splinter before she fled after regaining control of herself.|$|E
