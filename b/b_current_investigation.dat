In total, data from 205 participants were analyzed in the quantitative portion of the study, with 181 participants providing written narrative responses and 10 individuals participating in a follow-up interview.

Parentification was also associated with ideological and interpersonal values that were in opposition to parental beliefs. Through quantitative and qualitative methods, six factors were identified that may affect the relation between parentification and later outcome: perceived unfairness in the family of origin, perceived stress of adult roles, self-management skills, supportive parenting, optimistic attitude, and perceived value of skills learned.
