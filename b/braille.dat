5|$|New {{variations}} in <b>braille</b> technology continue to grow, including such innovations as <b>braille</b> computer terminals; RoboBraille email delivery service; and Nemeth <b>Braille,</b> a comprehensive system for mathematical and scientific notation. Almost two centuries after its invention, <b>braille</b> remains {{a system of}} powerful and enduring utility.|$|E
5|$|<b>Braille</b> {{produced}} several written works about <b>braille</b> and {{as general}} {{education for the}} blind. Method of Writing Words, Music, and Plain Songs... (1829) was revised and republished in 1837; his mathematics guide, Little Synopsis of Arithmetic for Beginners, entered use in 1838; and his monograph New Method for Representing by Dots the Form of Letters, Maps, Geometric Figures, Musical Symbols, etc., for Use by the Blind {{was first published in}} 1839. Many of Braille's original printed works remain available at the <b>Braille</b> birthplace museum in Coupvray.|$|E
5|$|<b>Braille</b> {{studied in}} Coupvray {{until the age}} of ten. Because of his {{combination}} of intelligence and diligence, <b>Braille</b> was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris. <b>Braille,</b> the last of the family's children to leave the household, departed for the school in February 1819. At that time the Royal Institute was an underfunded, ramshackle affair, but it provided a relatively stable environment for blind children to learn and associate together.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Braille</b> was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by his pupils, his writing system was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died in}} 1822, showed no interest in altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into <b>braille.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Braille</b> {{read the}} Haüy books repeatedly, {{and he was}} equally {{attentive}} to the oral instruction offered by the school. He {{proved to be a}} highly proficient student and, after he had exhausted the school's curriculum, he was immediately asked to remain as a teacher's aide. By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship. For {{much of the rest of}} his life, <b>Braille</b> stayed at the Institute where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.|$|E
5|$|Braille's {{childhood}} home in Coupvray is a listed historic building and houses the Louis <b>Braille</b> Museum. A large monument {{to him was}} erected {{in the town square}} which was itself renamed <b>Braille</b> Square. On the centenary of his death, his remains were moved to the Panthéon in Paris. In a symbolic gesture, Braille's hands were left in Coupvray, reverently buried near his home.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone won two {{publishing}} industry awards given for sales rather than literary merit, the British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year and the Booksellers' Association / Bookseller Author of the Year. By March 1999 UK editions had sold just over 300,000 copies, {{and the story}} was still the UK's best-selling title in December 2001. A <b>Braille</b> edition was published in May 1998 by the Scottish <b>Braille</b> Press.|$|E
5|$|In adulthood, <b>Braille</b> {{served as}} a {{professor}} at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely spent the remainder of his life refining and extending his system. It went unused by most educators for many years after his death, but posterity has recognized <b>braille</b> as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide.|$|E
5|$|New Method for Representing by Dots... (1839) {{put forth}} Braille's {{plan for a}} new writing system with which blind people could write letters that could be read by sighted people. Called decapoint, the system {{combined}} his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which <b>Braille</b> devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by <b>Braille</b> and requiring memorization), the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, <b>Braille</b> mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, <b>Braille</b> constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E
5|$|<b>Braille</b> {{had always}} been a sickly child, and his {{condition}} worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him, and by the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, <b>Braille</b> lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.|$|E
5|$|Louis <b>Braille</b> {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, <b>Braille</b> did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E
5|$|With {{increasing}} popularity {{since its}} release, Geet Ramayan has {{been translated into}} nine other languages: five Hindi translations and one each in Bengali, English, Gujarati, Kannada, Konkani, Sanskrit, Sindhi and Telugu. It has also been transliterated into <b>Braille.</b>|$|E
5|$|A newly {{designed}} <b>braille</b> template {{was used for}} the first time in a National election, allowing blind voters to vote independently for the first time. In previous elections, blind voters had to communicate their choice of party to a voting official, who then filled in a ballot sheet on their behalf.|$|E
5|$|After the {{introduction}} of decapoint, <b>Braille</b> gave assistance to his friend Pierre-François-Victor Foucault, who {{was working on the}} development of his Raphigraphe, a device that could emboss letters {{in the manner of a}} typewriter. Foucault's machine was hailed as a great success and was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1855.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, <b>Braille</b> spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for <b>Braille</b> to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Braille</b> {{created his}} own raised-dot system {{by using an}} awl, {{the same kind of}} {{implement}} which had blinded him. In the process of designing his system, he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it, based on Barbier's own slate and stylus tools. By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which would keep the lines straight and readable.|$|E
5|$|Braille's ear {{for music}} {{enabled him to}} become an {{accomplished}} cellist and organist in classes taught by Jean-Nicolas Marrigues. Later in life, his musical talents led him to play the organ for churches all over France. A devout Catholic, <b>Braille</b> held the position of organist in Paris at the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs from 1834 to 1839, and later at the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul.|$|E
5|$|Louis <b>Braille</b> {{was born}} in Coupvray, France, a small town about twenty miles east of Paris. He and his three elder {{siblings}} – Monique Catherine (b. 1793), Louis-Simon (b. 1795), and Marie Céline (b. 1797) – lived with their parents, Simon-René and Monique, on three hectares of land and vineyards in the countryside. Simon-René maintained a successful enterprise as a leatherer and maker of horse tack.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan {{is served}} by the New York Public Library, which has the largest {{collection}} of any public library system in the country. The five units of the Central Library—Mid-Manhattan Library, Donnell Library Center, The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Andrew Heiskell <b>Braille</b> and Talking Book Library, and the Science, Industry and Business Library—are all located in Manhattan. More than 35 other branch libraries {{are located in the}} borough.|$|E
5|$|Over 200 {{editions of}} the novel have been published, with almost 100 German and English editions alone, and {{numerous}} translations and reprintings in over 30 languages. It has also been published {{in a variety of}} formats, including printed medium, audiobook, <b>Braille,</b> and E-book formats. The original edition was unillustrated, but later several illustrations have been created.|$|E
5|$|RNC is {{involved}} in the RoboBraille project which allows visually impaired Internet users to have text translated into <b>Braille</b> and MP3 audio format via email. The system, developed in Denmark, was launched in June 2006 and won a British Computer Society Social Contribution Project Award in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Schuur is a {{voracious}} {{reader and}} a cat owner. She is an ardent {{fan of the}} American daytime television series The Young and the Restless, {{to the extent of}} personally visiting the set on at least three occasions. Her Grammy awards, one inscribed in <b>braille,</b> sit on a Baldwin piano given to her by the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|The {{open section}} of the tournament was contested by {{a record number of}} 180 teams {{representing}} 175 nations. Azerbaijan, as host nation, fielded three teams, whilst the International <b>Braille</b> Chess Association (IBCA), the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA), and the International Chess Committee of the Deaf (ICCD) each provided one team.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{classes and}} {{vocational}} workshops, the orphanage operated its own printing press and bindery where it produced its own textbooks, <b>Braille</b> books, and German-language newspapers. It also operated a flour mill and bakery that produced 35,000 {{loaves of bread}} a year, a laundry and clothing-repair service, a carpentry, a pottery factory that produced all the clay utensils used in the orphanage, and a tree and plant nursery. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, a large brick and tile factory was erected on the premises, which produced one million bricks and 250,000 tiles annually.|$|E
5|$|<b>Braille</b> worked tirelessly on his ideas, and {{his system}} was largely {{completed}} by 1824, {{when he was}} fifteen years old. From Barbier's night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 he had discarded the dashes {{because they were too}} difficult to read. Crucially, Braille's smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.|$|E
5|$|Potter's small format {{books have}} been {{translated}} into nearly thirty languages including Greek and Russian. The Tale of Peter Rabbit {{was the first of}} the small format books to be translated into a non-English language when Het Verhaal van Pieter Langoor was published in 1912 by Nijgh & Ditmar's Uitgevers Maatschappij, Rotterdam. Peter Rabbit has since been published in <b>braille</b> (1921), in the International Phonetic Alphabet (1968), and in the hieroglyphic script of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2005).|$|E
5|$|Rambhadracharya is {{the founder}} and head of Tulsi Peeth, a {{religious}} and social service institution in Chitrakoot named after Saint Tulsidas. He {{is the founder}} and lifelong chancellor of the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University in Chitrakoot, which offers graduate and postgraduate courses exclusively to four types of disabled students. Rambhadracharya has been blind since the age of two months, had no formal education till the age of seventeen years, and has never used <b>Braille</b> or any other aid to learn or compose.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} five, Giridhar {{memorised}} {{the entire}} Bhagavad Gita, consisting of around 700verses with chapter and verse numbers, in 15days, {{with the help of}} his neighbour, Pandit Murlidhar Mishra. On Janmashtami day in 1955, he recited the entire Bhagavad Gita. He released the first <b>Braille</b> version of the scripture, with the original Sanskrit text and a Hindi commentary, at New Delhi on 30 November 2007, 52years after memorising the Gita. When Giridhar was seven, he memorised the entire Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, consisting of around 10,900verses with chapter and verse numbers, in 60days, assisted by his grandfather. On Rama Navami day in 1957, he recited the entire epic while fasting. Later, Giridhar went on to memorise the Vedas, the Upanishads, works of Sanskrit grammar, the Bhagavata Purana, all the works of Tulsidas, and many other works in Sanskrit and Indian literature.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{became a}} popular {{character}} {{and the subject of}} considerable merchandise over the decades including nursery ware and porcelain figurines. The tale has been published in <b>braille</b> and the Initial Teaching Alphabet, and has been translated into French, German, and Dutch. In 1971, Mrs. Tiggy-winkle became a character performed by Sir Frederick Ashton in the Royal Ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter. In 1993, the tale was adapted to animation and telecast as an episode of the BBC series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.In the world of Peter rabbit and friends the story was combined with the tale of Jeremy Fisher, the 7th book in the series. This book, the tale of Mrs tiggy Winkle, is the 6th book in the series. It is also the 6th book to be published.|$|E
5|$|RNC {{hosts the}} UK's first VI Sports Academy, having begun {{as the home}} of the first {{football}} academy for visually impaired players and the England blind football team. It hosted the 2010 World Blind Football Championship and also served as a training facility for participants in the 2012 Paralympic Games. The college is actively involved in the development of assistive technology, including student participation in the Tech Novice Cafe, run for members of the public who are not confident in computer use. Two notable devices were developed at RNC; the Mountbatten Brailler, an electronic <b>braille</b> writer, and the T3, a talking tactile device that helped with the reading of maps and diagrams.|$|E
5|$|The older {{stations}} on the North South and East West {{lines were}} originally built with no accessibility facilities, such as lifts, ramps, tactile guidance systems (<b>Braille</b> tactiles {{on the floor}} surface), wider fare gates, or toilets for passengers with disabilities; authorities in the past actively discouraged use of their system by the disabled. Now, these facilities are being progressively installed {{as part of a}} programme to make all stations accessible to the elderly and to those with disabilities. All stations are now barrier-free, although works are still ongoing to provide stations with additional barrier-free facilities. The installation of lifts at pedestrian overhead bridges next to six MRT stations and additional bicycle racks at 20 stations is slated to be completed by the end of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Study {{programmes}} at RNC {{are designed}} to prepare visually impaired students for progression into further education, university or employment. The development of independent living and personal skills is also encouraged. The college is divided into several different areas of study. These include Leisure, Therapies and Sport (including courses and qualifications in massage, complementary therapies, and sport treatment and management); Music, Media, Performance and Art (including courses and qualifications in music technology, media and art); Information and Communication Technology (including courses and qualifications in office skills and the European Computer Driving Licence); Business, Administration and Customer Service; Secondary level qualifications– General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (A-Level) qualifications in subjects such as English, mathematics, French and psychology; and <b>Braille</b> reading. On top of academic and vocational study students are also taught to develop independence and mobility skills for day-to-day living. Topics covered here {{include the use of}} a white cane and becoming familiar with the surrounding environment, using public transport safely and confidently, cooking and laundry skills, and using cash machines or making Chip and PIN credit card transactions.|$|E
25|$|A <b>braille</b> {{embosser}} is, simply put, {{a printer}} for <b>braille.</b> Instead {{of a standard}} printer adding ink onto a page, the <b>braille</b> embosser imprints the raised dots of <b>braille</b> onto a page. Some <b>braille</b> embossers combine both <b>braille</b> and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch.|$|E
25|$|Related to <b>Braille</b> pattern dots-1 are <b>Braille</b> {{patterns}} 17, 18, and 178, {{which are}} used in 8-dot <b>braille</b> systems, such as Gardner-Salinas and Luxembourgish <b>Braille.</b>|$|E
25|$|Related to <b>Braille</b> pattern dots-12 are <b>Braille</b> {{patterns}} 127, 128, and 1278, {{which are}} used in 8-dot <b>braille</b> systems, such as Gardner-Salinas and Luxembourgish <b>Braille.</b>|$|E
