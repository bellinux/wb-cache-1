5|$|In 2009, {{with the}} {{production}} beginning to coalesce, Scorsese and a production crew went to Nagasaki, Japan, visiting the original sites {{that served as the}} setting for Endō's novel. Additional location scouting was conducted in Canada. However, Silence entered a state of development hell soon afterwards, and Scorsese decided to work on Shutter Island and Hugo instead. In December 2011, Scorsese stated that Silence would be his next film. By March, although he originally put it on the <b>back</b> <b>burner</b> and consequently dropped out, Scorsese signed back on to The Wolf of Wall Street and opted to direct it ahead of Silence. However, at the time, Scorsese's publicist stated that Silence would come first. In May, the film picked up another producer in the recently revived Cecchi Gori Pictures, which placed the project first on its slate of upcoming films. Cecchi Gori was involved in pre-production for Silence, but years of unrelated legal disputes had interrupted its association to the film.|$|E
5|$|Negro {{became one}} of the driving forces in LLL's feud with AAA owner Antonio Peña and his AAA loyalists. Over the years, Negro feuded with the top técnicos of AAA such as La Parka, Jr., Octagón and Latin Lover. Negro's {{position}} as one of AAA's top workers was cemented on March 5, 2000, when he competed in AAA's annual Rey de Reyes tournament. In the opening round, he defeated Dos Caras, Killer and Psicosis II and in the finals, he defeated El Alebrije, Charly Manson and Cibernético to win the 2000 Rey de Reyes tournament. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead Los Vipers. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo (2000). When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerra de Titanes (2000), the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b> In 2001, Negro almost won Rey de Reyes again, but La Parka, Jr. defeated him in the finals. His string of losses continued at Triplemanía IX, where the LLL team of Abismo Negro, Cibernético, Electroshock and Mascara Maligna lost to Mascara Sagrada, El Alebrije, Octagón and La Parka, Jr. when Negro was forced to submit.|$|E

According to Michaels' autobiography, he was {{nursing a}} severe {{hangover}} {{in the hours}} before this match. In spring 1989, The Rockers started a storyline with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers that kicked off with an underhanded attack on Michaels during a match. The Rougeaus assaulted Michaels with manager Jimmy Hart’s megaphone and drew blood. This storyline put The Rockers' issues with The Brain Busters on the <b>back</b> <b>burners</b> while The Rockers and the Rougeaus fought. The issue between The Rockers and Rougeaus was the storyline reason for introducing the “Iron Man match” to the WWF. Despite wrestling 5 Iron Man matches against each other none of the matches were ever televised or released on a commercial tape. On August 28, 1989, the Rockers/Rougeau feud made it to PPV as the Rougeaus teamed with Rick Martel to defeat The Rockers and Tito Santana at SummerSlam.|$|R

Annadurai felt that remaining in the Indian Union meant accepting linguistic domination and economic backwardness. Nevertheless, the Sino-Indian war brought about changes in the Indian constitution.

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1999 Cibernético formed another rudo faction, a {{group called}} Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was {{inspired}} by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Abismo Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers after Cibernético. Cibernético looked like he could repeat as Rey de Reyes winner at the 2000 Event, but was defeated by Abismo Negro in the final. A few months later Cibernético teamed up with LLL members Abismo Negro, Electroshock and Pro Wrestling Noah wrestler Shiima Nobunaga in the main event of Triplemanía VIII, only to lose to Octagón, Jushin Thunder Liger, Latin Lover and El Alebrije. While Cibernético was leading LLL Abismo Negro was rising {{through the ranks of}} AAA, bolstered by his leadership of Los Vipers. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead and who should follow. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo 2000. When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerrera de Titanes 2000, the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b> On June 30, 2001 Cibernético's almost three-year-long reign as Campeon de Campeones was ended when Heavy Metal won the title from him.

Cibernético would retain the title until AAA quietly stopped promoting the belt some time in 2005. Cibernético's LLL was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of AAA founder and owner Antonio Peña and led to a match between Cibernético and Peña, who had been a wrestler before retiring in the 1980s. The two wrestled at the 2001 Guerrera de Titanes which Cibernético easily won in under three minutes. On January 20, 2002 Cibernético finally managed to defeat his longtime rival El Canek to win the UWA World Heavyweight Championship, a title he would retain for almost 10 months before El Canek regained the title on November 15, 2002.|$|E

50|$|Gas stoves today use {{two basic}} types of {{ignition}} sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a pilot light) under the cooktop. The flame {{is between the}} front and <b>back</b> <b>burners.</b> When the stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing out of the burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system {{is that it is}} simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a flame failure device for gas hobs and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. If a draft blows out the flame or it goes out due to loss of gas pressure, the thermocouple cools and signals the valve to close, shutting off the gas supply. In gas ranges that come with a flame failure device, lighting when there's no power can prove to {{be a bit of a}} challenge because unless the user is quick at lighting a match and then turning on the gas valve, the flame failure device cuts off the gas supply within seconds if it senses that the burner isn't lit and there's not much of a point trying to light it once it has already cut off the gas supply.|$|R

40|$|Venting range hoods are {{important}} residential ventilation components that remove pollutants generated by cooking activities {{and natural gas}} cooking burners. To address the lack of data on range hood installations in California, we conducted a survey by examining photographs of homes for sale or rent listed on a popular real estate web site. The survey was conducted in November 2010 and April–May 2011. Posted photos of the homes were reviewed {{to determine if a}} hood was installed, the type of hood, and two installation details that can impact performance, namely the height above the cooktop {{and the degree to which}} the hood covers the cooktop burners. We additionally collected information about the homes, including asking price for purchase or rent, type of building (e. g. detached house, townhouse or apartment), building age, floor area, and cooktop fuel type. Listings were first sampled to focus on homes built since 2005, then randomly sampled to include varied prices and locations around the state. Data were obtained for 1002 homes built between 1865 and 2011 (median year built 1989). Homes for sale varied in asking price from $ 16, 000 to $ 16, 500, 000 (median $ 353, 000) and homes for rent varied from $ 500 to $ 25, 000 (median $ 2125) per month. Approximately 74 % of the sample had natural gas cooktops. In this sample, natural gas cooktops were more prevalent in more expensive homes than in less expensive homes. Across the entire sample, 7. 4 % appeared to have no hood installed, 33 % had a short hood, 13 % had a deep hood and 47 % had a microwave over the range. The percentage of these hoods that vent to the outdoors could not be determined. Hood type was related to coverage of the cooktop. For deep hoods, 76 % appeared to cover most or all of the cooktop burners. For short hoods, 70 % covered about three quarters of the cooktop. And for microwaves the vast majority (96 %) covered the <b>back</b> <b>burners</b> but not the front burners. Hood type was also correlated with asking price or monthly rent, with deep hoods most common in the most expensive homes. Hood type was also correlated with home age, with microwave hoods more common in newer homes. Installation height was related to device type with microwaves installed lower (closer) to the cooktop (median 18 inches), and short hoods (median 28 inches) and deep hoods (median 30 inches) installed higher. Deep range hoods are more common with natural gas cooktops than with electric cooktops, and slightly fewer homes with natural gas cooktops lack a range hood (7 %) than homes with electric cooktops (9 %). This study provides limited but useful information about the characteristics of range hoods in California homes and demonstrates the potential value of non-traditional forms of data collection...|$|R

50|$|A {{single-ended}} recuperative (SER) burner {{is a type}} of {{gas burner}} used in high-temperature industrial kilns and furnaces. These burners are used where indirect heating is required, e.g. where the products of combustion are not allowed to combine with the atmosphere of the furnace. The typical design is a tubular (pipe) shape with convoluted pathways on the interior, closed on the end pointed into the furnace. A gas burner fires a flame down the center of these pathways, and the hot combustion gases are then forced to change direction and travel along the shell of the tube, heating it to incandescent temperatures and allowing efficient transfer of thermal energy to the furnace interior. Exhaust gas is collected <b>back</b> at the <b>burner</b> end where it is eventually discharged to the atmosphere. The hot exhaust can be used to pre-heat the incoming combustion air and fuel gas (recuperation) to boost efficiency.|$|R

40|$|It is well {{understood}} that the stability of axial diffusion flames {{is dependent on the}} mixing behavior of the fuel and combustion air streams. Combustion aerodynamic texts typically describe flame stability and transitions from laminar diffusion flames to fully developed turbulent flames as a function of increasing jet velocity. Turbulent diffusion flame stability is greatly influenced by recirculation eddies that transport hot combustion gases <b>back</b> to the <b>burner</b> nozzle. This recirculation enhances mixing and heats the incoming gas streams. Models describing these recirculation eddies utilize conservation of momentum and mass assumptions. Increasing the mass flow rate of either fuel or combustion air increases both the jet velocity and momentum for a fixed burner configuration. Thus, differentiating between gas velocity and momentum is important when evaluating flame stability under various operating conditions. The research efforts described herein are part of an ongoing project directed at evaluating the effect of flame aerodynamics on NO{sub x} emissions from coal fired burners in a systematic manner. This research includes both experimental and modeling efforts being performed at the University of Arizona in collaboration with Purdue University. The objective of this effort is to develop rational design tools for optimizing low NO{sub x} burners. Experimental studies include both cold-and hot-flow evaluations of the following parameters: primary and secondary inlet air velocity, coal concentration in the primary air, coal particle size distribution and flame holder geometry. Hot-flow experiments will also evaluate the effect of wall temperature on burner performance...|$|R
40|$|There {{is always}} some risk of {{incident}} {{associated with the}} combustion of solid fuels in automatically stoked boilers or stoves. These incidents are of essentially three types: smoke from the <b>burner</b> <b>back</b> into the boiler room (or {{back into the living}} room from pellet stoves), gas explosions in the combustion chamber and back burning in the stoker. There can be a number of reasons for these problems, and in many cases such incidents have not been investigated. The Swedish Building Regulations stipulate that firing equipment shall have adequate safety against fire. They also recommend that stokers/burners should have at least two independent safety systems against back burning. The objective of this project has been to analyse such incidents and to test safety systems for pellet and wood chip burners, in order better to understand how they work. It has also included evaluation of the“fireguard” water sprinkler system. The results from the tests with pellet burners showed that the burners that were tested provided relatively good protection against back burning. However, it was found that it was very important how and where the systems (temperature limiter, water sprinkler etc.) were fitted on the burners in order to ensure correct and effective operation of the safety system. One of the key question was also where to position electronic equipment on the burners in order to ensure that it is not exposed to temperatures higher than those for which it is designed. Over the years, there have been major problems with back burning in older designs of wood chip burners using old technology. The chip burner used in this project was of modern type. The test with simulated back burning showed that the water sprinkler stopped the fire. However, for greater safety the water sprinklers should have included two separate water container. The test with the pellets stove showed that the temperature sensor was of crucial importance for safety against back burning in the stove. Back burn occurred in one of the tests, but only after all the stove’s safety systems had been rendered inoperable. The “Fireguard” water sprinkler system performed well in our tests. However, the position of the temperature sensors, and the integrity of their thermal contact, was of crucial importance for how quickly the sprinklers responded. Another water sprinkler (Syr) showed itself to be very slow to respond when its sensor were in poor thermal contact with the surface of the fuel feed chute. Experience from the tests in this project has shown that it is relatively difficult to simulate back burning in boilers and pellet stoves, despite setting up very favourable conditions for such back burning. Although modern burners and pellet stoves are equipped with all the safety systems that can be expected, several incidents still happen every year. This means that continued analysis of incidents and development of safety systems is essential. The results from this project will be included when SP’s P-marking rules for pellet burners, pellet stoves and chip wood burners are next reviewe...|$|R
2500|$|Macmillan's {{successor}} was the Earl of Home, Alec Douglas-Home. However, as no {{prime minister}} had {{led from the}} House of Lords since the Marquess of Salisbury in 1902, Home chose {{to become a member}} of parliament so he could enter the House of Commons. He disclaimed his earldom and, as [...] "Sir Alec Douglas-Home", contested a by-election in the safe seat of Kinross & West Perthshire. He won and is the only prime minister to resign the Lords to enter the Commons. [...] His demeanor and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned, however. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor Reginald Maudling free rein to handle financial affairs. Home's few domestic policies were not well received, but he did abolish retail price maintenance, which allowed consumers to find more bargains on sale. [...] He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. His Foreign Minister Rab Butler was not especially energetic. [...] Britain's application to join Europe had already been vetoed by De Gaulle, the Cuban missile crisis had been resolved, and Berlin was again on the <b>back</b> <b>burner.</b> Decolonization issues were largely routine, and the Rhodesia and South African crises lay in the future.|$|E
