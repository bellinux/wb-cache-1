The site was purchased by Seattle City Light in October 2008 and vacated by Greyhound in 2010. From 2012 to 2014, Seattle City Light demolished the Greyhound facility and removed contaminated soils in preparation for construction. During the period <b>between</b> <b>environmental</b> cleanup {{and the start of}} construction, the vacant lot was used for a series of temporary public art installations collectively called All Rise.|$|E
5|$|In a {{long-lived}} {{bird with}} a small clutch size such as the Atlantic puffin, the survival rate of adults {{is an important factor}} influencing the success of the species. Only 5% of the ringed puffins that failed to reappear at the colony did so during the breeding season. The rest were lost some time between departing from land in the summer and reappearing the following spring. The birds spend the winter widely spread out in the open ocean, though there is a tendency for individuals from different colonies to overwinter in different areas. Little is known of their behaviour and diet at sea but no correlation was found <b>between</b> <b>environmental</b> factors, such as temperature variations, and their mortality rate. A combination of the availability of food in winter and summer probably influences the survival of the birds, since individuals starting the winter in poor condition are less likely to survive than those in good condition.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} Kuznets {{curve is}} a hypothesized relationship <b>between</b> <b>environmental</b> quality and economic development: various indicators {{of environmental degradation}} tend to get worse as modern economic growth occurs until average income reaches a certain point {{over the course of}} development. Although the subject of continuing debate, some evidence supports the claim that environmental health indicators, such as water and air pollution, show the inverted U-shaped curve. It has been argued that this trend occurs in the level of many of the environmental pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, lead, DDT, chlorofluorocarbons, sewage, and other chemicals previously released directly into the air or water.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{speculation}} that heavy metal poisoning may trigger {{the symptoms of}} autism, particularly in small subsets of individuals who cannot excrete toxins effectively, some parents have turned to alternative medicine practitioners who provide detoxification treatments via chelation therapy. However, evidence to support this practice has been anecdotal and not rigorous. Strong epidemiological evidence refutes links <b>between</b> <b>environmental</b> triggers, in particular thiomersal containing vaccines, and the onset of autistic symptoms. No scientific data supports {{the claim that the}} mercury in the vaccine preservative thiomersal causes autism or its symptoms, and there is no scientific support for chelation therapy as a treatment for autism.|$|E
25|$|Maternal tobacco smoking during {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} increased activity, decreased attention, and diminished intellectual abilities. However, a recent study finds that maternal tobacco smoking has no direct causal effect on the child's IQ. Adjusting for maternal cognitive ability as measured by IQ and education eliminated the association between lower IQ and tobacco smoking. But another study instead looking at the relationship <b>between</b> <b>environmental</b> tobacco smoke exposure, measured with a blood biomarker, and cognitive abilities among U.S. children and adolescents 6–16 years of age, found an inverse association between exposure and cognitive ability among children even at extremely low levels of exposure. The study controlled for sex, race, region, poverty, parent education and marital status, ferritin, and blood lead concentration.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} The Kampung Boy {{led to its}} {{adaptation}} as an animated series. [...] Started in 1995, production took four years to complete and was an international effort, involving companies {{in countries such as}} Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States. [...] The series uses the characters of the graphic novel, casting them in stories that bear similarities to The Simpsons. [...] Comprising 26episodes, Kampung Boy features themes that focus on the meshing of traditional ways of life with modern living, the balance <b>between</b> <b>environmental</b> conservation and urban development, and local superstitions. [...] One of its episodes, [...] "Oh! Tok", featuring a spooky banyan tree, won a special Annecy Award for an animated episode of more than 13minutes in 1999. [...] Although the pilot episode was shown on television in 1997, the series began broadcasting over the satellite television network Astro in 1999. [...] Aside from Malaysia, Kampung Boy was broadcast in other countries such as Germany and Canada.|$|E

[...] A similar model was developed for the northwest Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere known as the Statistical Intensity Prediction System (STIPS), which accounts for land interactions through the input environmental conditions from the Navy Operational Global Prediction System (NOGAPS) model. [...] The version of SHIPS with an inland decay component is known as Decay SHIPS (DSHIPS). [...] The Logistic Growth Equation Model (LGEM) uses the same input as SHIPS but within a simplified dynamical prediction system. [...] Within tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting, the Rainfall Climatology and Persistence (r-CLIPER) model was developed using microwave rainfall data from polar orbiting satellites over the ocean and first-order rainfall measurements from the land, {{to come up with}} a realistic rainfall distribution for tropical cyclones based on the National Hurricane Center's track forecast. [...] It has been operational since 2004. [...] A statistical-parametric wind radii model has been developed for use at the National Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center which uses climatology and persistence to predict wind structure out to five days into the future.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades much {{attention}} in the literature has been addressed to the relationship <b>between</b> corporate <b>environmental</b> responsibility and financial performance. Results however remain contradictory. One view is that improved environmental performance usually means extra costs for the firm and reduced profits. A conflicting view is that improved environmental performance induces cost savings and increase sales and increases financial performance. Broadly speaking, most theorizing on the relationship between social and economic indicators assumes that the evidence is insufficient or too contrasting to draw any generalizable conclusions. Besides examining in detail the cause-effect relation <b>between</b> corporate <b>environmental</b> responsibility and competitive performance is to investigate another perspective clarifying the relationship.

2500|$|Various {{competing}} {{schools of}} thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the European Society for Ecological Economics. [...] An example of the former is the Swedish Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics. Clive Spash has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories. [...] These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists, and the more radical social ecological economists.

2500|$|William Richard Scott {{describes}} contingency {{theory in}} the following manner: [...] "The best way to organize depends {{on the nature of}} the environment to which the organization must relate". The work of other researchers including Paul Lawrence, Jay Lorsch, and James D. Thompson complements this statement. They are more interested in the impact of contingency factors on organizational structure. Their structural contingency theory was the dominant paradigm of organizational structural theories for most of the 1970s. A major empirical test was furnished by Johannes M Pennings who examined the interaction <b>between</b> <b>environmental</b> uncertainty, organization structure and various aspects of performance. Pennings carried out an empirical study on a sample of retail brokerage offices in which aspects of their market environment such as competitiveness, change and munificence, versus [...] organizational arrangements such as decision making templates, power distribution were juxtaposed for possible implications for performance. While structural attributes of offices strongly impacted performance, the evidence for [...] "contingency" [...] was less pronounced.|$|E
