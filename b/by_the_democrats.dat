5|$|In 392 BC, a {{civil war}} had taken place at Corinth, in which a group of pro-Spartan oligarchs was {{defeated}} and exiled by anti-Spartan democrats. Those exiles cooperated with Spartan forces {{in the region to}} gain control of Corinth's port on the Corinthian Gulf, Lechaeum. They then repulsed several attacks on the port <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>democrats</b> at Corinth and their Theban and Argive allies and secured their hold over the port.|$|E
5|$|William Sylvester Taylor (October 10, 1853 – August 2, 1928) was the 33rd Governor of Kentucky. He was {{initially}} declared {{the winner of}} the disputed gubernatorial election of 1899, but the Kentucky General Assembly, dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> reversed the election results, giving the victory to his Democratic Party (United States) opponent, William Goebel. Taylor served only 50 days as governor.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected {{members of his}} party formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined in <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|In 1877, McClellan was {{nominated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> for Governor of New Jersey, {{an action that}} took him by surprise because he had not {{expressed an interest in}} the position. He accepted the nomination, was elected, and served a single term from 1878 to 1881, a tenure marked by careful, conservative executive management and minimal political rancor. The concluding chapter of his political career was his strong support in 1884 for the election of Grover Cleveland. He sought the position of secretary of war in Cleveland's cabinet, for which he was well qualified, but political rivals from New Jersey were able to block his nomination.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 8, 1955 involved contests for mayor, district attorney, all seventeen city council seats, among other offices. Citywide, the Democrats took majorities of over 130,000 votes, continuing their success from the elections four years earlier. Richardson Dilworth, {{who had been}} elected district attorney in 1951, was elected mayor. Victor H. Blanc, a city councilman, was elected district attorney. The Democrats also kept fourteen of seventeen city council seats, losing one district seat while gaining another, and kept control of the other citywide offices. The election represented a further consolidation of control <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> after their citywide victories of four years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Pierce fully {{expected}} to be renominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.|$|E

5|$|His {{popularity}} in the Northern states declined sharply after he supported the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which nullified the Missouri Compromise, while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to violent conflict over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the Ostend Manifesto, calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. Although Pierce fully expected to be renominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the 1856 presidential election, he was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the Civil War as he became a vocal critic of President Abraham Lincoln. Pierce, {{who had been a}} heavy drinker for much of his life, died of severe cirrhosis of the liver in 1869.|$|E
5|$|McClellan was {{nominated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{to run against}} Abraham Lincoln in the 1864 U.S. presidential election. Following the example of Winfield Scott, he ran as a U.S. Army general still on active duty; he did not resign his commission until election day, November 8, 1864. McClellan supported continuation {{of the war and}} restoration of the Union (but not the abolition of slavery), but the party platform, written by Copperhead leader Clement Vallandigham of Ohio, was opposed to this position. The platform called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy. McClellan was forced to repudiate the platform, which made his campaign inconsistent and difficult. He also was not helped by the party's choice for vice president, George H. Pendleton, a peace candidate from Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The Grant administration, who {{recognized}} Morton {{as a powerful}} friend, offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain, replacing John Lothrop Motley, but Morton declined. Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat. In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. (Later, Grant recalled that concerns over Morton's ill health alone had kept him from proposing Morton for Chief Justice, but Grant may have mistaken. Well-advised sources at the time heard that the Senator from Indiana had been offered {{a place on the}} Supreme Court, unofficially, and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the job would cause Morton a physical breakdown).|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} several {{unsuccessful}} proposals at consolidation before 1854. The main opposition of consolidation {{came from the}} Whig Party.
