5|$|Of {{the many}} bird species {{found in the}} Mendips, the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), which has gradually recolonised the area since the 1980s, is particularly significant. It breeds on sea and inland cliffs and {{on the faces of}} active and disused quarries. The upland heaths of the west Mendips have recently increased in ornithological importance due to colonisation by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata), which can be found at Black Down and Crook Peak. In Britain, this species is usually associated with lowland heath. The woodlands at Stock Hill are a <b>breeding</b> <b>site</b> for nightjars (Caprimulgus europaeus) and long-eared owls (Asio otus). The Waldegrave Pool, part of Priddy Mineries, is an important site for dragonflies, including downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) and four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata). Waldegrave Pool is the only Mendip <b>breeding</b> <b>site</b> for downy emerald dragonflies. In 2007 the first confirmed sighting of a red kite (Milvus milvus) on the Mendips was made at Charterhouse.|$|E

5|$|A {{disaster}} {{struck the}} colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire {{swept through the}} <b>breeding</b> <b>site</b> killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, {{and the use of}} anti-erosion materials.|$|E
5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries.

40|$|Longitudinal {{study for}} larval survey {{was carried out}} in the period between March 2009 and August 2009 in East Nile unit area in Khartoum. The study showed that Anopheles arabiensis larval {{presence}} varied significantly between different types of <b>breeding</b> <b>sites.</b> Although the larvae were collected from all identified types of water accumulations, the most important <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> were The Nile flood pools 36 %, rain pools 22. 6 %; broken drinking water pipes leakages 20 %, irrigation channels seepage 15. 3 % and brick making sites 12. 5 %. The study showed that the presence of Anopheles arabiensis larvae was influenced by physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the <b>breeding</b> <b>sites.</b> Habitats with warm water, Anopheles arabiensis larvae were found in water with a range of surface temperature between 16 and 42 °C. The percentages of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> increased with in crease in temperature. The percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> with water salinity of 0 g/l was 4. 3 %, and those with salinity ranging between 0. 1 and 0. 5 g/l was 12. 1 % and those with a salinity of more than 0. 5 g/l was 3. 2 %. The percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> with a pH of 3 - 6 was 6. 9 %, and a pH of 6. 5 - 7. 5 was 7. 8 % and a pH of 8 - 9 was 23. 9 %. The percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> within water surface areas of less than one sq meter was 4. 2 % and in a surface range of 1 - 10 sq meters was 14. 5 % and in more than 10 sq meters was 7. 4 %. In a water depth of less than 10 cm, the percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> was 8. 9 %, and a range of water depth of 10 - 50 cm was 12 % and in a depth of more than 50 cm, the percentage was 3 %. Sunlight affected the number of Anopheles arabiensis <b>breeding</b> <b>sites.</b> The percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> in water with less than 25 % shade was 9. 9 %, and a range of shade of 25 - 75 % was 6. 8 %and in a shade of more than 75 % was 1. 3 %. The presence of surface algae affected the <b>breeding</b> <b>sites.</b> The percentage of breeding with surface algae was 23 % and those without surface algae were 4. 9 %. The percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> detected in water with aquatic vegetation was 7. 9 %, while those in water without aquatic vegetation was 5. 2 %. The presence of other species of mosquitoes affected the percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> of Anopheles arabiensis. Thus in water with other mosquito species the percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> was 47. 2 % and those without other mosquito species were 3. 5 %. The presence of other groups of aquatic invertebrates affects the percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> of Anopheles arabiensis. In waters with other aquatic invertebrates the percentageof positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> was 32. 3 % and those without other aquatic invertebrates the percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> was 0. 9 %. Anopheles arabiensis larvae were not affected with amount of organic content and were also not affectedwith the degree of turbidity of water. The presence of Anopheles arabiensis in East Nile Unit depended mainly on The Nile River level and the rainy season. The highest percentage of positive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> was found during the post-flood season (36 %) and rainy season (22. 6). Larval surveys provided spatial and temporal information about Anopheles arabiensis <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> which is strongly required for larval control. The study recommended that more comprehensive studies should be carried out {{over a longer period of}} time to determine the effect of the natural variations in the <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> on Anopheles arabiensis larvae presence and density...|$|R

40|$|Two {{strategies}} were tested to control #Culex quinquefasciatus$ with #Bacillus sphaericus$ in Maroua (population 130, 000), Cameroon. The treatment of all potential <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> (27, 000) with #B. sphaericus$ {{during the dry}} season caused up to a 90 % reduction in the adult biting rate. Because of the short persistence of #B. sphaericus$ and the occurence of new <b>breeding</b> <b>sites,</b> unacceptable levels of adult biting rates were reached again in 5 months. In the second strategy, two treatments per year of the most productive <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> (10, 000) stopped the biting rate increase during the rainy season. The results were only partially successful because of variations in #B. sphaericus$ toxicity. The first treatment required 1, 200 man-days of work vs. 200 for the simplified treatments. The density of <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> depends on the rainfall and the presence of a tap-water network. A sustained control program of #Cx quinquefasciatus$ will depend upon the dynamics of the principal <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> and an improved formulation of #B. sphaericus$.

5|$|At the <b>breeding</b> <b>site,</b> {{the male}} mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female {{releases}} her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E
40|$|Simultaneously with {{a control}} of <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> {{primarily}} for #Culex quinquefasciatus$ and secondarily for anophelines with #Bacillus sphaericus$ {{in the town}} of Maroua (120, 000 inhabitants) in North Cameroon, a survey of anopheline populations and of transmission rates of malaria was performed. Monthly night catches in 8 districts of the town emphasized the relation between the biting rate by #Anopheles$ in the districts and two main factors. One factor was the distance of a district from the <b>breeding</b> <b>sites,</b> i. e., natural flooded areas along the periphery of the town or artificial <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> (ditches, puddles) filled with rain water during the rainy season and with water from the water network throughout the year. The second factor was the density of the habitation that reduced dispersal of femal mosquitoes from the <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> and the risk for inhabitants to be injected because of scattered bites. The treatment with #B. sphaericus$ was followed by a delay (2 months) {{in the beginning of the}} transmission period and a decrease in the incidence of malaria cases studied in a health facility of the town. It thus seems to be possible to reduce malaria transmission by applying #B. sphaericus$ to the <b>breeding</b> <b>sites,</b> but this requires a good knowledge of the location and dynamics of <b>breeding</b> <b>sites</b> and an improved formulation of the pesticide.

5|$|Common loons {{are mainly}} Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their {{breeding}} season {{in spring and}} summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be large enough for flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They are known to exhibit high <b>breeding</b> <b>site</b> fidelity.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her <b>breeding</b> <b>site,</b> she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E

5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The African rock martin {{and the south}} Asian dusky crag martin are resident, but the Eurasian crag martin is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north Africa or India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the <b>breeding</b> <b>site</b> with a slow hunting flight as they seek their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the <b>breeding</b> <b>site,</b> which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can tolerate a wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to sit still for several minutes.|$|E
