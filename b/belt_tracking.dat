50|$|The {{drum shell}} (or pulley face) can be {{produced}} in aluminium, steel or stainless steel and is normally crowned to facilitate central <b>belt</b> <b>tracking.</b> However, cylindrical shells {{can be produced}} and fitted with external sprockets or rotary brushes for special applications. Rubber NBR, PU and other coatings {{can be applied to}} the shell to increase friction between the shell and conveyor belt and hot vulcanised or moulded profiled lagging can also be applied to drive plastic or steel modular belts.|$|E
5000|$|Bad <b>belt</b> <b>tracking</b> or timing: in {{a system}} that uses {{precisely}} controlled belts, such as a sorter system, regular inspections should be made that all belts are traveling at the proper speeds at all times. While usually a computer controls this with Pulse Position Indicators, any belt not controlled must be monitored to ensure accuracy and reduce the likelihood of problems. Timing is also important for any equipment that is instructed to precisely meter out items, such as a merge where one box pulls from all lines at one time. If one were to be mistimed, product would collide and disrupt operation. Timing is also important wherever a conveyor must [...] "keep track" [...] of where a box is, or improper operation will result.|$|E

40|$|Wheel {{traffic is}} {{considered}} {{a major cause of}} soil compaction in production agriculture. Soil compaction depends on initial conditions, load, contact area and tire type and shape at the soil surface. The use of tractors equipped with tracks instead of tires has the potential of reducing soil compaction because of reduced surface contact pressure and difference in load distribution over a relatively long-narrow track. The introduction of a new agricultural tractor equipped with a rubber <b>belt</b> <b>track</b> permits a crawler tractor to compete with a large four-wheel drive tractor in both speed and mobility. Soil bulk density was measured as an indication of compaction which results from trafficking with a rubber <b>belt</b> <b>track</b> tractor and a four-wheel drive tractor. The measurements were taken on three tillage treatments at three soil water contents. Most of the comparative differences in bulk density resulting from trafficking with the two tractors were non-significant at the 0. 10 level. Bulk densities at the deeper depths were significantly higher for the tire than the rubber <b>belt</b> <b>track</b> for some tillage treatments. However, in all comparisons, bulk density resulting from the rubber <b>belt</b> <b>track</b> was numerically less than from the tire...|$|R
30|$|We {{conclude}} {{by observing}} that the described procedure applies to a stand-alone, purely image-based, installation. In an integrated installation, the system may receive a feedback of a parcel approaching from other sensors, installed {{earlier in the}} conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>track.</b> In this case, we can exploit the information redundancy to obtain a more accurate estimate of the parcelâ€™s position and reduce the computation time required by the parcel detection module.|$|R
40|$|The {{energy loss}} due to {{indentation}} rolling resistance in {{a conveyor belt}} system can account for up to 60 % of the total power usage. It arises due to an asymmetric pressure distribution as a viscoelastic belt cover is indented by a rigid idler roll. This causes a retarding moment on the idler roll, dependent on the load, speed, idler diameter and {{the properties of the}} conveyor belt cover. As pouch conveyor systems become more prevalent in industry, the supporting structure, and thus the indentation rolling resistance of such systems is of importance. These designs typically employ curved belt profiles, or spherical idlers in order to aid <b>belt</b> <b>tracking</b> and closing. From this, a spherical indentation into a generalised Maxwell backing is modelled, and compared with experimental values. In addition to this, the strain dependency across the contact is investigated...|$|E

50|$|Each {{track is}} {{composed}} {{of two or more}} rubber belts joined into a loop. The loops are held together with interior wheel guides and exterior cleats, commonly called grousers. The tracks are driven by a large drive sprocket that engages the grousers in sequence and causes the track to rotate. Two <b>belt</b> <b>tracks</b> were common on early model Bombardiers and muskeg machines. For deep-snow use, wider <b>tracks,</b> employing additional <b>belts,</b> are used for added flotation over the snow.|$|R
50|$|Higham is {{surrounded}} by the villages of Gawber, Barugh Green, Dodworth, Redbrook and Pogmoor. Other places of note nearby are the villages of Silkstone, Cawthorne and Darton. Nearby places include Captain and Hugset Woods, and Higham Reservoir. Higham {{used to have a}} small drift mine known as the Higham Pumping Station. The drift was used for coal to come from Redbrook colliery and then up the <b>belt</b> <b>track</b> to Dodworth colliery to the screens and washers. There was an even older shaft that could still be seen in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Steel tracks {{revolving}} around pontoons were {{replaced with a}} system that employed two rubber belts with metal cleats, or grousers, attached to the outside perimeter to grip the snow. A series of wheels and guides were used inside the belts. Two drive sprockets on a hub drive the rubber <b>belted</b> <b>track.</b> The most modern version of the Sno-Cat track is the all-rubber Terra Track system. This system uses a wide single rubber belt, constructed with a multi-ply design similar to a modern car tire. The exterior perimeter employs molded rubber treads instead of the steel grousers of prior models.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this paper}} was {{developed}} a theoretical study, underpinning a solution which can be patented, for an adaptive tyre, different from the conventional one, which provides, on arable soil, the advantages of a larger contact surface, with quite uniform pressure distribution in the contact patch, such as for rubber <b>belt</b> <b>track.</b> On public roads, this tyre is capable to adapt so that the area of contact patch to be minimum and rolling resistance to be minimum. Although the estimated cost of achieving such a tyre is significantly higher compared to conventional tyres, especially if tyre production is not of large series, results obtained by simulation and numeric analysis using Finite Element Method are encouraging and they justify the need of such adaptive tyre for agricultural trailers...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is intended}} {{for use as a}} load-bearing device under cryogenic temperatures and/or abrasive conditions (i. e., during missions to the Moon). The innovation consists of small-diameter, ceramic fibers that are woven or braided into devices like ropes, <b>belts,</b> <b>tracks,</b> or cables. The fibers can be formed from a variety of ceramic materials like silicon carbide, carbon, aluminosilicate, or aluminum oxide. The fiber architecture of the weave or braid is determined by both the fiber properties and the mechanical requirements of the application. A variety of weave or braid architectures is possible for this application. Thickness of load-bearing devices can be achieved by using either a 3 D woven structure, or a layered, 2 D structure. For the prototype device, a belt approximately 0. 10 in. (0. 25 cm) thick, and 3. 0 in. (7. 6 cm) wide was formed by layering and stitching a 2 D aluminosilicate fiber weave...|$|R

40|$|Tractive {{performance}} comparisons among {{two different}} width rubber <b>belt</b> <b>tracks,</b> 46 cm (18 in.) and 81 cm (32 in.) wide, and two different size rear tires, 710 / 70 R 38 and 18. 4 R 46, {{were made on}} two different surface conditions. The belts were tested on a Caterpillar 55 tractor equipped with the Mobil-tracâ„¢ system and the tires on a John Deere 8400 mechanical front-wheel-drive (MFWD) tractor. The performance tests were completed on two surfaces, one being a non-tilled wheat stubble field and the second, the wheat stubble field tilled approximately 23 cm (9 in.) deep with a Noble blade sweep. Performance comparisons using tractive efficiency, dynamic traction ratio, and slip were made. Results of these performance comparisons between the belts and tires indicate that, in general, the belts performed better. The performance {{differences between the two}} belt widths were less defined. The performance differences between the two tires suggests that the narrower tire had a slight traction advantage...|$|R
5000|$|V belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) {{solved the}} {{slippage}} and alignment problem. It {{is now the}} basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly trapezoidal (hence the name [...] "V"). The [...] "V" [...] shape of the <b>belt</b> <b>tracks</b> in a mating groove in the pulley (or sheave), {{with the result that}} the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increasesâ€”the greater the load, the greater the wedging actionâ€”improving torque transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios. The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys. Optimal speed range is [...] V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.|$|R

The Belt Railway of Chattanooga was operated physically as well as financially by the Alabama Great Southern Railroad. In regards to finances, collections were entrusted to the credit of Charles Patten. These collections were made by a local agent and deposited in the First National Bank of Chattanooga. The engines used on the railway included numbers 104, 106, 141, 150, and 156. These engines sole purpose was to facilitate the Alabama Great Southern business. An industry called the Montague Company originated on the <b>belt</b> <b>tracks</b> at Chattanooga and consigned the loads {{of many of the}} cars that transported clay. The Belt Line continued in service after it was acquired by Southern Railway, but it ran for only a few years in the late 1880s and the early 1890s. Today, the only visible tracks still in place can be seen {{at the start of the}} line at EPB yards across from Warner Park and a small section near Bachman Street.
