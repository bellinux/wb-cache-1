2500|$|Ifit is unjust to take fixed payment {{rather than}} a share of profits and losses, why are fixed rent and fixed wages not unjust as well? (While some Islamist thinkers have {{promoted}} the idea that 'labor owned firms would express the spirit of Islam better' there is no movement to restrict businesses to profit-sharing payment for employees or even [...] "extensive debate on the subject".) To the claim that collecting interest on a <b>business</b> <b>loan</b> when the business has gone insolvent is unjust, Khan replies that in {{the overwhelming majority of}} cases both banks and lenders benefit from loans and it's not sensible to let the small fraction of bankruptcies dictate how finance is structured.|$|E

40|$|Adequate credit {{availability}} {{for small}} businesses is an important public policy issue because small businesses are essential for employment and economic growth for the economy. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 includes a provision that could potentially support financial institutions {{in the provision of}} credit to small businesses through the use of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system that are secured with small <b>business</b> <b>loans.</b> We explore the relation between FHLB advances to financial institutions and the provision of <b>loans</b> to small <b>businesses.</b> We find a positive link between the change in FHLB advances and the change in small <b>business</b> <b>loans</b> and the level of FHLB advances and the level of small <b>business</b> <b>loans.</b> This relation holds for large and small banks and pre- and post- 2007 recession. However, we find that the change in the proportion of small <b>business</b> <b>loans</b> to assets is only positively related to the change in the advances to assets ratio prior to the recessionary period. This suggests that banks substitute small <b>business</b> <b>loans</b> for other types of assets during relatively normal economic periods, but FHLB advances are a source of wholesale funds that will be invested in the most attractive financial assets available with no preference for any particular asset during periods of contracting credit...|$|R

40|$|Total <b>business</b> <b>loans</b> under $ {{1 million}} held by small U. S. banks {{continue}} to dwindle. Disproportionate negative growth at financially weak small banks {{has been an}} important factor in this decline. Loan volumes at strong small banks actually grew in 2011. The finding supports the view that supply conditions, not just tepid demand for credit, have affected bank lending to small <b>businesses.</b> Total <b>business</b> <b>loans</b> under $ 1 million held by small U. S. banks are shrinking. Although dollar volumes fell at a slower pace in the four quarters that ended in June 2012 than over the previous year, the persistent decrease remains a concern. A previous Economic Letter (Laderman and Gillan 2011) presented data suggesting that trends in aggregate nonperforming asset ratios for <b>business</b> <b>loans</b> under $ 1 million held by small banks may be related to trends in the growth of those loans. This Letter shows the relationship between growth in <b>business</b> <b>loans</b> of this size and the lender’s overall financial condition. Financially weak small banks, though they are in the minority, have accounted for most of this loan shrinkage. In fact, <b>business</b> <b>loans</b> under $ 1 million at strong small banks actually grew in 2011.
