5|$|Historian Steven Boyd {{argued that}} the {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to seek change <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> for Republicans rather than resisting the government.

5|$|Since general {{election}} in May 2013, numerous seats of the National Assembly of Pakistan become vacant. In most cases, the incumbent becomes ineligible {{to continue in}} office when a constituency election is invalidated <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> irregularities. In some case the incumbent died, resigned or vacated the seat in order to retain the seat the member won in their home constituency. Afterwards, by-elections were held in vacant constituencies to fill the vacant seats.|$|E

5|$|Charlton was an {{immediate}} success with Andrew Fisher and was promoted to the temporary chairmanship of committees in the House in 1913, however Charlton threatened to resign in 1915 over a dispute in government delays in granting the committee increased powers. Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his loyalty to the new Labor leader Billy Hughes <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> for Hughes' conscription referendum bill, {{even though he was}} vehemently opposed to conscription and fought hard against it. However, Charlton seemed to accept the affirmative result of the referendum and again proved his loyalty to Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism. Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E

Visitors to the Big Brother web site decided <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> that the housemates had failed the task. On Day 56, Noirin's ex-boyfriend Isaac entered the House, but left voluntarily shortly after Noirin's eviction on Day 58 with 60.0% of the public vote.|$|E

5|$|Of 234 {{representatives in}} the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the Thirty-third Congress. His {{relative}} seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, {{he was assigned to}} the Ways and Means Committee, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; {{it was the only time}} in his career that he solely managed a bill. His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents.|$|E
5|$|The T-Mobile Rookie Challenge {{featured}} {{a team of}} standout first-year players ('Rookies') against a team of standout second-year players ('Sophomores'). The game was divided into two twenty-minute halves, similar to college basketball. The participating players were chosen <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> among the league's assistant coaches. The Rookies team includes the first overall draft pick in 2008 NBA draft, Derrick Rose. The rest of the Rookies team consists of five of the top ten pick in the 2008 Draft and three players from the 2007 NBA draft who were in their first NBA season. The three players are the first overall draft pick Greg Oden and two Spanish players Rudy Fernández and Marc Gasol. The Sophomores team features four players from the previous Rookie Challenge game which are Kevin Durant, Jeff Green, Al Horford and Luis Scola.|$|E
5|$|Mills's and Cleveland's defeat on the tariff {{bill could}} be {{considered}} a victory for Randall, but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker's protectionist ideas now made him in his party: only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions. The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade, adopting a pro-tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention. At the same time, Randall seemingly reversed his long-standing commitment to fiscal economy <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> with the Republicans to override Cleveland's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act. The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran (or their widows) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor, regardless of whether his disability was war-related. Cleveland's veto was in line with his record of small-government cost-cutting, with which Randall would normally have sympathized. Randall, perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district, joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland's veto. Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs; by increasing federal spending, he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs. Whatever the reason, the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats.|$|E

5|$|The National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game is {{an annual}} {{exhibition}} basketball game played between the Eastern-Conference and the Western-Conference All-Stars. It {{is the main}} event of the NBA All-Star Weekend. Twelve players—five starters and seven s—from each conference are chosen {{from a pool of}} 120 players—60 players from each conference with 24 guards and 24 frontcourts (forwards and centers)—listed on the ballots by a panel of sport writers and broadcasters. The starters are chosen by a combination of fans, media, and current players. Fans may vote using a variety of online platforms, and account for 50% of the vote, with the media and current players each accounting for 25%. The reserves are chosen <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> among the head coaches of each team's particular conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players, and can select two guards, three big men, and two players regardless of positions. If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the NBA commissioner will select a replacement. The 1999 All-Star Game was canceled due to the league's lockout.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term in parliament, Playford also gained {{attention}} for his unconvincing command of the English language; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly, bad syntax and speaking in a monotone. He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints {{from the likes of}} Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him. Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military. He continued to stridently support economic rationalism, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective. Playford further criticised government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced tariff protection as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation. In 1936, Playford defied his party <b>by</b> <b>voting</b> against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe the party line, Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.|$|E
