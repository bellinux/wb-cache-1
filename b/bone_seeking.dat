This study aimed to compare 11 different radioisotopes currently in use or under research. Hence, computational models were used to estimate the percentage of deoxyribonucleic acid damage, the probability of correct DNA repair, and the radiation-induced cellular effects post-irradiation. 223 Ra alpha particles, 177 Lu beta minus particles, and 170 Tm beta minus particles induced the highest cell death of all investigated particles and radioisotopes. The cell survival fraction measured post-irradiation with beta minus particles emitted by 89 Sr and 153 Sm, was higher than 177 Lu beta minus particles and 223 Ra alpha particles.

40|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>seeking</b> radiopharmaceuticals are {{indicated}} in cancer patients with multiple painful skeletal metastases. The {{majority of these}} patients are hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients in an advanced stage of their disease. <b>Bone</b> <b>seeking</b> radiopharmaceuticals relieve pain and improve the patients quality of life. The mostly used radiopharmaceuticals are 89 SrCl 2 (Metastron), 153 Sm-EDTMP (Quadramet) and 186 Re-HEDP. Differences between 89 SrCl 2, 153 Sm-EDTMP and 186 Re-HEDP were investigated. It was found that urinary excretion of activity is rapid in patients treated with 153 Sm-EDTMP and 186 Re-HEDP, in contrast to 89 SrCl 2. Together with differences in biodistribution and physical decay this leads to differences in radiation burden to bystanders. The effective doses were < 0. 1 mSv for 89 SrCl 2, 0. 3 mSv for 186 Re-HEDP and 1. 6 mSv for 153 Sm-EDTMP. In all cases however the calculated effective doses for bystanders were well below the recommended values. A treatment guideline was drawn using these data. In order to improve the patients’ clinical condition it may be beneficial to combine different treatment modalities. This may possibly lead to additive or even synergistic effects. In prostate cancer patients bisphosphonates are used to treat and prevent so called skeletal related events (fractures, hypercalcaemia, spinal cord compression). This may add to the palliative effect of <b>bone</b> <b>seeking</b> radiopharmaceuticals. Nevertheless, the European label of 153 Sm-EDTMP includes the contra-indication that “it {{should not be used}} concurrently with other bisphosponates if an interference is shown on the 99 mTc-labeled bisphosphonate bone scan”. This contra-indication is based on the hypothesis that as both drugs interact at the hydroxyapatite crystal surface of the skeleton, competition might exist for uptake by bone. However, it was shown that the combined use of zoledronic acid has no effect on the uptake of 153 Sm-EDTMP in skeletal metastases of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. Combined treatment with 153 Sm-EDTMP and zoledronic acid was both feasible and safe. The efficacy data on the patients treated in this phase I setting were regarded as pilot phase II data. Although the study comprised small numbers the results confirmed the utility of bone markers (bone specific alkaline phosphatase [BAP], procollagen type I N propeptide [PINP], N-terminal type I collagen peptide [NTX]) as predictors of clinical outcome. And they were first tested in the treatment monitoring of <b>bone</b> <b>seeking</b> radiopharmaceuticals. Bone markers may well prove to be very useful predictors of response in the treatment with <b>bone</b> <b>seeking</b> radiopharmaceuticals. They should be used in future trials. Another combination of 188 Re-HEDP and capecitabine (Xeloda) was tested in a phase I capecitabine dose-escalation study. Capecitabine was used as a radiation sensitizer. It proved to be feasible and safe. Phase II efficacy testing using the maximum tolerable dose of 2500 mg/m 2 /day capecitabine in combination with 37 MBq/kg 188 Re-HEDP is underway. It was concluded that patients treated with 89 SrCl 2, 186 Re-HEDP or 153 Sm-EDTMP do not lead to unacceptable radiation burden to health care workers and patients’ families. Combined treatment regimens (153 Sm-EDTMP / zoledronic acid and 188 Re-HEDP / capecitabine) are feasible and safe. Bone markers seem to be good candidates to predict response...|$|E

The general principle is that an opponents ability to attack should be destroyed rather than trying to hurt them to convince them to stop. Thus many strikes are aimed at the hands and arms, hoping to break the hand holding the weapon or cut the nerves or tendons controlling it (the concept of defanging the snake), but strikes to the eyes and legs are important.

40|$|Purpose: Throughout the years, the palliative {{treatment}} of bone metastases using <b>bone</b> <b>seeking</b> radiotracers {{has been part}} of the therapeutic resources used in oncology, but the choice of which <b>bone</b> <b>seeking</b> agent to use is not consensual across sites and limited data are available comparing the characteristics of each radioisotope. Computational simulation is a simple and practical method to study and to compare a variety of radioisotopes for different medical applications, including the palliative {{treatment of}} bone metastases. This study aims to evaluate and compare 11 different radioisotopes currently in use or under research for the palliative treatment of bone metastases using computational methods. Methods: Computational models were used to estimate the percentage of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage (fast Monte Carlo damage algorithm), the probability of correct DNA repair (Monte Carlo excision repair algorithm), and the radiation-induced cellular effects (virtual cell radiobiology algorithm) post-irradiation with selected particles emitted by phosphorus- 32 (P- 32), strontium- 89 (Sr- 89), yttrium- 90 (Y- 90), tin- 117 (Sn- 117 m), samarium- 153 (Sm- 153), holmium- 166 (Ho- 166), thulium- 170 (Tm- 170), lutetium- 177 (Lu- 177), rhenium- 186 (Re- 186), rhenium- 188 (Re- 188), and radium- 223 (Ra- 223). Results: Ra- 223 alpha particles, Lu- 177 beta minus particles, and Tm- 170 beta minus particles induced the highest cell death of all investigated particles and radioisotopes. The cell survival fraction measured post-irradiation with beta minus particles emitted by Sr- 89 and Sm- 153, two of the most frequently used radionuclides in the palliative treatment of bone metastases in clinical routine practice, was higher than Lu- 177 beta minus particles and Ra- 223 alpha particles. Conclusions: Ra- 223 and Lu- 177 hold the highest potential for palliative treatment of bone metastases of all radioisotopes compared in this study. Data reported here may prompt future in vitro and in vivo experiments comparing different radionuclides for palliative treatment of bone metastases, raise the need for the careful rethinking of the current widespread clinical use of Sr- 89 and Sm- 153, and perhaps strengthen the use of Ra- 223 and Lu- 177 in the palliative treatment of bone metastases.

40|$|Background: The {{fundamental}} principles of internal targeted alpha therapy for cancer were established many decades ago. The high {{linear energy transfer}} (LET) of alpha radiation to the targeted cancer cellscauses double strand breaks in DNA. At the same time, the short range radiation spares adjacent normal tissues. This targeted approach complements conventional external beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Such therapies fail on several fronts, such as lack of control of some primary cancers (e. g. glioblastoma multiforme) and to inhibit the development of lethal metastatic cancer after successful treatment of the primary cancer. Objective: This review charts the developing role of systemic high LET, internal radiation therapy. Method: Targeted alpha therapy is a rapidly advancing experimental therapy that holds promise to deliver high cytotoxicity to targeted cancer cells. Initially thought to be indicated for leukemia and micrometastases, there is now evidence that solid tumors can also be regressed. Results: Alpha therapy may be molecular or physiological in its targeting. Alpha emitting radioisotopes such as Bi- 212, Bi- 213, At- 211 and Ac- 225 are used to label monoclonal antibodies or proteins that target specifc cancer cells. Alternatively, Radium- 233 is used for palliative therapy of breast and prostate cancers because of its <b>bone</b> <b>seeking</b> properties. Conclusion: Preclinical studies and clinical trials of alpha therapy are discussed for leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme, bone metastases, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and other cancers...|$|E
40|$|Bone metastases are a {{very common}} problem in {{clinical}} oncology, affecting approximately 70 % of patients with prostate or breast cancer. Radiopharmaceutical therapy has proved effective with minimal side effects for treatment of refractory painful skeletal metastases of the blastic or mixed type, but administered activities are generally based on limited series of clinical studies without a proven correlation between the activity and the delivered dose to metastatic lesions. In bone pain palliation therapy the red marrow is generally the dose-limiting organ and due to the complex microstructure of the skeleton it {{has been difficult to}} calculate accurately the dose deposited to this region. Thus, the estimation of dose to the skeletal system at the microscopic level has been limited by the lack of a realistic characterization of the trabecular bone architecture. The dose distribution to bone marrow of metastatic lesions for the <b>bone</b> <b>seeking</b> radiopharmaceutical 153 Sm EDTMP has been evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation. In this setting a new dosimetric model has been developed based on the micro-CT analysis of bone metastases to investigate the morphology, topology and texture of bone samples based on assessment of the micro-structural parameters classically evaluated with histomorphometry.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) design {{derives from the}} difficulty in carefully addressing their inhibitory activity towards the MMP isoforms involved in many pathological conditions. In particular, specific metalloproteinases, such as MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, are key regulators of the 'vicious cycle' occurring between tumor metastases growth and bone remodeling. In an attempt to devise new approaches to selective inhibitor derivatives, we describe novel bisphosphonate <b>bone</b> <b>seeking</b> MMP inhibitors (BP-MMPIs), capable to be selectively targeted and to overcome undesired side effects of broad spectrum MMPIs. In vitro activity (IC 50 values) for each inhibitor was determined against MMP- 2, - 8, - 9 and - 14, because of their relevant role in skeletal development and renewal. The results show that BP-MMPIs reached IC 50 values of enzymatic inhibition in the low micromolar range. Computational studies, used to rationalize some trends in the observed inhibitory profiles, suggest a possible differential binding mode in MMP- 2 that explains the selective inhibition of this isoform. In addition, survival assay was conducted on J 774 cell line, a well known model system {{used to evaluate the}} structure-activity relationship of BPs for inhibiting bone resorption. The resulting data, confirming the specific activity of BP-MMPIs, and their additional proved propensity to bind hydroxyapatite powder in vitro, suggest a potential use of BP-MMPIs in skeletal malignancies...|$|E
40|$|Individuals who {{experience}} decreases in load-bearing bone densities can {{be subject to}} a higher risk of bone fracture during daily activity. Astronauts may lose up to nine percent of their load-bearing bone density for every month they spend in space [1]. Because of this, specialized countermeasures reduce percent loss in bone density and reduce fracture risk upon returning to Earth. Astronauts will typically not be at risk for fracture during spaceflight, because of the lesser loads experienced in microgravity conditions. However, once back on Earth, astronauts have an increased risk for bone fracture as a result of weakened bone and return to 1 G conditions [2]. It is therefore important to understand the significance of any bone density loss in addition to developing exercises in an attempt to limit losses in <b>bone</b> strength. NASA <b>seeks</b> to develop a deeper understanding of fracture risk through the development of a computational bone strength model to assess the bone fracture risk of astronauts pre-flight and post-flight. This study addresses the several key processes needed to develop such strength analyses using medical image processing and finite element modeling...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Appropriate {{selection}} {{of material and}} geometric characteristics of intraosseus pillar implant part creates a possibility to control the bone tissue loading. Design/methodology/approach: A basic tool that is commonly used the evaluation of bone loading state is the linear FEM analysis. It requires setting of appropriate experiment conditions. Hence, an analysis {{has been carried out}} {{in order to determine the}} influence of dividing method of finite elements (tetragonal type 187 in Ansys system v. 11) on stresses in pillar and surrounding <b>bone</b> tissue. Findings: <b>Seeking</b> of loading values cortical bone tissue is highly affected by the increase of mesh density on the edge of implant insertion into the cortex bone. Loading stresses values have significantly increased along with increased mesh density, whereas the differences have even reach 47 MPa. Research limitations/implications: Research has been carried out only for the Ansys system in the linear range assuming standard shape and mechanical characteristics of implant and bone, as well as regarding the after the osseointegration phase because if the presumed complete adherence of the pillar to the bone. Practical implications: Excessive increase of mesh density leads to overestimation of loading stresses values and further to an unjustified increase of pillars’ diameter. At the other hand, too large elements might lead, through an underestimation of loading stress level, to overloading atrophy of bone tissue. Originality/value: This paper points out the necessity of more determined activities aimed on defining appropriate and uniform FEM experiment conditions that would enable achievement of more real results of model researches and their comparability...|$|R
40|$|From the Cradle to the Grave: A Novel and Exegesis is {{concerned}} with maternal infanticide. This is, however, a somewhat inflammatory and perhaps misleading statement. While it {{is concerned}} with the infanticidal mother, she is in this instance largely an icon, a way into an exploration of diverse aspects of motherhood, especially negative ideas about mothers and mothering. It would be more precise to say that this thesis {{is concerned with}} the paradoxical Childless Mother. Both the novel and exegesis circle around ideas about parenting that seek to confront traditional assumptions about the connections and differences between good and bad mothering. The exegesis - From the Cradle to the Grave - does this through a discussion of various aspects of culture, which produce and are produced by mothering practices. In particular it engages with childcare literature, medical and legal engagements with women and children, and myth and fairy tales. The novel - The Bone Flute - is another exploration of the paradoxical nature of motherhood. While the exegesis seeks to draw together some of the material and historical truths of mothering, the novel addresses another kind of truth; through various narrative devices it seeks a different type of engagement with the lived realities of women. Both texts ask questions about the nature of maternity and its relationship to femininity. Both attempt {{to come to terms with}} the paradoxical status of mothers without children. The exegesis is an explication of the research processes, the reflections and considerations that preceded and accompanied the writing of The <b>Bone</b> Flute. It <b>seeks</b> to make explicit the tangled web of reading and thinking that informed the writing of a novel - from initial impulse to final draft. The exegesis is not, however, an explicit explanation of how the novel was written. Rather the two texts existed (and exist) symbiotically - each inciting and reflecting upon the other. While the exegesis explores the materia...|$|R
