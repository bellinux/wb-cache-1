5|$|In April 1888, the Church Board of Education {{was created}} {{as part of}} the LDS Church, {{inspired}} by a proposal made by Maeser in 1887. Maeser was made a member of the board, and was later appointed the superintendent of the Church Educational System. The Board of Education was created to maintain and supervise church schools. This position later became the Commissioner of Church Education. As Superintendent, Maeser helped establish initial policies for new academies established by the church. He also helped train teachers, and gave suggestions on the architecture of new school designs. By 1889, Maeser oversaw 19 schools that operated under the academy system. In 1889, Church Board of Education established a <b>board</b> <b>of</b> <b>examiners</b> to certify teachers. The board awarded Maeser a Doctor of Letters and Didactics degree that same year. Maeser also continued writing in the Juvenile Instructor in the 1890s to clarify church educational policies.|$|E

500|$|Historically, the actuarial {{profession}} {{has been reluctant}} to specify the pass marks for its examinations ( [...] , [...] ). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Examiners</b> of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, [...] "Although students find it hard to believe, the <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Examiners</b> does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (and do). They are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not whether you can achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." [...] In 2000, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers [...] The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that [...] "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass.".|$|E

2500|$|In 1890, the Association of Provincial Land Surveyors was {{launched}} during a two-day long meeting held in Victoria and attended by 22 surveyors. [...] In April 1891, the Provincial Land Surveyors' Act was proclaimed by the British Columbia Government {{in response to}} a petition made to the government by the Association, in which they requested, [...] "(...) the introduction of an act to protect authorized surveyors in the performance of their duties, to prevent unqualified persons acting as surveyors and to provide for duly qualified persons from time to time being admitted to practice." [...] Framed by W.S. Gore, then the Provincial Surveyor General, the [...] Act established a <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Examiners</b> (made up of the Surveyor General and five other surveyors) and set down policies for articling pupils. [...] Thereafter, only surveyors who passed the examinations and subsequently were approved by the Board were allowed to practice in the province of British Columbia. Authorized surveyors were then called [...] "Provincial Land Surveyors of the Province of British Columbia"; they received a numbered commission and seal, and were entitled to append the initials [...] "PLS" [...] after their names. The PLS group of surveyors eventually numbered eighty-five members. [...] The Act also incorporated a governing body - the Association of Provincial Land Surveyors - for their profession. However, the Association was relatively weak, and in 1905 it was replaced by the Corporation of Land Surveyors of the Province of British Columbia. [...] The Corporation was established under new legislation, the Provincial Land Surveyors' Act (1905), which strengthened the management of the profession. [...] A new <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Examiners</b> was formed and, as before, only surveyors who were recognized by that Board were entitled to practice in the province. Those so recognized were designated by the initials [...] "BCLS" [...] being appended to their name. Existing PLSs and LSs were also permitted to continue practicing under a grandfather clause. Although the Provincial Surveyors' Act has since been amended, the Association of British Columbia Land Surveyors now numbers over nine hundred and forty BCLS Commissions and continues to be the governing body of the profession. In order to practice legal land surveying in British Columbia, one must be a commissioned BCLS in good standing.|$|E
