40|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Module</b> (BCM) {{tuning in}} terms of the Antilock Braking system (ABS) and the Dynamic Stability Traction Control (DSTC) is {{normally}} a time consuming and costly procedure since it involves comprehensive physical testing on the prototype vehicles in early phases of the vehicle development. To reduce prototype vehicles and make the procedure time efficient, it is envisioned that BCM tuning will be achieved using Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) in all future V 54 X cars at Volvo Car Corporation. The thesis work aims to facilitate method development for Virtual Brake Software Release which constitutes BCM tuning using CAE tools in a closed loop control environment using Global Optimization tools. The CAE environment demands a high correlation between the simulated model (plant) and the actual vehicle. For the preparation of this plant model, tire parameter optimization using global optimization tools is performed using data from physical tests carried out on the test track to achieve good correlation between virtual and physical tests. These maneuvers are reproduced on IPG CarMaker to optimize the tire parameters in the pure slip region. Subsequently, the identification of a reference model was carried out using a 2 DOF model to tune with respect to the plant. The latter part of the thesis discusses various simplified DSTC strategies and a framework to perform the <b>Brake</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Module</b> tuning. It is realized that CAE tuning {{in terms of}} <b>Brake</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Module</b> is possible with an appropriate vehicle model in the CAE environment. As a future scope, sophisticated BCM model could be tuned using CAE tool; however, the constraints set up and weighting factors in the optimization would determine the final tuned values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} a dynamic control {{allocation}} approach is presented for an automotive vehicle yaw stabilization scheme. The stabilization strategy {{consists of a}} high level module that deals with the vehicle motion control objective (yaw rate reference generation and tracking), a low level module that handles the braking control for each wheel (longitudinal slip control and maximal tire-road friction parameter estimation) and an intermediate level dynamic control allocation module that generates the longitudinal slip reference for the low level <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> and commands front wheel steering angle corrections. The control allocation design is such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque calculated form the high level module, with desirable distribution of control forces satisfying actuator constraints and minimal control effort objectives. Conditions for uniform asymptotic stability are given for the case when the control allocation includes adaptation of the tire-road maximal friction coefficients, and the scheme has been implemented in a realistic non linear multi body vehicle simulation environment. The simulation cases show that the yaw control allocation strategy stabilizes the vehicle in extreme maneuvers where the non linear vehicle yaw dynamics otherwise (without active braking or active steering) becomes unstable {{in the sense of}} over- or under steering. The control allocation implementation is efficient and suitable for low cost automotive electronic control units. I...|$|E

Located behind the seats are a series of commercial grade [...] "D" [...] sized NiMH batteries wired to provide a nominal 144 V DC.

40|$|A new {{cooperative}} <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy (CBCS) {{is proposed}} for a parallel {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) with both a regenerative braking system and an antilock braking system (ABS) to achieve improved braking performance and energy regeneration. The braking system of the vehicle {{is based on a}} new method of HEV braking torque distribution that makes the antilock braking system work together with the regenerative braking system harmoniously. In the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy, a sliding mode controller (SMC) for ABS is designed to maintain the wheel slip within an optimal range by adjusting the hydraulic braking torque continuously; to reduce the chattering in SMC, a boundary-layer method with moderate tuning of a saturation function is also investigated; based on the wheel slip ratio, battery state of charge (SOC), and the motor speed, a fuzzy logic control strategy (FLC) is applied to adjust the regenerative braking torque dynamically. In order to evaluate the performance of the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy, the <b>braking</b> system model of a hybrid electric vehicle is built in MATLAB/SIMULINK.
