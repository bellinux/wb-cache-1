50|$|Filters may be {{positioned}} in many locations. The filter may be located between the reservoir and the pump intake. <b>Blockage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> will cause cavitation and possibly {{failure of the}} pump. Sometimes the filter is located between the pump and the control valves. This arrangement is more expensive, since the filter housing is pressurized, but eliminates cavitation problems and protects the control valve from pump failures. The third common filter location is just before the return line enters the reservoir. This location is relatively insensitive to blockage and {{does not require a}} pressurized housing, but contaminants that enter the reservoir from external sources are not filtered until passing through the system at least once.filters are used from 7 micron to 15 micron depends upon the viscosity grade of hydraulic oil.|$|E
40|$|Humic and fulvic acids {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to {{interfere}} with virus recovery by microporous filters. Two electropositively charged types of filter (Seitz S and Zeta Plus 60 S) were used to concentrate poliovirus in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> humic materials. Humic acid inhibited virus adsorption, but even at the highest humic acid concentrations tested (200 mg/liter), 30 to 40 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus was recovered by <b>the</b> <b>filters.</b> Fulvic acid, tested with Zeta Plus filters, did not affect virus recovery. For comparison, two electronegatively charged filter types were tested (Cox and Balston). These two types of filter were more sensitive to interference at lower concentrations of humic acid than the more positively charged filters. With Balston filters, at humic acid concentrations above 10 mg/liter, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virus was recovered in the filtrate. Fulvic acid, tested with Balston filters, did not interfere with virus recovery. With <b>the</b> electropositively charged <b>filters,</b> <b>the</b> humic materials adsorbed efficiently, even at high input concentrations. Interference with virus adsorption occurred at humic acid concentrations which were below <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> saturation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filters.</b> In addition, in high-volume experiments, humic acid led to premature <b>blockage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filters.</b> <b>The</b> efficiency <b>of</b> virus recovery by a second concentration step, organic flocculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> eluate, was tested. For all <b>the</b> <b>filter</b> types tested, this procedure was not affected by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> humic or fulvic acid in the input water...|$|R
40|$|The simple {{operational}} {{and maintenance}} requirements of slow sand filtration (SSF), coupled with its high biological treatment efficiency {{makes it an}} attractive technology. <b>The</b> main limitation <b>of</b> SSF is its vulnerability to high suspended solids loadings. Pre-treatment in such instances {{can be achieved by}} gravel filtration. Cases of gravel pre-filtration underperformance have been attributed to significant fractions of influent suspended particles in the colloidal range. Maximum limits <b>of</b> turbidity for <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> gravel pre-filters have also been suggested. A simple intervention to overcome such water quality constraints can be through <b>the</b> dosing <b>of</b> a coagulant (aluminium sulfate) upstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-filtration stage; enhancing the pre-treatment efficiency, in what could be defined as direct (gravel) filtration. Previous studies have investigated its use as a pre-treatment for SSF; however, the results emphasise pre-filtration treatment efficiency and do not consider <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-treatment in protecting <b>the</b> slow sand <b>filters.</b> Also, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential toxic effects of A 1 residuals, its upstream use in relation to a biological SSF treatment has never been properly evaluated. <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> this study were: assess the efficiency as well as <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> chemically- enhanced up-flow gravel filters in series (UGFS) as pre-treatment for SSF and study <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> aluminium residuals on the treatment performance and potential effects on biological activity. Preliminary experiments and first set of runs with chemically-enhanced pre-filter showed evidence of wall-effects due to the media size/column diameter ratio. This experimental design shortcoming was thought not to have affected <b>the</b> overall trends <b>of</b> results and was addressed for <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> pilot-experiments on which most conclusions are based. The results from the experimental work have shown that chemically-enhanced gravel pre-filtration can be effective only if coagulant dose is carefully controlled. Contrary to previous research, it was found that when resorting to chemically-enhanced pre-treatment (with alum) turbidities of less than 2 NTU (nephelometric turbidity units) should be targeted for in order to ensure an efficient and effective SSF pre-treatment. Such control will minimise A 1 residuals that can otherwise cause a premature <b>blockage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slow sand <b>filter</b> by A 1 hydroxide precipitates even with influent turbidities below 10 NTU. This was speculated to occur possibly due to size and mechanical properties of deposits retained on <b>the</b> uppermost layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SSF beds. A 1 speciation analyses revealed that A 1 residuals from chemically-enhanced pre-filtration were found to be mostly of inorganically- bound Al. This fraction consisted mainly of A 1 in its form which is considered to be potentially more bioavailable (and possibly toxic) to aquatic (micro) organisms. However, slow sand filtration column trials found that <b>filters</b> dosed with <b>the</b> potentially more labile form of A 1 did not show any significant difference in terms of treatment performance parameters and biological activity indicators. It has been demonstrated that chemically-enhanced pre-filtration (with alum) may not be an effective pre-treatment on the basis that it may cause an early <b>blockage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slow sand <b>filters.</b> There was no evidence of effect of A 1 on biological treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slow sand filtration process...|$|R
