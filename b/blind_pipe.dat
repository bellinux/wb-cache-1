40|$|The Cretaceous (133 Ma) Kroonstad Group II Kimberlite Cluster {{is located}} {{approximately}} 200 km south west of Johannesburg on the Kaapvaal Craton. The cluster {{is made up}} of six kimberlite pipes and numerous other intrusive dike/sill bodies. Three of the pipes are analysed in this study, which includes the: Voorspoed, Lace (Crown) and Besterskraal North pipes. These pipes were emplaced at surface into the Karoo Supergroup, which is comprised of older sedimentary rocks (300 - 185 Ma) overlain by flood basalts (185 Ma). At depth the pipes have intruded the Transvaal (2100 - 2600 Ma) and Ventersdorp (2700 Ma) Supergroups, which are comprised dominantly of carbonates and various volcanic units respectively. The pipes have typical morphology of South African pipes with circular to sub-circular plan views and steep 82 o pipe margins. The Voorspoed pipe is 12 ha in size and is characterised by the presence of a large block of Karoo basalt approximately 6 ha in size at the current land surface. This large basalt block extends to a maximum of 300 m below the current land surface. The main Lace pipe is 2 ha is size with a smaller (< 0. 5 ha) satellite pipe approximately 50 m to the west. No information is available on the morphology of the Besterskraal North pipe as it is sub-economic and no mining has occurred. Samples from the Besterskraal North pipe were collected from the De Beers archives. The Kroonstad Cluster has been subjected to approximately 1750 m of erosion post-emplacement, which has been calculated by the analysis of the crustal xenoliths with the pipe infill. The hypabyssal kimberlite from the three pipes shows a gradational evolution in magma compositions, indicated by the mineralogy and geochemistry. The Lace pipe is the least evolved and has characteristics more similar to Group I kimberlites. The Voorspoed and Besterskraal North kimberlite are intermediately and highly evolved respectively. The gradational evolution is marked by an increase in SiO 2 and Na 2 O contents. Furthermore the occurrence of abundant primary diopside, aegirine, sanidine, K-richterite and leucite indicates evolution of the magma. The root zones of the pipes are characterised by globular segregationary transitional kimberlite, which is interpreted to be hypabyssal and not the result of pyroclastic welding/agglutination. The hypabyssal transitional kimberlite (HKt) is characterised by incipient globular segregationary textures only and the typical tuffisitic transitional kimberlite (TKt) end member (Hetman et al. 2004) is not observed. The HKt contact with the overlying volcaniclastic kimberlite (VK) infill is sharp and not gradational. The presence of HKt in the satellite <b>blind</b> <b>pipe</b> at Lace further indicates that the distinct kimberlite rock type must be forming sub-volcanically. The HKt is distinctly different at the Voorspoed and Lace pipes, which is likely a result of differing compositions of the late stage magmatic liquid. Microlitic clinopyroxene is only observed at the Lace HKt and is interpreted to form as a result of both crustal xenolith contamination and CO 2 degassing. Furthermore the HKt is intimately associated with contact breccias in the sidewall. The root zones of the Kroonstad pipes are interpreted to form through the development of a sub-volcanic embryonic pipe. The volcaniclastic kimberlite (VK) infill of the Kroonstad pipes is not typical of South African tuffisitic Class 1 kimberlite pipes. The VK at Voorspoed is characterised by numerous horizontally layered massive volcaniclastic kimberlite (MVK) units, which are interpreted to have formed in a deep open vent through primary pyroclastic deposition. MVK is the dominant rock type infilling the Voorspoed pipe, however numerous other minor units occur. Normally graded units are interpreted to form through gravitational collapse of the tuff ring. MVK units rich in Karoo basalt and/or Karoo sandstone are interpreted to form through gravitational sidewall failure deep within an open vent. Magmaclasts are interpreted to form in the HKt during the development of an embryonic pipe and therefore the term autolith or nucleated autolith may be applied. Debate on the validity of the term nucleated autolith is beyond this study and therefore the term nucleated magmaclast is used to refer to spherical magmaclasts in the VK. The emplacement of the Kroonstad pipes is particularly complex and is not similar to typical Class 1 tuffisitic kimberlites. However the initial stage of pipe emplacement is similar to typical South African kimberlites and is interpreted to be through the development of an embryonic pipe as described by Clement (1982). The vent clearing eruption is interpreted to be from the bottom up through the exsolution of juvenile volatiles and the pipe shape is controlled by the depth of the eruption (+/- 2 km) (Skinner, 2008). The initial embryonic pipe development and explosive eruption is similar to other South African kimberlites, however the vent is cleared and left open, which is typical of Class 2 Prairies type and Class 3 Lac de Gras type pipes. The latter vent infilling processes are similar to Class 3 kimberlites from Lac de Gras and are dominated at the current level by primary pyroclastic deposition...|$|E

Older quad-BOPs have a different ram {{for each of these}} functions (<b>blind,</b> shear, <b>pipe,</b> slip). Newer dual-BOPs combine some of these functions together to need just two distinct rams (shear-blind, pipe-slip).|$|R
40|$|In this project, we have modeled and {{simulated}} a Double Skin Facade (hereafter DSF), 6 meters {{wide and}} 4 high. An average day {{was calculated for}} every month with official weather data and ANSYS FLUENT v 15 ’s Solar Calculator. The focus of the project is to help alleviate {{one of the problems}} of DSF: heat accumulating inside of the building because radiation transforms into heat, which is then stuck inside due to the glass’ thermal isolation properties, similar to a greenhouse. The design consists of a series of Venetian <b>blinds</b> connected by <b>pipes</b> through which water is circulated, accumulating sun’s radiated heat and remove it from the façade. In the results section, the amount of heat is analyzed and compared with the base case without the blind system, as studied by my colleagues J. Parra and A. Ravello in their senior project. The conclusion is that we can achieve significant energetic savings thanks to this design...|$|R
5000|$|Pet Engine was an alternative/power-pop {{band that}} formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, {{in the early}} 1990s under the name [...] "Blackfish" [...] until a Florida-based [...] "Blackfish" [...] {{achieved}} success and forced a name change. Although they never achieved widespread commercial success, Pet Engine did release three albums and one EP on its label, Don't Records. The singles [...] "Place to Breathe", [...] "Reinventing the Wheel" [...] and [...] "Popular Teenage Disease" [...] achieved a moderate amount of radio play in several American radio markets. The band was included on the Aware Records compilation volume 8 which also featured up-and-coming artists John Mayer and Howie Day. During their career, P.E. served as support for Oasis, Lemonheads, Goo Goo Dolls, Violent Femmes, <b>Blind</b> Melon, Verve <b>Pipe</b> and Mason Jennings among others. Their last official performance before a series of reunions came at Summerfest playing with Fountains of Wayne and Wilco. The band achieved a cult following in the Milwaukee music scene, often playing with popular Milwaukee bands like Citizen King and The Gufs, and were a regular act at Milwaukee's Summerfest for several years. Although Pet Engine broke up in early 2003, they were briefly reunited when they played at Summerfest 2006.|$|R
