25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give.

Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the side of the bed, leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him on the <b>bedside</b> <b>table</b> stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding.

The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background HAIs {{remain a}} {{frequent}} complication for hospitalised patients and pose {{a challenge that}} must be tackled by our health systems. Methods Quasi-experimental study. In {{order to determine the}} antimicrobial effectiveness of surface coating agents containing silver ions (BactiBlock®) the degree of contamination of several surfaces in two ICU wards was compared. The association between application of Bactiblock® and surface contamination was analysed using a relative risk (RR). Multivariate logistic regressions were performed for each product applied and each sampling location to adjust for the RR of the contamination of surfaces treated with Bactiblock® for the independent variables. Results Surface contamination was observed in 31. 5 % of treated samples and 27. 4 of untreated samples. Contamination was equally prominent on <b>bedside</b> <b>Tables</b> (38. 7 %), bed rails (38. 4 %) and sinks (38. 3 %), while the walls showed minimum contamination (2. 6 %). For beds under isolation protocols, contamination was higher (32. 6 %) than when no protocol was followed (26. 5 %) but the difference was not significant (p =  0. 148). After stratification for application method and adjusting the multivariate models for period of the study and presence of isolated patients, the risk of contamination after the intervention increased when the coating agent was applied using a spray (OR =  1. 79; 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 2. 95, particularly in a dry and rugged surface such as that of <b>bedside</b> <b>Tables</b> (OR =  2. 59; 95 % CI: 1. 22 - 5. 52); and decreased when the product was applied using a roller on a smooth and continuously cleaned (or wet) Surface (OR =  0. 42; 95 % CI: 0. 19 - 0. 92). Conclusion Coating of hospital surfaces with substances containing silver ions may reduce bacterial growth. However, the effectiveness of the coating agent is affected by application method and environmental conditions and the type and cleanness of the surface...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to assess}} the {{efficiency}} of cleaning/disinfection of surfaces of an Intensive Care Unit. METHOD: descriptive-exploratory study with quantitative approach conducted {{over the course of}} four weeks. Visual inspection, bioluminescence adenosine triphosphate and microbiological indicators were used to indicate cleanliness/disinfection. Five surfaces (bed rails, <b>bedside</b> <b>tables,</b> infusion pumps, nurses' counter, and medical prescription table) were assessed before and after the use of rubbing alcohol at 70 % (w/v), totaling 160 samples for each method. Non-parametric tests were used considering statistically significant differences at p< 0. 05. RESULTS: after the cleaning/disinfection process, 87. 5, 79. 4 and 87. 5 % of the surfaces were considered clean using the visual inspection, bioluminescence adenosine triphosphate and microbiological analyses, respectively. A statistically significant decrease was observed in the disapproval rates after the cleaning process considering the three assessment methods; the visual inspection was the least reliable.

Some of the items that were discussed in the research include: stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, keyboards, phones, <b>bedside</b> <b>tables,</b> electrocardiogram (ECG) wires, and lab coats. From the evidence based practice research articles, it was evident that more focus needs to be placed on the daily cleaning and disinfection of equipment that receives frequent use to assess patients. It was evident after being in the facility on two separate occasions that a need for further education and reinforcement on proper disinfectant practices was needed. Some related interventions that should be included are reinforcement of proper cleaning techniques of patient care equipment on shift by shift basis, not just when the patient is being discharged or transferred. Another intervention that should be addressed is how to use correct cleaning and disinfecting products based on the patient’s needs, diagnosis, and the contamination level of the equipment.

There is a need for new disinfection methods that are effective against Clostridium difficile spores, but also safe, rapid, and automated. Methods The Tru-D™ Rapid Room Disinfection device is a mobile, fully-automated room decontamination technology that utilizes ultraviolet-C irradiation to kill pathogens. We examined the efficacy of environmental disinfection using the Tru-D device in the laboratory and in rooms of hospitalized patients. Cultures for C. difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were collected from commonly touched surfaces before and after use of Tru-D. Results On inoculated surfaces, application of Tru-D at a reflected dose of 22, 000 μWs/cm 2 for ~ 45 minutes consistently reduced recovery of C. difficile spores and MRSA by > 2 - 3 log 10 colony forming units (CFU) /cm 2 and of VRE by > 3 - 4 log 10 CFU/cm 2. Similar killing of MRSA and VRE was achieved in ~ 20 minutes at a reflected dose of 12, 000 μWs/cm 2, but killing of C. difficile spores was reduced. Disinfection of hospital rooms with Tru-D reduced the frequency of positive MRSA and VRE cultures by 93 % and of C. difficile cultures by 80 %.

40|$|Background One in ten {{hospital}} {{patients are}} unintentionally harmed by their healthcare management. Healthcare professionals are often blamed for making mistakes {{that could be}} prevented if all the factors influencing human performance were addressed by designing the system to be safer. Hypothesis This thesis {{is part of the}} Designing Out Medical Error (DOME) project, which tested the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary team of designers, clinicians, psychologists and business analysts working collaboratively could design interventions to improve patient safety in surgical wards. Methods & Results We used a combination of observational techniques including Healthcare Failure Mode and Effects Analysis to proactively assess risk in surgical wards. We focused on five high-risk processes: hand hygiene, isolation of healthcare-associated infection, vital signs monitoring, handover communication and medication delivery. Patients and healthcare professionals were involved at every stage and helped co-design a suite of concepts to address risk in these processes. We progressed two prototypes: the Respiratory Rate Recorder and the CareCentre® (a <b>bedside</b> work <b>table</b> containing equipment including alcohol hand-rub) to simulated and clinical trials. The trials demonstrated that the accuracy of manual respiratory rate measurement and the adherence of healthcare workers to hand hygiene guidelines was significantly improved respectively, thus supporting the hypothesis.
