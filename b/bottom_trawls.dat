5|$|The viper dogfish has no {{economic}} value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is typically}} inoffensive towards humans, but if disturbed, can inflict a severe bite. Across {{much of its}} range, it is a frequent catch (intentional or not) in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> and probably also set nets and demersal gillnets; the meat is eaten and the rough skin is made into a type of leather called shagreen for use in wood finishing.|$|E
5|$|The quagga {{catshark}} is harmless {{and is not}} {{utilized by}} humans. It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though specific data on this species is lacking. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton {{promised to}} support a global ban on <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> if there was {{sufficient}} support to make that a practical option. <b>Bottom</b> <b>Trawling</b> has been banned in 1/3 of New Zealand's waters (although {{a large percentage of}} these areas were not viable for <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> in the first place) ...|$|R
5000|$|Led {{efforts to}} ban <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling,</b> {{resulting}} in the General Assembly’s 2006 consensus resolution prohibiting, for the first time, <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> in sensitive areas of the high seas.|$|R
5|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls,</b> gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E
5|$|The false {{catshark}} is an infrequent bycatch of longlines and <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls.</b> It has minimal economic value, {{though its}} meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized. In Okinawa, its oil is traditionally used {{to seal the}} hulls of wooden fishing boats. Like other deepwater sharks, this species {{is thought to be}} highly susceptible to overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is no information available on its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Least Concern.|$|E
50|$|Additional to {{the already}} banned <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> {{in the region to}} protect the sea floor, the {{executive}} order makes it a federal policy to support the continued prohibition on <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Beyond {{national}} jurisdictions, most <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> is unregulated {{either because}} there is no Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) with competence to regulate, or else what RFMOs that do exist have not actually regulated. [...] The major exception to this is in the Antarctic region, where the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources regime has instituted extensive <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> restrictions. The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) also recently closed four seamounts and part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge from all fishing, including <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling,</b> for three years. This still leaves most of international waters completely without <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> regulation.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, the FAO’s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> below 1000 metres and, in January 2006, {{completely}} closed ecologically {{sensitive areas}} off Italy, Cyprus, and Egypt to all <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b>|$|R
5|$|The shock {{produced}} by the onefin electric ray can be painful, but is not substantially dangerous to humans. Though not utilized economically, this ray is frequently caught as bycatch in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> in South African waters. Because of its inshore habits, {{it may also be}} negatively affected by water pollution from coastal development. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient due to lack of specific data, while noting that its vulnerability to fishing and habitat degradation may merit concern.|$|E
5|$|Though not {{normally}} aggressive towards humans, the sand devil can inflict serious wounds if provoked. Its common name refers to its habit of snapping vigorously at fishery workers when caught, and even {{out of the}} water it is capable of lunging upwards to bite. This shark is caught incidentally in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> operated by commercial fisheries targeting other species. It is edible but seldom brought to market. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks the data to list this species beyond Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> over {{vulnerable}} habitat, however, {{will continue}} within the Exclusive Fishing Zones of most nations until governments have mapped {{the location of}} vulnerable habitats, and taken steps to exclude all <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> activities from these areas.|$|R
25|$|Even {{in areas}} where the bottom {{sediment}}s are ancient, <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling,</b> by reintroducing the sediment into the water column, can create harmful algae blooms. More suspended solids are introduced into the oceans from <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> than any other man-made source.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>{{trawling}}</b> is trawling (towing a trawl, {{which is}} a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is {{also referred to as}} [...] "dragging". The scientific community divides <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> into benthic trawling and demersal trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. <b>Bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.|$|R
5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls,</b> which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape {{allows it to}} swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls.</b> The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> and perhaps other demersal fishing gear. It is a potential bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
40|$|Relative to the November {{edition of}} last year’s BSAI SAFE report, the {{following}} substantive {{changes have been}} made in the Pacific cod stock assessment. Changes in the Input Data 1) Catch data for 2005 were updated, and preliminary catch data for 2006 were incorporated. 2) Commercial fishery size composition data were recompiled for all years. 3) Size composition data from the 1982 - 2005 EBS shelf <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> surveys were recompiled. 4) Size composition data from the 2006 EBS shelf <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> survey were incorporated. 5) The biomass estimate from the 2006 EBS shelf <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> survey was incorporated (the 2006 estimate of 517, 698 t was down about 14 % from the 2005 estimate). 6) The biomass estimate from the 2006 AI <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> survey was incorporated (the 2006 estimate of 92, 526 t was down about 19 % from the 2004 estimate). 7) Age composition data from the 1994 and 2004 - 2005 EBS shelf <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> surveys were incorporated. 8) Length-at-age and weight-at-length data from the 1994 and 2004 - 2005 EBS shelf <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> surveys were incorporated. 9) Relative abundance indices and size composition data from the Japanese longline survey (annua...|$|R
40|$|Abundance {{estimates}} of North-east Arctic {{cod and haddock}} are given annually {{on the basis of}} combined <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> and acoustic surveys. Both survey methods use data from <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> catches in the calculations. The surveys are conducted in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard area with the same <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl,</b> but with different sweep wire length. The <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> indices are calculated for both areas assuming an effective path width of 25 m. In this paper results from parallel trawling experiments with the standard sampling trawl equipped with different sweep lengths are analyzed. These show that the total catch increases with increasing sweep length. Small fish are relatively underestimated by the trawl with the longer sweeps, but no species selection was observed. It is concluded that combining survey results without compensating for the effect of using different sweep length will bias the estimates. The variability in the presented results demonstrates the complexity of combining data from trawl surveys conducted with different sweep lengths on the <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl...</b>|$|R
50|$|Midwater {{trawling}} is trawling, or net fishing, {{at a depth}} that {{is higher}} {{in the water column}} than the bottom of the ocean.

5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is caught incidentally in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls,</b> trammel nets, and bottom longlines; it has little economic value and is mostly discarded at sea when captured. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough population and fishery data to assess its conservation status beyond Data Deficient. At least in the northern Mediterranean, surveys have found that it remains the most common {{electric ray}}, and is perhaps becoming more abundant in Italian waters. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research because their electric organs are rich in acetylcholine receptors, which {{play an important role}} in the human nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray fights strongly on hook-and-line {{and is thus}} {{popular with}} recreational anglers, who usually release it alive. This species is caught by intensive artisanal and commercial fisheries operating in Southeast Asia {{and parts of the}} Indian Ocean, using <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls,</b> gillnets and tangle nets, beach seines, and longlines. In particular, it is caught in substantial numbers by an Indonesian trawl fishery targeting wedgefishes in the Arafura Sea. The meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized, though this species is not a highly valued food fish. It also has applications in Chinese medicine, and its tail may be sold as a curio.|$|E
5|$|The sicklefin weasel shark is not {{dangerous}} to humans. It is caught by artisanal fishers throughout its range, mostly in drifting and bottom gillnets {{but also in}} <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls</b> and on longlines. The meat is eaten, the fins are used in shark fin soup, and the offal is processed into fishmeal. However, {{the small size of}} this shark limits its economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sicklefin weasel shark as Vulnerable, noting that it is naturally uncommon and resides in heavily fished regions. In addition, compared to the related Australian weasel shark it is less productive and thus less resilient to withstand fishing pressure.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries closed {{an area of}} 1000 km2 at Sula, {{including}} the large reef, to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b> In 2000, an additional area closed, covering about 600 km2. An area of about 300 km2 enclosing the Røst Reef closed to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> in 2002.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{are widely used}} to protect exploited fish species {{as well as to}} conserve marine habitats and their biodiversity. They have also become a popular management tool for <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries, a common fishing technique on continental shelves worldwide. The effects of <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> go far beyond the impact on target species, as trawls also affect other components of the benthic ecosystem and the seabed itself. This means that for <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries, MPAs can potentially be used not only to conserve target species but also to reduce impact of these side effects of the fishery. However, predicting the protective effects of MPAs is complicated because the side effects of trawling potentially alter the food-web interactions between target and non-target species. These changes in predatory and competitive interactions among fish and benthic invertebrates may have important ramifications for MPAs as tools to manage or mitigate the effects of <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling.</b> Yet, in current theory regarding the functioning of MPAs in relation to <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries, such predatory and competitive interactions between species are generally not taken into account. In this study, we discuss how food-web interactions that are potentially affected by <b>bottom</b> <b>trawling</b> may alter the effectiveness of MPAs to protect (1) biodiversity and marine habitats, (2) fish populations, (3) fisheries yield, and (4) trophic structure of the community. We make the case that in order to be applicable for <b>bottom</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries, guidelines for the implementation of MPAs must consider their potential food-web effects, at the risk of failing management. </p...|$|R

5|$|Sources {{from the}} 19th and early 20th centuries {{indicate}} that the angelshark was once abundant all around the coasts of Western Europe. Yarrell (1836), Day (1880–04), and Garstang (1903) all noted that the angelshark was common around the British Isles, and Rey (1928) recorded that this species was common around the Iberian Peninsula and in the Mediterranean. However, from {{the latter half of}} the 20th century onwards, the angelshark has come under intense pressure from commercial fisheries operating across much of its range. Due to its benthic, near-shore habits, individuals of all ages are susceptible to incidental capture by <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls,</b> trammel nets, and bottom longlines; the low reproductive rate of this shark limits its capacity to withstand population depletion.|$|E
5|$|The dark shyshark poses {{no danger}} to humans and {{is too small}} to be of {{commercial}} importance. Many are hooked by sport fishers casting from the shore, who regard the shark as a pest and often kill it. It may also be caught by subsistence fishers and in lobster traps and <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls,</b> though not in substantial quantities. This shark occasionally finds its way into the aquarium trade, though there is no direct fishing for this purpose. As the dark shyshark remains common and does not seem heavily threatened by human activity, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its small range does raise concerns that an increase in regional fishing pressure or habitat degradation could impact the entire population.|$|E
5|$|Timid and {{harmless}} to humans, the smalleye hammerhead {{is caught}} incidentally by inshore artisanal multispecies fisheries throughout its range, and marketed as food. It {{is the most}} or second-most important shark caught by such fisheries off Trinidad, Guyana, and Brazil. Because of its head shape, individuals of all ages are readily caught in gillnets; small numbers are also caught on line gear and in <b>bottom</b> <b>trawls.</b> The IUCN has assessed this species as vulnerable, as it is subjected to intense fishing pressure and its low reproductive rate renders it susceptible to population depletion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that smalleye hammerhead catches have declined significantly off Trinidad and northern Brazil, which are likely indicative of population trends {{in the rest of}} its range. It is not the target of any conservation or management schemes.|$|E
