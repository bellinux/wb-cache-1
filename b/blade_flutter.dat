This further indicates aerodynamic coupling between <b>blades.</b> The <b>flutter</b> frequency was between the first two blade normal modes, signifying an aerodynamic coupling between the normal modes. Flutter was observed at all blade pitch angles from small to large angles-of-attack of the blades. A strong blade response occurred, for four blades at the two-per-revolution (2 P) frequency, when the rotor speed was near the crossing of the flutter mode frequency and the 2 P order line. This is because the damping is low near the flutter condition and the interblade phase angle of the flutter mode and the 2 P response are the same...|$|R

40|$|Acoustical {{noise data}} were {{collected}} on small wind turbines used for water pumping [...] different blade designs were tested on each wind turbine. Three different blade designs were tested on 1 kW wind turbines and each successive blade design was shown to produce less noise with respect to rotor speed. All three blade designs, however, produced acoustical noise above 80 dB during part of their operation due to wind turbine <b>blade</b> <b>fluttering</b> which occurred when a specific rpm was exceeded for each blade design. Two radically different blade designs were tested on a 10 kW wind turbine. For the loaded condition (online) the average acoustical noise measured for both blade designs was within a few dB of each other (noise under 70 dB), but for the unloaded condition the average acoustical noise measured for the newer blade design was 4 to 8 dB less. The acoustical noise for both blade designs of the 10 kW wind turbine usually ranged between 70 and 80 dB in the offline condition, but occasionally exceeded 80 dB. Binning the measured sound data in terms of rotor or tip speed instead of wind speed greatly reduced the scatter in the data and enabled better evaluation of the noise emission for the different blade designs.

The second method utilizes a finite element technique to conduct modal flutter analysis. For both methods the unsteady aerodynamic loads are calculated using two dimensional cascade theories which are modified to account for sweep. An advanced fan stage is analyzed with 0, 15 and 30 degrees of sweep.

40|$|Investigations of {{unsteady}} pressure loadings on {{the blades}} of fans operating near the stall flutter boundary {{are carried out}} under simulated conditions in the NASA Transonic Flutter Cascade facility (TFC). It has been observed that for inlet Mach numbers of about 0. 8, the cascade flowfield exhibits intense low-frequency pressure oscillations. The origins of these oscillations were not clear. It was speculated that this behavior was either caused by instabilities in the blade separated flow zone or {{that it was a}} tunnel resonance phenomenon. It has now been determined that the strong low-frequency oscillations, observed in the TFC facility, are not a cascade phenomenon contributing to <b>blade</b> <b>flutter,</b> but that they are solely caused by the tunnel resonance characteristics. Most likely, the self-induced oscillations originate in the system of exit duct resonators. For sure, the self-induced oscillations can be significantly suppressed for a narrow range of inlet Mach numbers by tuning one of the resonators. A considerable amount of flutter simulation data has been acquired in this facility to date, and therefore it is of interest to know how much this tunnel self-induced flow oscillation influences the experimental data at high subsonic Mach numbers since this facility is being used to simulate flutter in transonic fans. In short, can this body of experimental data still be used reliably to verify computer codes for <b>blade</b> <b>flutter</b> and blade life predictions? To answer this question a study on resonance effects in the NASA TFC facility was carried out. The results, based on spectral and ensemble averaging analysis of the cascade data, showed that the interaction between self-induced oscillations and forced blade motion oscillations is very weak and can generally be neglected. The forced motion data acquired with the mistuned tunnel, when strong self-induced oscillations were present, can be used as reliable forced pressure fluctuations provided that they are extracted from raw data sets by an ensemble averaging procedure...|$|E

The typical instability encountered is body-freedom flutter involving a low frequency interaction of the first elastic mode and the aircraft short period mode. Parametric cases with the lowest static margin consistently demonstrated the highest flutter dynamic pressures. As mass ratio was increased, the flutter boundary decreased. The decrease was emphasized as center-of-gravity location was moved forward. As sweep angle varied, {{it was observed that}} the resulting increase in forward-swept blade bending amplitude relative to aft blade bending amplitude in the first elastic mode had a stabilizing effect on the flutter boundary.

Upon using the individual blade frequencies and solving the mistuned system with aerodynamic coupling only, the results show a stable system.

Two types of miniature pressure transducers were used: surface-mounted flat custom-made, and conventional miniature, body-mounted transducers. The signals of the surface-mounted transducers are significantly affected by blade acceleration, whereas the signals of body-mounted transducers are practically free of this distortion. A procedure was introduced to correct the signals of surface-mounted transducers to rectify the signal distortion due to blade acceleration. The signals from body-mounted transducers, and corrected signals from surface-mounted transducers represent true unsteady pressure signals {{on the surface of}} a blade subjected to forced oscillations. However, the use of body-mounted conventional transducers is preferred for the following reasons: no signal corrections are needed for blade acceleration, the conventional transducers are noticeably less expensive than custom-made flat transducers, the survival rate of body-mounted transducers is much higher, and finally installation of body-mounted transducers does not disturb the blade surface of interest...|$|R
