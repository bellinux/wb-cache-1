The decline has been reported to stem from age-related changes in various brain regions including the hippocampus. Recent studies have revealed that the hippocampus is important for the detection of metric and topological changes in the allocentric relationship among stimuli. However, little is known about age-related differences in the ability to detect these changes. In the current study, 25 young (6 month) and 22 aged (24 month) Fischer- 344 /Brown- Norway rats were tested on a paradigm designed to assess object-place memory for metric and topological changes using an exploratory-based, novelty detection task. Performance on this task {{has been shown to be}} dependent on the hippocampus. Metric changes were made by altering the distance between two objects, while topological changes were made by changing the object configuration. The metric task involved four 5 -min sessions, with a 3 -min intersession interval between Sessions 1, 2, and 3, and a 10 -min intersession interval between Sessions 3 and 4. Prior to testing, two different objects were positioned 68 cm apart in an open field. Sessions 1 - 3 allowed for habituation to the two objects. During Session 4, the objects were shifted in to a 38 cm separation for the first metric test and shifted out to 98 cm separation for the second test. The topological task involved five 5 -min sessions, with a 3 -min intersession interval after Sessions 1 and 3, and a 10 -min intersession interval after Sessions 2 and 4. Prior to testing, four different objects were positioned 68 cm apart in a square formation in an open field. Sessions 1 and 2 allowed for habituation to the four objects. During Sessions 3 and 4, two of the objects were transposed. During Session 5, the remaining two objects were transposed. There was a 48 -hr separation between metric and topological tests. Object exploration was recorded during all sessions and analyzed for age differences. In order to assess age group differences in exploration during the metric task, two separate 2 x 4 repeated measures ANOVAs were run for each condition, shift-in and shift-out, with Group (6 month, 24 month) as a between group variable and Session (1 - 4) as a within group variable. In order to assess age group differences in exploration during the topological task, a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted with Group (6 month, 24 month) as a between group variable and Location (Front Switch, <b>Back</b> <b>Switch)</b> as a within group variable. Young rats spent significantly more time exploring displaced objects during the metric task compared to aged rats when the objects were shifted in. During the topological task, young rats spent significantly more time exploring objects when the front two objects were transposed compared to aged rats. The results of this study suggest that age-related changes in the hippocampus impair memory for metric and topological spatial representations. Impairments in the detection of metric and topological spatial change may be useful indicators of age-related memory decline...|$|E
40|$|Households in Chiwundura Communal Area {{continue}} {{to depend on}} traditional biomass fuels, that is, fuelwood, agricultural residues {{and in some cases}} dung. This is despite the fact that grid electrification has been introduced in the communal area. A few households have been able to adopt the grid electrification whilst the rest remain rooted {{in the use of the}} inefficient and polluting traditional biomass. Some of those who have adopted the grid electricity only use it for lighting and entertainment whilst they {{continue to}} use fuelwood for cooking. A number of households that have connected to grid electricity have reverted to the use of the traditional biomass. This means that the generality of people in Chiwundura Communal Area continue to be subjected to energy poverty, which is a constrained access to modern energy services such as electricity. As a result these households will not be able to meet the millennium development goals among many other achievements. This state of affairs motivated the researcher to conduct this study. The study wanted to find out why the transition from traditional biomass energy forms to modern energy services was slow in Chiwundura Communal Area. The study also wanted to establish the factors that influenced household en ergy choices as well as establish the ways in which the traditional biomass energy forms had affected the livelihoods of households in the study area. In order to get information on the above mentioned questions, this study which was a case study of Chiwundura Communal Area utilised the triangulation of both qualitative and quantitative techniques. These methods were meant to complement each other and benefit from the strengths of each method. The study used questionnaires, interviews, observations, transect walks, focus group discussions and content analysis. The researcher spent up to three months in the study area so as to get first hand information on the issues under study. A total of 215 households and 106 school children were conveniently sampled to respond to the questionnaires whilst fifty household heads participated in the interviews. The study looked at three energy theories namely the energy ladder, the leapfrogging and the multiple fuels use models as well as consumption and decision making theories to open this discussion. The study made a number of critical findings. Firstly, there was very little transition as most households remained as users of biomass energy; hence they were at the lower rungs of the energy ladder. Those that had moved up the ladder tended to <b>back</b> <b>switch</b> to the use of fuelwood. This made them multiple fuel users. Generally fuelwood was the dominant source of energy as it was used mainly for cooking, space and water heating, space lighting and other domestic needs such as smoking meat. About 22 % of all respondents were connected to the grid and used electricity mainly for lighting. Candles, paraffin, gensets and solar energy were part of the energy mix. It was established that income was the most important determinant in the energy choices made by the different households. Most of the households were peasant farmers who could not harvest excess crops for the market. A few households with members in paid employment or obtained remittances from relatives in South Africa or the Diaspora were able to get connected to the grid or could afford to purchase fuelwood from vendors. Households could not procure solar house systems as the start up costs were beyond their reach. Those who were able to acquire generators could not run them for many hours as they could not afford to refuel them regularly. Household characteristics such as age and education of household- head were also important factors. It was however established that cultural and traditional factors were as usual not given the attention they deserved yet they were very significant in determining the type of fuel a household chose. Food preparation and taste always played an important role in determining whether a household chose traditional fuels for certain cuisines. It was also realised that failure by numerous households in the study area to access modern energy sources meant that they could not attain the millennium development goals by 2015. They could not move out of abject poverty as they lacked irrigation schemes to assure them of food security. Universal access to education was affected by lack of light to use for studying and reading after hours. Adult education was also frustrated. The boy child was worst affected as he came to school late or at times missed school altogether collecting fuelwood for the household. In Chiwundura Communal Area men and boys were responsible for collecting fuelwood. This signified a shift in gender roles. Men and boys took it upon themselves to have these responsibilities as women and girls could not walk the long distances. The health of the household particularly women and children who spent several hours close to the fire was compromised as most huts were poorly ventilated. They therefore could not adequately deal with indoor air pollution challenges. Other MDGs were also likely not to be achieved by the families. The study also found out that men were not dictatorial in determining the fuel that a household used. Some form of democracy existed within homes and negotiations between husband and wife often took place away from the public domain. Oftentimes women often aped their colleagues who owned modern energy technologies within the villages; hence they pressurised their husbands to buy them SHSs and gensets. This was conspicuous consumption. The study established that there was need for modern energy in the study area. Grid electricity was not the panacea for this as it was beyond the reach of many. It was therefore important to look at renewable energy forms such as gel fuel, SHSs and biogas. It was also pertinent to educate and make households aware of dangers posed by indoor air pollution. The government and different stakeholders must give it equal importance and publicity as that given to HIV and AIDS as it kills several children annually. Housing interventions should be made so that households build huts with proper ventilation...|$|E
