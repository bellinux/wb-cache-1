25|$|Expenses {{incurred}} in a trading, business, rental, {{or other}} income producing activity are generally deductible, though {{there may be}} limitations on some types of expenses or activities. <b>Business</b> <b>expenses</b> include all manner of costs {{for the benefit of}} the activity. An allowance (as a capital allowance or depreciation deduction) is nearly always allowed for recovery of costs of assets used in the activity. Rules on capital allowances vary widely, and often permit recovery of costs more quickly than ratably over the life of the asset.|$|E
25|$|Taxable {{income of}} taxpayers {{resident}} in the jurisdiction is generally total income less income producing expenses and other deductions. Generally, only net gain from sale of property, including goods held for sale, {{is included in}} income. Income of a corporation's shareholders usually includes distributions of profits from the corporation. Deductions typically include all income producing or <b>business</b> <b>expenses</b> including an allowance for recovery of costs of business assets. Many jurisdictions allow notional deductions for individuals, and may allow deduction of some personal expenses. Most jurisdictions either do not tax income earned outside the jurisdiction or allow a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions on such income. Nonresidents are taxed only on certain types of income from sources within the jurisdictions, with few exceptions.|$|E

25|$|In a {{class action}} lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on August 16, 2013, Uber drivers plead that they were {{employees}} who had been misclassified as independent contractors {{in violation of the}} California Labor Code and demanded that they be given any tips Uber had collected on their behalf and payment of <b>business</b> <b>expenses</b> such as gas and maintenance of their vehicles. The District Judge, Edward M. Chen, ruled in the plaintiffs' favor with respect to a motion for summary judgement by defendants on March 11, 2015, holding that whether Uber drivers were employees was a disputed fact to be resolved by the jury. On September 1, 2015, Chen certified the class but generally limited it to drivers in California hired before June 2014 (when an opt-out arbitration clause was included in the contract) who had directly contracted with Uber.|$|E
500|$|Croitoru {{was born}} to Romanian parents in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Before {{entering}} professional wrestling, Croitoru played junior hockey for the Kitchener Rangers in the Ontario Hockey League. He was not drafted to the National Hockey League, however, {{and he decided to}} pursue professional wrestling instead. He was an accomplished weightlifter, and he once bench pressed 625 pounds. [...] While awaiting his murder trial, he ran a home renovation business until he was unable to secure a bank loan to cover <b>business</b> <b>expenses.</b> After closing the business, he supported himself by working as a used car salesman.|$|E
500|$|There {{had been}} {{inflation}} after the War of 1812, {{and the establishment}} of the Second Bank of the United States. In these times, when paper currency was privatized, this took the form of wildcat banks. Johnson, like many other Kentuckians, was caught in the ensuing financial collapse, the Panic of 1819. He took a strong part in the politically popular struggle for debt relief, and some form of bankruptcy legislation, called the Relief War, which would help his own problems and those of his neighbors. Johnson knew this politically pressing issue, which he worked on into the 1830s, quite well because it affected him personally. He was in debt himself from his <b>business</b> <b>expenses</b> and support for Western expansion. At the same time, he had other political positions. As the chair of the Committee on Military Affairs, Johnson pushed for higher veterans pensions, [...] "liberal land policy" [...] {{to make it easier to}} buy land in the West, and defended Andrew Jackson in the Senate, after the First Seminole War.|$|E

500|$|Businesses {{would be}} {{required}} to submit monthly or quarterly reports (depending on sales volume) of taxable sales and sales tax collected on their monthly sales tax return. During audits, the business would have to produce invoices for the [...] "business purchases" [...] that they did not pay sales tax on, and would {{have to be able to}} show that they were genuine <b>business</b> <b>expenses.</b> Advocates state the significant 86% reduction in collection points would greatly increase the likelihood of business audits, making tax evasion behavior much more risky. Additionally, the FairTax legislation has several fines and penalties for non-compliance, and authorizes a mechanism for reporting tax cheats to obtain a reward. To prevent businesses from purchasing everything for their employees, in a family business for example, goods and services bought by the business for the employees that are not strictly for business use would be taxable. Health insurance or medical expenses would be an example where the business would have to pay the FairTax on these purchases. [...] Taxable property and services purchased by a qualified non-profit or religious organization [...] "for business purposes" [...] would not be taxable.|$|E

2500|$|Marine {{insurance}} and marine cargo insurance cover the loss or damage of vessels at sea or on inland waterways, and of cargo in transit, {{regardless of the}} method of transit. When {{the owner of the}} cargo and the carrier are separate corporations, marine cargo insurance typically compensates the owner of cargo for losses sustained from fire, shipwreck, etc., but excludes losses that can be recovered from the carrier or the carrier's insurance. Many marine insurance underwriters will include [...] "time element" [...] coverage in such policies, which extends the indemnity to cover loss of profit and other <b>business</b> <b>expenses</b> attributable to the delay caused by a covered loss.|$|E

2500|$|In general, the {{question}} of how to eliminate deductions is fundamental to the flat tax design; deductions dramatically affect the effective [...] "flatness" [...] in the tax rate. Perhaps the single biggest necessary deduction is for <b>business</b> <b>expenses.</b> If businesses were not allowed to deduct expenses, businesses with a profit margin below the flat tax rate could never earn any money since the tax on revenues would always exceed the earnings. For example, grocery stores typically earn pennies on every dollar of revenue; they could not pay a tax rate of 25% on revenues unless their markup exceeded 25%. Thus, corporations must be able to deduct operating expenses even if individual citizens cannot. A practical dilemma now arises as to identifying what is an expense for a business.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time Lady Docker earned a {{reputation}} for having rather poor social graces when under the influence, and she and Sir Bernard were investigated for failing to correctly declare {{the amount of money}} taken out of the country on a visit to a Monte Carlo casino. Sir Bernard was instantly dumped [...] "for absenteeism" [...] by the Midland Bank board without waiting for the court case. Norah drew further attention. She ran up large bills and presented them to Daimler as <b>business</b> <b>expenses</b> but some items were disallowed by the Tax Office. The publicity attached to this and other social episodes told on Sir Bernard's standing as some already thought the cars too opulent and vulgar for austere post-war Britain. To compound Sir Bernard's difficulty, the royal family shifted allegiance to Rolls-Royce. By the end of 1960 all the State Daimlers had been sold and replaced by Rolls-Royces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{remodeling}} bills came to $8 million, {{which the}} Helmsleys were loath to pay.

In 1985, during those proceedings, the contractors revealed that most of their work was being illegally billed to the Helmsleys' hotels as <b>business</b> <b>expenses.</b> The contractors sent a stack of the falsified invoices to the New York Post {{to prove that the}} Helmsleys were trying to avoid tax liabilities. The resulting Post story led to a federal criminal investigation. Also, Jeremiah McCarthy, the Helmsleys' executive engineer, alleged that Leona repeatedly demanded that he sign invoices to bill personal expenses to the Helmsley company and, when McCarthy declined to do so, Helmsley exploded with tyrannical outbursts, shouting, [...] "You're not my fucking partner! You'll sign what I tell you to sign." [...] In 1988, then United States Attorney Rudy Giuliani indicted the Helmsleys and two of their associates on several tax-related charges, as well as extortion.|$|E
