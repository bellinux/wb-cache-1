Applying <b>bipolar</b> <b>electrode</b> in esophageal position of maximal left atrial deflection and using Butterworth high-pass filtering, the LAE provides an additional “left atrial marker channel”. By this way, atrial activities can easily be recognized {{even if they are}} superimposed by the QRS complex.

50|$|Bipolar {{electrochemistry}} is {{a phenomenon}} in electrochemistry based on the polarization of conducting objects in electric fields. Indeed, this polarization generates a potential {{difference between the two}} extremities of the substrate that is equal to the electric field value multiplied {{by the size of the}} object. If this potential difference is important enough, then redox reactions can be generated at the extremities of the object, oxidations will occur at one extremity coupled simultaneously to reductions at the other extremity. In a simple experimental setup consisting of a platinum wire in a weighing boat containing a pH indicator solution, a 30 V voltage across two electrodes will cause water reduction at one end of the wire (the cathode) and a pH increase (OH− formation) and water oxidation at the anodic end and a pH decrease. The poles of the <b>bipolar</b> <b>electrode</b> also align themselves with the applied electric field.|$|E
