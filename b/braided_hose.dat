5000|$|Though {{commonly}} called [...] "Steam Cleaning", no actual steam {{is involved in}} the HWE cleaning process, apart from steam that may escape incidentally from hot water. When the cleaning solution comes in contact with the carpet/rug, it is anywhere between 50-120 degrees Celsius, according to the heat available from the cleaning unit. For instance, in a modern truck-mounted carpet cleaning machine, water can be heated under pressure to 150+ degrees Celsius, but after passing through high pressure steel <b>braided</b> <b>hose</b> and several manifolds, the water loses much of its heat.|$|E
50|$|Lavatories {{and water}} closets {{normally}} {{connect to the}} water supply {{by means of a}} supply, which is a tube, usually of nominal 3/8 in (U.S.) or 10 or 12 mm diameter (Europe and Middle East), which connects the water supply to the fixture, sometimes through a flexible (<b>braided)</b> <b>hose.</b> For water closets, this tube usually ends in a flat neoprene washer that tightens against the connection, while for lavatories, the supply usually ends in a conical neoprene washer. Kitchen sinks, tubs and showers usually have supply tubes built onto their valves which then are soldered or 'fast joint'ed directly onto the water supply pipes.|$|E

40|$|A {{high-volume}} pneumatic-impact {{system has}} been used to test PTFE-lined stainless steel <b>braided</b> <b>hoses,</b> in order to characterize the roles played in the mechanism of oxygen-induced ignition by impact pressure, pressurization rate, and upstream and downstream volumes of the hose. Ignitions are noted to have occurred at impact pressures well below the working pressure of the hoses, as well as at pressurization rates easily obtainable through manual operation of valves. The use of stainless steel hardlines downstream of the hose prevented ignitions at all pressures and pressurization rates; internal observations have shown evidence of shock ionization in the oxygen prior to ignition...|$|R

40|$|Testing {{facilities}} {{such as the}} TU Delft Vehicle Test Lab (VTL) {{are needed}} to provide necessary experimental data to validate and to compare the performance of several ABS controllers like the Feed-Forward Braking controller. Before testing ABS controllers with the VTL measurement system, {{it needs to be}} improved first. Earlier measurements reported in [11] showed a lack of developed braking torque due to decreased bandwidth of the measurement setup. This problem could be within the hydraulic brake line of the VTL measurement setup. Pressure dynamics results of the original situation show a significant decrease when increasing the actuating frequency. Differences in pressure dynamics are examined by replacing the original brake hose with a stainless steel <b>braided</b> brake <b>hose.</b> Sinus wave excitation measurements show a relative small increase of the maximal reaching brake pressure with the design improvements situation. Random noise excitation measurements show increased bandwidth, compared to the frequency results reported in [4] and [11]. Improvements in brake pressure dynamics are realized by using a stainless steel <b>braided</b> brake <b>hose</b> in addition with relative low varying amplitudes.

50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner hose wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, <b>braided</b> stainless steel <b>hoses</b> typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated <b>braided</b> stainless steel <b>hoses</b> have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the <b>braided</b> stainless steel <b>hoses</b> offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|R
50|$|The ER5 has a {{twin piston}} front disk brake and a rear drum brake. Unlike many modern motorcycles, with fixed caliper and {{floating}} disk, the ER5 has a fixed disk and floating caliper. 'A' models have a trailing piston which {{is smaller than}} the leading piston but the later 'C' models have identical leading and trailing pistons, dramatically improving front braking. 'A' model owners often fit caliper units from 'C' models. As for most motorcycles, another common braking upgrade is to reduce sponginess by replacing the OEM brake <b>hose</b> with a <b>braided</b> brake <b>hose.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} the above, it is {{reasonable}} to ask why rubber brake hose is used at all, instead of always using <b>braided</b> stainless steel <b>hose.</b> The most typical reason is cost, but also use case. <b>Braided</b> stainless steel <b>hose</b> is typically more expensive than rubber. When the cost difference is extrapolated across hundreds or thousands of units, it is quite compelling to opt for the rubber option, especially when the use case exhibits that the operator will not need or want the additional capabilities offered by a brake system equipped with braided stainless steel brake lines. It thus stands to reason that braided stainless steel brake lines are typically only seen on upmarket motor vehicles such as hot-rods and supercars, or on race-prepped vehicles such as those used in Formula One and touring car series. Braided stainless steel brake lines are a common aftermarket upgrade, purchased and installed after a vehicle is initially purchased.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{braiding}} functions on {{the lazy}} tongs principle. When axial tension {{is applied to}} the <b>hose,</b> the <b>braid</b> reaches its extension limit. This means that the wires lie tightly spaced with the smallest crossing angle, creating a <b>hose</b> <b>braiding</b> of the smallest possible diameter and the largest possible length. When the hose is axially compressed, the crossing angle and diameter increase to maximum values.|$|R
50|$|To {{increase}} pressure resistance, metal hoses can {{be equipped}} with one- or two-layer braiding. The braiding is firmly connected to the hose fittings on both sides to absorb the longitudinal forces caused by internal pressure. Due to its inherent flexibility, the braid moulds itself perfectly to {{the movement of the}} <b>hose.</b> <b>Hose</b> <b>braiding</b> consists of right- and left-handed wrapped wire bundles that are alternately layered one over the other. This not only prevents hose lengthening due to internal pressure, but also absorbs external tensile forces and protects the outside of the hose. The basic material of the wire braid is usually {{the same as that of}} the corrugated hose. It is also possible to select different materials in the interest of greater corrosion resistance or for economic considerations.|$|R
40|$|Silicone Rubber is a {{specialty}} synthetic elastomer {{that provides a}} unique balance of chemical and mechanical properties required by many of today's more demanding industrial applications. ns. Because of its relative purity and chemical makeup, silicone rubber displays exceptional biocompatibility which makes it suitable for many health care and pharmaceutical applications. However, Braiding {{is probably the most}} common and traditional method of reinforcing <b>hose.</b> <b>Braiding</b> machines were available in France and Germany as early as the middle of the l 9 th century for braiding textiles used for rope and clothing products. Compared to many organic elastomers, silicone rubber offers superior ease of fabrication resulting in high productivity and cost effectiveness for extended service reliability. Here, We are going to combine properties of silicone with braiding technology to make a well suited hose to industrial applications. Keywords...|$|R
50|$|The typical {{operation}} of a hydraulic brake system uses the premise of fluid displacement to convert operator input into friction. This fluid transfer is accomplished by a connecting tube and/or hose from one hydraulic cylinder (often called the master cylinder) to another (located at the brakes of each wheel). In practice, an operator control such as a brake pedal or lever attached to a hydraulic cylinder is connected in turn, via a tube/hose, to another hydraulic cylinder responsible for applying friction to a moving surface. This network of operator control(s), tube/hose, and cylinder(s) is filled with hydraulic fluid such that input from the operator displaces fluid at the control location, resulting in movement {{at the opposite end}} of the system. The ideal hydraulic brake system would use only hard tubing such as galvanized or stainless steel pipe, as this would prevent any expansion along the hydraulic fluid path, providing the most direct transfer of operator input force to the friction surfaces, and in fact most of the length of a brake line is made of stainless steel. However, hard tubing will not endure the motions caused by articulation of suspension components. For example, an automobile wheel is not hard-mounted to the automobile's frame or unibody chassis. It is instead mounted to a suspension component which allows that wheel to move in response to road irregularities and steering inputs. Because the wheel must be able to move, a length of flexible hose must be used between the end of the run of metal brake line tubing, and the brake at each wheel. Since the ideal brake system would use only hard tubing for its lack of expansion, but some use of flexible hose is required, the ideal compromise is to use a hose type that allows a minimal rate of expansion. Thus the assertion that <b>braided</b> stainless steel <b>hose</b> is superior as compared to a typical rubber hose when used in a hydraulic brake system.|$|R
