2500|$|Peter Griffin is {{a middle}} class Irish American, who is a bespectacled, {{overweight}} <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>worker</b> with a prominent Rhode Island and Eastern Massachusetts accent. Peter and his wife Lois have three children; Meg, Chris, and Stewie. He is the illegitimate son of Thelma Griffin and Mickey McFinnigan, and was raised by Thelma and her husband Francis Griffin. Peter and his family live in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island, which is modeled after Providence, Rhode Island. Peter primarily worked as a safety inspector at the Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory, until his boss Jonathan Weed choked to death on a dinner roll; he then became a fisherman on his own boat, known as the [...] "S.S. More Powerful than Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and The Incredible Hulk Put Together," [...] {{with the help of}} two Portuguese immigrants, Santos and Pasqual, until his boat was destroyed. He now works in the shipping department of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery. Peter is also shown in various jobs for single episodes and cutaway gags. In one episode Peter played for the New England Patriots until his behavior resulted in him being kicked off the team. In a running gag, storylines are randomly interrupted by extremely long, unexpected fights between Peter and Ernie the Giant Chicken, an anthropomorphic chicken who serves as a rival to Peter. These battles parody the action film genre, with explosions, high-speed chases, and immense devastation to the town of Quahog.|$|E

30|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> and white <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> {{that is often}} used in the literature (for Germany, see e.g. Bernard and Wagner 2001) {{is no way to}} proxy human capital intensity for two reasons. First, often <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> are high qualified skilled employees with apprenticeship (so-called Facharbeiter) while white <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> include many unskilled employees. Second, the {{distinction between}} <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> (Arbeiter) and white <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> (Angestellte) is no longer used in Germany after a reform of the pension system; in the data from official statistics, for example, there is no separate information on wages (for <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers)</b> and salaries (for white collar employees) from the reporting year 2006 onwards.|$|R
40|$|In this article, two {{contrasting}} {{theories on}} {{the attitudes of}} unskilled <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> are confronted: the ‘embourgeoisement’ thesis and the hypothesis of the ‘authoritarianism of the working class’. The ‘embourgeoisement’ thesis states that <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> adopted the attitudes (and life style) of white <b>collar</b> <b>workers,</b> from whom {{they can no longer}} be distinguished. Lipset’s hypothesis of the ‘authoritarianism of the working class’, on the other hand, states that <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> more strongly endorse a conservative attitude on socio-cultural matters and a progressive stand concerning socio-economic issues. Both hypotheses are tested using data from a small scale survey (N = 135) among unskilled <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> and lower- and mid-level white <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> from different large companies in the region of Leuven, Belgium. The results indicate that the interviewed unskilled <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> still hold a set of attitudes that distinguishes them from the interviewed white <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> So, the ‘embourgeoisement’ thesis was refuted. Instead, the unskilled <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> were more conservative on a socio-cultural level, and more progressive concerning socio-economic issues. These results are in line with Lipset’s ‘authoritarianism of the working class’ hypothesis...|$|R

It was determined with correlation analysis whether there is a relation between perception of inequality and reaction towards it for two groups. A significant and positive relation has been found between inequality perceptions and reaction towards inequality of <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> No significant relation has been found for white <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> Factor analysis was used to determine the dimensions of inequality perceptions andreactions towards inequality of <b>blue</b> and white <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> Results show that inequality perceptions and types of reactions towards inequality differ in terms of dimensions. Equity perceptions of <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> are mostly based on comparisons with colleagues and nepotist behavior of their managers. White <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> show sensitivity to the issues like salary, promotion and status. <b>Blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> prefer to report or to persuade their managers when they face with inequality.

40|$|All {{persons in}} Sweden, {{classified}} as white or <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> in the 1960 Population Census, were followed {{up for the}} period 1961 - 1973 {{with regard to the}} occurrence of cancer. The SMRs were calculated for 50 tumour sites and {{it was found that the}} crude classification of occupations into white or <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> was particularly important for malignant melanoma risk. The number of malignant melanoma cases among <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> was significantly lower than expected while it was significantly higher than expected among the white <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> This was true for men as well as for women. The SMRs were calculated to be 87 and 141 (men) and 79 and 117 (women), respectively. Comparing the relative survival probabilities it was found that white <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> had a higher probability of survival than <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> This might indicate that the difference in occurrence could be dependent on early detection as well as differential risk. The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing faster than any other kind of tumour in Sweden. For the period 1961 - 1970 the incidence rate increased two-fold for <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> and more than two-fold for white <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> (men). In absolute terms the white <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> in the age group 45 - 64 had an appreciably faster increase in incidence over this period compared to all other groups studied. ...|$|R

A survey of white and <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> site-based <b>workers</b> on a major Australian infrastructure project measured work-family conflict, work schedule fit and work-family enrichment, as well as flexibility, time adequacy, work time control and supervisor support. The &# 039;TurningPoint&# 039; automated response system with &# 039;KeyPad&# 039; hand held devices was used to administered the survey. The results revealed that there were notable differences between <b>blue</b> and white <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> responses, with <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> experiencing statistically lower levels of supervisor support, flexibility, family work enrichment and control as well as longer work hours, and higher levels of time-based work interference with family.

40|$|Background: General {{health in}} the working {{population}} is thought to depend on working conditions. Objective: This survey studied job demands and health complaints in working white and <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> employees. We expect physical and psychological job demands to be differentially distributed among white and <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> Do they report health complaints consistent with their working conditions? Method: Cross-sectional study of 323 white and 383 <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers.</b> They completed the Basic Occupational Health Questionnaire, a valid and reliable self-report questionnaire about health, work and working conditions. The results were analysed using Chi-square and logistic regression analysis, controlling for educational level as a proxy of socioeconomic status. Results: The questionnaires of 280 white and 251 <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> were suitable for analysis. White <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> reported higher psychological job demands, and <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> reported higher physical demands. In both occupational groups, low back pain, fatigue and upper respiratory complaints were most common. The rates of low back pain and pain in the lower extremity were higher in <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers,</b> as were regular headaches, pain in the cardiac region and feeling sleepy. However, these relationships substantially weakened when the educational level was adjusted for. Conclusions: Despite the differential distribution of job demands, white and blue collarworkers reported similar health complaints. Health in the working population depended predominantly on socioeconomic status. Interventions to improve general health of employees should be directed at their socioeconomic position instead of working conditions...|$|R

40|$|MBA thesisThe {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} is to determine the factors which are critical to the motivation of <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> as it is these factors which contribute to the achievement of high levels of productivity in the work place. Furthermore, the research aims to determine whether <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> have a preference for extrinsic factors or intrinsic factors. The aim of the research report is not to modify behaviour or influence the current state of affairs in any way. The objective is to reveal data that will establish the current situation. The population chosen for this research consists of <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> that are employed in the Quarrying industry operated by PPC Aggregates Pty Ltd. A questionnaire was used to gather the relevant data during an interview session with each respondent. The questions and the questionnaire adopted for this research is an adaptation of those used in a previous study. The study in question, done in 2008, focused on Employee motivation of Malaysian <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> (Islam and Ismail, 2008). In this study, the data collected from the questionnaires was analysed using an array of descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. This was done using the Statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS) which, with the t-test, will be employed to analyse the data. The ranked data was then analysed using means comparison. The results of the research show that <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> listed cash, company shares and paid time off, in that order, as their preferred top three methods of reward and recognition. In terms of factors of motivation, the top three preferred options were high wages, job security and promotion. The results of the research conclude that <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> prefer extrinsic factors of motivation over intrinsic factors...|$|R

30|$|Surely, the AfD still {{cannot be}} {{considered}} the party for <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> and the unemployed. Just {{because the majority of}} a particular social group supports a political party does not necessarily mean they represent the party’s majority base. According to a study by Niedermayer and Hofrichter (2016), the proportion of unemployed among all supporters of the AfD and the proportion of <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> among its supporters with livelihood activities during the first quarter of 2016 were only 3 % and 26 %, respectively. 1 However, the rapid surge of <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> and the unemployed as the main supporters of the AfD cannot be denied. This phenomenon is also observed in a study by Niedermayer and Hofrichter. The approval rating for the AfD among <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> showed a rapid increase, from 4 % in the 4 th quarter of 2013 to 18 % in the 1 st quarter of 2016, and approval rating {{in the case of the}} unemployed also increased considerably, from 7 % to 12 % during the same period (Ibid. 273). Increase in approval rating among <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> was steeper than that of any other social group – its rate more than quadrupled (4.5 times) – and consequently, the proportion of <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> among the entire supporters show rapid expansion. The 26 % rating recorded in the 1 st quarter of 2016 is a result of a 6 % increase in only about two years subsequent to the 4 th quarter of 2013 (Ibid. 272). Considering that other occupational groups did not show much change in their ratings or even dropped in their rating during the same period, even though the approval rating for the AfD increased for each group, this is a significant and meaningful change. In sum, although social groups such as <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> and the unemployed are not the absolute majority among the supporters of the AfD, the approval rating for the AfD within those groups is increasing faster than for any other group, and their prominence as main supporting groups of the AfD is also growing.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the viewpoint, held by employees, concerning their percieved organizational commitment {{in relation to their}} and the organizations use of internal information channels, with emphasis on the limited access to the corporate intranet. The research questions are: How do the employees use the corporate intranet? What other internal information channels do the employees and the organization use? How satisfied are the employees with the organizations use of the informations channels? How do the employees percieve their organizational commitment? Design/methodology – The research was designed as a case study using a qualitative data gathering method. Six semi structured interviews were conducted with <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> that had been working within the organization between 4 to 31 years. Findings – Many of the <b>blue</b> <b>collar</b> <b>workers</b> have limited access to the corporate intranet and still percieve their organizational commitment as high. They believe that their high commitment is related to the gaining of information. Their high commitment might be understood via the use of high amount of other informational channels, especially verbal ones.
