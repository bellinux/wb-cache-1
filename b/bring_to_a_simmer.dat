5000|$|Wappani ( [...] (wappani) is a miso-soup-based dish {{unique to}} Awashima {{island off the}} coast of Niigata, Japan. A cedar flask ("wappa") is filled with miso soup, fish and {{vegetables}} and it is heated by dropping in hot rocks, which quickly <b>bring</b> it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer.</b> Hot rocks retain their heat for hours after being taken from the fire, so a hot meal can be prepared without the use of fire.|$|R
5|$|The {{essential}} {{process of}} dyeing requires soaking the material containing the dye (the dyestuff) in water, adding the textile to be dyed to the resulting solution (the dyebath), and <b>bringing</b> the solution <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer</b> for <b>an</b> extended period, often measured in days or even weeks, stirring occasionally until the color has evenly {{transferred to the}} textiles.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>an</b> {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ladle, a degreasing cup {{can be used}} to skim the fat off hot liquids. This is a {{clear plastic}} or glass cup that looks similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> teapot, with a spout that comes out of the bottom. The liquid and juices are poured into the cup then poured out leaving the fat behind; the liquid comes {{from the bottom of the}} cup instead of the top. Degreasing cups come in various sizes. Refrigerating or freezing liquids until the fat congeals and solidifies can make the fat easier <b>to</b> remove with <b>a</b> spoon. If, after removing the congealed fat, the liquid still appears cloudy, it can be made clearer by skimming it again with a ladle after <b>bringing</b> it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gentle <b>simmer</b> <b>to</b> allow for the release of more fat and insoluble proteins.|$|R
5000|$|Harry (Danny Glover), {{an enigmatic}} old {{friend from the}} South, comes to visit Gideon (Paul Butler) and his wife Suzie (Mary Alice), who haven't seen him for many years, who are delighted to see him again, and who insist that he stay with them {{for as long as}} he would like. Gideon and Suzie live in South Central Los Angeles, though they retain some of their rural {{southern}} ways, including raising chickens in the backyard. Harry has a charming, down-home manner, but his presence <b>brings</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crisis the <b>simmering</b> trouble that is already in the family—especially as regards the younger son, Samuel or [...] "Baby Brother" [...] (Richard Brooks), and his relation to his parents, wife, and older brother, Junior (Carl Lumbly). His disruptive presence is dangerous (his influence threatens to break up Samuel's marriage and seems to be related to the illness that puts Gideon in bed in serious condition for a couple weeks), but ultimately purgative: Gideon's extended family is much more cohesive as a result of Harry's visit. The storm accompanying the wound Suzie suffers when she grasps the knife that Samuel and Junior are struggling over during their climactic fight clears while the two brothers quietly reconcile (during a long wait in an emergency room) and, similarly, the simmering anger that Harry seemed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> boil is also dissipated. Harry's death just before the end of the film suggests, ambiguously, that he has been <b>to</b> <b>a</b> degree a self-sacrificing savior of the family.|$|R

50|$|This drink is {{typically}} made from nurungji, the roasted (but not charred) crust of rice that forms {{on the bottom}} of a pot after cooking rice.

50|$|Schmaltz (chicken fat) imparts a {{distinctive}} flavor, but many modern cooks prefer vegetable oils or margarine.

The balls swell during the cooking time of approximately 30 minutes.|$|R

Many Shinto shrines provide or sell it in the New Year. In the 20th century, an instant version became available.|$|R

5000|$|Milmyeon ( [...] , meaning [...] "flour noodle") is a Korean dish of {{long and}} thin noodles similar to naengmyeon, {{representing}} the dishes of Busan. The noodle is basically mixing flour powder with starches of sweet potato and potato with meat broth, which bring it and water, {{several kinds of}} vegetables <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer</b> in saucepan. The mixture of flour is not fixed at certain ingredients, leading to several transformation like using Artemisia princeps for ssuk milmyeon (쑥 밀면). Milmyeon also has its variety of mul milmyeon and bibim milmyeon applicable for naengmyeon. The {{difference between the two}} is chiefly spicy sauce for bibim milmyeon.|$|R
50|$|<b>Simmering</b> is <b>a</b> food {{preparation}} technique in which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept {{just below the}} boiling point of water (which is 100 °C or 212 °F at average sea level air pressure), but higher than poaching temperature. <b>To</b> keep <b>a</b> pot <b>simmering,</b> one <b>brings</b> it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> boil and then reduces the heat <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point where the formation of bubbles has almost ceased, typically a water temperature of about 94 °C (200 °F) at sea level.|$|R
25|$|Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is {{traditionally}} prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) is added <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{pot of boiling}} water, the water is then reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer,</b> and the pot is covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used <b>to</b> make <b>an</b> extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "poaching" [...] is {{used for}} this method but is {{actually}} incorrect. The egg is placed in a cup and suspended over <b>simmering</b> water, using <b>a</b> special pan called an [...] "egg-poacher". This is usually a wide-bottomed pan with an inner lid, with holes containing a number of circular cups that each hold one egg, with an additional lid over the top. To cook, the pan is filled with water and brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer,</b> or <b>a</b> gentle boil. The outer lid holds in the steam, ensuring that the heat surrounds the egg completely. The cups are often lubricated with butter in order to effect easy removal of the cooked egg, although non-stick egg poachers are also available.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{variety of}} camping stoves on the market ranging in {{specialty}} from being extremely lightweight to focusing on using very little fuel. The majority of campers rely on a stove for their cooking needs as they boast several advantages over cooking over a campfire. Since most camping stoves have an adjustable heat source, they can be much easier <b>to</b> use than <b>a</b> campfire. The ability to quickly adjust the flame to reduce your pot from <b>a</b> boil <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer,</b> for example, is considered invaluable to many campers. Campfires can take <b>a</b> long time <b>to</b> start and get <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point where they are suitable for cooking over. Since a cook-stove can be ready in minutes, this is an advantage for many campers. Many types of cookware exist for outdoor cooking.|$|R
