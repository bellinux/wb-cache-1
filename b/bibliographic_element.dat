40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} semi-supervised <b>bibliographic</b> <b>element</b> segmentation. Our input data {{is a large}} scale set of bibliographic {{references}} each given as an unsegmented sequence of word tokens. Our problem is to segment each reference into bibliographic elements, e. g. authors, title, journal, pages, etc. We solve this problem with an LDA-like topic model by assigning each word token to a topic so that the word tokens assigned to the same topic refer to the same <b>bibliographic</b> <b>element.</b> Topic assignments should satisfy contiguity constraint, i. e., the constraint that the word tokens assigned to the same topic should be contiguous. Therefore, we proposed a topic model in our preceding work [8] based on the topic model devised by Chen et al. [3]. Our model extends LDA and realizes unsupervised topic assignments satisfying contiguity constraint. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} the proposal of a semi-supervised learning for our proposed model. We assume that at most one third of word tokens are already labeled. In addition, we assume that a few percent of the labels may be incorrect.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} for large-scale unsupervised segmentation of bibliographic elements. Our problem is to segment a word token sequence representing a citation into subsequences each corresponding to a different <b>bibliographic</b> <b>element,</b> e. g. authors, paper title, journal name, publication year, etc. Obviously, each <b>bibliographic</b> <b>element</b> should be represented by contiguous word tokens. We call this constraint contiguity constraint. Therefore, we should infer a sequence of assignments of word tokens to bibliographic elements so that this constraint is satisfied. Many HMM-based methods solve this problem by prescribing fixed transition patterns among bibliographic elements. In this paper, we use generalized Mallows models (GMM) in a Bayesian multi-topic model, effectively applied to document structure learning by Chen et al. [4], and infer a permutation of latent topics each {{of which can be}} interpreted as one among the bibliographic elements. According to the inferred permutation, we arrange the order of the draws from a multinomial distribution defined over topics. In this manner, we can obtain an ordered sequence of topic assignments satisfying contiguity constraint. We do not need to prescribe any transition patterns among bibliographic elements. We only need to specify the number of bibliographic elements. However, the method proposed by Chen et al. works for our problem only after introducing modification.

40|$|Purpose : The {{purpose of}} the article is to present user’s {{satisfaction}} with searching fiction in the library catalogue and to identify key <b>bibliographic</b> <b>elements</b> influencing user’s decision to select a particular version of an individual book title. The research tries {{to answer the question}} of adequacy of existing bibliographic records for identification and selection of fiction in the library catalogue as compared to browsing physical books on the shelves. Methodology/approach : Quantitative research included 108 adult users of three public libraries. Data were collected by conducting interviews and observation. The study was limited to three book titles: The Godfather (Mario Puzo), The catcher in the rye (Jerome David Salinger) and Quo vadis? (Henryk Sienkiewicz). Each participant was first asked to select among the bibliographic records and then could choose from the physical units. Analysis/results : The browsing of physical units on the shelves and book searching with the help of library staff proved to be the prevailing ways of book searching. The author and the blurb are generally the two decisive elements for a user to select a particular book, especially when browsing the shelves with the so-called recommended books. When searching the library catalogue, key <b>bibliographic</b> <b>elements</b> for user’s selection are the language, publication year, the length and the publisher. The user satisfaction rate with bibliographic records was 81 %; however, 43 % library users would rather select another book when they saw all possible versions. Two main reasons for the change were the condition of the book and the quality of print. Research limitation : The research was limited by space and time, the sample size and methodological approach, the selection of book titles and their versions. The research was mostly concentrated on how library users identified and selected different versions of the three book titles; actual browsing, searching and finding in a library catalogue were excluded. The future research should not be limited only to fiction but should be extended to non-fiction, different types of library materials on various media and to the study of impact and the possibility to include enhanced bibliographic records to the library catalogue. Originality/practical implications: The research is innovative as it focuses on two user tasks (identification and selection) and deals with the importance of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>elements</b> in the library catalogue and the selection criteria for publications in physical form. It deals with the (non) use of library catalogue and encourages librarians and cataloguers to study user needs when searching for fiction in the catalogue. The results could enhance the development and improvement of the library catalogue for electronic book searching. <br /...|$|R

The COAR Interest Group “Controlled Vocabularies for Repository Assets” is developing a set of controlled vocabularies for the <b>bibliographic</b> metadata <b>elements</b> used describing research outputs. Controlled vocabularies offer a uniform standard terminology for describing content, and assist with resource discovery, sharing and reuse of metadata and content, as well as integration between different systems.

COAR is promoting {{the adoption of the}} vocabularies by the repository community in order to improve interoperability across systems, organizations and regions. To that end, COAR has been working with the most common repository software platforms to have the vocabularies integrated directly into their workflows. The adoption of COAR Vocabularies is also encouraged in international and national guidelines for repository and CRIS managers such as the OpenAIRE Content Provider Guidelines, LA Referencia Guidelines and the German DINI Certificate for repositories. The COAR Vocabularies are also integrated and referenced in value added services like the the Phaidra Classification Server of University of Vienna in Austria, and Research Vocabularies Australia operated by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). Harmonization of vocabulary terms with the CASRAI dictionaries and glossaries is an ongoing task. So far the COAR Controlled Vocabularies Interest Group has released two vocabularies: Resource Types, to identify the genre of a scholarly output and Access Rights, to declare its degree of openness.

When each country seriously undertakes this task of ensuring that every book is captured under this scheme, it becomes a national bibliography; and the collective effort by various nations of the universe is the UBC. The efforts put up by individual countries in Africa will be the focus of this work. The author will consider this article under the following headings: a} Bibliographic control activities on Africa c} Problems with the compilation of Bibliographies in Africa d} Ways of enhancing Universal Bibliographic Control in Africa Bibliographic control activities on Africa Bibliographic control activities have generally developed in Africa randomly over the years. A few African countries are lucky to have gotten retrospective national bibliographies before 1940, and it was individuals who made personal effort to compile national bibliographies for these countries. According to Musiker (2005) Mendelssohn’s South African Bibliography was published in 1910 making South Africa the first African country to have a national bibliography. This was the conceit effort made by South African Librarians towards the attainment of universal bibliographic control According to Aje (1977 : 16 (3), Sierra Leone was the first West African country to have a national bibliography. It was compiled by Sir Harry Charles Luke and published in 1925. H. C. Luke was a colonial secretary for Sierra Leone and apparently had searched important libraries in London and the secretariat library in Freetown and came out with his work entitled “A Bibliography of Sierra Leone” Another individual named Cardinell, (Aje 1977; 21 (7)) concentrated on Ghana for a national retrospective bibliography, entitled “A Bibliography of the Gold Coast 1496 - 1931 ” published in 1932. Sources of his information are said to be 19 th century work was pioneered by the Basel mission who set up printing and publishing enterprise in the field of religious publications. On the government side where activities commenced earlier than the Bassel Mission, Cardinell recorded that government printing press started functioning after 1875, producing government gazettes and reports. Thus, the first listing of government publication was part of the colonial report on the Gold Coast. All these were precursors of the monumental work produced by A. W. Cardinell. A UNESCO document by Beaudiquez (1977 : 99) also named Burundi as another country with retrospective national bibliography compiled by individual effort. Daniel Nyambarize, librarian at Universite du Burundi institute universitaire des sciences de L’ Education centre Recherche’s et de Documentation, pedagogique, compiled a bibliography “Le Burundi: essai d” une bibliographic 1959 – 1973. This was a list of publications, research reports and periodicals published between 1959 and 1973 and held in Burundi National Library. The UNESCO document by Beaudiquez (1977 : 419) states further that Benin Republic is another country with retrospective national bibliography compiled by an individual called Guillaume Da Silva. It was published by the Institute de Recherche Applique es du Benin (IRAB). No date of publication was given by this source. Other African countries with retrospective national bibliographies by individuals include Chad (1968); Costa Rice (1958); Guinea (1964); Ivory Coast (1972 - 1974); Libya (1951 - 1971); Madagascar (1952); Morocco (1970); South Africa (1910) and Zambia (no date). These retrospective bibliographies are attempts to compile all the works published in these individual countries. A close look at this same UNESCO document (1977 : 419) shows that eighteen (18) other African countries, apart from the thirteen (13) mentioned here have national bibliographies compiled by depository centers. And some of these countries have legal deposit decrees backing them up from the central government. These show a great progress made in the development of Africa’s Continental Bibliography. Another study by Samuel Kotie (1971 : 14), on the development of library studies, University of Ghana identified thirty two current national bibliographies for African countries by 1969. Whereas, at the time the International Conference on African Bibliography (1970 : 1) was held in Nairobi, Kenya from December 4 - 8, 1967, only nine African countries were listed as having national bibliographies in the true sense of the word. These include, Ethiopia Madagascar, Malawi, Nigeria, Rhodesia, Senegal, South Africa, Sierra Leone and Tanzania. Another writer on bibliography, Amosu (1968 : 14 - 18), explained the issue of the availability of bibliographies of all types on Africa subject and national bibliographies produced on Africa. She also explored methods of bibliographic control of materials on Africa, the problem of coordination for complete coverage and avoidance of serious duplication amongst other considerations. In Nigeria, the National Library of Nigeria has been charged with these responsibilities of compiling; coordinating and publishing the bibliography of all published materials on Nigeria...|$|R

Information retrieval systems have been developed by getting feedback from themselves and user is usually ignored. Traditional processing and organization of the information are different from the processing of information in the user's mind. This causes disharmony between the user and information retrieval systems. The differences between the user and the information retrieval systems affect the user's information seeking behaviour and decision making. The success of the recall and precision of the information retrieval systems are influenced negatively when the cognitive {{structure of the}} user is not considered important {{in the design of the}} information service. The knowledge and the values of the user affect the way of reaching the <b>bibliographic</b> information. The <b>elements</b> of the <b>bibliographic</b> information give clues to the user in order to make decision. In addition to this, the user selects bibliographic information based on his/her values and criteria. The effects of the <b>elements</b> in the <b>bibliographic</b> information, document selection criteria and user's values on the decision making are exposed in this study. The hypothesis is that "the cognitive structure of the user, the assessment of values to the document (functional, social, emotional, epistemic, conditional), document selection criteria (topicality, authority, scope/level, novelty, quality, recency, availability, special requisite, relation with author) and <b>elements</b> of the <b>bibliographic</b> information (title, author, source, publication date, publisher, language, keywords, abstract) affect the selection of the documents". As a result of this research, we proved our hypothesis and recommended some suggestion related with the subject. The method of content analysis was used in this study. Postgraduate and doctorate students in Hacettepe University Faculty of Letters Department of Library Science and Ankara University Faculty of Letters Department of Library Science were participated in this study. There are 21 participants. Totally 1043 bibliographic information were given to these students. They were asked to evaluate the bibliographic information which was collected from LISA, Bulletin of Turkish Librarians' Association and other publications of Turkish Librarians' Association. The evaluation of the participants were important to get their opinions about the <b>elements</b> of the <b>bibliographic</b> information, criteria and their values. As a result, among the <b>elements</b> of the <b>bibliographic</b> information; title, abstract and source are used mostly and topicality, recency and scope/level are the most important ones out of the nine document selection criteria. According to the assessment of the value on the bibliographic information, it has been found that % 58, 9 functional, % 12, 9 epistemic, % 12, 1 conditional, % 10, 3 social and % 5, 8 emotional value are attributed to 1043 bibliographic information...|$|R
40|$|A proposta desta investigação {{consiste}} em compreender de modo mais pontual os processos de constituição da arte contemporânea a partir do fenômeno da crescente interação entre as culturas, o qual, no âmbito cultural da pósmodernidade, avança fortemente matizado por questões de natureza identitária. Em tempos atuais, parece impensável isolar a arte – à maneira moderna – e tratá-la como um organismo autônomo e impermeável ao mundo à sua volta. Desvinculada de um projeto histórico e de princípios universais de assimilação, a arte contemporânea corresponde a um novo modo de processar práticas estéticas no campo da arte, dentro de um âmbito que vem demandando, por parte dos artistas, a incursão por territórios sócio-políticos cada vez mais conflitivos. As críticas destrutivas, os ataques e as tentativas de desqualificar a arte contemporânea refletem um parcialismo preguiçoso e tendencioso. Tais atitudes quase sempre desconsideram as mudanças conjunturais que, pelos menos desde meados da década de 1970, vêm afetando o campo das artes visuais e dele fazem um território privilegiado para a visibilidade de leituras possíveis sobre diversas esferas sociais, como a da identidade cultural. Para realizar este empreendimento investigativo, optou-se por uma abordagem de cunho hermenêutico que tem como ponto de partida a crítica aos valores afirmativos e integralistas da História, combinada com algumas considerações sobre os campos conceituais da cultura e da identidade. Este núcleo estrutural acomoda uma análise sobre a arte contemporânea conduzida por novos agenciamentos presentes na crítica cultural pós-moderna, fortemente baseada na contextualidade da experiência, na narratividade do conhecimento e na inconsistência das explicações sinópticas e teleológicas sobre a realidade. Mediante a aproximação de exploração bibliográfica, elementos etnográficos e vivências no campo da arte, procurou-se construir este trabalho sob o domínio de uma sensibilidade dialógica que repudia a fixação de “fundamentos” e posições axiomáticas acerca da ciência, de modo que o próprio movimento de reconstrução do texto através de sua leitura possa criar possibilidades de enunciar o que não foi dito. O itinerário traçado a partir destes parâmetros produz tensionamentos que não são facilmente resolvidos, tendo em vista o fato de que os produtos gerados pela ciência são também constituídos a partir de um jogo de linguagem próprio que cadencia temporalidades, ritmos e processos de assimilação que não se revelam em sua totalidade. A projeção da cultura como um campo de experimentações políticas trouxe ao cenário atual a necessidade de compreensão dos seus impactos frente a diversas esferas da vida social. Como uma destas esferas, a arte absorveu as possibilidades criativas, desconstrutivas e ressignificantes que estão na base de um projeto que almeja reposicionar o valor da cultura após o desgaste da modernidade e o esvaziamento de suas significações. Sob esta ótica, os rompantes escatológicos e suicidas da arte perdem sua força, pois ela {{assume a}} posição de um texto que se enriquece na medida em que se deixa impregnar por outros textos. Posicionando-se desta forma, a arte evita a fixação de limites disciplinares precisos e aventura-se na busca por um sentido capaz de situá-la em espaços sociais que se renovam constantemente. It is {{the aim of}} this investigation work to comprehend in a more thorough way, the making processes of contemporary art {{in the light of the}} phenomenon of increased interaction among cultures, which in the sphere of postmodern culture advances strongly tinged with issues of identity nature. Isolating art – in the modern form – and treating it as an autonomous and impervious to the world organism is unthinkable in the present time. Dissociated from a historical project and from universal assimilation principles, contemporary art corresponds to a new form of processing the aesthetic practices in the field of art, within a sphere which is demanding, from the part of the artists, moving about increasingly conflicting territories. Criticism against, confrontation and attempts to discredit contemporary art generally reflect a biased and idle partiality. These attitudes do not consider the set of changes that have been taking place since at least the mid 70 ’s and which are affecting the field of visual arts although at the same time causing it to be a privileged territory for the possibilities of reading about the different social spheres such as the cultural identity one. In order to realize this research project, a hermeneutic approach was used and the starting point has been the critique of History affirmative values, combined with some considerations about the concept fields of culture and identity. This structural unit brings along an analysis over the contemporary art conducted by new perspectives present in the postmodern culture critique, strongly based on the contextuality of experience, on the narrative of knowledge and on the inconsistency of the synoptical and teleological explanations on reality. This research work has been constructed through the approximation of <b>bibliographic</b> data, ethnographic <b>elements</b> and experiences in the field of art, always under the domain of a dialogic sensitivity which does not advocate the establishment of axiomatic positions and “principles” about science, thus allowing for the movement of text reconstruction itself through its reading to make statement possibilities of the unsaid. The itinerary outlined from these standards creates strains that are not easily managed bearing in mind the fact that the products generated by science are also constructed from a unique language system which regulates temporality, rhythm and assimilation processes not wholly revealed. The projection of culture as a field for political experiment brought into our time the need to understand its impact over the different spheres of social life. As one of such spheres, art absorbed the creative, deconstructive and resignificant possibilities which form part of a project that aims at resetting the value of culture upon the deterioration of modern age. From this view the eschatological and suicidal irruptions of art lose strength as it takes the position of a text which enriches itself as it allows for other texts to impregnate it. It is through this perspective that art avoids the establishment of precise disciplinary limits and ventures into the pursuit of a meaning which will enable it to situate in social scenarios which renew themselves constantly...|$|R
