[...] She said at the time, [...] "I've enjoyed these things for 30 years. But it's time for a change." [...] Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. She later said, [...] "I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clearout, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie's. When you have to pay the bills, you're not proud and you can't take it with you." ...|$|E
500|$|Kornhaber {{described}} the video as a [...] "sombre, socially conscious curveball" [...] but wondered why Gaga released the PSA-like video, {{adding that she}} has: [...] "always <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> surprises, and unfortunately, no time is {{better than any other}} when it comes to discussing the issues she's singing about". Christopher Rosen from Entertainment Weekly {{described the}} clip as [...] "powerful, disturbing and emotional". Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Radhika Sanghani declared that each scenario in the video appeared realistic and wrote: [...] "by making sure the attacks differ in location, scenario and the appearances of both rapist and victim, Gaga is breaking the myth of there being a 'typical rape'". Corinne Heller from E! believed that the [...] "graphic, emotional and hard to watch" [...] video was able to deliver a [...] "powerful message", one that was close to Gaga due to her real-life rape experience. Wright described the video for NME as a [...] "brutal, monochrome rendering" [...] of the subject matter, with [...] "harrowing" [...] depictions of the rapes. She added that the rape statistics {{at the end of the}} video were [...] "horrifying" [...] but complimented Gaga for using her popularity to promote awareness of the subject. Loretta Donelan from Bustle believed that Gaga's previous music videos had political aspects but were open to interpretations. But with the music video of [...] "Til It Happens to You", she showed maturity by featuring [...] "chilling scenes of staged sexual assaults".|$|E

500|$|Paste {{magazine}} writer Brent Koepp {{called it}} [...] "another incredible episode" [...] {{and said the}} impending conflict between Walter and Gus [...] "has the makings of one of television's finest showdowns". He also said the script made good use of the supporting characters, and that the growing distance between Hank and Marie was particularly well handled. Matt Seitz of Salon.com compared [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to excellent third season episodes that had [...] "very few scenes and sequences but luxuriated in them, allowing the characters (and the viewer) time to experience the tiny eddies and currents of the moment". He also called an overhead shot of Walter standing outside Gus' house alone [...] "one of the best shots in the show's history". Tim Surette of TV.com especially praised the scene with Walter approaching Gus' house, writing: [...] "Breaking Bad has always <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> creating an air of tension, but now {{it seems as though}} the series has mastered it. He also said Paul's acting during Jesse's emotional breakdown [...] "ripped my heart out and shredded it to pieces". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said the photography and direction during Jesse's party scenes was masterful: [...] "Here we are four seasons into Breaking Bad and I shouldn't still be amazed at the innovated visuals or perfectly honed sense of sound. These are masters at work, people." [...] Slate writers Jessica Grose and June Thomas both enjoyed the episode, although they found Walter's character increasingly difficult to sympathize with. Both praised the scene when Mike attacked Walter, while Grose especially enjoyed Aaron Paul's performance and Skyler's subplot.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics. Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, have to be concerned that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bailey {{was educated}} at King Edward's School, an {{independent}} school in Bath {{where he was}} initially a highly academic pupil winning most of the prizes. At {{about the age of}} 15, he started to become distracted from school work when he realised the thrill of performance {{as a member of a}} school band called Behind Closed Doors, which played mostly original work. He was the only pupil at his school to study A-level music and he passed with an A grade. He also claims to have <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> sport (captain of KES 2nd XI cricket team 1982), which often surprised his teachers. He would often combine music and sport by leading the singing on the long coach trip back from away rugby fixtures.

2500|$|The {{expedition}} {{was to have}} {{an unlikely}} influence on the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition, {{the first time the}} summit was reached. Tenzing Norgay had been impressive in 1935– in future years he went on to be Sherpa many times on Everest, including on the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expeditions. In fact he was on all the subsequent British expeditions, including 1936 and 1938, culminating in his reaching the summit of Everest in 1953. On the 1935 occasion New Zealander Dan Bryant had not <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> altitude but he had become very popular and particularly well-respected {{by the rest of the}} party. When Shipton was assembling his team for the 1951 Everest reconnaissance he received an application from an unknown New Zealander at a time when British climbers were strongly favoured. With happy memories of Bryant, Shipton personally decided to appoint the New Zealander later writing, [...] "My momentary caprice was to have far reaching results". Following his success in 1951, Ed Hillary was invited back to Everest in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{was sent}} to Cheltenham College in 1841 {{when he was only}} seven, but after he had been there a year he {{was sent to}} a school kept by the Rev. Samuel Ollis Garrard in Gloucestershire. He {{attended}} the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1848, where he was a contemporary and friend of Charles George Gordon (no relation, later 'Gordon of Khartoum') and Thomas Bland Strange (later known as [...] "Gunner Jingo"). There Gordon appears to have <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> sports, but not studious and certainly undisciplined – [...] and like Richard Henry Horne, he was asked to leave. Gordon was again admitted a pupil at Cheltenham College. He was not there for long – he appears to have left in the middle of 1852 – but the story that he was expelled from Cheltenham is without foundation. Then Gordon was sent to the Royal Grammar School Worcester in 1852. Gordon began to lead a wild and aimless life, contracted debts, and was a great anxiety to his father, who at last decided that his son should go to Australia and make a fresh start in 1853 to join the mounted police with a letter of introduction to the Governor.|$|E
2500|$|Even with Duran Duran on hold, {{band members}} were soon anxious to record new music, {{leading to a}} {{supposedly}} temporary split into two side projects. John and Andy Taylor wanted {{to break away from}} the Duran Duran sound and pursue hard rock material; they collaborated with Robert Palmer and Tony Thompson to form the rock/funk supergroup the Power Station, which released two Top 10 singles. Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes, on the other hand, wanted to further explore Duran Duran's atmospheric aspect and formed Arcadia, who released one LP (So Red the Rose) from which the single [...] "Election Day" [...] was released. Contributors to that album included guitarist Masami Tsuchiya, bassist Mark Egan, percussionist David Van Tieghem, drummer Steve Jordan, Sting, Herbie Hancock, and David Gilmour. Roger Taylor was a drummer for Arcadia as well, but also contributed percussion to the Power Station album. Duran Duran were never the same after this break. According to Rhodes, the two side projects [...] "were commercial suicide... But we've always <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> that." [...] The band was still off balance when they regrouped to contribute [...] "A View to a Kill" [...] to the 1985 James Bond movie of the same name. This single was the first Bond theme to go to number 1 on the US charts, and was at the time the joint highest-placed Bond theme on the UK chart where it reached number 2. It was the last single the band recorded as the original five-piece for close to twenty years.|$|E

6000|$|I must {{write you}} again before I {{leave this place}} (which I do {{tomorrow}} noon;) if only to still a little the unrest of my having condemned myself, all too awkwardly, to be so long without hearing from you. I haven't all this while--that is these several days--had the letters which I am believing you will have forwarded to Monterey sent down to me here. This I have abstained from mainly because, having stopped over here these eight or nine days to write, in extreme urgency, an article, and wishing to finish it at any price, I have felt that I should go to pieces as an author if a mass of arrears of postal matter should come tumbling in upon me--and particularly if any of it should be troublous. However, I devoutly hope none {{of it has been}} troublous--and I have done my best to let you know (in any need of wiring etc.) where I have been. Also the letterless state has added itself to the deliciously simplified social state to make me taste the charming sweetness and comfort of this spot. California, on these terms, when all is said (Southern C. at least--which, however, the real C., I believe, much repudiates,) has completely bowled me over--such a delicious difference {{from the rest of the}} U.S. do I find in it. (I speak of course all of nature and climate, fruits and flowers; for there is absolutely nothing else, and the sense of the shining social and human inane is utter.) The days have been mostly here of heavenly beauty, and the flowers, the wild flowers just now in particular, which fairly rage, with radiance, over the land, are worthy of some purer planet than this. I live on oranges and olives, fresh from the tree, and I lie awake nights to listen, on purpose, to the languid list of the Pacific, which my windows overhang. I wish poor heroic Harry could be here--the thought of whose privations, while I wallow unworthy, makes me (tell him with all my love) miserably sick and poisons much of my profit. I go back to Los Angeles to-morrow, to (as I wrote you last) re-utter my (now loathly) Lecture to a female culture club of 900 members (whom I make pay me through the nose,) and on Saturday p.m. 8th, I shall be at Monterey (Hotel del Monte.) But my stay there is now condemned to bitterest brevity and my margin of time for all the rest of this job is so rapidly shrinking that I see myself brûlant mes étapes, alas, without exception, and cutting down my famous visit to Seattle to a couple of days. It breaks my heart to have so stinted myself here--but it was inevitable, and no one had given me the least inkling that I should find California so sympathetic. It is strange and inconvenient, how little impression of anything any one ever takes the trouble to give one beforehand. I should like to stay here all April and May. But I am writing more than my time permits--my article is still to finish. I ask you no questions--you will have told me everything.
