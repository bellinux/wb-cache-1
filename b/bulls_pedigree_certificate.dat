40|$|To {{explore the}} {{potential}} of cattle to produce both milk and beef, the genetic aspects of beef production among Holstein-Friesian <b>bulls</b> <b>pedigree</b> selected for milk were studied. The data included growth records of 504 bulls (DPT) by 120 sires (SPT) pedigree selected for progeny testing by American Breeders Service, 1964 to 1971. DPT bulls with proofs had an average predicted difference for milk (PMD) of + 180 kilograms. The daughter average was 7, 273 kg per lactation under varying herd conditions. Sires accounted for 10 % {{of the variation in}} average daily gain (ADG), 10 % in daily gain per 100 kg body weight (DG/ 100) and 16 % in body weight, indicating substantial genetic variability in beef traits. Sire variance components for beef traits varied with age. There were wide ranges in estimated breeding value (EBV) and estimated transmitting ability (ETA) for beef traits among DPT and SPT bulls, respectively. Ranking EBV among DPT bulls and ETA among SPT bulls for beef traits and selecting the top 10 % and 20 %, respectively, showed high selection differentials, empirically reflecting the potential for genetic improvement from selection...|$|R
40|$|Behavioural testing allows {{to exclude}} dogs that are fearful and {{aggressive}} from the breeding population, but relatively {{little is known}} about the effectiveness of such strategies in practice. From 2001 till 2009 parent purebred Dutch Rottweilers had to pass the Socially Acceptable Behaviour (SAB) -test for their offspring to obtain a <b>pedigree</b> <b>certificate.</b> We evaluated if this breeding policy of excluding fearful and aggressive Rottweilers, as diagnosed by the SAB-test, indeed reduced the prevalence of fear and aggression in the Dutch Rottweiler population. Owner-reported assessments of their dogs' behaviour were compared between groups of Rottweilers with or without <b>pedigree</b> <b>certificates,</b> assuming the Rottweiler look-a-likes to represent the control condition of no breeding policy regarding fear and aggression. A total of 822 Rottweiler owners filled out the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) on problem behaviour, including 7 behavioural categories related to fear and aggression. Problem behaviour prevalence and explanatory factors were investigated by multivariable logistic regression. The prevalence of Stranger-directed fear (P. <. 0. 05) and Non-social fear (P. <. 0. 01) was lower in the group of pedigrees than in the group of look-a-likes, with a same tendency for Stranger-directed aggression (P = 0. 056). Analysing the combined C-BARQ scores for the behaviour categories that are assessed with the SAB-test, namely Stranger-directed aggression, Dog-directed fear/aggression, Stranger-directed fear and Non-social fear, revealed that one sixth of the pedigree Rottweilers showed these behaviours compared to one third of the look-a-likes (P. <. 0. 0001). Strong associations were found between Stranger-directed aggression and Dog-directed fear/aggression (P. <. 0. 001) or Social Fear (P. <. 0. 001), indicating the role of fear in aggression towards unfamiliars. The association between Stranger-directed aggression and chase proneness (P. <. 0. 01) seems to illustrate how different motivations may underlie a same manifestation of aggression. Familiar dog aggression associated with Owner-directed aggression (P. <. 0. 001), implicating that such aggressions may have do with conflicts over status. Found associations between types of fear/aggression will have in part reflected shared underlying causes, and reflect the known comorbidity of problem behaviours. Their associations with dog and/or owner characteristics indicated several possible risk factors for fear/aggression. However, associations with common risk factors like sex and reproductive status were not found. Taking into account behaviour test outcomes in Rottweiler pedigree certification was associated with a reduced prevalence of fear and aggression. The exclusion of fear/aggressive individuals from the breeding population on the basis of SAB-test outcomes may have had favourable effects on population genetics or incited preventive actions by breeders like not putting a dog forward for pedigree certification. In our view, validated behaviour tests like the SAB-test can help to reduce unwanted behaviours in dog populations by breeding policies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Dairy cattle {{breeding}} {{is an international}} business, with trade of animal material across populations. Interbull performs international genetic evaluations of dairy bulls, enabling fair comparisons across populations. The bull daughter performances differ between populations and international evaluations therefore require estimation of genetic correlations between the populations. Prerequisites for estimating correlations are knowledge about the genetic variances and covariances within and between populations {{and the relationship between}} the <b>bulls.</b> Traditionally, <b>pedigree</b> information has been used to build the relationship matrix connecting included bulls. The recent developments in DNA technology have made it possible to also build genomic relationship matrices using information from the bull genomes. The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate variances and covariances estimated using pedigree or genomic relationship matrices and the effect of factors such as trait heritability, population size, and number of bulls used in more than one population. Moreover, we evaluate the genetic correlations estimated using our different estimates. Genetic variance estimates were compared for a total of 175 population-trait combinations, and genetic covariance and correlation estimates were assessed for four populations and three traits. Phenotypes, genotypes and pedigree were available for 8 864 Brown Swiss bulls originating from Germany-Austria, France, Italy, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United States of America. The results showed that more genetic variance and covariance was explained when the pedigree relationship matrix was used than using the genomic relationship matrix. We found an effect of trait heritability and population size on the genetic variance estimates and an effect of number of common bulls on the genetic covariance estimates. The estimated genetic correlations were similar for both relationship matrices used in the estimation of variances and covariances, indicating that {{it should be possible to}} obtain accurate across-population correlation estimates using genomic relationship matrices...|$|R

This remarkable man, who stood {{for the future of}} South Africa as clearly as the Dopper Boer stood for its past, had, both in features and in character, some traits which may, without extravagance, be called Napoleonic.

40|$|Several {{dairy cows}} have been {{identified}} as partially deficient in UMP synthase. Although erythrocytes of normal cows contained 2. 54 units of enzyme per ml, four cows were discovered with only 1. 08 units per ml. Cows deficient in UMP synthase secreted milk with abnormally high levels of orotate, 300 - 1, 000 micrograms of orotate per ml compared to 80 micrograms/ml for normal cows. The deficiency also was accompanied by a lactation-induced orotic aciduria. Although bovine urinary orotate was generally less than 10 micrograms/ml, the urine of the deficient cows, when lactating, contained 20 - 200 micrograms/ml. Their plasma orotate also was elevated. Genetic transmission of the condition was suggested by a common <b>bull</b> in the <b>pedigrees</b> of all deficient animals. Indeed, these cows, with half the normal level of UMP synthase, are probably heterozygotes with a 50 % chance of passing the deficient allele to their progeny. For these putative heterozygotes, the condition is apparently benign because longevity and production were unaffected. However, the existence of a gene for UMP synthase deficiency in the dairy cow population poses a hazard with respect to the conception of homozygotic, deficient animals.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to capture basic {{categories}} of behaviour and sexual behaviour of bulls in natural breeding, acquire and evaluate data from behavioural observations. The observations were realized in the village Obora u Tachova and were focused on a <b>pedigree</b> <b>bull</b> of a breed called Limousine (ZLI 796) and a herd of 26 breeding-cows, crossbreed beef cattle which are reared in the system of cows without market production of milk. The observations were made {{during the period from}} March 2013 till March 2014. The <b>pedigree</b> <b>bull</b> was in the herd of cows classified year-round. Monitoring with subsequent recording from the observations was performed whenever there was a breeding-cow in the herd and was discovered by a regular inspection of the herd observer. The snapshot method was used for the observations with the length of an interval of 5 minutes. From the ethological observation it emerged that the category of lying influences sexual behaviour of the bull towards to a breeding-cow the most. The value decreased from 15. 97 %, which was recorded in case of no breeding-cow in the herd, to 11. 87 % in case of one breeding-cow in the herd and, if there were more breeding-cows the value fell to 2, 51 %. For the category called movement, the value increased from 12. 50 % to 16. 03 % in case of one breeding-cow and when there were more breeding-cows, the value increased to 22. 17 %. Sexual behaviour of the bull has only a low effect on feed intake, which was always held on the level of 47 % and the category called stall which was in case of no breeding-cow and one breeding-cow 24 %. For more breeding-cows the values increased to 27 %. It was found out that the length of a movement extends at the expense of lying. The number of failed attempts to copulate the bull with one breeding-cow decreased from 17. 91 experiments to 12. 22 experiments with two or three breeding-cows. In case of successful copulations, the value increased from the original 5. 73 copulations with one breeding-cow in the herd to 6. 56 copulations with the average number of successful copulations 3. 11 per one copulation. The highest intensity of copulation passed off in the morning between 8 a. m. to 10 a. m., the second peak occurred around 5 p. m. in the afternoon.

40|$|Abstract. Hemochromatosis {{is rare in}} {{domestic}} mammals. Five clinical cases and one preclinical case of hemochromatosis were diagnosed in Salers and Salers-cross cattle. Clinical disease developed between 9 and 22 months of age. Animals were healthy until weaning but then lost weight, developed rough hair coats, and lost incisor teeth. In two animals, hemochromatosis was identified by liver biopsy, biochemical evidence of hepatic injury, and/or elevated transferrin saturation values. At necropsy, carcasses were thin, with firm dark brown livers and lymph nodes, soft bones, and brown-colored small bowel. The principal histologic changes were hepatocellular siderosis and periportal, bridging, and perivenular fibrosis. Siderocalcinosis involved collagen, elastin, reticulin, and basement membrane components in liver, lymph nodes, spleen, duodenum, and kidney. Hepatic iron concen-trations in clinically affected cattle were 1, 500 – 10, 500 g/g wet weight (reference range for cattle 300 g/ g). Ultrastructurally, the heaviest intrahepatic deposition was in hepatocytes, which contained large intracytoplas-mic siderosomes. Iron deposition in bone was associated with osteopenia. Genetic analysis indicated a common ancestral <b>bull</b> in the <b>pedigrees</b> of five of six affected cattle; no pedigree was available for the remaining animal. Four dams of five affected animals were phenotypically normal and had histologically normal livers.

5000|$|The Irish Moiled Cow {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} breed of cow in Ireland and [...] "the Moiled breed has been very {{successful}} in proportion to its numbers in open competition with other breeds in the milk recording contests." [...] Although the Irish Moiled Cow really did originate from Ireland, its known location to most is Finland. This is due to the fact that Norseman, such as the Danes, took much of the cattle. The numbers of Irish Moiled Cow left in Ireland made the true Irish cows endangered, and in an effort to replenish the numbers, the Irish Moiled Cattle Society tried to buy cows from Finland. The only problem was that they had to get special permits in order to breed these cows to bring them back. Once the cow had been replenished in Ireland, there was a sharp decline from 1930 to 1970. By the late 1970s there were only 30 cows left in Ireland owned by two breeders. The cow was becoming extinct and if the demand for Irish Moiled beef had not been required, this breed would have died out. Since then, the cow has made a comeback, it is still rare and endangered but is now being produced more widespread throughout Ireland as well as parts of England. There are now around one hundred breeders in the mainland of Ireland as well as another 40 breeders in England. Another important note of the Irish Moiled Cow is that throughout all the hardships that the breed has faced, they have maintained a pure breed albeit with some careful admixture of polled Lincoln red and beef shorthorn blood when the breed numbers were so low and no <b>pedigree</b> <b>bulls</b> were registered. Since then a grading up register was for a period allowed but has now been officially closed. This means that the species of Irish Moiled is maintained and healthy and breeding pure once again.|$|R
50|$|From the {{examination}} of horse teeth that were excavated from shell middens in Gwakji-ri and in Handeulgul Cave in Wollyeong-ri, horses are estimated to have been on Jejudo Island {{since the end of}} the Stone Age or the beginning of the Bronze Age. A historical document of the Goryeo Dynasty, recorded in 1073 A.D. (the 27th year of King Moonjong’s reign), states that an excellent steed was presented to the king from Jeju, which indicates Jeju has a long history of breeding horses. Systematic management of Jeju horses at a national level started in 1276 when a state-run ranch, Tamna Ranch, was constructed to accommodate 160 horses imported from Mongolia. According to another record, Jeju continued to import Mongolian horses for more than a century, until 1374. In the ancient times, Jeju provided horses upon the central government’s request, and bred approximately 20,000 horses.Starting in the 1960s, the usability of horses decreased as other means of transportation developed. In addition, the Korea Racing Authority introduced other breeds, such as the Anglo-Arabian and the Thoroughbred in late 1970s in order to produce race horses. Some of the foreign-bred stallions were used to create cross-breed horses, which contributed to the decreased number of native Jeju horses. In mid 1980s, the population of the Jeju horse dropped to approximately 1,200.In 1986, the central government designated the horse as Natural Monument No. 347, named ‘Jeju Horse of Jeju,’ to prevent it from extinction and to preserve its breeds as state-designated cultural properties. Currently, more than 150 native Jeju horses are being raised within a protection area.In 2000, the government appointed the Jeju Stockbreeding Promotion Institute as a designated agency to register and breed Jeju horses. It also established the Rules on the Registration and Management of Jeju Horses to maintain their pedigrees. An electronic chip is implanted into a new-born foal for identification.

40|$|Genomic {{selection}} (GS) {{has been}} adopted by the dairy cattle breeding industry and the opportunity exists to implement this technology in UK beef and sheep breeding. However, these sectors do not appear so readily predisposed to GS implementation. Following an introduction to GS in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 investigated {{the structure of the}} little-studied UK beef breeding sector. This provided estimates of key commercial and pedigree population parameters, for use in modelling genetic gain from GS. Terminal traits were found to be the dominant selection goals, with 85 % of beef-sired commercial matings resulting in progeny being slaughtered at a prime age. <b>Pedigree</b> <b>bulls</b> disseminated the majority of genes in the sector via natural service. The correlation between the terminal selection index (TI) and the sale price of breeding bulls was moderate, suggesting a modest uptake of genetic technology in the sector. Chapter 3 estimated selection intensity for TI, generation interval and the dissemination rate of improved genes in the pedigree Limousin population. In order to predict the genetic gain achievable in using GS in beef and sheep breeding, Chapters 4 to 6 undertook deterministic selection index simulations, incorporating genomic information as correlated traits. In Chapter 4, GS was modelled for terminal beef traits, when incorporating carcass information and accounting for likely genotype by environment interaction. Using a training population of 2000 sires, this concept was predicted to offer 40 % greater genetic gain than existing BLUP selection using pedigree phenotypes. Gene flow methodology projected the commercial value of this gain to offer a substantial return net of genotyping costs. Chapter 5 explored GS for maternal beef traits within the concept of a nucleus breeding scheme. Whilst greater genetic gain was predicted with GS than with conventional BLUP, the economic value of this gain was projected to be too low to justify such a scheme in the UK. Chapter 6 proposed a synergy between computer tomography (CT) phenotypes and GS in sheep breeding. Developing a genomic predictor from male selection candidates with CT phenotypes and conventional performance records was predicted to increase genetic gain by 55 % over BLUP selection without CT traits. Introducing GBV contributed most of the accuracy in this scenario, suggesting that the existing performance recording structure in UK sheep breeding could in the future be replaced by GS using CT. In the general discussion, the potential for GS in other beef and sheep traits was considered {{in the light of the}} outcomes of these simulations. Given the lack of vertical integration in UK beef and sheep sectors, the drivers for implementation of GS are examined. Finally, the options for international cooperation and the possibilities offered by future genotyping technology are considered. It was concluded that implementation of GS incorporating beef carcass phenotypes was merited and could provide a platform for future GS implementation in other novel traits. Sheep GS with CT traits was considered a higher risk strategy, due to the lack of evidence for uptake of existing EBV technology...|$|R
