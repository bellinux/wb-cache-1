40|$|Ricin is {{a highly}} toxic type II ribosome-inactivating protein that has {{potential}} as a <b>biochemical</b> <b>weapon</b> and as the toxic component of immunotoxins. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a survival response that helps cells to recover from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Failure to recover from ER stress leads to apoptosis. In yeast, ricin-A-chain (RTA), the enzymatic component of ricin, inhibits UPR. Our goals were to determine if RTA inhibits UPR in two epithelial cell lines and if this affects RTA cytotoxicity. RTA alone did not induce UPR. However, RTA inhibited both phosphorylation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE 1) and splicing of X-box binding protein 1 mRNA by the UPR-inducing agent tunicamycin (Tm). The ability of dithiothreitol (DTT) to activate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF 2 α), {{a component of the}} PERK pathway, was also inhibited by RTA. Treatment with RTA in combination with Tm or DTT inhibited protein synthesis more than either agent did alone in one cell line, while caspase cleavage was enhanced by the treatment combination in both cell lines. These data indicate that RTA is more cytotoxic when UPR is inhibited. This ability to inhibit UPR may enhance the potential of RTA as a therapeutic immunotoxin in solid tumors...|$|E
40|$|Plants alter soil {{characteristics}} {{in many ways}} causing changes in their subsequent growth resulting in either positive or negative feedback on their own fitness. Plants in their native ranges typically experience negative feedback from natural enemies, while feedback is often positive in invaded ranges where they escape enemies, experience new beneficial mutualisms, or bring with them a novel <b>biochemical</b> <b>weapon.</b> I conducted a fully factorial greenhouse experiment to examine plant-soil feedback in the invasive shrub Lonicera maackii {{and whether or not}} positive feedback may contribute to its successful invasion in southern Ohio. I also investigated whether the sign and strength of the feedback changed across two distinct soil types, and whether effects were due to shifts in biotic or abiotic soil traits by analyzing soil properties, phenolic content and microbial communities. I compared L. maackii 2 ̆ 7 s response to the related native shrub, Diervilla lonicera, using their conditioned soils along with soil conditioned by an unrelated native tree, Fraxinus pennsylvanica. I hypothesized that L. maackii would experience positive feedback overall in both soil types. L. maackii showed positive feedback in Shawnee soils, but neutral to negative feedback in Wright State soils. Growth of L. maackii decreased and positive feedback was eliminated with sterilization in Shawnee soil which may indicate that it had benefitted from mutualisms that were destroyed by sterilization. In Wright State soil, sterilization significantly increased growth, suggesting L. maackii had been released from pathogenic organisms found in live soils. Despite this, feedback became even more negative with sterilization in Wright State soil which may be a sign that its own phytochemicals hinder its growth in the absence of biotic symbioses. Lonicera maackii performed similarly in its own soils and in those of F. pennsylvanica and D. lonicera, regardless of soil type. Our findings also suggest native species are controlled by negative feedbacks in their own soils. Diervilla lonicera displayed negative feedback overall in its own unsterilized soil regardless of soil type, but sterilization eliminated or reversed feedback relationships. Growth of Diervilla lonicera varied little in soils conditioned by L. maackii and F. pennsylvanica in both soil types. Our results indicate that both soil type and soil microorganisms play a large role in plant-soil feedback, yet feedback in L. maackii is dependent on soil type. Our evidence reveals that sign and strength of feedback can vary with soil source. This is the first study to examine plant-soil feedback in L. maackii, {{one of the most important}} invaders in Ohio uplands...|$|E

The chemicals in question can be generalized as bisimide anthracene derivatives. The idea behind these compounds is that in the presence of certain nerve gases, the compound will actually fluoresce, giving an indication that there is a strong likelihood of the presence of a nerve gas and ensure the proper precautionary measures are taken. The fluorescence is due to the quenching of an electric proton transfer within the structure of the molecule.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{invasion of}} the nonmycorrhizal biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata in North America is hypothesized to be facilitated by the production of novel <b>biochemical</b> <b>weapons</b> that suppress the growth of mycorrhizal fungi. As a result, A. petiolata {{is expected to be}} a strong competitor against plant species that rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake services. If A. petiolata is also a strong competitor for soil resources, it should deplete nutrients to levels lower than can be tolerated by weaker competitors. Because the negative effect of losing the fungal symbiont for mycorrhizal plants is greatest when nutrients are low, the ability of A. petiolata to simultaneously suppress fungi and efficiently take up soil nutrients should further strengthen its competitive ability against mycorrhizal plants. To test this hypothesis, we grew 27 mycorrhizal tree, forb and grass species that are representative of invaded habitats in the absence or presence of competition with A. petiolata in soils that had previously been experimentally planted with the invader or left as a control. A history of A. petiolata in soil reduced plant available forms of nitrogen by > 50 % and phosphorus by 17 % relative to control soil. Average mycorrhizal colonization of competitor species was reduced by > 50 % in A. petiolata history versus control soil. Contrary to expectations, competition between A. petiolata and other species was stronger in control than history soil. The invader suppressed the biomass of 70 % of competitor species in control soil but only 26 % of species in history soil. In addition, A. petiolata biomass was reduced by 56 % in history versus control soil, whereas the average biomass of competitor species was reduced by 15 %. Thus, our results suggest that the negative effect of nutrient depletion on A. petiolata was stronger than the negative effect of suppressing mycorrhizal colonization on competitor species. These findings indicate that the inhibitory potential of A. petiolata on competitor species via mycorrhizal suppression is not enhanced under nutrient limitation...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic {{bacteria}} secrete various virulence {{factors as}} their <b>biochemical</b> <b>weapons</b> {{to gain access}} to and destroy the target cells. They can directly interact with the outer lipid bilayer membrane of eukaryotic cells, inducing the premature cell death by either apoptosis or necrosis. Such virulence factors account for much of the toxic actions associated with bacterial infection; therefore the detection of such proteins could provide a methodology for sensing/detection of pathogenic bacteria in, for example, food or human tissue. Detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria by conventional methods such as plating and counting in laboratory is expensive and time consuming. With growing concerns over emergence and re-emergence of pathogenic bacteria with high resistant to current antibiotics, there is a potential need for effective detection of pathogenic toxins invitro. On the other hand, artificially prepared lipid bilayer membrane on planar metallic surfaces provides the cell membrane mimics which are extremely useful in exploring the cellular functions and processes at the molecular level. Therefore in this work, an application of planar tethered bilayer lipid membrane (pTBLM) as a biomimetic sensing platform for the detection of clinically important pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa via their secreted virulence factors was presented. Planar TBLM was modified by incorporation of cholesterol and detection of bacterial toxins at human body temperature was examined by impedance and surface plasmon resonance methods. The results of pathogenic bacterial toxin detection were compared with those of Escherichia coli (DH 5 α), the human gut normal flora with non-pathogenic strain, as a control. Additionally pTBLM was transferred onto single nanoporous Si 3 N 4 membrane to enhance the toxin sensitivity and extend the lifetime for the possible realization of future membrane chips for ion channel characterizations and drug screenings. Then the single ion channel measurement was demonstrated with nanopore-suspended TBLM (Nano-psTBLM) using α-toxin of S. aureus. The results presented in this work therefore, may pave the more effective and efficient ways for future pathogenic bacterial detection in which the sensing mechanism was solely based on the nature of interactions as well as modes of action between bacterial toxins and artificial lipid bilayer membranes...|$|R
40|$|Why do militaries {{invest in}} some {{emerging}} technologies but not others? Conventional wisdom suggests that capable states have reasons to hedge their bets {{and invest in}} emerging military technologies as widely as they can. Yet, even the most capable states do not invest in all technologies of military utility. Moreover, in some cases, early investments {{in research and development}} (R&D) are not sufficiently sustained to lead to any realized capability. This dissertation answers the question of why some emerging technologies are able to attract and sustain military investment while others cannot. I argue that decisions over such investments are influenced by relevant actors’ assessment of feasibility during the R&D process, the military requirement the technology fulfills, and the availability of alternatives. In particular, a dominant belief in low feasibility, highly stringent requirements, and available alternatives can create an unfavorable condition that makes an emerging technology unappealing as an investment opportunity. Such a condition can prevent a technology from attracting or sustaining investment even if it were to have legitimate military use. Three case studies are conducted to illustrate this argument: <b>biochemical</b> non-lethal <b>weapons,</b> neuropharmacological treatment for combat stress, and aircraft nuclear propulsion.
