30|$|The same {{disaggregation}} into subgroups {{shows that}} <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are consistently increasing from subgroup to subgroup. We {{do not need}} to report the figures here. Average <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> increase from 6.11 in the subgroup with the lowest experience level to 70.73 in the group with the highest experience level. Finally, if we run separate regressions of odds on <b>bet</b> <b>sizes,</b> we find that odds are decreasing in <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> in all subgroups. This is significant at the 1  % level in all subgroups. The coefficients of <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> range from a minimum of − 0.0003 (subgroup 10) to a maximum of 0.53 (subgroup 1) when we define the highest experienced group as group ten.|$|R
30|$|As a {{side effect}} of our analysis, we show that <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> and odds are {{negatively}} correlated at all levels of experience. This supports two current empirical papers (Kopriva 2009 and Andrikogiannopoulou 2010) showing that accounting for different <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> is important when estimating preferences from the data.|$|R
30|$|Another {{point we}} are {{interested}} in is the relationship between odds and <b>bet</b> <b>sizes.</b> Due to a lack of data, {{the overwhelming majority of the}} literature estimating preferences from odds and outcomes has assumed that <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are independent of odds (e.g., the seminal paper by Jullien and Salanié 2000). This assumption, however, is implausible as few bettors are willing to invest high amounts on outcomes with a success probability of 5  %, for instance. For our data set, we indeed find that <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are, for all levels of experience, consistently decreasing in odds. Although this result is perfectly intuitive, it seems to be important as it implies that all models estimating preferences from the data by assuming equal <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are likely to be biased (Kopriva 2009).|$|R
50|$|This {{system is}} one that is {{designed}} so that when the player has won over a third of his bets (less than the expected 18/38), he will win. Whereas the martingale will cause ruin {{in the event of a}} long sequence of successive losses, the Labouchère system will cause <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> to grow quickly even where a losing sequence is broken by wins. This occurs because as the player loses, the average <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> in the line increases.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} other betting systems {{that rely on}} this fallacy, or that attempt to follow 'streaks' (looking for patterns in randomness), varying <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> accordingly.|$|E
50|$|Back-counting is {{different}} from traditional card-counting, in that the player does not play every hand he sees. This offers several advantages. For one, the player does not play hands at which {{he does not have}} a statistical advantage. This in turn reduces variance and fluctuations, and increases the total advantage of the player. Another advantage is that the player does not have to change their <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> as much, or at all if they choose. Large variations in <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> are one way that casinos detect card counters, and this is eliminated with back-counting.|$|E
30|$|We {{are aware}} of three other papers {{accounting}} for different <b>bet</b> <b>sizes.</b> While Bradley (2003) provides a theoretical model based on prospect theory, Kopriva (2009) and Andrikogiannopoulou (2010) {{seem to be the}} only other empirical papers having data on <b>bet</b> <b>sizes.</b> Kopriva’s data set is from betfair.com which differs significantly from the usual betting platforms. On betfair.com, bettors can post limit orders where they stipulate at which odds {{they would be willing to}} trade. As on share markets, it then depends on the clearing price whether bets are put through or not. Kopriva shows that the estimation results for risk preferences change considerably when controlling for <b>bet</b> <b>sizes.</b> Our paper simply demonstrates that the negative correlation between odds and <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> is an important empirical fact which holds for all levels of experience. Andrikogiannopoulou (2010) has randomly picked data on hundred bettors from a large betting company which she uses to estimate individual risk preferences.|$|R
5000|$|The company {{indicates}} that operators {{are able to}} choose between payout settings for their slots [...] and video poker games. They have expressed intentions to limit operator liability for a single game to $50,000 by default, by reducing maximum <b>bet</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|R
30|$|As a {{side step}} of this analysis, we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} odds and the variance of returns. We are interested in this as {{it seems reasonable to}} view the variance as a (though clearly imperfect) proxy for the risk of bets. For purely arithmetical reasons, the variance of the return for a bet on longshots is higher when <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are independent of odds. If there are just two possible outcomes and <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> on favorites and longshots are proportional to win probabilities (that is, inversely proportional to fair odds), then the variance of return is the same for both <b>bets.</b> As <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> decrease in odds, the relation between the variance and odds per bet is an open empirical question. When we do not control for experience, we find that the variance per bet is, on average, decreasing in odds. Controlling for experience, however, shows that this result is driven by large investors who bet high amounts on favorites. This finding is reinforced by our separation into subgroups: the variance is significantly increasing in odds for the first nine subgroups, but significantly decreasing in odds for the subgroup with the highest experience.|$|R

50|$|Players {{known as}} comp hustlers attempt to {{maximize}} the amount of comps that they receive, as well as minimize their expected losses in gambling to receive those comps. Comp hustlers play games with a low house advantage, such as blackjack or video poker, or games with small bet sizes such as penny slots. Comp hustlers may use tactics such as placing large bets when a pit boss is checking their <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> to rate them for comps, and then moving to a smaller <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> when the boss is not watching. They may also take frequent breaks from playing, play at full tables to be dealt fewer hands per hour, and play more slowly. Comp hustling {{is a type of}} advantage gambling if the player is able to hustle more in comps than their average cost of gambling.|$|E
40|$|In extensive-form {{games with}} a large number of actions, careful {{abstraction}} of the action space is critically important to performance. In this paper we extend previous work on action abstraction using no-limit poker games as our test domains. We show that in such games it is no longer necessary to choose, a priori, one specific range of possible <b>bet</b> <b>sizes.</b> We introduce an algorithm that adjusts the range of <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> considered for each bet individually in an iterative fashion. This flexibility results in a substantially improved game value in no-limit Leduc poker. When applied to no-limit Texas Hold’em our algorithm produces an action abstraction that is about one third the size of a state of the art hand-crafted action abstraction, yet has a better overall game value...|$|R
30|$|Given that <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are {{decreasing}} in odds, it {{is interesting}} to see how the final odds set by the monopolistic betting agency differ from odds which would be realized at the totalisator (parimutuel-betting market), and which would just be given by the ratio of the amount bet on the correct outcome and the overall amount.|$|R
50|$|AIs like PokerSnowie and Claudico {{have been}} created by {{allowing}} the computer {{to determine the best}} possible strategy by letting it play itself an enormous number of times. This seems to be the current approach to poker AI, as opposed to attempting to make a computer that plays like a human. This results in odd <b>bet</b> <b>sizing</b> and a much different strategy than humans are used to seeing.|$|R
50|$|Comp hustling can {{be another}} form of {{advantage}} gambling. Players who play games with a low house advantage or low <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> such as penny slots, can get more than their expected loss in free items from the casino. Many advantage players also take steps to maximize the comps they receive from their play.|$|E
5000|$|A {{mathematical}} principle {{called the}} Kelly criterion indicates that bet increases should be {{proportional to the}} player advantage. In practice, {{this means that the}} higher the count, the more a player should bet on each hand in order {{to take advantage of the}} player edge. Using this principle, a card counter may elect to vary his <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> in proportion to the advantage dictated by a count creating what is called a [...] "Bet ramp" [...] according to the principles of the Kelly criterion. A bet ramp is a betting plan with a specific <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> tied to each true count value in such a way that the player is betting proportionally to the player advantage with aims to maintain a constant risk of ruin for every bet made.Taken to its ultimate conclusion, the Kelly criterion would demand that a player not bet anything at all when the deck doesn't offer a positive expectation; the [...] "Wonging" [...] strategy described above implements this.|$|E
50|$|Researchers {{from the}} Responsible Gambling Fund financed, University of Sydney Gambling Treatment Clinic, have {{suggested}} that strategies such a minimum <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> {{are not likely to}} prevent the local community from being affected by problem gambling.

30|$|In {{cases where}} Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) or a Brunnauer-Emmet-Teller (<b>BET)</b> <b>sizing</b> method {{was used in}} {{conjunction}} with a Transfer Electron Microscopy (TEM) or Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) method, the latter sizing values were preferred over the former ones as they provide better accuracy (DLS and BET methods both take into account the hydrodynamic size of particles with the assumption of sphericity instead of their actual dimensions. This incurs problems when the nanoparticles are clustered/agglomerated or not spherical).|$|R
50|$|In certain casinos, {{such as the}} Wynn and Encore Casinos in Las Vegas, {{chips are}} {{embedded}} with RFID tags to help casinos keep better track of them, determine gamblers' average <b>bet</b> <b>sizes,</b> and to make them harder for counterfeiters to reproduce. However, this technique is costly and {{considered by many to}} be unnecessary to profit. Also, this technology provides minimal benefits in games with layouts that do not provide gamblers with their own designated betting areas, such as craps.|$|R
5000|$|Denominations above $5000 {{are almost}} never {{encountered}} {{by the general}} public; their use is usually limited to [...] "high limit rooms" [...] where <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are much greater than on the main floor. Casinos often use gaming plaques for these denominations: These plaques are {{about the size of}} a playing card, and must be marked with serial numbers. The greatest value placed on a plaque to date is $10 million, used at the London Club in Las Vegas.|$|R
5000|$|For example, we {{may offer}} {{a price of}} 32-35 for [...] "the FTSE to finish {{up at the end}} of the day". You think the FTSE will rise, so you Buy at 35 for £10 a point.

To close this bet and take an early profit you would Sell at 80 points for the same <b>bet</b> <b>size,</b> ie £10 a point.|$|E
5000|$|The {{player was}} accused of {{cheating}} by the casino, who said he used a robot (automated playing program), {{and that he would}} not be paid. Since the game has a casino advantage (albeit a low advantage, somewhere over 0.1% [...] ), the casino should still have held the edge, though good luck can overcome an edge in the short and medium-term. The details of the player's final settlement with the casino were never published. RTG subsequently limited the maximum <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> of the game to $5, before removing it entirely.|$|E
50|$|The game {{features}} numerous five-reel slots {{that vary}} by <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> {{and the number}} of betting lines available. Bonus rounds are activated when three “Bonus” symbols appear on valid lines, and extra coins are earned for outscoring friends.As the game progresses, new levels are unlocked, with higher max bets. At the same time, players earn points in the game’s loyalty program. Every bet adds experience points to a bar located {{at the top of the}} screen. Once the bar is filled, the player advances to the next level. There are five levels ranging from Tin to Platinum. Tournament play, achievements lists, and a high-limit lobby add to the social experience. As with other Zynga games on Facebook, friends help one another achieve goals.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of Tartanian 5, a no-limit Texas Hold’em agent which we submitted to the 2012 Annual Computer Poker Competition. The agent plays a game-theoretic approximate Nash equilibrium strategy. First, it applies a potential-aware, perfect-recall, automated abstraction algorithm to group similar game states together and construct a smaller game that is strategically similar to the full game. In order to maintain a tractable number of possible betting sequences, it employs a discretized betting model, where {{only a small number}} of <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are allowed at each game state. The strategies for both players are then computed using an improved version of Nesterov’s excessive gap technique specialized for poker. To mitigate the effect of overfitting, we employ an ex-post purification procedure to remove actions that are played with small probability. One final feature of our agent is a novel algorithm for interpreting <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> of the opponent that fall outside our model. We describe our new approach in detail, and present theoretical and empirical advantages over prior approaches. Finally, we briefly describe ongoing research in our group involving real-time computation and opponent exploitation, which will hopefully be incorporated into our agents in future years...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present two famous poker models, {{developed}} be Borel and von Neumann. An analysis of each model {{will be presented}} and an equilibrium solution found. Throughout the paper we will show facts about optimal play, for these models, that mirror very general ”rules of thumb” that most skilled poker players would argue are true in any poker variant. Analysis will include what to do against opponents who are behaving irrationally, {{as well as how}} one should adjust their play with varying <b>bet</b> <b>sizes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Regret {{matching}} is a widely-used algorithm {{for learning}} how to act. We begin by proving that regrets on actions in one setting (game) can be transferred to warm start the regrets for solving a different setting with same structure but differ-ent payoffs that can be written {{as a function of}} parameters. We prove how this can be done by carefully discounting the prior regrets. This provides, to our knowledge, the first prin-cipled warm-starting method for no-regret learning. It also extends to warm-starting the widely-adopted counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) algorithm for large incomplete-information games; we show this experimentally as well. We then study optimizing a parameter vector for a player in a two-player zero-sum game (e. g., optimizing <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> to use in poker). We propose a custom gradient descent algo-rithm that provably finds a locally optimal parameter vector while leveraging our warm-start theory to significantly save regret-matching iterations at each step. It optimizes the pa-rameter vector while simultaneously finding an equilibrium. We present experiments in no-limit Leduc Hold’em and no-limit Texas Hold’em to optimize <b>bet</b> <b>sizing.</b> This amounts to the first action abstraction algorithm (algorithm for selecting a small number of discrete actions to use from a continuum of actions—a key preprocessing step for solving large games us-ing current equilibrium-finding algorithms) with convergence guarantees for extensive-form games...|$|R
50|$|Oscar's Grind {{divides the}} entire {{gambling}} event into sessions. A session is {{a sequence of}} consecutive wagers made until 1 unit of profit is won. Each session begins by betting 1 unit, and ends by winning 1 unit of profit. If the gambler loses, the session continues and the bet is repeated. Each time the gambler wins the game following a lost game, the bet is increased by 1 unit. This increase is not performed if the current bet warrants achieving at least 1 unit of profit in total, in case the next game is won. On the contrary, the <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> {{in such a situation}} should be decreased to assure exactly 1 unit is won. Given infinite money and time, this makes sure that every session ends with a 1 unit profit.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{a gambler}} with {{infinite}} wealth will, almost surely, eventually flip heads, the martingale betting strategy {{was seen as}} a sure thing by those who advocated it. Of course, none of the gamblers in fact possessed infinite wealth, and the exponential growth of the bets would eventually bankrupt [...] "unlucky" [...] gamblers who chose to use the martingale. The gambler usually wins a small net reward, thus appearing to have a sound strategy. However, the gambler's expected value does indeed remain zero (or less than zero) because the small probability that he will suffer a catastrophic loss exactly balances with his expected gain. (In a casino, the expected value is negative, due to the house's edge.) The likelihood of catastrophic loss may not even be very small. The <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> rises exponentially. This, combined with the fact that strings of consecutive losses actually occur more often than common intuition suggests, can bankrupt a gambler quickly.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s Ken Uston was {{the first}} to write about a tactic of card {{counting}} he called the Big Player Team. The book was based on his experiences working as a [...] "big player" [...] (BP) on Al Francesco's teams. In big-player blackjack teams a number of card counters, called [...] "spotters," [...] are dispatched to tables around a casino, where their responsibility is {{to keep track of the}} count and signal to the big player when the count indicates a player advantage. The big player then joins the game at that table, placing maximum bets at a player advantage. When the spotter indicates that the count has dropped, he again signals the BP to leave the table. By jumping from table to table as called in by spotters, the BP avoids all play at a disadvantage. In addition, since the BP's play appears random and irrational, he avoids detection by the casinos. The spotters, who are doing the actual counting, are not themselves changing their <b>bet</b> <b>size</b> or strategy, so they are relatively inconspicuous.|$|E
40|$|We extend gender {{research}} on risk behavior to betting markets. Our data set consists of all 5, 136, 660 bets in New Zealand from 2006 to 2009 and allows assigning each bet to individ-ual bettors. Women {{are much more}} prone to the favorite-longshot bias and suffer higher losses. Usually, betting on longshots is associated with higher variance of return, but we find that <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> are disproportionally decreasing in odds. Hence, the average risk when betting on longshots is in fact lower. This observation reconciles our findings with gender {{research on}} risk preferences and leads to new insights on the favorite-longshot bias...|$|R
30|$|Again, it is {{instructive}} to consider the ten subgroups, ordered by ExpAmount, separately. Not surprising, {{we find that the}} variance per bet increases from subgroup to subgroup. More interesting results are obtained when we run regressions on the variance of odds for each of the ten subgroups. We then find that the variance increases in odds for the first nine subgroups, but decreases in odds for the subgroup with the largest investors; all significant at the 1  %-level. Thus, for all subgroups but the one with the highest experience, <b>bet</b> <b>sizes</b> and odds are negatively correlated, but at a degree which does not overcompensate the direct effect of odds on variance.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that an {{advantage}} gambler maximizes the average geometric growth rate by using Kelly betting. If the advantage is known precisely, then one can to use Full Kelly betting or, more commonly, some fraction of it. Systematic gamblers may have an advantage, but may not know exactly how large it is. This may be the case for e. g. sports bettors, blackjack and poker players and future traders. We show how they can estimate the fraction of full Kelly they have been employing, from their past results. This ongoing process enables them to select future <b>bet</b> <b>sizing</b> scientifically according to their risk tolerance. We use a geometric Brownian motion model to obtain a confidence interval estimator for the fraction of Kelly bet based on historical bankroll data...|$|R
