5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy <b>brush</b> <b>strokes,</b> Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.|$|E
5|$|The figures, the {{minutely}} detailed clothes, and {{the architecture}} of the room and windows are depicted {{with a high degree of}} realism. Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of <b>brush</b> <b>strokes.</b> The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|The {{sunflowers}} {{were painted}} {{to decorate the}} walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in Arles. Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the <b>brush</b> <b>strokes,</b> and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|Marigene Butler, head {{conservator}} at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research project}} between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and priming layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample of paint {{was taken from the}} seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure ultramarine, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer of paint overlaid with hatching and fine <b>brush</b> <b>strokes</b> on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyse {{the impact of}} {{brushing}} on the protective effect of different fluoride solutions on enamel and dentin erosion. Bovine enamel and dentin specimens were rinsed once with TiF 4, AmF, SnF 2 (0. 5 M F, 2 min) or water (control). Specimens were either left unbrushed or brushed with 10, 20, 50, 100 or 500 <b>brushing</b> <b>strokes</b> in an automatic brushing machine (2 N, non-fluoridated toothpaste slurry). Ten specimens per group were eroded with hydrochloric acid (HCl) (pH 2. 3) for 60 s, and calcium release into the acid was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, enamel and dentin surfaces were analysed by X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (n = 6 /group) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (n = 2 /group) before brushing and after 500 <b>brushing</b> <b>strokes.</b> Statistical analysis (p < 0. 05) was performed by three- and one-way ANOVA (calcium release) or repeated measures ANOVA (EDS). TiF 4, AmF and SnF 2 reduced the erosive calcium loss in unbrushed specimens to 58 - 67 % (enamel) and 23 - 31 % (dentin) of control. Calcium release increased with increasing <b>brushing</b> <b>strokes</b> prior to erosion and amounted to 70 - 88 % (enamel) and 45 - 78 % (dentin) of control after 500 <b>brushing</b> <b>strokes.</b> <b>Brushing</b> reduced the surface concentration of fluoride (AmF), tin (SnF 2) and titanium (TiF 4). SEM revealed that surface precipitates were affected by long-term brushing. Brushing reduced the protective potential of TiF 4, AmF and SnF 2 solutions. However, considering {{a small number of}} <b>brushing</b> <b>strokes,</b> the protective effect of fluoride solutions is only slightly affected by brushing abrasion...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{simulation}} method of the <b>brush</b> <b>stroke</b> is proposed by applying force feedback {{technology to the}} virtual painting process. The relationship between force and the brush deformation is analyzed, and the spring-mass model is applied to construct the brush model, which can realistically simulate the brush morphological changes according to the force exerted on it. According to the deformation of the brush model at a sampling point, the brush footprint between the brush and the paper is calculated in real time. Then, the <b>brush</b> <b>stroke</b> is obtained by superimposing brush footprints along sampling points, and the dynamic painting of the <b>brush</b> <b>stroke</b> is implemented. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the virtual painting system based on the force feedback technology. In this system, users can implement the painting in real time with a Phantom Desktop haptic device, which can effectively enhance reality to users...|$|R

After Ghazan's nephew Abu Said died in 1335, however, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties – most prominently the Jalayirids, Muzaffarids, Sarbadars and Kartids.|$|E
25|$|Post-Impressionism is {{the term}} coined by the British artist and art critic Roger Fry in 1910 to {{describe}} the development of French art since Manet. Fry used the term when he organized the 1910 exhibition Manet and Post-Impressionism. Post-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued using vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive <b>brush</b> <b>strokes,</b> and real-life subject matter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for expressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method that takes a raster image as input and {{produces}} a painting-like image composed of strokes rather than pixels. Our method works by first segmenting the image into features, finding the approximate medial axes of these features, and using the medial axes to guide <b>brush</b> <b>stroke</b> creation. System parameters may be interactively manipulated by a user to effect image segmentation, <b>brush</b> <b>stroke</b> characteristics, stroke size, and stroke frequency. This process creates images reminiscent of those contemporary representational painters whose work has an abstract or sketchy quality. Our software is available at [URL]...|$|R

25|$|In his sculpture, he digs through sources {{ranging from}} other art and other genres (most notably Feynman diagrams), to flea markets, nuclear power plants, and fields of grass. He is {{in search of}} forms and ideas from which to build models, table pieces, and {{occasionally}} larger landscape pieces. Even some nominally finished, large scale works are reworked heavily. But at the same time, some random sculptural equivalents of <b>brush</b> <b>strokes</b> or artifacts of a piece's former life are retained, a degree of wabi-sabi, as {{may be seen in}} Rocket Science (circa 2006–9, Hogpen Hill, Connecticut).|$|E
25|$|Japanese {{calligraphy}} {{was influenced}} by, and influenced, Zen thought. For any {{particular piece of}} paper, the calligrapher has but one chance to create with the brush.

The brush writes a statement about the calligrapher at a moment in time (see Hitsuzendō, the Zen way of the brush). Through Zen, Japanese calligraphy absorbed a distinct Japanese aesthetic often symbolised by the ensō or circle of enlightenment.|$|E

40|$|We present CoolPaint, {{a system}} for {{computer}} painting that uses a props-based direct interaction technique. By instrumenting real paint brushes and developing corresponding digital models of the brushes, we allow the user to control digital tools by directly manipulating their physical counterparts. In addition, we use a tabletop display which allows the display space and interaction space to be unified. The painter picks up a real paint brush, dabs it in ‘paint’, and makes a <b>brush</b> <b>stroke</b> across the canvas. Digital paint immediately appears on the canvas, directly under the brush, with exactly the <b>brush</b> <b>stroke</b> the painter expects. The result is an intuitive, expressive, and fun painting experience. 1...|$|R
25|$|Scientists Emily Craig and Randall Bresee have {{attempted}} to recreate the likenesses of the shroud through the dust-transfer technique, {{which could have been}} done by medieval arts. They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of <b>brush</b> <b>strokes.</b> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.|$|E
25|$|For {{many critics}} Édouard Manet {{wrote of the}} nineteenth century and the modern period (much as Charles Baudelaire does in poetry). His rediscovery of Spanish {{painting}} from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude, and his radical <b>brush</b> <b>strokes</b> are the first steps toward Impressionism. Impressionism would take the Barbizon school one step farther, rejecting once and for all a belabored style and the use of mixed colors and black, for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (partly inspired by the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and Eugène Boudin). It led to Claude Monet with his cathedrals and haystacks, Pierre-Auguste Renoir with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, Edgar Degas with his dancers and bathers. Other important impressionists were Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro and Gustave Caillebotte.|$|E
25|$|Medović's {{work on the}} Pelješac {{peninsula}} {{marked a}} complete departure in technique and themes. He painted still lifes, seascapes, and landscapes, which were new genres in Croatian art at the time. His palette became lighter and brighter as he worked outdoors: browns, greys and dull greens became purer, and were joined the purple of heather, the yellow of broom, and the rich array of blues of the sea. Abandoning his previously detailed style, his smaller studies from nature are more creative. With thick impasto and impulsive <b>brush</b> <b>strokes,</b> around 1907 a new style emerged in his work – pointillism in a light, bright colours, that he used for his landscapes of Pelješac. Initially (1908–1912), these were disciplined strokes on larger canvases, but in his later (1914–1918), smaller paintings with impressionistically captured motifs, the strokes became softer and more diffuse colours. He {{was one of the}} first Croatian artists to paint the coastal landscapes, and it dominated his work after the turn of the century.|$|E

25|$|His Geese Alighting on Water, painted at Enman'in, Ōtsu in 1767, is {{an early}} example of his mature style. The subject is treated {{as a part of}} nature; nothing {{philosophical}} is implied as had been done with such imagery in the East Asian tradition. Likewise, Kingfisher and Trout, painted in 1769, features a bird {{near the top of the}} image, waiting for a fish. The trout swims under a large rock near the center. Bird, fish, and stone all appear as they do in nature, creating a matter-of-fact, comprehensible, and natural-looking piece. Later in his oeuvre, Pine Trees in Snow, executed in 1773 for the wealthy Mitsui family, is realistic despite being in the Japanese idiom of ink on a gold background. The two six-panel screens show tree bark and pine needles separated by differing <b>brush</b> <b>strokes,</b> and the white snow seems to weigh down the branches. The bark is painted in the tsuketate technique, which uses no outlines, just dark and light shades to create the illusion of volume.|$|E
