5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable <b>business</b> <b>climate</b> in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} analyze the factors {{affecting}} the growth of enterprises in the Philippines, as measured from the expansion of employment. The paper {{contributes to the literature}} in two ways. First, it attempts to provide a comprehensive background of the various policies and legislations that affect firms in the country. Second, using micro-level data of the firms in 2009, we correlate the observed growth of these firms with reported constraints in the business environment within which these firms operate, to investigate which ones are binding constraints. We find significant correlations between a subset of these indicators of <b>business</b> <b>climates</b> and the issues raised in previous literature, and the effects vary across firms of different sizes. Given the challenging global climate {{in the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, more than a third of these firms expanded their payroll and majority saw growth in real sales. Amidst a sea of subjective self-reported responses, we manage to find certain empirical regularities that withstand a battery of robustness checks. These correlations between a subset of indicators for <b>business</b> <b>climates</b> and the growth or expansion of firms may shed some light on future potential policies to assist these firms, as well as provide directions for further research...|$|R
