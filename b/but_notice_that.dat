5|$|When Brian {{approaches}} Stewie {{about helping}} him find {{a tennis ball}} he'd buried, Stewie asks if Brian remembers the date that he lost it. Brian tells him that he buried it on January 31, 1999 (the day of the series' premiere on Fox). Using Stewie's time machine to travel back to that date, the two soon come upon the Griffin family, <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> their past looks more strange than they remembered it: The family continually pauses for cutaways, and Meg's voice sounds different. Telling Brian that he mustn't alter the past by getting the tennis ball {{and that he should}} instead memorize its location, Stewie goes into his room to set up their return to the present before Past Stewie suddenly enters. The two Stewies then meet, and Stewie tells Brian to come out from his hiding place after explaining himself to Past Stewie. However, hanging outside the window, Brian fell onto Past Peter's car as he drives to the bachelor party at past Glenn Quagmire's house. Stewie finds Brian and the two then attempt to return to the present, but find that the transportation device's batteries are running low and moved only a bit forward in time towards their destination. Later, the two manage to take advantage of Peter dumping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII to collect the money needed to purchase new batteries. It was only after the two return to the present that Stewie learns that Brian intentionally told his past self about the September 11 attacks ahead of time, allowing the Past Brian to beat American Airlines Flight 11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari with a baseball bat, and then preventing the other three planes from leaving the airports.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. <b>But</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

2500|$|<b>But</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> {{the domain}} was {{asserted}} {{to include all}} sets of real numbers. That requirement cannot {{be reduced to a}} first-order sentence, as the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows. That theorem implies that there is some countably infinite subset of the real numbers, whose members we will call internal numbers, and some countably infinite collection of sets of internal numbers, whose members we will call [...] "internal sets", such that the domain consisting of internal numbers and internal sets satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as are satisfied by the domain of real numbers and sets of real numbers. In particular, it satisfies a sort of least-upper-bound axiom that says, in effect: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{square of}} any {{positive}} or negative number is positive, and the square of 0 is 0. Therefore, no negative number can have a real square root. [...] However, {{it is possible to}} work with a more inclusive set of numbers, called the complex numbers, that does contain solutions to the square root of a negative number. [...] This is done by introducing a new number, denoted by i (sometimes j, especially in the context of electricity where [...] "i" [...] traditionally represents electric current) and called the imaginary unit, which is defined such that [...] Using this notation, we can think of i as the square root of −1, <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> we also have [...] and so −i is also a square root of −1. By convention, the principal square root of −1 is i, or more generally, if x is any nonnegative number, then the principal square root of −x is ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{answer is}} that {{nonlinearity}} enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric. [...] <b>But</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking [...] [...] So if [...] is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation. [...] This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out {{the same way that}} heat can be carried off [...] "to infinity" [...] in an infinite flat plate. [...] But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect to homogenize the temperature, but clearly we cannot expect to reduce it to zero. [...] In the same way, we expect that the Ricci flow, applied to a distorted round sphere, will tend to round out the geometry over time, but not {{to turn it into a}} flat Euclidean geometry.|$|E

60|$|She {{could not}} help <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> his clothes were rather badly {{wrinkled}} and that his shoes were dusty and well worn; for when he kneeled in the street to operate the jack the sole of one shoe was revealed beneath the light of an adjacent arc, and she {{saw that it was}} badly worn.

The 'Poesia,' Plate IV., opposite, is a {{still more}} severe, though not so generic, an example; its {{decorative}} foreground reducing it {{almost to the}} rank of goldsmith's ornamentation. I need scarcely point out to you that the flowing water shows neither luster nor reflection; <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the observer's attention is supposed to be so close to every dark touch of the graver that he will see the minute dark spots which indicate the sprinkled shower falling from the vase into the pool.|$|E

Dr. Seward is loved not only by his household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> the sophistic tendencies {{of some of its}} inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenche." ...|$|E
60|$|Hitherto I {{had noticed}} {{the backs of}} his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine. But seeing them now close to me, I could not <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> they were rather coarse, broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could not conceal.|$|E
