The hurdle method teaches individuals how to nimbly respond situation {{for which they}} have not specifically prepared themselves. The manager of learning prepared and present unexpected tasks or challenges to the leader and the group which they must organize themselves {{to find a solution}} or to complete a task. The hurdle method is closely linked to hands-on learning.|$|E
5|$|Domitian was {{allegedly}} extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised {{in later life}} by wearing wigs. According to Suetonius, he even wrote {{a book on the}} subject of hair care. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Tesla evaded {{conscription}} {{into the}} Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. Tesla {{said that this}} contact with nature made him stronger, <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} fight career, and for some time after it ended, he acted as a second for other {{prominent}} fighters and ran a public house. His dissipation outside the ring appears to have resulted in his decision to leave England for Ireland, where he continued to tutor other boxers but eventually resorted to gambling to earn a living. He died a broken man, <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and financially.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the elder}} Symeon's advice, {{he left for}} the nearby Monastery of St. Mammas in Constantinople, which was {{described}} as run down, <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and spiritually.

Within three years after moving to St. Mammas, Symeon was tonsured as a monk, ordained as a priest, and elected as the abbot of the monastery. He spent the next twenty-five years as abbot of St. Mammas, attracting many monks and clergy with his reputation for learning and sanctity.|$|E
5|$|Process {{theology}} {{argues that}} God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels {{the pain of the}} world (<b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E

5|$|The Marshalsea {{became the}} main holding prison for Roman Catholics {{suspected}} of sedition during the Elizabethan era. Bishop Bonner, the last Roman Catholic Bishop of London, was imprisoned there in 1559, supposedly {{for his own}} safety, until his death 10years later. William Herle, a spy for Lord Burghley, Elizabeth I's chief adviser, was held there in 1570 and 1571. According to Robyn Adams, the prison leaked <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and metaphorically. In correspondence about Marshalsea prisoners Herle suspected of involvement in a plot to kill the Queen, he wrote of a network within the prison for smuggling information out of it, which included hiding letters in holes in the crumbling brickwork for others to pick up.|$|E
5|$|The dam and reservoir, {{along with}} other {{treatment}} structures built at and below the mine, have successfully reduced the dry weather pollution of Spring Creek by up to ninety-five percent. Problems, though, still occur mainly {{in the form of}} large uncontrolled spills from the reservoir. Several concerns about the structural integrity and safety of the dam, <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and biologically, arose in the 1990s. Emergency releases from Shasta Lake, often in the value of thousands of acre feet of water, have occurred {{from time to time to}} dilute massive acid spills from the Spring Creek drainage.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall stress on the diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan first {{appears in}} StarCraft as a twenty-six-year-old Terran Ghost, a psychic trained <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and mentally {{as an expert}} espionage agent and assassin. Initially the second-in-command of Sons of Korhal, a revolutionary {{movement}} against the oppressive Confederacy of Man, she is captured by the insectoid Zerg and infested, turning her into a human/Zerg hybrid completely {{under the control of}} the Zerg Overmind. She becomes one of the Zerg's most powerful agents, but during the Brood Wars, she replaces the Overmind following its destruction at the end of the great war, and gains control of the Zerg to seek dominance over the galaxy. Kerrigan's life before her infestation is further explored in the Starcraft novels Uprising and Liberty's Crusade, while Queen of Blades elaborates on her infested character.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{helped the}} police perform a sting operation, telling Seymour {{that the police}} knew what had {{happened}} and {{that the only way to}} save Williams was to dig up the gun and move it to somewhere more safe. When Seymour and Powers went to do this, several policemen (who had been lying in wait) immediately arrested her and Powers (who was released a few hours later). Seymour was in a poor condition <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and mentally, and after a few hours she wrote and signed a statement which incriminated Williams. Powers again helped the police, convincing Williams to meet him at Moorgate station, where Williams was arrested by the police and charged with the murder of Arthur Walls. Williams maintained that he was innocent of the murder and burglary.|$|E
5|$|The highway enters Geneseo {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY Geneseo. At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits Geneseo. Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east–west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> shorter than going all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E

25|$|The {{dissolution}} of a friendship {{may be viewed}} as a personal rejection, or {{may be the result of}} natural changes over time, as friends grow more distant <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and emotionally. The disruption of friendships has been associated with increased guilt, anger and depression, and may be highly stressful events, especially in childhood. However, potential negative effects can be mitigated if the {{dissolution of}} a friendship is replaced with another close relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} college campuses in the United States begins in 1636 with the {{founding}} of Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then known as New Towne. Early colonial colleges, which included not only Harvard, but also College of William & Mary, Yale University and The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), were modeled after equivalent English and Scottish institutions, but American establishments gradually split with their forebears, <b>both</b> <b>physically</b> and academically.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{patients}} {{describe their}} double as <b>both</b> a <b>physically</b> and psychologically identical copy, {{rather than a}} purely physical copy.
