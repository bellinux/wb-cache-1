Asserting what he considered severe {{differences between men and}} women, Berman insisted that women's [...] "raging storms of monthly hormonal imbalances" [...] made them unfit for high office. He said, [...] "Suppose that we had a menopausal woman president who had to make the decision <b>of</b> the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Pigs?</b> ...

5|$|President John F. Kennedy {{solicited}} MacArthur's {{counsel in}} 1961. The {{first of two}} meetings was held shortly after the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs</b> Invasion. MacArthur was extremely critical of the military advice given to Kennedy, and cautioned the young President to avoid a U.S. military build-up in Vietnam, pointing out that domestic problems {{should be given a}} much greater priority. Shortly before his death, MacArthur gave similar advice to President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War {{the future}} park area {{was used as}} a {{training}} ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs</b> invasion. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs</b> Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E

5|$|Shoup opposed {{military}} action against Cuba, warning against any attempt to intervene militarily against Fidel Castro. He was initially not involved or aware of {{the plans for the}} <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs</b> invasion. He was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to furnish an officer, but became furious when he learned the CIA was requisitioning Marine supplies without his permission. He finally learned the intent of the CIA when the officer, Colonel Jack Hawkins, contacted him {{on the night of the}} invasion, pleading with him to appeal to Kennedy for air support. Following the failure of the operation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were blamed, which Shoup thought was unfair, as they had not been aware of the early planning.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{opposed the}} {{military}} escalation {{in response to}} {{events such as the}} Cuban Missile Crisis and the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs</b> invasion, but his strongest opposition was to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. His opposition grew in strength after he retired from the military in 1963; he was hostile to both the strategy of the conflict and the excessive influence of corporations and military officials upon foreign policy. His high-profile criticism later spread to include the military industrial complex and what he saw as a pervasive militarism in American culture. Historians consider Shoup's statements opposing the war to be among the most pointed and high-profile leveled by a veteran against the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|The {{second game}} {{was held at}} Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore on May 3, 1999, in front of 47,940 fans. By May 3, the Orioles had a 7–17 win-loss record in the 1999 MLB season. The Cuban {{national}} team, meanwhile, was stronger than during the first game, as the 1998–99 Cuban National Series had concluded and players who were not available for {{the first game of}} the exhibition joined the Cuban team. A 300-person delegation accompanied the Cuban team, including members of the Cuban media, students, and retired players. MLB requested the Federal Aviation Administration clear the airspace above Camden Yards for the game, in response to an attempt by a Miami-based pilot and veteran of the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs</b> invasion, to drop anti-Castro leaflets over Estadio Latinoamericano during the first game.|$|E

40|$|JEL Classification: R 12; R 3; C 51 In Denmark, the {{concentration}} <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production is {{highest in the}} western part of the country. However, there may be even larger local differences in the number <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> produced. In this study we analyze the determinants of the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production in Denmark with particular focus on spatial externalities and the interaction between the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production and upstream sector and slaughterhouses. It is the assumption that the location of slaughterhouses is influenced by the location of the primary producers, implying that this variable is endogenous, whereas the location of primary producers is independent of the location of slaughterhouses. This is due to the fact that transportation costs <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> are paid by the cooperatives owning the slaughterhouses. This assumption is tested applying a spatial econometric model. The model is estimated for 1999 and 2004. Furthermore, the impact of negative environmental externalities <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production on location is analyzed. The results show that spatial externalities have a positive effect on the location <b>of</b> <b>pig</b> production whereas environmental regulation has an negative effect on location...|$|R
5|$|Nixon {{had been}} a firm {{supporter}} of Kennedy in the 1961 <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs</b> Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process {{had not yet been}} completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.|$|E
5|$|The CIA and the Democratic Revolutionary Front had based a 1,400-strong army, Brigade 2506, in Nicaragua. On {{the night}} of April 16 to 17, Brigade 2506 landed along Cuba's <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs,</b> and engaged in a firefight with a local revolutionary militia. Castro ordered Captain José Ramón Fernández to launch the counter-offensive, before taking {{personal}} control of it. After bombing the invaders' ships and bringing in reinforcements, Castro forced the Brigade to surrender on April 20. He ordered the 1189 captured rebels to be interrogated {{by a panel of}} journalists on live television, personally taking over the questioning on April 25. 14 were put on trial for crimes allegedly committed before the revolution, while the others were returned to the U.S. in exchange for medicine and food valued at U.S. $25 million. Castro's victory was a powerful symbol across Latin America, but it also increased internal opposition primarily among the middle-class Cubans who had been detained {{in the run-up to the}} invasion. Although most were freed within a few days, many fled to the U.S., establishing themselves in Florida.|$|E
5|$|Born in Birán, Oriente {{as the son}} of {{a wealthy}} Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist {{politics}} while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother Raúl Castro and Che Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took {{a key role in the}} Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, economic blockade and counter-revolution, including the <b>Bay</b> <b>of</b> <b>Pigs</b> Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro formed an alliance with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis—a defining incident of the Cold War—in 1962.|$|E
40|$|An in vivo {{experiment}} was performed with pigs {{to study the}} inhibitory effect of fermented feed on the bacterial population of the gastrointestinal tract. Results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between pH and lactobacilli in the stomach contents <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> in dry feed {{as well as in}} the stomach contents <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> fed fermented feed. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the pH and the numbers of bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae in the contents of the stomach <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> fed dry feed was found. In the stomach contents <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> fed fermented feed, a significant negative correlation was found between the concentration of the undissociated form of lactic acid and the numbers of Enterobacteriaceae. The numbers of Enterobacteriaceae in the contents of the stomach, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> fed fermented feed were significantly lower compared with the contents of the stomach, ileum, caecum, colon, and rectum <b>of</b> <b>pigs</b> fed dry feed.
