40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is a ubiquitous virus of the herpes {{type that}} infects {{a high percentage}} of some populations. One of the most researched genes expressed by HCMV with close homology to human chemokine receptors is the US 28 G protein-coupled receptor. Study design: This study was initiated to elucidate the intracellular signalling pathways of an inflammatory factor (IL- 6) and an angiogenic factor (STAT 3) triggered by the viral US 28 oncogene and the presence of US 28 in the HCMV viral particle. These pathways were observed by introducing the US 28 gene into two human cell lines by infection with a HCMV strain that expresses the US 28 gene (wild type), and two HCMV strains where the US 28 gene was deleted (ÄUS 28 and ÄUS 28 /UL 33). Special attention was directed at the expression of IL- 6 after promotion of the US 28 gene and subsequent phosphorolation of STAT 3. A new US 28 antibody was validated and a method developed in an attempt to determine US 28 on the viral particle. The following techniques were applied: Cell culture work, two mammalian cell lines were used, HFF’s and U 373 MG. Virus stock titre determination to determine the multiplicity of infection. Protein quantitation to determine very small quantities of protein for Western blot analysis. ELISA for the quantitative determination of IL- 6. Western blotting for phospho- STAT 3 determination and validation of the US 28 antibody. Immunocytochemistry was used for <b>back</b> <b>titrations</b> of virally infected cells. Immunofluorescence assay and use of confocal microscopic techniques was used for the location of the US 28 gene in the virion and for tSTAT 3 translocation to the nucleus. Conclusion: A clear increase in IL- 6 secretion (495 % ± 1 %) was seen, and this was after only an hour in HCMV WT infected cells. From the increase in IL- 6 secretion a subsequent increase in STAT 3 phosphorylation was detected in the same samples. A clear link has been established between IL- 6 and STAT 3. A method to determine whether US 28 was present in the HCMV viral particle was designed and preliminary results obtained. The results were inclusive.

50|$|To {{determine}} {{the amount of}} water in the sample, analysis must first be performed using either <b>back</b> or direct <b>titration.</b> In the direct method, just enough of the reagents will be added to completely use up all of the water. At this point in the titration, the current approaches zero. It is then possible to relate the amount of reagents used to the amount of water in the system via stoichiometry. The back-titration method is similar, but involves the addition of an excess of the reagent. This excess is then consumed by adding a known amount of a standard solution with known water content. The result reflects the water content of the sample and the standard solution. Since the amount of water in the standard solution is known, the difference reflects the water content of the sample.|$|R
40|$|Historically, cadmium (Cd) {{has been}} used in many {{different}} applications from cadmium paint to nickel-cadmium batteries. However, Cd is a nonessential, naturally occurring toxic element due to its low excretion rate and half-life of 10 - 30 years in humans (1). Due to similar properties, such as atomic radii and charge/radius ratios, Cd(II) has been found to replace the essential divalent calcium (Ca) ion in many proteins, including calmodulin, parvalbumin, and troponin C (1). A specific protein of interest is human cardiac troponin C (HcTnC), a Ca(II) binding protein in the EF hand family. This protein has four EF hand binding loops, where loops I and II are found in the regulatory domain of the protein, and loops III and IV play a more structural role. Interestingly, loop I is a “defunct” loop and does not bind Ca(II). Previous crystal structures of Cd(II) bound to the regulatory domain of HcTnC reveal two Cd(II) ions bound to EF hand loops I and II (2). While isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data from the Spuches lab reveals two Cd(II) ion binding to the N-domain (as verified in this work), displacement studies strongly suggest that Cd(II) is not binding to loop II as noted in the crystal structure. Cd(II) is known to bind strongly to cysteine residues in proteins, therefore our hypothesis is that Cd(II) is binding to loop I of the protein due to the cysteine residue present. To test this hypothesis, the following mutants have been overexpressed and purified: C 35 A, C 84 A, and the double-mutant C 35 A/C 84 A. ITC studies of both Ca(II) and Cd(II) binding to HcTnC mutants have been performed and compared to wild-type. It was expected that Ca(II) binding to the mutants would not be altered, but Cd(II) binding to both the C 35 A and double-mutant would not display a heat event corresponding to Cd(II) binding to the regulatory domain. It was also hypothesized that binding of Cd(II) to the C 84 mutant protein would remain unchanged as compared to the Ca(II) binding. Thermodynamic studies revealed very unexpected results. All three mutants displayed a total of 3 Cd(II) ions binding to the protein, with 2 Cd(II) ions binding to the C-domain and one additional Cd(II) binding to the N-domain. This suggested that cysteine, a residue important to Cd(II) binding, was not necessary since the dual mutant still displayed favorable binding of 1 Cd(II) ion to the protein. In fact, Cd(II) binding to the dual protein does so with more favorable Gibbs free energy of binding than the other 2 mutants. <b>Back</b> <b>titrations</b> of Ca(II) revealed that Cd(II) is not binding to Loop II of the protein {{as was the case with}} wild-type. This data allowed us to propose a new model where Cd(II) binds to Loop I of the protein since this is a prearranged binding domain, and that Cys 84 may play a role in metal loading.

40|$|The {{activation}} of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF 1) by thioredoxin (ThR) was characterized using membrane-bound and soluble CF 1.

The proton gradient substantially accelerates the {{activation of}} CF 1 compared with thylakoids incubated in the dark with similar concentrations of dithiothreitol and ThR. The interaction of soluble CF 1 with ThR was studied using fluorescent probes. CF 1 in solution, with and without its associated ε-subunit, was labeled at Cys- 322 of the γ-subunit with fluoresceinyl maleimide. ThR from Escherichia coli was labeled with eosin isothiocyanate. Labeled ThR and CF 1 showed normal activities. Fluorescence energy transfer between donor fluoresceinyl maleimide and acceptor eosin isothiocyanate, manifested by a quenching of the donor fluorescence, was detected, suggesting that ThR and CF 1 form an intermolecular complex. When the ε-subunit was absent, quenching of donor fluorescence was approximately doubled, indicating that labeled ThR could approach more closely to the γ-subunit of CF 1. The distance between the fluorescent probes on CF 1 and ThR was calculated to be approximately 65 Å when ε-subunit was present and 52 Å when ε was absent. These values are consistent with other distance measurements and energy transfer values reported previously for fluorescent probes on CF 1. Whereas the extent of quenching increased by removal of the ε-subunit, the apparent dissociation constant was unchanged. The quenching effect was reversed when the ε-subunit was added <b>back</b> to the <b>titration</b> mixture. Similarly, the addition of unlabeled ThR decreased donor quenching...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [47]- 48) The pH dependance of the near-uv {{absorption band}} of oxidized (Fe⁺³) cytochrome c oxidase has been investigated. Decreasing the pH of an oxidase sample from 8. 9 to 6. 5 caused a progressive blue shift from 422 - 424 nm to approximately 417 nm, while <b>titration</b> <b>back</b> to high pH (10. 5) {{led to a}} reversal of the Soret to 426 nm. The time required for the band to reach a stable, equilibrium position ranged from 30 minutes to 8 hours. The extent of shift was also highly variable from one preparation to the next, as well as from one experiment to another within the same preparation. An isosbestic point was present in most cases, typically near 421 nm during blue shifts, and 425 nm during red shifts. The kinetic approach to the equilibrium position was measured both for blue and red shifting enzyme samples. The shift in both directions was characterized by two phases of reactivity which had observed rate constants (k[sub obs]) differing by two orders of magnitude (10 ⁻² and 10 ⁻⁴ s⁻¹). The amplitude of the fast phase ranged from 30 % to 75 % of the total absorbance change. The direction of the shift had no effect on the rate constants associated with the fast and slow phases. Additionally, the blue shift of the Soret band was not kinetically correlated to the fast to slow conversion in ligand binding behavior which is also known to occur at low pH. Resistent samples which showed little or no response to low pH often failed to have an isosbestic point, and were often associated with a red shift of the Soret band after 1 - 2 hours at low pH. These effects are all due to cytochrome a₃, not cytochrome a. Some samples which were incubated at high pH (> 9. 1) exhibited a loss of amplitude which was quickly reversible pH (> 9. 1) exhibited a loss of amplitude which was quickly reversible after titration to low pH, and caused the spectrum before titration to deviate from the isosbestic point of the spectra recorded after titration. This probably reflects an effect on cytochrome a (Baker & Palmer, 1987), and did not affect pH sensitivity. Incubation of resistent preparations at high pH and high concentrations of dodecyl maltoside caused a marked increase in pH sensitivity. The kinetics of pH resistant samples showed the fast component described above, but displayed little or no slow phase. Incubation at high concentrations of dodecyl maltoside restored the biphasic response to low pH, resulting in a greater blue shift. High concentrations of cholate during isolation and purification of the enzyme did not affect pH sensitivity, although it did increase the amount of bound phospholipid by as much as ten times that present when the enzyme was isolated using the minimum amount of cholate needed to extract oxidase from mitochondrial membranes. A model consistent with the fast and slow proton binding forms is described. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

The reaction occurs in an acid medium (H 2 SO 4) upon heating at reflux {{in the presence of}} a catalyst (Ag 2 SO 4) and a complexion agent of chloride ions (HgSO 4). In this paper, we titrated the residual potassium dichromate (<b>back</b> <b>titration)</b> with a solution of sulfate of iron and ammonium (Fe(NH 4) 2 (SO 4) 2) called Mohr salt. We used ferroin as an indicator, because it changed colour from blue-green to red-brown (APHA 1999). The COD is expressed as grams of oxygen per gram of sample.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a simple, environmentally benign alternate analytical method for simultaneous estimation of iron oxidation states. This proposed method of iron speciation is based on 1, 10 -phenanthroline (phen) modified redox potential of transition metal ions. In a pre-step ex-cess cerium(IV) oxidizes iron(II) in sample to iron(III). Initial <b>back</b> <b>titration</b> of un-reacted cerium(IV) with cobalt(II) in presence of phen gives amount of iron(II) in sample, reduction of iron(III) with cobalt(II) is then used to estimate total iron as iron(III). The potentiometric titration method has been successfully test-ed for determinations of iron(II) and total iron in synthetic and natural samples and represents a distinc-tively green alternative to other reported protocols of iron speciation analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Organic/inorganic epoxy nanocomposites {{containing}} {{diglycidyl ether}} of bisphenol A (DGEBA), 4 -methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) and poly(aminopropyl/phenyl) silsesquioxanes (PAPPS) were prepared and characterized. PAPPS were synthesized via fluoride-catalyzed cage formation from random-structured poly(phenyl) silsesquioxane (PPS) and 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) using tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) catalyst containing substantial water. The PPS/APTES stoichiometric ratios were varied. The FTIR, 1 H, solid-state 29 Si-NMR {{studies show that}} PAPPS probably consists of cages, partial cages, and some linear structures containing phenyl and aminopropyl functional groups. The amine content was determined by <b>back</b> <b>titration</b> and elemental analysis. In comparison with neat epoxy, incorporation of these materials can improve the resultant thermal stabilities, raise glass transition temperatures (Tgs), and reduce coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of epoxy nanocomposites as confirmed b...|$|E
40|$|For the {{determination}} of milligram quantities of uranium(N) in thorium oxide-uranium oxide mixtures which may also contain uranium(VI), {{it was necessary to}} devise a means of dissolving the sample so as to prevent any air oxidation of the uranium(IV) to uranium(VI). For this determination, the conventional potassium dichromate volumetric method was used except that the sample was dissolved under reflux in 7 M H/sub 3 /PO/sub 4 / which contained an excess of standard dichromate solution. Following the dissolution of the sample, this excess was determined by <b>back</b> <b>titration</b> with a standard solution of iron(II). Barium diphenylaminesulfonate was used as the indicator. Initial tests on the dissolution of samples of thorium oxide-uranium oxide in hot HC 1 O/sub 4 / and hot HCI are described. (auth...|$|E
