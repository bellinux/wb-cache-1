50|$|Omaruru is a {{city and}} {{constituency}} in the Erongo Region of Namibia. The town has 14,000 inhabitants and owns 352 km2 of land. The town is situated near Mount Erongo, on the usually dry Omaruru River. It {{is located on the}} main paved road from Swakopmund to Otjiwarongo. The name in the local Otjiherero language means 'bitter milk', as the cattle used to browse on a local bush that turned their <b>milk</b> <b>bitter.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chifir' is {{typically}} prepared with 5-8 tablespoons of loose tea (or tea bags) per person poured {{on top of}} the boiled water. It is brewed for 10-15 minutes without stirring - until the leaves drop {{to the bottom of the}} cup. Chifir' is often drunk by pouring a small amount of Chifir into a mug, and adding boiling water to soothe and dilute the strong tea, or it can be consumed without sugar by those that seek a caffeine high. Those that prefer to simply enjoy the chifir' drink it with milk. To avoid bitterness, sweets can also be held in the mouth before or with the tea. Sugar is sometimes added; however, the nature of the tea tends to have it retain a <b>bitter</b> flavor. <b>Milk</b> is often used to make the tea less bitter or to make it less acidic. It is to be drunk slowly, otherwise it may cause vomiting. Ultimately, making chifir' involves brewing a great deal of black tea and for a long time. It may be left to brew overnight and drunk either hot or cold.|$|R

40|$|Western {{participants}} consistently match certain shapes {{with particular}} speech sounds, tastes, and flavours. Here we {{demonstrate that the}} "Bouba-Kiki effect", a well-known shape-sound symbolism effect commonly observed in Western participants, is also observable in the Himba of Northern Namibia, a remote population with little exposure to Western cultural and environmental influences, and who do not use a written language. However, in contrast to Westerners, the Himba did not map carbonation (in a sample of sparkling water) onto an angular (as opposed to a rounded) shape. Furthermore, they also tended to match less <b>bitter</b> (i. e., <b>milk)</b> chocolate samples to angular rather than rounded shapes; the opposite mapping to that shown by Westerners. Together, these results show that cultural-environmental as well as phylogenetic factors {{play a central role}} in shaping our repertoire of crossmodal correspondences...|$|R
40|$|The present {{overview}} {{was intended}} to evaluate the degree of total aflatoxins and ochratoxin A contamination in different samples of <b>bitter,</b> dark, <b>milk,</b> and white chocolates marketed in Pakistan. For that exploration, two hundred (n= 200) samples of chocolates, 100 branded and 100 local, were analyzed for mycotoxins profile by HPLC-FLD. The outcomes firmly sustained {{that the majority of}} the samples were contaminated with aflatoxins and ochratoxin A. The incidence of total aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in branded samples was 83 % and 90 %, whereas the local samples showed 91 % and 97 % contamination, respectively. The highest amount of total aflatoxins was found in branded dark chocolates, that is, 2. 27 [*]μg/kg, and maximum ochratoxin A level was detected white chocolates (2. 06 [*]μg/kg). On average, the local white chocolates and dark chocolates faced the highest level of total aflatoxins (3. 35 [*]μg/kg) and ochratoxin A (3. 48 [*]μg/kg), respectively. The local samples of chocolates were more contaminated with mycotoxins as compared to branded ones accredited to the lack of quality control and quality assurance during the manufacturing as well as packing processes. In recent years, consumption of chocolate is rapidly increasing especially by young generation, so monitoring of mycotoxin occurrence in them is a matter of great concern and more studies are required to comprehend the production of mycotoxins in these products...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the occurrence of aflatoxin B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2 and ochratoxin A in chocolate marketed in Brazil. A hundred and twenty-five samples of powdered, <b>bitter,</b> dark, <b>milk</b> and white chocolate were evaluated for mycotoxins. Ochratoxin A {{was the most common}} mycotoxin in the evaluated samples, contaminating 98 % of the purchased chocolate. A co-occurrence of aflatoxins was observed in 80 % of all samples evaluated. The bitter, dark and powdered chocolate samples had the largest presence of aflatoxins. On average, the highest levels of ochratoxin A were found in powdered, dark and bitter chocolate, respectively: 0. 39; 0. 34 and 0. 31 μg/kg. Bitter, powdered and dark chocolate had the highest aflatoxin content; an average of 0. 66, 0. 53 and 0. 43 μg/kg, respectively. This is the first report of co-occurrence of ochratoxin A and aflatoxins in chocolate. The consumption of chocolate with high levels of cocoa in the formulation has been stimulated due to health benefits attributed to some cocoa components but on the other hand, these high cocoa content products tend to have the highest amount of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A. To guarantee a safe consumption of chocolate, there should be a continuous monitoring of both ochratoxin and aflatoxin and more studies attempting to understand the dynamics involving mycotoxin-producing fungi and mycotoxin production in cocoa need to be carried out with the aim of preventing mycotoxin accumulation in this commodity...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} milk {{inoculation}} with cultures of Micrococcus sp. INIA 528 {{and of the}} addition of high enzymatic activity (HEA) curds prepared with this strain on casein hydrolysis and formation of peptides during cheese ripening was investigated by capillary electrophoresis and reversed-phase HPLC. Milk inoculation at 2 % with Micrococcus sp. INIA 528 cultures and addition of HEA curds at 10 or 20 % enhanced significantly the degradation of all casein fractions, in particular of β-casein. Also, milk inoculation at 2 % with Micrococcus sp. INIA 528 cultures and addition of HEA curds at 10 or 20 % increased significantly the formation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{sporulated}} bacteria produce proteolytic and lipolytic thermoresistant enzymes associated with technological problems such as off-flavors, age gelation and <b>bitter</b> taste in <b>milk</b> and dairy products. Preventive measures to avoid contamination of milk must be taken in consideration, e. g., the employment of {{a certain type of}} sanitizing agent, its conditions of use, concentration, contact time and temperature. The aim of this work was to evaluate the sanitation efficiency of workers of the dairy industry in relation to sporulated bacteria isolated from UHT milk. The suspension test was used to evaluate the efficiency of solutions of sodium hypocholite, biguanide, peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide against 18 strains of Bacillus sp. isolated from whole UHT milk. Although the biguanide resulted in significant decimal reduction, none of the sanitizing agents studied was effective under the evaluated conditions. The average decimal reduction values obtained were below 5 log cycles (99. 999 %). The effectiveness of the sanitizing agent is a primary factor in order to control the contaminations within the dairy industry. Thus, it is essential to define the ideal conditions of use of these agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} of jenny milk during cheesemaking has been recommended {{as a viable}} alternative to egg lysozyme for controlling late blowing defects. However, little is known on the sensory properties of the cheeses made with jenny milk. In this study, the effect of the {{addition of}} jenny milk during cheesemaking on sensory properties and consumer acceptability of cheese was evaluated. A sensory profile was carried out by 10 trained panelists on 4 cow milk cheese types. Two types of cheeses were made by adding jenny milk to cow milk during cheesemaking; the cheeses were then left to ripen for 45 and 120 d. The remaining 2 cheese types were made with only cow milk and were also left to ripen for 45 and 120 d. The attributes generated by a quantitative descriptive analysis sensory panel were effective for discriminating the 4 products. Among them, added jenny milk samples aged for 45 d had the highest intensity of some appearance descriptors (structure and color uniformity), as well as the highest intensity of sweetness. The analysis of acceptability data obtained from 89 consumers showed that added jenny milk aged for 45 d was the most preferred type of cheese, whereas {{no significant differences were found}} among the other products, which had higher intensity of <b>bitter,</b> salty, acid <b>milk,</b> and so on. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association...|$|R
60|$|I came to {{the city}} of Antung, and lodged with a merchant. He was a grain merchant. Corn he had, {{hundreds}} of bushels, stored in great bins of stout matting; peas and beans in sacks, and in the back yard his millstones went round and round, grinding out meal. Also, in his back yard, were buildings containing vats sunk into the ground, and here the tanners were at work making leather. I bought a measure of corn from mine host for my horses, and he overcharged me thirty cents. I was in China. Antung was jammed with Japanese troops. It was the thick of war. But it did not matter. The work of Antung went on just the same. The shops were wide open; the streets were lined with pedlars. One could buy anything; get anything made. I dined at a Chinese restaurant, cleansed myself at a public bath in a private tub with a small boy to assist in the scrubbing. I bought condensed <b>milk,</b> <b>bitter,</b> canned vegetables, bread, and cake. I repeat it, cake--good cake. I bought knives, forks, and spoons, granite-ware dishes and mugs. There were horseshoes and horseshoers. A worker in iron realized for me new designs of mine for my tent poles. My shoes were sent out to be repaired. A barber shampooed my hair. A servant returned with corn-beef in tins, a bottle of port, another of cognac, and beer, blessed beer, to wash out from my throat the dust of an army. It was the land of Canaan. I was in China.|$|R
60|$|All {{the natural}} powers in man, which I know, that are conversant about {{external}} objects, are the senses; the imagination; and the judgment. And first {{with regard to}} the senses. We do and we must suppose, that as the conformation of their organs are nearly or altogether the same in all men, so the manner of perceiving external objects is in all men the same, or with little difference. We are satisfied that what appears to be light to one eye, appears light to another; that what seems sweet to one palate, is sweet to another; that what is dark and bitter to this man, is likewise dark and bitter to that; and we conclude in the same manner of great and little, hard and soft, hot and cold, rough and smooth; and indeed of all the natural qualities and affections of bodies. If we suffer ourselves to imagine, that their senses present to different men different images of things, this sceptical proceeding will make every sort of reasoning on every subject vain and frivolous, even that sceptical reasoning itself which had persuaded us to entertain a doubt concerning the agreement of our perceptions. But as there will be little doubt that bodies present similar images to the whole species, it must necessarily be allowed, that the pleasures and the pains which every object excites in one man, it must raise in all mankind, whilst it operates naturally, simply, and by its proper powers only: for if we deny this, we must imagine that the same cause, operating in the same manner, and on subjects of the same kind, will produce different effects; which would be highly absurd. Let us first consider this point in the sense of taste, and the rather as the faculty in question has taken its name from that sense. All men are agreed to call vinegar sour, honey sweet, and aloes bitter; and as they are all agreed in finding those qualities in those objects, they do not in the least differ concerning their effects with regard to pleasure and pain. They all concur in calling sweetness pleasant, and sourness and bitterness unpleasant. Here there is no diversity in their sentiments; and that there is not, appears fully from the consent of all men in the metaphors which are taken, from the souse of taste. A sour temper, bitter expressions, bitter curses, a bitter fate, are terms well and strongly understood by all. And we are altogether as well understood when we say, a sweet disposition, a sweet person, a sweet condition and the like. It is confessed, that custom and some other causes have made many deviations from the natural pleasures or pains which belong to these several tastes; but then the power of distinguishing between the natural and the acquired relish remains to the very last. A man frequently comes to prefer the taste of tobacco to that of sugar, and the flavor of vinegar to that of milk; but this makes no confusion in tastes, whilst he is sensible that the tobacco and vinegar are not sweet, and whilst he knows that habit alone has reconciled his palate to these alien pleasures. Even with such a person we may speak, and with sufficient precision, concerning tastes. But should any man be found who declares, that to him tobacco has a taste like sugar, and that he cannot distinguish between milk and vinegar; or that tobacco and vinegar are sweet, <b>milk</b> <b>bitter,</b> and sugar sour; we immediately conclude that the organs of this man are out of order, and that his palate is utterly vitiated. We are as far from conferring with such a person upon tastes, as from reasoning concerning the relations of quantity with one who should deny that all the parts together were equal to the whole. We do not call a man of this kind wrong in his notions, but absolutely mad. Exceptions of this sort, in either way, do not at all impeach our general rule, nor make us conclude that men have various principles concerning the relations of quantity or the taste of things. So that when it is said, taste cannot be disputed, it can only mean, that no one can strictly answer what pleasure or pain some particular man may find from the taste of some particular thing. This indeed cannot be disputed; but we may dispute, and with sufficient clearness too, concerning the things which are naturally pleasing or disagreeable to the sense. But when we talk of any peculiar or acquired relish, then we must know the habits, the prejudices, or the distempers of this particular man, and we must draw our conclusion from those.|$|R
