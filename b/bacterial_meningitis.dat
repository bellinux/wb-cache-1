5|$|On 30 July 1993, {{a mortar}} shell fired by Bosnian Serb troops hit a Sarajevo neighbourhood, {{injuring}} five-year-old Irma Hadžimuratović and killing several others, including her mother. Sarajevo's overstretched Koševo hospital {{was unable to}} provide adequate treatment for the injuries Irma received to her spine, head and abdomen. She developed <b>bacterial</b> <b>meningitis</b> as a result. Edo Jaganjac, the surgeon treating Hadžimuratović, tried unsuccessfully to have her evacuated on a UN relief flight. He then resorted to distributing her photograph among foreign journalists in Sarajevo. Several picked up Irma's story, giving it widespread coverage in the international (and especially the British) press. On the evening of 8 August, BBC news led with coverage of Irma's injuries. On 9 August, British Prime Minister John Major personally intervened, dispatching an RAF Hercules to airlift Irma to London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.|$|E

30|$|As {{observed}} by other authors, <b>bacterial</b> and aseptic <b>meningitis</b> {{could not be}} distinguished by clinical characteristics alone.

40|$|Pediatric Research and Clinical Center of Infectious Diseases {{under the}} Federal Medical Biological Agency, Saint Petersburg, Russia Investigation {{of the role}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid components in the processes of patho- and sanogenesis of central nervous system diseases is a fundamental problem of medicine and biology. The work aim was to study immunomodulatory features of cerebrospinal fluid in case of <b>bacterial</b> purulent <b>meningitis</b> (BPM) in children by an in vitro experiment. There were studied immunomodulatory features of high-molecular and low-molecular fractions of cerebrospinal fluid of 33 children with <b>bacterial</b> purulent <b>meningitis</b> of different etiology and 12 children without meningitis by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) -stimulated reaction of leukocyte blast transformation. There was studied the influence of homogeneous cerebrospinal fluid samples of 8 children with <b>bacterial</b> purulent <b>meningitis</b> upon the production of immunoregulatory cytokines by blood cells. Concentration of cytokines (Interleukin (IL) - 12, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a, IL- 8, IL- 6, IL- 10, IL- 1 b) in supernatants of 3 -day old cultures of blood cells was detected by flow cytometry method. The effects of cerebrospinal fluid fractions directed on both stimulation and suppression of blast production were identified by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated reaction of leukocyte blast transformation (PHA-RLBT) test. The maximal frequency of stimulating effect of fractions was revealed in children with meningococcal meningitis. There was detected a link between the dynamics of blast forms production under the influence of cerebrospinal fluid fractions and severity of the disease course. The studied cerebrospinal fluid samples of children with <b>bacterial</b> purulent <b>meningitis</b> stimulated IL- 6 proinflammatory cytokine production by blood cells as much as possible whereas the influence upon the synthesis of other immunoregulatory cytokines was ambiguous. </p...|$|R

25|$|Scientific {{evidence}} for the effectiveness of large-scale vaccination campaigns is well established. Vaccination campaigns helped eradicate smallpox, which once killed {{as many as one}} in seven children in Europe, and have nearly eradicated polio. As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of <b>bacterial</b> <b>meningitis</b> and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988. It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections.|$|E
25|$|Early {{breastfeeding}} {{is associated}} with fewer nighttime feeding problems. Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby improves breastfeeding outcomes and increases cardio-respiratory stability. Reviews from 2007 found numerous benefits. Breastfeeding aids general health, growth and development in the infant. Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, <b>bacterial</b> <b>meningitis,</b> botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis. Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases, obesity, develop diabetes, or childhood leukemia later in life. and may enhance cognitive development.|$|E

25|$|Many {{bacteria}} are parasitic, though since {{the result is}} infection and disease, sometimes leading to death, they are generally thought of as pathogens instead. Parasitic {{bacteria are}} extremely diverse, and infect their hosts {{by a variety of}} routes. To give a few examples, Bacillus anthracis, the cause of anthrax, is spread by contact with infected domestic animals; the bacillus's spores, which can survive for years outside the body, can enter a host through an abrasion or may be inhaled. Borrelia, the cause of Lyme disease and relapsing fever, is transmitted by a vector, ticks of the genus Ixodes, from the diseases' reservoirs in animals such as deer. Campylobacter jejuni, a cause of severe enteritis (gut inflammation), is spread by the fecal-oral route from animals, or by eating insufficiently cooked poultry, or by contaminated water. Haemophilus influenzae, an agent of <b>bacterial</b> <b>meningitis</b> and respiratory tract infections such as influenza and bronchitis, is transmitted by droplet contact. Treponema pallidum, the cause of syphilis, is spread by sexual intercourse.|$|E

40|$|The aim : is to {{investigate}} pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid {{of children with}} meningitis of different aetiology in {{the dynamics of the}} disease. Materials and methods: there were examined 93 children: 29 of them had <b>bacterial</b> purulent <b>meningitis,</b> 42 ones – serous meningitis, and 22 – an acute respiratory viral infection of meningeal symptomatology (control group). The design of the investigation is an open comparative research. The concentration of proinflammatory (IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 4, IL- 10) cytokines was defined by the solid-phase immune-enzyme assay. The results were processed statistically by computer standard programs Excel and Statistica 7. Results and discussion: different levels of the cytokine concentration increase were detected in the acute period of the disease, the maximal one – in the case of <b>bacterial</b> purulent <b>meningitis,</b> IL- 6 and IL- 10 in particular. The concentration of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 4, IL- 10 was significantly increased to compare with serous meningitis. The decrease of cytokine level was detected in the period of reconvalescence. Conclusion: the cytokine concentration increase in the cerebrospinal fluid in the acute stage of bacterial purulent and serous meningitis indicates both the presence of common patterns of neuroinfectious process and the features caused by the agent, and their increase in the stage of reconvalescense demonstrates the remaining intrathecal inflammation. </p...|$|R
