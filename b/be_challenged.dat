5|$|Justice Phang {{also held}} that section 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act was not {{necessarily}} determinative of the matter in the Collector's favour, as acquisitions can <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> for having been made in bad faith. However, the provision applied in this case as no bad faith on the Collector's part had been alleged by the appellants.|$|E
5|$|Rhee Taekwon-Do's {{position}} as the first taekwondo school in Australia might <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> by the Melbourne Taekwondo Centre (originally the Shuto Karate Club), as tang soo do {{was one of the}} arts taught there. Such status would, however, involve recognising tang soo do as taekwondo retrospectively. The Melbourne Taekwondo Centre incorporated taekwondo into its name in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|An ouster {{clause in}} a statute {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> by any court.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{explored}} coaching possibilities, {{but he was}} mindful not to {{put himself}} {{in a position where}} his control might <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> as it had been in Cleveland. In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also given the right to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{books have}} also <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> for attacking or disagreeing with {{religious}} truths. On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin has <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> and suppressed since its publication {{due to its}} groundbreaking theories on Evolution. In 1925, the Butler Act was enacted in Tennessee, banning the teaching of evolutionary theories statewide. Other works, such as the Harry Potter series, have also <b>been</b> <b>challenged</b> thanks to themes that are perceived to promote witchcraft and the occult.|$|R

5|$|Caged Bird was {{nominated}} for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on The New York Times paperback bestseller list for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> or banned in some schools and libraries.|$|E
5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to <b>be</b> <b>challenged.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the Velvet Revolution, an {{amendment}} act No. 49/1990 Coll. was adopted. Under the new law, any person older than 18, with clean criminal record, {{physically and mentally}} sound that did not pose threat of misuse of the firearm could have license issued. License may have been issued for purpose of hunting, sport shooting, exercise of profession and in special cases also for protection. Newly, denial of license could <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> in court.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{received}} a 25-second penalty, which demoted him to third place and advanced Massa and Heidfeld to {{first and second}} positions. McLaren appealed the decision at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) International Court of Appeal. Their case, however, was declared inadmissible, with the Court ruling that 25 second penalties cannot <b>be</b> <b>challenged.</b> The penalty prompted global press discussion, primarily from the United Kingdom and Italy, with several former drivers questioning the decision. Massa's retroactive victory, with Hamilton demoted to third, narrowed {{the gap in the}} Championship from six points to just two.|$|E
5|$|It also greatly {{extended}} {{the powers of}} Parliament. Under this new constitution, monarchical absolutism was replaced by parliamentary supremacy. It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This supremacy would <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> {{by the likes of}} Granville Sharp. Sharp regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained that it would be treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited slavery.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} values is a focus on hands-on learning. The program emphasizes use of experiential learning activities in the context of outdoor education. These help participants retain what they learn about leadership generally and the eleven leadership competencies specifically.

5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned every ten {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in their districts. It is rare, however, for an incumbent to <b>be</b> <b>challenged.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ISA has its {{constitutional}} basis in Article 149 of the Constitution, which sanctions preventive detention {{and allows for}} laws passed by the legislature against subversion to override the Articles protecting the personal liberties of the individual. Specifically, Article 149(1) declares such legislation to be valid notwithstanding any inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 9. Thus, detentions under the ISA cannot <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> {{on the basis of}} deprivation of these rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{work had}} been {{commissioned}} jointly by the Houston Grand Opera, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Netherlands Opera and the Washington Opera, {{all of which were}} to mount early productions of the opera. Fearful that the work might <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> as defamatory or not in the public domain, Houston Grand Opera obtained insurance to cover such an eventuality. Before its stage premiere, the opera was presented in concert form in May 1987 in San Francisco, with intermission discussions led by Adams. According to the Los Angeles Times review, a number of audience members left as the work proceeded.|$|E

5|$|After Team Plasma's defeat, Looker {{arrives in}} Unova and tasks the player with finding the {{remaining}} Sages of Team Plasma, {{so they can}} be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pokémon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pokémon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pokémon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pokémon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can <b>be</b> <b>challenged.</b> A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, {{and the director of the}} HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Parties {{bringing}} {{judicial review}} must have sufficient {{interest in the}} challenged subject. Professor Mullen therefore {{suggests that it is}} at first glance surprising that standing was not contested: the appellants brought proceedings in their personal capacities, yet had not even been threatened with prosecution. However, he suggests that no challenge was made because the legislation was likely to <b>be</b> <b>challenged</b> at some point and it was more convenient for the Government to have the legal issue decided before the Hunting Act came into force. Moreover, the recent expansion of standing for issues of public interest, such as the validity of an Act of Parliament, would have made a successful challenge more difficult.|$|E
