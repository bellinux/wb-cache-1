5|$|This {{equation}} {{relating the}} two radial forces {{can be understood}} qualitatively as follows. The difference in angular speeds (or equivalently, in angular momenta) causes {{a difference in the}} centripetal force requirement; to offset this, the radial force must <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> with an inverse-cube force.|$|E

5|$|A parent's {{internal}} working {{model that}} is operative in the attachment {{relationship with her}} infant can be accessed by examining the parent's mental representations.

5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (chemical compounds). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.|$|E

25|$|Of the {{thirteen}} stations {{designed and built}} in the 1950s and early 1960s {{as part of the}} original Queensland Railways electrification and quadruplication projects, Graceville, which remains substantially intact, best exemplifies the Modernist-influenced design concepts employed. It is the most intact of the four butterfly-roofed platform stations, with Chelmer having <b>been</b> <b>altered</b> somewhat, and Eagle Junction and Nundah altered substantially. Of the four flat-roofed platform stations Sherwood has <b>been</b> <b>altered</b> partially, Milton has <b>been</b> <b>altered</b> substantially, and Indooroopilly and Toowong have been rebuilt. Of the five over-head stations, Auchenflower and Taringa remain the more intact, Corinda and Wooloowin have <b>been</b> <b>altered</b> substantially, and Toombul has been rebuilt.|$|R

5|$|Developed by Sera Gamble and Cathryn Humphris, {{the episode}} {{was written by}} the latter and {{directed}} by Steve Boyum. It delves into the backstory of Bobby, and also features a major turning point in Dean's search for self-worth. Many dream sequences had to <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> due to production issues, though series creator Eric Kripke believes it ultimately benefited the episode.|$|E
5|$|Every {{officer of}} such a {{battalion}} was deemed {{a member of the}} Reserve of Officers, and every man a special reservist, though no individual's condition of service could <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> without their consent.

5|$|In the 21st century, {{these trends}} have continued, and several new {{approaches}} {{have come into}} prominence, including multielectrode recording, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of the brain to <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> experimentally; genomics, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|E

Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair, prevention of pressure sores, and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance.

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Raelle Tucker, and marked the directorial debut of series creator Eric Kripke. It {{featured}} the return of deceased characters Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) and Jessica Moore (Adrianne Palicki). Kripke enjoyed expanding upon the character of Mary, who was only briefly depicted in earlier episodes.

5|$|The {{municipal}} government has permitted denser development around the stations, where it wants most new housing and commercial property to be built. Development projects for Slettebakken, Wergeland, Paradis and Lagunen have been announced by private developers. Many of the stations are in primarily residential areas, and the projects have met resistance from residents who {{fear that the}} character of their neighborhoods will <b>be</b> <b>altered.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Sarah {{encounters}} the Fire Gang had to <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> in post-production {{as it had}} been filmed against black velvet cloth, to disguise the puppeteers, and a new forest background was added behind.

5|$|By the 1990s, new {{historical}} research (especially by Air Force historians Earl Tilford, Bernard Nalty, and Jacob Van Staaveren) and the publications of the Military Institute of Vietnam finally opened new perspectives on aerial interdiction during the Vietnam War. During Commando Hunt for example, the Air Force claimed that 46,000 PAVN trucks {{had been destroyed}} or damaged by air strikes in Laos. These figures were hard to reconcile with the 6,000 trucks imported annually into North Vietnam between 1965 and 1970 â€“ {{for all of its}} operations. American claims that 80 percent of the materiel that started down the trail was destroyed while en route to the southern battlefields had to <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> in the face of loss claims of only 15 percent by the Vietnamese.|$|E

5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution would provide the opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days later}} the band {{reassembled}} to try a different arrangement. The second version of the song featured McCartney's Mellotron introduction followed by the refrain. They recorded five takes of the basic tracks for this arrangement (two of which were false starts) with the last being chosen as best and subjected to further overdubs. Lennon's final vocal was recorded with the tape running fast so that when played back at normal speed the tonality would <b>be</b> <b>altered,</b> giving his voice a slurred sound. This version {{was used for the}} first minute of the released recording.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel Î±1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may <b>be</b> <b>altered</b> by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E
