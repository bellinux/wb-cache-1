The determination of the conditions for the initiation of {{the motion of the}} ballast stones due to the wind gust created by high-speed trains is critical to predict the start of <b>ballast</b> <b>pick-up</b> because, once the motion is initiated, a saltation-like chain reaction can take place. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a model to evaluate the effect of a random aerodynamic impulse on stone motion initiation, and an experimental study performed to check the capability of the proposed model to classify trains by their effect on the ballast due to the flow generated by the trains. A measurement study has been performed at kp 69 [*]+[*] 500 on the Madrid – Barcelona High Speed Line. The obtained results show the feasibility of the proposed method, and contribute to a technique for BTE characterization, which can be relevant for the development of train interoperability standard...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the AeroTRAIN project in railway aerodynamics, the objectives and some first results. The project is promoting interoperable rail traffic by addressing identified needs in rolling stock authorisation, mainly {{focusing on the}} technical specifications for interoperability. The areas addressed are: open air pressure pulses, aerodynamic loads on track (<b>ballast</b> <b>pick-up),</b> crosswinds, train-tunnel interaction (loads on conventional trains and micro-pressure wave phenomena) and slipstream effects. The work contains full-scale and model-scale tests as well as numerical simulations. Complementing the area specific research is work focusing on regulatory acceptance by emphasising a scientific assessment of uncertainties and ensuring that the safety, effectiveness, efficiency and feasibility of the proposed conformity assessment processes are convincing...|$|E
