40|$|Graduation date: 2003 This {{dissertation}} describes {{formulation of}} a gastric retention device (GRD) and sustained release (SR) hydrochlorothiazide beads at Oregon State University. Formulation condition and amounts of excipients had {{significant influence on}} characteristic of the GRD. The GRD containing SR hydrochlorothiazide beads was employed to assess bioavailability/bioequivalency study in healthy subjects. An original GRD was retained in the stomach with food and completed the drug release. However, this original GRD failed to stay {{on an empty stomach}}, leading to lower bioavailability than an immediate release (IR) tablet due to insufficient rigidity. The original device was modified to be more rigid, and this more rigid device successfully stayed on an empty stomach and achieved completion of the drug release at a slow release rate, the bioavailability and the drug effect on diuresis increased compared to the drug in an IR tablet. Less amount of hydrochlorothiazide at a slow release rate achieved equivalent diuresis to higher amount of the drug at a rapid release rate, which indicated slow drug release resulted in higher efficiency of hydrochlorothiazide. In vivo/in vitro correlation of hydrochlorothiazide in a modified GRD and an IR tablet was established to predict in vivo profile with in vitro dissolution profile prior to a clinical study. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic of nicotine was reviewed in terms of a relationship between plasma nicotine concentrations and pharmacological changes including heart rate and craving.

We conducted a difference in difference study in a set of 30 chronic use drugs, selected from the eighty clinical guidelines published by the Chilean Ministry of Health. The effect was assessed according to the date when the corresponding ministerial decree was published. A control drugs was selected for each analyzed medication in order to estimate the effect of implementation independently of other factors of the market. We identified three groups of drugs: (i) those which experimented a significant increment of price due to bioequivalence; (ii) those where prices decreased; and (iii) those where prices did not (significantly changed) decrease. A sensitivity analysis complemented the study results and identified the significant effect of the date when the bioequivalence was implemented.

In this study the <b>bioequivalency</b> of two marketed formulations using both urine and plasma samples were investigated. 'Ranitidine' 150 mg tablets (generic) and 'Zantac' 150 mg tablets were compared in a double blind crossover study using eight healthy male volunteers. A simple and rapid HPLC method was also developed to analyze the drug concentration in both urine and plasma. Double peak phenomenon, observed in plasma samples, was omitted when the urine samples were used. Bioavailability of the two formulations calculated from urinary data were not significantly different, whereas the plasma data were considerably different (based on Cmax &amp; Tmax but not AUC). Pharmacokinetic parameters resulted from urine regarding the rate of the absorption (Tmax-ud, (dDu/dt) max, Ka-ud) did not correlate well with their respective plasma parameters (Tmax, Cmax, Ka), whereas those of absorption extent and elimination rates (plasma AUC, K and urinary Du ) were well correlated. It is concluded that the urine sampling which has advantages of easy sample collection and extraction could be used for determination of the extent of absorption and rate of the elimination of ranitidine, since similar parameters can be obtained with easier sample collection and extraction, whereas for determination of absorption rate, Cmax &amp; Tmax plasma data are preferred.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to compare the quality of {{atenolol}} tablets and examine the possibility of biowaiver study for approval of generic drugs without additional in vivo bioequivalence study. Atenolol, a cardio selective β-blocker, could be clearly classified into BCS Class III and may be evaluated under biowaiver conditions. Due to the importance of atenolol and availability of different generics in a community basis, four products available in Ras Al Khaimah were analyzed. Four brands of atenolol 100 mg tablets have been evaluated using some quality control parameters, such as weight variation, hardness, content assay, disintegration and dissolution test. In vitro dissolution testing can be used in some cases not only to determine the quality of the pharmaceutical products but also to demonstrate bioequivalence to the generic product. Similarity factor (f 2) and Difference Factor (f 1) were used to assess <b>bioequivalency</b> among four products. The FDA recommended dissolution medium for atenolol is 0. 1 N HCl but it shows a good releasing pattern in water also. The dissolution profiles of Aten- 4 and Aten- 2 in pH 1. 2 is rapid and good, only Aten- 3 failed to cross the similarity factor but f 1 is within limit. In pH 4. 5 and 6. 8 all brands fulfilled biowaiver requirements, except Aten- 2 in pH 6. 8 that may be due to manufacturing process difference. In the same time Aten- 2 has f 1 value 12 that is within the limit. Therefore, generic drugs with differing in vitro dissolution will not necessarily exhibit different in vivo performance.

The products were characterized by physical parameters including weight variation, thickness, friability, hardness and moisture content. The in vitro release study was conducted in simulated gastric medium (0. 1 N HCl, pH 1. 2) for 2 h and simulated intestinal medium (phosphate buffer pH 6. 8) for 9 h using type II (paddle type) USP reference dissolution apparatus. The drug was assayed by using UV spectrophotometry at 277 nm. Different kinetics models were applied to drug release data in order to evaluate mechanism of drug release. Physical properties of all products compiled with the acceptable limits. However moisture content was higher than the standard value in the generic products except the brand. All the products succeed to fulfill their official requirement of 80 % drug release within 8 h, in simulated intestinal medium except A 3. Zero order release kinetics was predominant for al L 2 and the International brand while more data fitting to Hixson- Crowell kinetics was obtained with the L 1 and A 1, A 2 and A 3.

The two products were found to comply with the compendial requirments for both disintegration and content uniformity; moreover, the 111 vitro dissolution characteristics of the two products were similar. Method: Ten healthy male volunteers were enrolled in the study, each received a single dose of each drug in an open randomizes two-way cross-over study, with a wash out period of 7 days. Blood samples were obtained over a 10 hours interval according to this fashion: At zero, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 2. 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 hours. These samples were analyzed for serum glucose by the glucose oxidase method and glibenclamide by a sensitive HPLC assay. Results. · The two products were closely related in terms of their in vitro compendial requirements. Moreover, there was no significant difference with respect to peak serum concentration (103. 92 ± 43. 98 and 98. 5 ± 51. 26 nglml for products A and B, respectively) or to the corresponding peak times (2. 6 ± 0. 66 and 2. 3 ± 0. 88 hours for A and B respectively).

In addition it discusses the advances pharmaceutical scientists have made in response to the new knowledge. The CIDR® 1900 Cattle insert is a commercially available silicone based intravaginal delivery system containing the natural steroid progesterone for fertility regulation in cattle. It was designed in 1987 to be inserted for 12 days. Advances made in oestrous cycle understanding by animal scientists have resulted in this product being inserted for much shorter treatment periods of 7 days. Rathbone et al. recently optimised the CIDR® 1900 Cattle insert for seven day insertion periods. The outcome of these scientists work was a manufactured prototype which, when compared to the CIDR® 1900 Cattle insert, contained a reduced initial drug load and a much lower residual drug load after use. For commercial production the prototype insert needed to be scaled up. This process required detailed pharmaceutical characterisation, invitro release assessment, invivo <b>bioequivalency</b> and chemical and physical stability studies to be performed on the scaled up product (CIDR® 1380 Cattle insert) to ensure the success of the scale up process. This characterisation process forms Chapters Two and Three of this Thesis. Knowledge of the mechanism of release of a drug from a pharmaceutical product provides the formulation scientist with the necessary insight to optimise, further develop or recognise the potential and limitations of a product. Chapter Four explores the mechanism of release of progesterone from the silicone based CIDR® Cattle insert both invitro and invivo. Cumulative release data from both invitro and invivo studies were fitted against conventional mathematical models to determine the mechanism of release of progesterone from the CIDR® Cattle insert. In addition, an experimental method was developed to assess the validity of the models. The method involved taking thin consecutive horizontal slices from the surface of CIDR® Cattle inserts after various periods of release. Cumulative release of progesterone, both invitro and invivo, was linear when plotted against the square root of time, suggesting that release from the CIDR® Cattle insert occurred in accordance with the square root of time mechanism. However, experimental evidence from the horizontal slicing technique only supported the curve fitting evidence for invitro release. When the insert was investigated invivo, the slicing method indicated that a novel release mechanism was in operation which was better described by a zero order process. Chapters Five and Six of this Thesis direct their focus to oestrus control in sheep. Chapter Five utilises information gained from both Rathbone et al. and the work performed in this Thesis on the CIDR® Cattle insert to characterise and optimise the commercially available sheep equivalent of the CIDR ® 1900 Cattle insert (known as the CIDR® Sheep and Goat insert). The Chapter successfully characterises the CIDR® Sheep and Goat insert, defines the parameters of, and tests, an optimised version of this sheep product. The final Chapter of this Thesis investigates the use of poly-(ε-caprolactone) as a platform for the intravaginal delivery of progesterone to control oestrus in sheep. Silicone has certain limitations as a drug delivery platform, and with animal physiologists recent advances in knowledge, pharmaceutical scientists will need more versatile delivery platforms to develop intravaginal drug delivery systems which fulfil the future demands of the animal scientists...|$|E
