50|$|In Europe, it {{was known}} by various names {{during the nineteenth century}} when it was used as a medicine; these names {{included}} bitter ash, <b>bitterwood,</b> mountain damson and stave-wood.|$|E

50|$|Müller et al. (2005) {{described}} {{two main}} vegetation types, namely a) moist, evergreen forest dominated by Forest newtonia, Chirinda stinkwood, Forest ordeal tree and Panga-panga, and b) transitional forest {{on the northern}} verge of the forest, where the predominant species were Winged bersama, Panga-panga, Two-winged pteleopsis, Toad-tree and Bushveld <b>bitterwood.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Misahöhe Forest Reserve is {{situated}} in the mountains north-west of Kpalimé, {{on the border with}} Ghana (Coordinates: 0° 35.00′ East, 6° 57.00′ North). It covers an area of 5000 ha, and the altitude varies between 250 and 740 m. The reserve consists of steep hillsides supporting semi-deciduous forest dominated by bark cloth and iroko trees. Other species include flat-crown, alstonia, false fig, cola, velvet tamarind, orange milk, African mahogany, macaranga, malacantha, African nutmeg, limba, African <b>bitterwood</b> and Abachi.|$|E
50|$|Simarouba glauca is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} tree that is native to Florida in the United States, southern Florida, South America, and the Lesser Antilles. Common names include paradise-tree, dysentery-bark, and <b>bitterwood.</b> Its seeds produce an edible oil. The tree is well suited for warm, humid, tropical regions. Its cultivation depends on rainfall distribution, water holding capacity of the soil and sub-soil moisture. It is suited for temperature range of 10 to 40 C. It can grow at elevations from sea level to 1000 m. It grows 40 to 50 ft tall and has a span of 25 to 30 ft. It bears yellow flowers and oval elongated purple colored fleshy fruits.|$|E
5000|$|Cindy Lynn Speer of SF Site called Nobody Gets the Girl [...] "very well written." [...] The blog Guilded Earlobe gave Maxey's {{audiobook}} <b>Bitterwood</b> an A- rating. Bull Spec Magazine wrote, [...] "James Maxey's Dragon Apocalypse {{series has}} been a lot of fun so far — and yet every time I say that I feel remiss in focusing on the fun, and not enough on how creative these books are." [...] The book review website Founding Fields saying, [...] "James Maxey is a freaking genius. I want more." [...] George T. Dodds of SF Site wrote of Maxey's Dragonforge, [...] "While I was entertained and the plot was compelling and well structured, the story left me feeling underwhelmed in a number of ways." [...] Dodds expounded, [...] "My biggest problem with Dragonforge is that the dragons are basically humans in dragon suits ... a bit more of Cthulhu-like incomprehensibility and alienness to their behaviour would have made them more interesting." ...|$|E
40|$|In Latin America and the Caribbean, {{precious}} wood species like mahoganies (Swietenia spp.) and cedars (Cedrela spp.) {{are seriously}} injured by the mahogany shootborer, Hypsipyla grandella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larva, which bores {{into the main}} shoot of trees. In previous experiments focused on searching for a preventive method for managing this pest, a wood extract of <b>bitterwood,</b> Quassia amara L. ex Blom (Simaroubaceae) had been shown to cause phagodeterrence to larvae. Therefore, three fractions (water, methanol and diethyl ether) of a wood extract were tested for their phagodeterrence to larvae, by means of laboratory and greenhouse trials. Phagodeterrence was assessed by determining their effect on foliage consumption, mortality and signs of damage (number of orifices, sawdust piles, fallen shoots, number of tunnels and tunnel length) caused by larvae on Spanish cedar (C. odorata). Both the methanol and diethyl ether fractions caused phagodeterrence, by strongly reducing foliage consumption and signs of damage, while not causing larval mortality. The lowest concentration at which phagodeterrence was detected for the methanol fraction corresponded to 0. 0625 %, which is equivalent to a 1. 0 % of the <b>bitterwood</b> crude extract. However, results with the diethyl ether fraction were unsatisfactory, as none of the treatments differed from the solvent, possibly because of an adverse effect of the solvent on foliar tissues. Phagodeterrent principles from Q. amara derivatives may {{play an important role}} in dealing with H. grandella if they are complemented with other integrated pest management preventative tactics.

40|$|Bemisia tabaci {{is a key}} {{virus vector}} on several crops worldwide. Then, a {{preventive}} approach to deal with viral epidemics may be the deployment of repellents or phagodeterrents at earlier stages of plant development (critical period). Thus, the crude extract and four fractions thereof (water, water: methanol, methanol, and diethyl ether) of <b>bitterwood</b> (Quassia amara, Simaroubaceae) were tested for phagodeterrence to B. tabaci adults under greenhouse conditions, on tomato plants, in Costa Rica. Both restricted-choice and unrestricted-choice experiments showed that the crude extract and some fractions exerted such effect on the insect. In the former case (in sleeve cages), all fractions caused deterrence at doses as low as 0. 1 % (methanol), 0. 5 % (water: methanol and diethyl ether), and 1 % (water). In the latter case (plants exposed in a greenhouse) the methanol fraction stood out, followed by the diethyl ether fraction. Nonetheless, none of the fractions performed better than the deterrent control (mineral oil). Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (4) : 2131 - 2146. Epub 2008 December 12...|$|E
