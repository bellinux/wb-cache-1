500|$|In October 2010, Jackman {{confirmed}} that Aronofsky would direct the film. Jackman commented that with Aronofsky directing, Wolverine 2 {{will not be}} [...] "usual" [...] stating, [...] "This is, hopefully for me, {{going to be out}} of the box. It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure". The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E
500|$|On September15,2000, US songwriters Seth Swirsky and Warren Campbell filed {{a lawsuit}} against Carey at the [...] 9th Circuit for {{copyright}} infringement, [...] "reverse passing off" [...] and false designation, claiming that [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] borrowed heavily from a song they composed called [...] "One of Those Love Songs". It was recorded by the R group Xscape in 1998 for their album Traces of My Lipstick. The lawsuit claimed that Carey wrongfully gave the songwriting credits to Jam and Lewis. Swirsky and Campbell had sold the rights of the song to So So Def Recordings in 1998. [...] "I'm a fan of Mariah Carey; this is nothing personal against her. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> believe there's accountability, and it's very clear what happened here. I've never sued anybody before", Swirsky said. According to the district court, an expert witness (chair of the Musicology Department at the University of California at Los Angeles) determined that the songs shared a [...] "substantially similar chorus". The expert stated that although the lyrics and verse melodies of the two songs were different, the songs' choruses [...] "shared a 'basic shape and pitch emphasis' in their melodies, which were played over 'highly similar basslines' and chord changes, at very nearly the same tempo and in the same generic style." [...] He noted both the songs had their choruses sung in the key of B. The expert further remarked that [...] "the emphasis on musical notes" [...] on the two songs was the same, which [...] "contribute to the impression of similarity one hears when comparing the two songs." [...] He presented a series of visual transcriptions of his observations. The transcriptions contained details about the pitch sequence of both the songs' chorus, melody, and bassline.|$|E
2500|$|The plot is {{not based}} on the storyline in the {{original}} book by Gaston Leroux. Lloyd Webber stated: [...] "I don't regard this as a sequelâ€”it's a stand-alone piece." [...] He later clarified: [...] "Clearly, it is a sequel, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not believe {{that you have to have}} seen Phantom of the Opera to understand Love Never Dies." [...] The musical is set in 1907, which Lloyd Webber states is [...] "ten years roughly after the end of the original Phantom", although the events of the original actually took place in 1881.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No,' said Mr. Slinkton. 'I {{did look}} in at Mr. Sampson's office, on your recommendation; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not feel {{justified}} in troubling Mr. Sampson himself, {{on a point}} in the everyday, routine of an ordinary clerk.' ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{with all}} of Tykwer's films since 1997's Winter Sleepers, the musical score for Perfume was {{composed}} by Tykwer {{and two of his}} friends Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil. The score was performed by the Berlin Philharmonic and State choir Latvija under the direction of conductor Simon Rattle. Tykwer began composing the score with Klimek and Heil the very day he started working on the screenplay. Tykwer said, [...] "I feel like I understand very much about the structure and the motivations of the characters when I'm writing the script, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> understand the atmosphere and the emotional and the more abstract part of the film when I'm investigating the music, and when I'm planning the music for it. ... When I then come to the shooting, having worked for three years on the music and three years on the script, I really feel like I know exactly the two worlds and how to combine them." [...] By the time it came to shooting the film, a substantial portion of music had been composed. Tykwer hired a small orchestra and recorded them performing the score. Tykwer played the recorded music on set so people could explore the atmosphere and the acoustic world of the film while they were acting in it. The music was also used instead of temp music during editing.|$|E

60|$|Shall I own the truth? The bottles {{circulated}} freely at Mr. Farnaby's table--I {{began to}} wonder whether he was quite sober. I said I was sorry to disappoint him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not know what my family motto was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a great fool," [...] said Agatha, {{sitting down}} and {{twisting}} her hands perplexedly. [...] "I believe <b>I</b> said something; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not intend to. He surprised me into speaking before I knew what I was saying. A pretty mess I have got myself into!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Are you? I don't {{know that}} I have shown any very strong preference. I am not {{disposed}} to praise myself for many things, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> think that I {{have been as}} undemonstrative as most men of my age." ...|$|E
5000|$|Through the Rosenthals, Rosen was {{connected}} to the New York musical scene. ... He says that by the time he went to Princeton, he knew all the music department socially. [...] "So that made me too proud to take a degree in music, which I thought would be too easy. I sound like a snotty bastard, which I might have been, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> know more music as an undergraduate than the postgraduate students." ...|$|R
5000|$|William S. Niederkorn, in {{his article}} on the play for The New York Times quoted Amy Freed: [...] "There's a lot in 'The Beard of Avon' {{that has to do}} with my own {{completely}} insane love affair with actors and theater... It's very much a valentine to the whole theatrical experience at its silliest and most rewarding... It is a comic perspective, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> a lot of reading on all sides of the issue." ...|$|R

"I don't {{wish to be}} rude, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> {{think you}} are vain of your good looks, elegant accomplishments, and the {{impression}} you make wherever you go. When it's worth while, you exert yourself, and are altogether fascinating; but the 'I come-see-and-conquer' air you put on spoils it all for sensible people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Dolly, she {{is really}} sick," [...] Lute said that evening, when they had {{returned}} from {{a last look at}} the mare. [...] "But you weren't hurt, Chris, and that's enough for one small woman to be thankful for. I thought <b>I</b> knew, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not know till to-day, how much you meant to me. I could hear only the plunging and struggle in the thicket.
