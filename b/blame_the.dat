5|$|Today, erosion {{caused by}} ship {{movements}} {{on the nearby}} Canal has left considerable portions of the Diolkos in a poor state, particularly at its excavated western end.

5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all <b>blame.</b> <b>The</b> court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
50|$|The M-19 lost {{several of}} its top commanders during <b>the</b> event, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} for the ensuing bloodshed.

5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> purge on Hitler, whom {{they wanted to see}} continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} thrust levers, the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect thrust lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E
5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
25|$|State {{authorities}} were also <b>blamed.</b> <b>The</b> state labor commissioner, John C. Brooks, blamed his department's failure {{to inspect the}} plant on shortage of money and staff, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> federal government for not enforcing stricter standards.|$|R

The wife killed his favorite horse and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> sister. The brother said the dogs could eat it. Finally, the wife gave birth, cut off the baby's head, and <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> sister. The brother took his sister and drove the carriage into a bramble. He told his sister to disentangle. When she started, he cut off both her arms at the elbow and drove off.|$|R
5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have noted}} that Brooks uses World War Z as a {{platform}} to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human short-sightedness. At {{one point in the}} book, a Palestinian refugee living in Kuwait refuses to believe the dead are rising, fearing it is a trick by Israel. Many U.S. characters <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|The medallions were {{initially}} sold through mail order; purchasers {{were required to}} obtain the day's price by telephone before ordering. Later, the Mint sold them through telemarketing. Mintage ceased after the ten different medallions approved by Congress were produced. All were struck at the West Point Bullion Depository. The series sold poorly, prompting critics to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> involved process by which they were first marketed, {{and the fact that}} they were medallions rather than coins.|$|E
50|$|However, the Sri Lankan {{government}} and other Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists have repeatedly <b>blamed</b> <b>the</b> Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for the assassinations.

5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was not responsible for the deaths, resolutely continuing to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E
5|$|I am heartily {{sorry that}} after waiting {{so long for}} you I would set out but a day before your arrival....

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} {{the imposition of}} martial law, ostensibly {{to break up the}} demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E
5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving the country at the airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices and <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> deaths on the communists.|$|E
5|$|The OKL was {{not happy}} about {{supporting}} Cerberus. Jeschonnek remarked to Galland that if Cerberus failed then the Luftwaffe would be made a scapegoat. Jeschnonnek was to be proved right. During the 12 January 1942 meeting, the Navy demanded maximum fighter cover be given and won Hitler's support. Should anything go wrong, the Navy would most likely <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe for damage sustained by enemy air forces. During the meeting Jeschonnek stood his ground and refused to give any guarantees or to reinforce the Western Fighter Forces from other theatres. Galland was given executive power for the air operation which was given the code name Unternehmen Donnerkeil (Operation Thunderbolt). The existence of the operation was so secret that both Jeschonnek and Galland had to sign secrecy pledges as they left Hitler's Headquarters in East Prussia.|$|E

5|$|The gender-based {{criticism}} has also affected younger male {{fans of the}} show, such as with Michael Morones above. Another story that gained national attention was that of Grayson Bruce, a nine-year-old fan who was told to stop bringing a Rainbow Dash backpack to school to prevent bullying that he was receiving. An online campaign to show support for Grayson gained over 32,000 supporters on its Facebook page, and the brony fanbase, the show's creators and voice actors, and various news commentators like Glenn Beck, Ronan Farrow and Eugene Volokh have stood up for the boy's actions. The school later revised its decision after speaking to the family and clarifying it {{was not trying to}} <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> student for the incident.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{a general}} store {{delivery}} boy named Jimmy (Jack Parker) listens to a radio {{report about the}} Creeper's murders. The cantankerous store owner Mr. Haskins (Oscar O'Shea) arrives with a handwritten letter slipped under the door, requesting groceries be delivered to a nearby dock. Jimmy brings the groceries to the dock and leaves them at a door, where the Creeper takes them into his hideout. But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J. Donelly (Donald MacBride) and Lieutenant Gates (Peter Whitney) receive complaints from the mayor's office about their failure to arrest the Creeper, but they deflect the <b>blame.</b> <b>The</b> two officers then get a call about the missing delivery boy and head to the dock to investigate.|$|E
5|$|This plan {{required}} tacit Soviet support, and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, {{included a}} secret agreement to partition Poland {{between the two}} countries. Contrary to Ribbentrop's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939. This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September. Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit {{in an effort to}} <b>blame</b> <b>the</b> imminent war on British and Polish inaction.|$|E
