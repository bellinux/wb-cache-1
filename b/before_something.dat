25|$|Bradman's {{luck with}} the coin toss {{continued}} in the series, as he won the toss and chose to bat first for the fourth occasion out of five. The Australian openers put on 48 runs before Sid Barnes was run out brilliantly by Adhikari. As usual, Bradman came out to bat at one-down and along with Bill Brown, he added 92 runs for the third wicket <b>before</b> <b>something</b> unfortunate for Australia happened. Bradman discovered that he had torn a rib muscle {{and was unable to}} play freely, so he retired hurt at 140/1. Brown was unaffected by this situation and carved a three-hour, twenty-five minute 99, from 216 balls. Again he too was run out, but the other Australian batsmen scored handily. Sam Loxton, making his debut, scored a 155-ball 80, Lindwall, Tallon(the wicket-keeper), Len Johnson, and Bill Johnston contributed to the huge scoreline.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an op-ed}} for The Washington Post in August 2016, Scarborough {{argued that the}} Republican Party must [...] "dump Donald Trump" [...] as their presidential candidate. Drawing {{attention}} to Trump's remarks about Hillary Clinton and the Second Amendment, Scarborough wrote: [...] "A bloody line has been crossed that cannot be ignored. At long last, Donald Trump has left the Republican Party few options but to act decisively and get this political train wreck off the tracks <b>before</b> <b>something</b> terrible happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{next level}} of despair is [...] "The despair that is {{conscious}} of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self {{in which there is}} something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself." [...] This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will or want to be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is pretty straightforward. A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy <b>before</b> <b>something</b> they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God {{or at the very least}} see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading [...] "Despair over the earthly." ...|$|E
