40|$|Movement {{abnormalities}} can be dichotomised {{into the}} two broad categories of hypokinetic and hyperkinetic syndromes.

Subadult gerbils also preferred opaque artificial burrows to transparent ones. Based on these findings we developed an artificial burrow system that could be integrated into laboratory Makrolon Type IV cages to prevent the development of stereotypic digging in gerbils by addressing their behavioural needs. Faecal cortisol levels were measured as a non-invasive method of comparing stress reactions in gerbils given access to the new integrated artificial burrow system or to an equivalent transparent burrow.

5000|$|When social {{interactions}} amongst birds are absent or inadequate, abnormal social behaviour may develop. For example, a study regarding parrots {{that had been}} isolated in cages demonstrated that most birds showing this social deprivation had significant behavioural disturbances, such as aggressive behaviour, feather picking, self-mutilation, restlessness, screaming, apathetic behavior, and stereotypies. [...] Cannibalism often occurs in large animal husbandry systems, which are usually impoverished environments {{with a lack of}} opportunities. In addition, studies of caged canaries have revealed two common stereotypies. These include spot picking, where birds repeatedly touch a particular spot in the environment with the tip of their beak, and route tracing, a pacing behaviour associated with physical restrictions in movement imposed by the cage. The absence of song learning in zebra finches has also been implicated as a <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality.</b> In these birds, the social interaction of a young male with his song tutor is important for normal song development. Without the stimulus, the song, which is necessary for mating behavior, will not be learned.|$|R

Total phenolic content of GSE was 592. 5 mg/g dry weight, including gallic acid (49 mg/g), catechin (41 mg/g), epicatechin (66 mg/g) and proanthocyanidins (436. 6 mg catechin equivalents/g). Long-term feeding of GSE diet was well tolerated without fatality, <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality,</b> changes in food consumption, body weight or liver function. The Aβ levels {{in the brain and}} serum of the mice fed with GSE were reduced by 33 % and 44 %, respectively, compared with the Alzheimer’s mice fed with the control diet. Amyloid plaques and microgliosis in the brain of Alzheimer’s mice fed with GSE were also reduced by 49 % and 70 %, respectively.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the effect of}} {{estrogen}} on facial pain, we first compared the face-rubbing evoked by a formalin injection in the lip of aromatase-knockout (ArKO) mice, lacking endogenous estrogen production, 17 beta-estradiol-treated ArKO mice (ArKO-E 2) and wild-type (WT) littermates. During the 'acute' phase of pain the time spent rubbing was similar in the three groups, whereas during the following 'interphase' and the second phase of pain, grooming was increased ill ArKO mice. Estradiol-treatment restored a behaviour similar to WT group. To better understand estrogens modulation on pain processes, we examined changes in 5 -HT and CGRP innervations of trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in ArKO, ArKO-E 2 and WT groups sacrified during the interphase. Whereas serotonin and CGRP immunoreactivities were comparable in WT and ArKO non-injected control groups, our data showed that 9 min after formalin injection, the density of serotoninergic terminals increased significantly in WT, but not in ArKO mice, while that of CGRP-immunoreactive fibers was lower in WT than in ArKO mice on the injected side. Estradiol-treatment only partially reversed these changes in ArKO-E 2 mice. We conclude that estrogen deprivation in ArKO mice can be responsible for increased nociceptive response and that it is accompanied by transmitter changes favouring pro- over anti-nociceptive mechanisms in TNC during interphase of the formalin model. That estradiol-treatment completely reverses the <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality</b> Suggests that estrogens absence produces chiefly functional activation-dependent changes. However, the fact that the immunohistochemical abnormalities were not totally normalized by estradiol-treatment suggested that some permanent developmental alterations may occur in ArKO mice.

In some of the churches as well as church members, we can observe some level of ‘spiritual proprioception’. So many things have arisen {{from one side of the}} vision – Man’s Vision. In many cases, there is a clear absence of the spiritual vision – Vision from Heaven. Of course, there are also some who are overly spiritual where they are ‘too heavenly but of no earthly use’.

Man’s vision can come from learning, acquiring skills, equipping, training, mentoring, counseling, planning, etc., but God’s vision can only come from God Himself through praying, reading the Bible, contemplating, listening to God, meditation, journeying with God, solitude or dwelling in silence with God, communing with God, etc. It seems that we have been doing a lot in the acquiring of skills and training in the arena of professionalism and religiosity.

40|$|Flank sucking is a <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality</b> of {{compulsive}} {{nature that}} occurs {{almost exclusively in}} Doberman pinchers and is frequently accompanied by other abnormal behaviours, such as acral lick dermatitis, blanket sucking and pica. A 2. 5 -year old, intact male, Doberman pinscher was presented because of a two-month long history of persistent right flank sucking. The dog was up-to-date with vaccinations and lived exclusively outdoors with his mother. The onset of the problem coincided with a period of crate restraining, where a short chain was used to avoid copulation with his mother, {{when she was in}} oestrus. Since then, the abnormal behaviour occurred on a daily basis and was not associated with neurological signs. In addition, the dog presented blanket sucking and pica that had first appeared during puppyhood. No clinical abnormalities were detected and the dog did not show signs of anxiety, aggression or fear during physical examination and blood sampling. Later-on and while remaining calm in the waiting room of the Clinic, the dog started chasing, chewing and sucking his right flank for over three minutes, but stopped immediately after his owner's verbal intervention. Primary diagnosis was compulsive flank sucking; differential diagnosis included Trichuris vulpis infestation, allergic dermatitis and psychomotor seizures. Results of haematological and serum biochemical examinations were unremarkable, whereas serological examination for Leishmania and faecal parasitological examination did not reveal significant results. Suggested treatment included administration of an anthelminthic combination (praziquantel, pyrantel and febantel), orally, for 4 consecutive days and clomipramine, at the dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight, every 12 hours, orally, {{for a long period of}} time, along with instructions to avoid the causative and triggering factors.

40|$|Canine acral lick {{dermatitis}} is {{a complicated}} and challenging syndrome occurring in companion animal dermatology. Skin lesions are caused by intense and prolonged licking of a localized area, usually on the lower parts of the limbs that progressively may result in plaque or nodule formation with alopecia, erythema, hyperpigmentation, exudation, erosion and ulceration. Acral lick dermatitis develops more often in male dogs of large breeds and has a multifactorial aetiology. The underlying causes may be broadly separated into organic (e. g., pruritic skin diseases, painful conditions) and psychogenic. The former subset includes mainly deep bacterial pyoderma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, foreign bodies, sensory neuropathies and painful bone and articular diseases. The psychogenic subset may be either a primary (e. g., the result of long-standing anxiety, boredom, attention-seeking or stereotypic behavior) or a psychosomatic <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Regardless of the aetiology and the primary role it may play, the most common complication in the psychogenic acral lick dermatitis is actually the deep bacterial pyoderma observed {{in the majority of}} the cases. Diagnosis of the disorder is reached after exclusion of similar-looking skin diseases, such as ringworm kerion, demodicosis, leishmaniosis, sterile granulomas and neoplasia. An extensive list of diagnostic tests is necessary to identify the underlying cause(s) and includes cytological examination, bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing, histopathological examination, imaging of the affected area and hypoallergenic food trial. A prerequisite to diagnosing the psychogenic subset of the disease is to rule-out potential organic causes, coupled with persistence of skin licking, despite resolution of deep bacterial pyoderma. Regardless of the underlying cause, therapy should always include mechanical restrain, as well as the long-term topical and systemic use of antimicrobials that ideally should be selected {{based on the results of}} antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Specific treatment in also warranted to resolve potential organic causes of the syndrome, whereas, management of its psychogenic subset should be based on avoidance of the causative and triggering factors, desensitization and counter-conditioning, along with the administration of psychotropic medication.

A Cognitive Laterality Quotient (CLQ) was calculated from the difference in performance between the "right" and "left" test batteries and, therefore, reflected the relative functioning attributed to the right and left hemispheres. Using the CLQ measurement and a control group of 30 non-neurological patients matched for age and education, 28 out of 30 brain-damaged patients (93 %) were categorised correctly according to side of lesion; the other two were considered to have either abnormal lateralisation (one was left handed) or asymmetrical premorbid cognitive profiles.
