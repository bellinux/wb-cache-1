Billings pays him a friendly visit, and the two men agree to become partners in a new, even grander production of The Ziegfeld Follies. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> that both men are broke and Ziegfeld realizes this.

[...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is,</b> we believed in it." ...|$|E

[...] A writer for What's on TV said, [...] "It’s gripping and surprising, has a thoroughbred cast of Irish actors and is more filmic than soap. Worth delving into even if you’ve never heard of Kat and Alfie." [...] Tom Eames from Digital Spy called the series a [...] "bold move from the BBC" [...] that [...] "looks like a show that is a must-watch whether you're an EastEnders fan or not." [...] Steven Murphy, editor for Inside Soap, urged the magazine's readers to watch Redwater, despite previous soap spin-offs, such as Ricky & Bianca or Coronation Street: Open All Hours, being unmemorable, because [...] "It's mysterious, moody and dramatic—and looks stunning by making the best of its gorgeous Irish location." [...] Fiona Sturges from The Guardian said, [...] "There is—improbable as it sounds—a degree of suspense here, not to say proper acting. The problem is that whenever Kat and Alfie appear—he the well-meaning idiot, she the wounded fishwife—the spell is broken. The BBC is trying to sell this as Broadchurch meets The Wicker Man, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> more NCSI: Ballykissangel. I love Kat and Alfie, but the quicker they get back to Albert Square, the better." [...] Sean O'Grady from The Independent said, [...] "it's an un-soapy, unclaustrophobic sort of production, and a storyline about a long-lost son adds the necessary emotional stress." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{have been}} a good many funny things said and written about hardupishness, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> not funny, for all that.

It is much better to read books of travel than to travel oneself; he really enjoys foreign lands who never goes abroad; and the man who stays at home, preserving his illusions, has certainly the best of it.

Has any one seen St. Peter's without asking himself: Is that all? And the truest enjoyment arises from things that come unexpectedly, that one had never heard of. Then, living in a strange land, one loses all impression of its strangeness; it is only afterwards, in England, that one realises the charm and longs to return; and a hundred pictures rise to fill the mind with delight. Why can one not be strong enough to leave it at that and never tempt the fates again? ...|$|E
