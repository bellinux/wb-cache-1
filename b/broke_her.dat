5|$|Ulrika Eleonora (the elder) was sickly, and {{the many}} child births {{eventually}} <b>broke</b> <b>her.</b> When she became seriously ill, in 1693, Charles finally dedicated his time and care to her. Her death in July that year shook him deeply and he never fully recovered. Her infant son Ulric (1684–1685) had been given Ulriksdal Palace, which was renamed for him (Ulric's Dale).|$|E
5|$|After {{collapsing}} at a House of Lords dinner, Thatcher, having suffered low blood pressure, {{was admitted}} to St Thomas' Hospital in central London on 7 March 2008 for tests. In 2009 she was hospitalised again when she fell and <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> arm. Thatcher returned to 10 Downing Street in late November 2009 for the unveiling of an official portrait by artist Richard Stone, an unusual honour for a living ex-Prime Minister. Stone previously painted portraits of the Queen and the Queen Mother.|$|E

5|$|At the Australian Open, Kuznetsova {{reached the}} quarterfinals {{for the second}} time in her career, but lost to {{eventual}} champion Serena Williams, after being within two points of winning the match in the second set. After that, Kuznetsova did not win another match for nearly two months. She <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> losing streak at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, reaching the semifinals, losing to Victoria Azarenka.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the season, Lloyd was declared a free agent and subsequently signed with her home state club and 2009 WPS champions, Sky Blue FC, for the 2010 season. In April 2010, during a match against her former team, Chicago Red Stars, Lloyd slipped and <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> ankle. The injury kept her off the pitch for most of the season although she did return for two games in September.|$|E
5|$|Kathy Lynch {{was born}} in 1957 in Hawera, Taranaki {{and grew up in}} that town. She {{represented}} New Zealand in netball early in her life. As a young woman, Lynch <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> leg while skiing at Whakapapa skifield. Pete Braggins was the ski patroller who assisted her and has been her partner since. They moved to Motueka in the 1980s. Lynch took up canoeing and in 1987 won the New Zealand White Water Downriver and Slalom Championships.|$|E
50|$|Takahashi started aggressively attacking Asako, quickly {{overwhelming}} Asako and <b>broking</b> <b>her</b> nose. At {{the beginning}} of the second round, the referee stopped the fight to have Asako checked by the ring doctor. After restarting Takahashi threw a barrage of punches, which prompted the referee to stop the fight concerned about her broken chin.|$|R

5|$|Keene {{had been}} {{persistent}} in her efforts. In 1985 she <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> leg, {{but managed to}} keep to the feeding schedule even on crutches. In the winter of 1994 {{she was diagnosed with}} breast cancer and on her doctor's advice underwent a mastectomy. She hired a friend to conduct feeding operations in her absence, but was back to do it herself three days after surgery.|$|E
5|$|She {{was devastated}} by her husband's death and retired to Scotland. However, {{after a meeting}} with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, she <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> {{retirement}} and resumed her public duties. Eventually she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – the current University of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Two of the U.S. destroyers met {{a sudden}} demise. Either Nagara or the destroyers Teruzuki and Yukikaze {{came upon the}} {{drifting}} Cushing and pounded her with gunfire, knocking out all of her systems. Unable to fight back, Cushings crew abandoned ship. Cushing sank several hours later. Laffey, having escaped from her engagement with Hiei, encountered Asagumo, Murasame, Samidare, and, perhaps, Teruzuki. The Japanese destroyers pounded Laffey with gunfire and then hit her with a torpedo which <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> keel. A few minutes later fires reached her ammunition magazines and she blew up and sank.|$|E

5|$|Upon the Duke's {{death from}} cancer in 1972, the Duchess {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom to attend his funeral, staying at Buckingham Palace during her visit. The Duchess, increasingly frail and suffering from dementia, lived {{the remainder of}} {{her life as a}} recluse, supported by both her husband's estate and an allowance from the Queen. She suffered several falls and <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> hip twice.|$|E
5|$|All four ships saw major action {{during the}} war. Augsburg fired the first {{shots of the}} war against Russia on 2 August. Mainz and Cöln were sunk at the Battle of Heligoland Bight {{in the first month}} of the war. Kolberg saw action at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and scored the first hits of the engagement. Both Kolberg and Augsburg participated in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, and Operation Albion in October 1917. After the end of the war, Kolberg was seized by France as a war prize and {{commissioned}} into the French Navy as Colmar; she served for only a few years and was scrapped in 1929. Augsburg was surrendered to Japan, which <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|At 3:54p.m. BST on 23 July 2011, two {{ambulances}} {{were called}} to Winehouse's home in Camden, London. Winehouse was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that she had died. After her death was announced, media and camera crews appeared, as crowds gathered near Winehouse's residence to pay their respects. Forensic investigators entered the flat as police cordoned off the street outside; they recovered one small and two large bottles of vodka from her room. After her death, the singer <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> second Guinness World Record: for the most songs by a woman to simultaneously appear on the UK singles chart, with eight.|$|E

5|$|Candice {{made her}} {{on-screen}} {{return on the}} February 18, 2008 episode of Raw, distracting Beth Phoenix during a match with Maria. She returned to in-ring action on March 17, teaming up with Maria to defeat Jillian Hall and Victoria. During the match, Candice injured her left shoulder by tearing the scar tissue over her previously broken left clavicle. Unlike her previous injury, Candice <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> clavicle in four separate places, in essence, shattering it. As a result, Candice was replaced by Ashley for her scheduled match at WrestleMania XXIV. On March 23, Candice underwent successful surgery on her re-broken clavicle.|$|E
5|$|Nairana had {{her final}} {{overhaul}} at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944. By mid-1947, airlines had captured {{a significant portion}} of the passenger trade across Bass Strait, and Nairanas schedule was reduced. On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease. Nairana made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, Nairana <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> moorings during a gale on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off Port Melbourne. Unrecoverable, she was broken up in place in 1953–54.|$|E
5|$|Tao {{participated in}} the 25th Southeast Asian Games in Vientiane, Laos. On 10 December 2009, she took the gold in the 200metres {{backstroke}} {{in a time of}} 2 minutes 17.12 seconds. Three days later, she was part of the winning 4 x 100metres medley relay team with Roanne Ho, Shana Lim and Quah Ting Wen, and on 14 December she <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> own 2005 Games record in the 200metres butterfly in a time of 2minutes 13.49seconds. As she chalked up five wins, including the 100metres backstroke and butterfly events, these were her most successful Games to date.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} torpedoed twice by British submarines; the first, in July 1941, necessitated {{three months of}} repairs. The second, in August 1942, caused {{extensive}} damage and ended the ship's career. She was eventually towed back to La Spezia, where repairs were to be completed. Resources were unavailable, however, and Bolzano remained there, out of action. Plans to convert her into a hybrid cruiser-aircraft carrier came to nothing for the same reason. After Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, La Spezia was occupied by German forces; {{to prevent them from}} using her as a blockship, Italian and British frogmen sank Bolzano using Chariot manned torpedoes in June 1944. The Italian Navy ultimately raised the ship in September 1949 and <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|By nightfall {{some of the}} {{remaining}} French ships had entered Donegal Bay with Canada, Melampus and Foudroyant still in pursuit. The two forces repeatedly passed {{one another in the}} dark, and Canada almost drove ashore. Back at the battle site, Warren had ordered Robust to tow Hoche into Lough Swilly—this order later came under criticism, as Robust was in a battered state herself and the storms of the previous week had not abated. When a gale struck the pair on 13 October, Hoche lost several masts and <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> tow, only being prevented from foundering by the combined efforts of the British prize crew and their French prisoners. Eventually, on 15 October, Doris appeared and took Hoche in tow, arriving in Lough Swilly without further incident a few days later. Meanwhile, Ethalion saw Bellone safely into port, and Magnanime and Amelia brought in Coquille and Embuscade respectively.|$|E
5|$|Knowles {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, to Mathew Knowles and Tina Knowles. Solange's older sister is singer Beyoncé. Her father, {{originally}} from Alabama, is African American, and her mother, originally from southern Louisiana, is Creole (with African, Native American, French, and 1/32 Irish ancestry). Her maternal grandparents are Lumis Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon, (a seamstress). She is also a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. As a child, Knowles studied dance and theater. At the age of five, she made her singing debut at an amusement park. She began writing songs {{at the age of}} nine. At 13, she decided to pursue recording, but her parents initially advised her to wait. At the age of 15 Knowles replaced a departed dancer and performed with her sister's group Destiny's Child on tour. During the group's opening stint for American pop singer Christina Aguilera's tour, Knowles temporarily replaced Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland after she <b>broke</b> <b>her</b> toes backstage during a costume change. When Knowles was 16, her father, who was then also her manager, signed her to his recording company, Music World Entertainment, along with Columbia.|$|E
