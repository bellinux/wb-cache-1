50|$|Wooden boxes or crates are stowed {{on double}} dunnage in the holds and single dunnage in the 'tween decks. Heavy boxes are given bottom <b>stowage.</b> The <b>loading</b> slings are often left on to aid discharge.|$|R
50|$|On 1 November 1958, Chicago was {{reclassified}} CG-11 and towed to San Francisco Naval Shipyard {{to begin}} a five-year conversion (20 months longer than Columbus and 13 months longer than Albany) to a guided missile cruiser. Begun on 1 July 1959, the entire superstructure was removed and replaced with new aluminum compartments, modernized electronic systems, and an improved Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) equipped combat information center. Representative of the new technological focus on guided missiles, Chicago was refitted with Tartar and Talos SAM <b>stowage,</b> <b>loading,</b> launching, and guidance systems. Two triple torpedo tubes, an ASROC launcher, two 5 in/38 cal guns, and two antisubmarine helicopters rounded out the cruisers’ modifications.|$|R
50|$|The <b>loading,</b> <b>stowage</b> and {{securing}} of general cargo on and under deck, including special surveys of heavy or large items.|$|R
30|$|For key {{components}} {{to measure the}} convergence level in the shipbuilding industry’s product, a total of 12 components are selected from the propulsion power control, sailing control, accommodation and life safety control, and marine environment control sections. For the propelling power control section, the convergence level is measured for the main propulsion engine and the engine room auxiliary equipment. And, for the sailing control, the convergence level is measured for the cargo <b>stowage,</b> <b>loading</b> and unloading facilities, anchoring/mooring facilities, and navigation systems. For the accommodation and life safety control section, the convergence level is measured for the fire extinguishing and saving equipment and the crew accommodation facilities, and for the marine environment control sections, the convergence level is measured for the harmful substance management and the prevention of marine pollution.|$|R
50|$|The ship's officer {{must be able}} {{to oversee}} the <b>loading,</b> <b>stowage,</b> {{securing}} and unloading of cargoes. Requirements include understanding the care of cargo during the voyage.|$|R
50|$|As cargo officer, a {{chief mate}} oversees the <b>loading,</b> <b>stowage,</b> {{securing}} and unloading of cargoes. Moreover, the chief mate is {{accountable for the}} care of cargo during the voyage. This includes a general responsibility for the ship's stability and special care for cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful.|$|R
30|$|There {{are some}} {{operational}} port activities alliance carriers now do in concert to reduce overall operating costs and increase asset utilization. They include Joint Terminal Procurement where negotiations with port operators {{can be done}} to reduce costs for storage, security, container handling, refrigerated (reefer) container handling and the like (Glave et al., 2014). <b>Block</b> container <b>stowage</b> onboard for large volume customers and terminal based appointment systems have been put in place to maximize efficiency of terminal resources (Davies & Kieran, 2015). Joint rail vendor procurement and joint motor carrier procurement have also been put in place to better coordinate vessel arrival and cargo availability (Davies & Kieran, 2015).|$|R
40|$|Virtual Reality (VR) {{is a set}} of {{breakthrough}} technologies that allow a human being to enter and fully experience a 3 -dimensional, computer simulated environment. A true virtual reality experience meets three criteria: (1) It involves 3 -dimensional computer graphics; (2) It includes real-time feedback and response to user actions; and (3) It must provide a sense of immersion. Good examples of a virtual reality simulator are the flight simulators used by all branches of the military to train pilots for combat in high performance jet fighters. The fidelity of such simulators is extremely high [...] but so is the price tag, typically millions of dollars. Virtual reality teaching and training methods are manifestly effective, and we have therefore implemented a VR trainer for the International Space Welding Experiment. My {{role in the development of}} the ISWE trainer consisted of the following: (1) created texture-mapped models of the ISWE's rotating sample drum, technology <b>block,</b> tool <b>stowage</b> assembly, sliding foot restraint, and control panel; (2) developed C code for control panel button selection and rotation of the sample drum; (3) In collaboration with Tim Clark (Antares Virtual Reality Systems), developed a serial interface box for the PC and the SGI Indigo so that external control devices, similar to ones actually used on the ISWE, could be used to control virtual objects in the ISWE simulation; (4) In collaboration with Peter Wang (SFFP) and Mark Blasingame (Boeing), established the interference characteristics of the VIM 1000 head-mounted-display and tested software filters to correct the problem; (5) In collaboration with Peter Wang and Mark Blasingame, established software and procedures for interfacing the VPL DataGlove and the Polhemus 6 DOF position sensors to the SGI Indigo serial ports. The majority of the ISWE modeling effort was conducted on a PC-based VR Workstation, described below...|$|R
