5|$|Before one combat a {{beautiful}} young woman comes to him, claiming to be the daughter of a king, and offers him her love, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> refuses her.

Finally, she appears as a heifer {{at the head of the}} stampede, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> breaks her leg with another sling stone. After Cú Chulainn finally defeats Lóch, the Morrígan appears to him as an old woman milking a cow, with the same injuries he had given her in her animal forms. She gives him three drinks of milk, and with each drink he blesses her, healing her wounds.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1770s, Johnson {{had become}} an {{established}} publisher. Writers—particularly Dissenters—sought him out, and his home started to become the centre of a radical and stimulating intellectual milieu.
