30|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) is {{a unique}} {{material}} with semiconducting and piezoelectric dual properties. It {{is turning out to}} be a very important material due to its wide variety of potential applications in everyday life like sunscreens, miniaturized lasers, light sources, sensors, piezoelectric elements for power nano-generators, transparent electrodes [1] etc. ZnO has many advantages over other wide <b>bangap</b> semiconductors like direct band gap of 3.37 eV, large excitons binding energy of 60 meV, high thermal/chemical stabilities, and the option of wet chemical etching etc. [1, 2]. This has led to the demonstration of ZnO as an alternative material to the nitride semiconductors.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a systematic design study of nanowire Tunnel-FETs at LG= 17 nm employing a 3 D Poisson-NEGF solver {{based on a}} 8 × 8 k·p Hamiltonian and including phonon scattering. In particular: (a) we revisit the design of GaSb- InAs based hetero-junction tunnel-FETs showing that this system is unlikely to yield a broken <b>bangap</b> profile at the very narrow features necessary for a good sub-VT slope value; (b) we propose new design options for hetero-junction tunnel-FETs, relying {{on the use of}} strain and of a graded molar fraction (xM) in Alx MGa(1 −xM) Sb, which improve remarkably on current preserving optimal sub-VT slopes; (c) we show that interface defects can frustrate any design strategy aiming at sub-VT slope values below 60 mV/dec...|$|E
40|$|Near-field thermophotovoltaic (TPV) {{systems with}} {{carefully}} tailored emitter-PV properties show large promise {{for a new}} temperature range (600 – 1200 K) solid state energy conversion, where conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices cannot operate due to high temperatures and far-field TPV schemes suffer from low efficiency and power density. We present a detailed theoretical study of several different implementations of thermal emitters using plasmonic materials and graphene. We find that optimal improvements over the black body limit are achieved for low bandgap semiconductors and properly matched plasmonic frequencies. For a pure plasmonic emitter, theoretically predicted generated power density of 14 [W over cm[superscript 2]] and efficiency of 36 % can be achieved at 600 K (hot-side), for 0. 17 eV bandgap (InSb). Developing insightful approximations, we argue that large plasmonic losses can, contrary to intuition, be helpful in enhancing the overall near-field transfer. We discuss and quantify the properties of an optimal near-field photovoltaic (PV) diode. In addition, we study plasmons in graphene and show that doping {{can be used to}} tune the plasmonic dispersion relation to match the PV cell <b>bangap.</b> In case of graphene, theoretically predicted generated power density of 6 (120) [W over cm[superscript 2]] and efficiency of 35 (40) % can be achieved at 600 (1200) K, for 0. 17 eV bandgap. With the ability to operate in intermediate temperature range, as well as high efficiency and power density, near-field TPV systems have the potential to complement conventional TE and TPV solid state heat-to-electricity conversion devices...|$|E
40|$|Wide <b>bangap</b> GaN-based {{heterostructure}} {{devices are}} capable of delivering superior performance under extreme operating conditions including high voltage, high-temperature, high-frequency, high-power and chemically and mechanically harsh environment. Such a capability {{can be attributed to}} the intrinsic material properties including high electric breakdown field, high electron saturation velocity, low intrinsic carrier concentration, strong charge polarization, and strong chemical inertness. GaN electronic devices are emerging as the promising candidates for next-generation wireless power amplifiers, high-efficiency power converters and high-temperature sensors (e. g. gas, pressure sensors). This work focuses on the development of GaN device technologies for exploration of novel sensing and control ICs. The technologies developed in this work promise not only to deliver integrated sensors, but also provide on-chip sensing and control circuits that are promised to deliver optimized performance, increased functionality and enhanced reliability to the key functional blocks that operate under extreme conditions. Two integration technologies of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices with HEMT (high electron mobility transistor) on AlGaN/GaN heterostructure are proposed. The first one is a planar process with isolation achieved by fluorine plasma implantation. This approach not only is preferred in high-frequency SAW/HEMT circuits because of the smooth surface, but also eliminates the need of dry etching process which inevitably induces crystal damages. The second one is a novel SAW device featuring invisible (or transparent) 2 DEG interdigitated transducers (IDTs) instead of metallic IDTs. Thus the active sensing area can be placed on top of the 2 DEG IDTs rather than along the propagation path in the conventional SAW devices. A HEMT-compatible lateral-field effect rectifier (L-FER) with low turn-on voltage, low on-resistance, and high reverse breakdown is used for zero-bias RF mixer that features no dc bias, zero dc power consumption, low conversion loss, excellent linearity and high power handling capability. In addition, the good circuit performance has been achieved up to 250 ℃, exhibiting its usefulness in high-temperature wireless sensors that are finding increasing demand in industrial control, automotive and aviation systems, and petroleum exploration. Detailed temperature dependences of the L-FER are characterized and analyzed with an equivalent circuit model. An integration platform for GaN smart power chip technology is proposed. Fully integrated voltage reference generator and temperature-compensated comparator circuits are demonstrated with excellent stability in wide range of operating temperature (up to 250 ℃) and low power consumption [...] - a performance that exceeds the capability of Si CMOS technologies...|$|E
40|$|As {{technology}} advances, so {{does the}} quality of treatment offered to cancer patients. Proton therapy, and more specifically proton pencil beam scanning, is currently {{at the forefront of}} radiation therapy. Pencil beam scanning offers excellent tumor dose control as well as surrounding organs at risk sparing. Current treatment planning, however, is performed on a static image acquired before treatment. Naturally, this is not a proper representation of the actual patient on a daily basis. Thus, {{there is a need for}} adaptive radiation therapy, such as readjusting a given treatment plan based on the patient’s daily setup or a moving tumor location. In order to perform adaptive treatment delivery, appropriate imaging as well as an extremely fast, yet accurate, dose computation engine is needed. GEANT 4 Monte Carlo simulations were performed in order to assess the imaging capabilities and limitations of a proton radiography detector, comparing them to conventional X-ray imaging. In parallel, a small form factor proton radiography system was designed based on available technologies. Thus, photonic bandgap fibers, a CMOS active pixel sensor, and Bicron scintillating fibers were evaluated for proton imaging purposes. The requisites and limitations of treatment planning for proton pencil beam scanning were further defined, from the acquisition of the treatment planning software’s beam model to the methodologies and treatment robustness. Based on this work, a simplified Monte Carlo algorithm was designed and implemented on the CPU architecture. This computation engine, GMC, was validated against physical observables and then compared to the treatment planning software dose calculation, as well as a ”full” Monte Carlo recomputation. Proton radiography showed poor spatial resolution but excellent density resolution when compared to X-ray radiography. This density resolution can be of importance when attempting to perform tumor tracking. The lower imaging dose associated with proton radiography is also of interest, especially in pediatric patients. Moreover, the use of a unique beam’s eye view could slightly improve the accuracy of treatment delivery. Photonic <b>bangap</b> fibers, as well as the specific CMOS active pixel sensor used in this work, did not yield promising results for proton imaging. Conversely, Bicron scintillating fibers proved to be suitable for the design of a proton radiography system, as both the individual particle’s position and energy could be acquired. The treatment planning software’s beam model is very simple, as compared to other modalities. However, the planning stage presented a few limitations, such as a lack of robustness analysis and issues related to spot placement. It was shown that both of these issues could be addressed with the use of a fast, yet accurate, dose computation engine. GMC was successfully implemented on the CPU architecture, and compared extremely well against actual pre-treatment QA measurements. The comparisons against the current algorithm of the treatment planning software and the full Monte Carlo engine matched the expectations for such an algorithm. The complementing work on proton imaging and fast dose computation algorithm lays a solid foundation to materializing pencil beam scanning adaptive radiotherapy. Future work will focus on generating the necessary synergy between the two systems in order to implement the tools in the clinical setting...|$|E
