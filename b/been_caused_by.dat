5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes are short enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day.

In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities.
