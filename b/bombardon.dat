2500|$|The Bombardons {{were large}} [...] by [...] cross-shaped {{floating}} breakwaters fabricated in steel that were anchored outside the main breakwaters {{that consisted of}} Gooseberries (block ships) and Phoenixes (concrete caissons). 24 <b>bombardon</b> units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, would create a [...] breakwater. During the storms {{at the end of}} June 1944 some Bombardons broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage to the harbours than the storm itself. The design of the Bombardons was the responsibility of the Royal Navy while the Royal Engineers were responsible for the design {{of the rest of the}} Mulberry harbour equipment.|$|E

25|$|The {{destruction}} at Omaha was so {{bad that}} the entire harbour was deemed irreparable. 21 of the 28 Phoenix caisson were completely destroyed, the <b>Bombardons</b> were cast adrift, and the roadways and piers smashed.|$|R
50|$|Later that summer, Lochner and {{his fellow}} {{scientists}} flew to Canada for the Quebec Conference to report {{the progress of the}} harbours to Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. The decision to go ahead was taken and full-scale trials of the floating breakwater started in April 1944. During the trial, an onshore gale produced heavy seas, but Robert's <b>bombardons</b> calmed the waves effectively.|$|R
25|$|Arriving {{first on}} D-Day itself were the <b>Bombardons</b> {{followed}} {{a day later}} by the first blockship. The first Phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the Gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued {{to be used for}} landing vehicles and stores using Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.|$|R

25|$|On 2 September 1943 the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{estimated}} that the artificial ports (Mulberries) would need to handle 12,000 tons per day, exclusive of motor transport and in all weathers. On 4 September the go ahead was given to start work immediately on the harbours. However, infighting between the War Office and the Admiralty over responsibility was only resolved on 15 December 1943 by {{the intervention of the}} Vice-Chiefs of Staff. The decision was that the Admiralty managed the blockships, <b>Bombardons</b> and assembly of all constituent parts on the south coast of England. Further the Admiralty would undertake all necessary work to survey, site, tow and mark navigation.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrumentation}} of the Royal Artillery Band in Aldershot came {{largely from}} the Royal Artillery Brass Band (formerly under the charge of Lawson), and consisted of 8 cornets, 3 tenor horns, two baritones, 2 E-Flat <b>bombardons,</b> and 1 pair of kettledrums. To this, 5 woodwinds, including E-Flat 'clarionette' and piccolo were added. All of the musicians were required to become proficient on stringed instruments - a required condition that has remained in all Royal Artillery bands from 1887 to the current day. In 1897 the 'mounted portion' of the Royal Artillery Band was disbanded, leaving the Aldershot band to fulfil all remaining mounted ceremonial duties. During the tour of New Zealand, by the Royal Artillery (Woolwich) Band (May 1913 - March 1914), approximately half of that band remained in London to provide an orchestra. Interestingly, the RA Bands Committee chose to allow Mr Henry Sims and the Royal Artillery Mounted Band to fulfill the London concerts at Queen's Hall, although the strings were actually augmented by those string players remaining in Woolwich. Orchestral music {{in all of the}} Royal Artillery's bands has always been maintained as an important, and integral feature of the Regiment's music, and the string sections in general, have always comprised mainly those musicians, whose primary instruments were/are stringed instruments. Likewise, primary brass, woodwind, and percussion players, would specialize in the military band ensembles. On 17 May 1913 The Royal Artillery Mounted Band gave the first performance {{at the opening of the}} new bandstand, at the riverside promenade (The Groves) in Chester.|$|R
60|$|The Earl of Carbury was a youngish {{man with}} no sort of turn for being a nobleman. He could {{not bring himself to}} behave as if he was anybody in particular; and though this passed for perfect {{breeding}} whenever he by chance appeared in his place in society, on the magisterial bench, or in the House of Lords, it prevented him from making the most of the earldom, and was a standing grievance with his relatives, many of whom were the most impudent and uppish people {{on the face of the}} earth. He was, if he had only known it, a born republican, with no natural belief in earls at all; but as he was rather too modest to indulge his consciousness with broad generalizations of this kind, all he knew about the matter was that he was sensible of being a bad hand at his hereditary trade of territorial aristocrat. At a very early age he had disgraced himself by asking his mother whether he might be a watchmaker when he grew up, and his feeble sense on that occasion of the impropriety of an earl being anything whatsoever except an earl had given his mother an imperious contempt for him which afterward got curiously mixed with a salutary dread of his moral superiority to her, which was considerable. His aspiration to become a watchmaker was an early symptom of his extraordinary turn for mechanics. An apprenticeship of six years at the bench would have made an educated workman of him: as it was, he pottered at every mechanical pursuit as a gentleman amateur in a laboratory and workshop which he had got built for himself in his park. In this magazine of toys--for such it virtually was at first--he satisfied his itchings to play with tools and machines. He was no sportsman; but if he saw in a shop window the most trumpery patent improvement in a breechloader, he would go in and buy it; and as to a new repeating rifle or liquefied gas gun, he would travel to St. Petersburg to see it. He wrote very little; but he had sixteen different typewriters, each guaranteed perfect by an American agent, who had also pledged himself that the other fifteen were miserable impostures. A really ingenious bicycle or tricycle always found in him a ready purchaser; and he had patented a roller skate and a railway brake. When the electric chair for dental operations was invented, he sacrificed a tooth to satisfy his curiosity as to its operation. He could not play brass instruments to any musical purpose; but his collection of double slide trombones, <b>bombardons</b> with patent compensating pistons, comma trumpets, and the like, would have equipped a small military band; whilst his newly tempered harmonium with fifty-three notes to each octave, and his pianos with simplified keyboards that nobody could play on, were the despair of all musical amateurs who came to stay at Towers Cottage, as his place was called. He would buy the most expensive and elaborate lathe, and spend a month trying to make a true billiard ball at it. At the end of that time he would have to send for a professional hand, who would cornet the ball with apparently miraculous skill in a few seconds. He got on better with chemistry and photography; but at last he settled down to electrical engineering, and, giving up the idea of doing everything with his own half-trained hand, kept a skilled man always in his laboratory to help him out.|$|R

50|$|Les Ramoneurs de menhirs is a Breton celtic punk group {{formed in}} 2006. Its members include Éric Gorce on the <b>bombardon,</b> Richard Bévillon on the bagpipes, the {{traditional}} vannetais singer Gwenaël Kere and Loran, guitarist {{from the group}} Bérurier Noir. They play concerts at fest noz as well as normal rock concerts. Most of their songs are sung in Breton.|$|E
50|$|In 1922, Austrian {{composer}} Alban Berg {{included a}} short on-stage accordion part in his landmark opera Wozzeck, Op. 7. The instrument—marked Ziehharmonika bzw. Akkordeon in the score appears {{only during the}} tavern garden (wirthausgarten) scene, along with an on-stage (Bühnenmusik) ensemble consisting of two fiddles (violins tuned up a tone), one clarinet in C, one guitar and one <b>bombardon</b> in F (or bass tuba), to lend a touch of authenticity to the deutsche Biergarten setting.|$|E
50|$|It was {{now that}} he began to study acoustics, in order to correct the {{deficiencies}} in military musical instruments. As the result, he improved the valves of the brass instruments, and succeeded, by constructing them on sounder acoustic principles, in greatly increasing the volume and purity of their tone. He also invented the bass tuba or <b>bombardon</b> in order to give greater richness and power to the bass parts. In recognition of these inventions he was, in 1835, honoured by the Royal Academy of Berlin.|$|E

50|$|Olaiya {{was born}} on 31 December 1930, in Calabar, Cross River State, the 20th child {{of a family of}} 24. His parents, Alfred Omolona Olaiya and Bathsheba Owolabi Motajo, came from Ijesha-Ishu in Ekiti State. Olaiya came from a very rich family. His father's house called Ilọijọs Bar stood on 2 Bamgbose Street, Lagos Island, until it was {{demolished}} on September 11, 2016. At an early age he learned to play the <b>Bombardon</b> and the French Horn. After leaving school he moved to Lagos, where he passed the school certificate examination in 1951 and was accepted by Howard University, US, to study civil engineering. Olaiya instead pursued a career as a musician, to the disapproval of his parents. He played with the Sammy Akpabot Band, was leader and trumpeter for the Old Lagos City Orchestra and joined the Bobby Benson Jam Session Orchestra.|$|E
5000|$|A tuba {{with its}} tubing wrapped for placing the {{instrument}} on the player's lap is usually called a concert tuba {{or simply a}} tuba. Tubas with the bell pointing forward (pavillon tournant) instead of upward are often called recording tubas because of their popularity {{in the early days}} of recorded music, as their sound could more easily be directed at the recording microphone. When wrapped to surround the body for cavalry bands on horseback or marching, it is traditionally known as a hélicon. The modern sousaphone, named after American bandmaster John Philip Sousa, resembles a hélicon with the bell pointed up (in the original models as the J. W. Pepper prototype and Sousa's concert instruments) and then curved to point forward (as developed by Conn and others). Some ancestors of the tuba, such as the military <b>bombardon,</b> had unusual valve and bore arrangements compared to modern tubas.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of valves, the single F horn proved difficult {{for use in the}} highest range, where the partials grew closer and closer, making accuracy a great challenge. An early solution was simply to use a single horn of higher pitch—usually in B. Late in the nineteenth century a new design was worked out by the German horn maker Ed. Kruspe (namesake of his family's brass instrument firm), in collaboration with a nephew of the horn player F. A. Gumbert, who introduced a prototype of the [...] "double horn" [...] in Markneukirchen in 1897. The French maker Pierre Louis Gautrot, in the meantime, had been experimenting along similar lines from 1858 onwards. In 1864 he patented his [...] "système équitonique", originally conceived not for the horn but rather as a [...] "compensating system" [...] to correct the intonation of the lowest notes of the euphonium and the <b>bombardon.</b> It was eventually applied also to the horn, but the extra weight and cost proved excessive. Although the French firm Jérôme Thibouville-Lamy in about 1928 introduced a piston-valved double-horn with ascending third valve, designed in collaboration with the horn player Louis Vuillermoz, the double horn has continued to be identified mainly as a German horn.|$|E
