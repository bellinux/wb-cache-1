50|$|Cold-weather {{battery holder}} was {{available}} from 1969 and minor changes {{were applied to}} the appearance. The cold-weather battery holder allowed the relocation of the battery by using a long cord with a dummy <b>battery</b> <b>carrier</b> and receptacle for the original battery holder to then {{be placed in a}} warm pocket to avoid battery failure due to cold. Along with the availability macro lenses for close work, a selection of extension tubes and in both the standard bayonet and the outer bayonet were available as well. As well as a compact and convenient variable extension was also available. For more flexibility a bellows system was available as well as a slide copier accessory.|$|E
40|$|The battery {{systems of}} {{electrified}} vehicles are characterised by increasing weight due to larger battery modules. A lightweight <b>battery</b> <b>carrier</b> structure {{can reduce the}} system weight by replacing heavy metallic housing components by materials like fibre-reinforced plastics (FRP) and aluminum. The battery housing has to meet several requirements, e. g. stiffness, crash and intrusion protection, proof of leakage and thermal management. Present battery housings are manufactured using pressure die-cast aluminum in combination with steel carrier structures and are cooled actively. A novel approach is a lightweight hybrid battery housing consisting of a thermoformed FRP as stiff outer shell and an integrated closed cell aluminum foam infiltrated with phase-change-material for passive thermal management. This multi-material setup enables substitution of functionally separated systems in one intelligent solution. In the Open Hybrid LabFactory an entire process chain was built up including the aluminum foaming process, the thermoforming of FRP with heating and consolidating {{as well as the}} integrated forming and joining process of FRP with aluminum foam. With the goal of application-orientated research, a battery housing of an existing electric car was used to define requirements such as design space and mechanical specifications. Based on parameter studies an optimised process setup was achieved, which will be described in this paper...|$|E

40|$|We are in {{the process}} of {{developing}} multifunctional load-bearing structural batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). The battery system not only stores electricity for vehicle propulsion, but also reduces impact forces for the EVs getting into crash loading conditions functioning as a shock absorber, thus decreasing the impact shock to the vehicle occupants for increased safety. Our research focuses on two EV battery systems: Granular Battery Assembly (GBA) and Topologically Interlocked Battery Assembly (TIBA). In GBA, the term “Granular” originated from the recent findings on the granular mechanics. Parab et al. [1] demonstrated the fundamental mechanism of impact energy dissipation with the pulverization of a sand particle in the granular load chain, where the pulverized sand particle interrupted the transmission of impact loads and forced the rearrangement of the remaining grains. Our GBA research extended the concept of granular load chains to the battery cell arrangement with the use of “sacrificing cells” that effectively limit the impact load propagation speed, thus isolating the mechanical impact shock. In TIBA, our research focuses on the use of topologically interlocked materials (TIMs). Mather et al. [2] showed the basic mechanism behind TIMs, where the nonbonded platonic solids were assembled and kept their structural integrity by the neighboring solids. Upon impact, these solids rub against each other, thus dissipating energy by friction. Our TIBA research transformed the application of topological interlocking as a design principle for EV battery pack in such a way that truncated tetrahedra, as either battery cells or <b>battery</b> <b>carriers,</b> created TIBA, a multifunctional structural battery system that has both the capability to dissipate impact energy and resistance to fracture propagation. Following the numerical analysis, quasistatic and dynamic impact mechanical responses were examined in the experiment. In each analysis, the experimental behaviors of the battery systems were compared against the numerical results to confirm the validity of the numerical models. Furthermore, we added a “Base” model, which has neither GBA nor TIBA to reduce the impact force, in order for us to compare against the GBA and TIBA results and to examine the improvement that the two EV battery systems delivered.

40|$|Common igneous and {{high-grade}} {{metamorphic rocks}} contain dormant defects, which release electronic charge carriers when stressed. Rocks thereby {{behave like a}} <b>battery.</b> The charge <b>carriers</b> of interest are defect electrons h¿, e. g. electronic states associated with O¿ in a matrix of O 2 ¿.

50|$|The French 75 {{gave its}} best {{performances}} during the Battle of the Marne in August-September 1914 and at Verdun in 1916. At {{the time the}} contribution of 75 mm artillery to these military successes, and thus to the French victories that ensued, was seen as significant. In the case of Verdun, over 1,000 French 75s (250 batteries) were constantly in action, night and day, on the battlefield {{during a period of}} nearly nine months. The total consumption of 75 mm shells at Verdun during the period February 21 to September 30, 1916, is documented by the public record at the Service Historique de l'Armée de Terre to have been in excess of 16 million rounds, or nearly 70% of all shells fired by French artillery during that battle. The French 75 was a devastating anti-personnel weapon against waves of infantry attacking in the open, as at the Marne and Verdun. However, its shells were comparatively light and lacked the power to obliterate trench works, concrete bunkers and deeply buried shelters. Thus, with time, the French 75 batteries became routinely used to cut corridors with high-explosive shells, across the belts of German barbed wire. After 1916, the 75 <b>batteries</b> became the <b>carriers</b> of choice to deliver toxic gas shells, including mustard gas and phosgene.|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of aircraft model technology, quadcopters equipped with cameras are more frequently used for aerial video. Cell phones, moreover, allow people to share photos online immediately, so many people prefer to take photos or videos by cell phones instead of expensive cameras. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} project is to design and build a light weight quadcopter frame and select the system components that allow the quadcopter to fly smoothly while carrying a cell phone for aerial video. The method for creating the quadcopter is separated into three steps: design, build, and test. The design part includes frame design on the SolidWorks and Thrust/Weight ratio calculation with a safety factor of 1. 0 to 1. 5. The build consists of a center plate made of carbon fiber plate. Aluminum sheet metal arms are formed into a U-shape and attached to the plate. A drill press, treadle shear, and manual turret punch are used during the building process. The remaining parts, such as cellphone <b>carrier,</b> <b>battery,</b> motors, speed controller, and control board were purchased after the analysis. The frame and electric parts were assembled with screws, nuts, and glue. During the testing section, two different propellers are tested to determine which size and type provide maximum thrust with the least battery consumption. Additional testing will evaluate stability of flight and payload capacity...|$|R
40|$|A novel gas chromatograph-mass {{spectrometer}} (GC-MS) {{based on}} a miniature toroidal ion trap mass analyzer (TMS) and a low thermal mass GC is described. The TMS system has an effective mass/charge (m/z) range of 50 – 442 with mass resolution at full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 0. 55 at m/z 91 and 0. 80 at m/z 222. A solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber mounted in a simple syringe-style holder is used for sample collection and introduction into a specially designed low thermal mass GC injection port. This portable GC-TMS system weighs < 13 kg (28 lb), including <b>batteries</b> and helium <b>carrier</b> gas cartridge, and is totally self-contained within dimensions of 47 × 36 × 18 cm (18. 5 × 14 × 7 in.). System start-up takes about 3 min and sample analysis with library matching typically takes about 5 min, including time for column cool-down. Peak power consumption during sample analysis is about 80 W. Battery power and helium supply cartridges allow 50 and 100 consecutive analyses, respectively. Both can be easily replaced. An on-board library of target analytes is used to provide detection and identification of chemical compounds based on their characteristic retention times and mass spectra. The GC-TMS can detect 200 pg of methyl salicylate on-column. n-Butylbenzene and naphthalene can be detected at a concentration of 100 ppt in water from solid-phase microextraction (SPME) analysis of the headspace.

40|$|The Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) is {{conducting}} a technical program to develop and prototype disposable flexible blast dosimeter tapes to detect the occurrence of events that cause traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a medical condition that is cumulative and triggered by events such as blast pressure waves, noise, acceleration and possibly also extremely bright light. The sensor tape has integrated sensors, signal conditioning electronics, non-volatile memory and a thin film battery. In {{order to meet the}} low cost target of the tapes, fabrication techniques such as inkjet printing, laser machining and lamination are employed with all deposition and patterning steps been compatible with future roll-to-roll manufacturing, as schematically shown in Figure 1. Inkjet printing is used because it is a non-contact technique and is the printing method that allows the most accurate registration from layer to layer. (1) In addition, the sensors require membranes and spacers; therefore contact printing methods would not be appropriated. Inkjet printing requires the use of solution-processed materials, which leads us to organic based materials and inorganic nanoparticles that can be printed from solution.

40|$|The common single-nucleotide {{polymorphism}} (SNP) brain-derived {{neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) valine-to-methionine substitution at codon 66 (Val 66 Met) {{has been associated with}} differences in memory functions and cortical plasticity following brain stimulation. Other studies could not confirm these results, though, and potential interactions of BDNF carrier status with other learning-relevant SNPs are largely unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of BDNF Val 66 Met genotype on paired associative stimulation (PAS) -induced motor cortex plasticity, while additionally taking catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val 158 Met and kidney and brain (KIBRA) rs 17070145 carrier status into account. Therefore, a cohort of 2 × 16 age- and education-matched healthy young females underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation using an excitatory PAS 25 protocol to induce cortical plasticity. Cognitive performance was assessed using implicit grammar- and motor-learning tasks and a detailed neuropsychological test <b>battery.</b> While BDNF <b>carrier</b> status alone did not significantly influence PAS-induced cortical plasticity, we found a significant BDNF × COMT interaction, showing higher plasticity immediately following the PAS 25 protocol for the BDNF Val/Val vs Met genotype in COMT Met homozygotes only (ANOVA, p = 0. 027). A similar advantage for this group was noted for implicit grammar learning (ANOVA, p = 0. 021). Accounting for KIBRA rs 17070145 did not explain significant variance. Our findings for the first time demonstrate an interaction of BDNF by COMT on human cortical plasticity. Moreover, they show that genotype-related differences in neurophysiology translate into behavioral differences. These findings might contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms of interindividual differences in cognition...|$|R
40|$|Porous metal-organic {{framework}} materials (MOFs) {{have found}} exceptional {{interest in the}} engineering and medical communities, due to a large spectrum of valuable properties. These materials may bring solutions to pressing environmental issues, such as gas storage media, new type <b>batteries,</b> or <b>carriers</b> for medical drugs. However, not all MOFs fulfil the specific requirements for these applications, yet may be suitable for alternative applications. In agriculture, for example, increasing soil acidification requires urgent attention. Use of MOFs as innovative slow-release fertilisers may contribute to soil alkalinisation, soil fertility and improved N and P fertiliser use efficiency. This thesis seeks to provide a proof of concept for optimal production, and mode of action for just such a fertiliser: a structure built by plant nutrients N, P and Fe, plus oxalate, which is decomposed by soil bacteria, thereby releasing the nutrients to the soil environment for plant uptake. The structural oxalate provides a source of carbon and energy for oxalotrophic bacteria through adequate solubility in soil solution, which enables biomineralisation of carbonate via the oxalate-carbonate pathway, resulting in increased soil pH. This thesis presents the successful hydrothermal synthesis, with urea as structure-directing agent (SDA), and synthesis optimisation of a mixed-valence iron-based oxalate-phosphate-amine framework (OPA-MOF; C 8 Fe 8 N 16 O 52 P 8), which crystallizes in a Pccm centrosymmetric system. Corner-sharing FeO 6 - and PO 4 - units are connected by the oxalate ligand in two directions, forming a macro-porous framework, which carries ammonium from decomposed urea as guests. Optimal production factors were defined from a full factorial 42 + 1 design, and response surface method (RSM), which produced a saddle-ridged optimum function for desirability. Two additional experiments confirmed the robust model. The OPA-MOF displays all properties required for application as fertiliser: high product yields of suitable purity, nutrient contents, and oxalate solubility. The material’s fertilising capacities were tested in a pot trial growing wheat, which showed increased grain yields (compared to unfertilised controls and urea fertilisation), and an unprecedented long-lasting nitrification inhibition effect. Due to a short trial period no soil pH increase could be detected, and P remained limiting for maximum yields. However, microbiological investigations confirmed presence of oxalotrophic bacteria, {{and their ability to}} consume OPA-MOF. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) reveals that even after 22 weeks exposure to the soil environment the OPA-MOF particles are almost intact, which suggests that any decomposition of the material is very slow, affording a long-term presence of the incorporated plant nutrients in the soil. The successful proof of concept warrants long-term trials to investigate potential soil alkalinising and P-fertilising effects...|$|R
25|$|The 24th Battalion defended a {{position}} near Elasson. The road out of Elasson forked into two branches {{and ran for}} three miles across a level plain. The eastern branch then climbed abruptly over a steep ridge. The western branch made a wider loop to Tyrnavos that was suitable for armoured vehicles. As a result of this, B Company was detached under command of the 25th Battalion for its defence. The other companies made positions on the east road with C Company on the right, D Company on the centre and A Company on the left on a ridge overlooking the plain of Elasson. The ridge was rocky, which meant that trenches could not be dug and the troops could only build rock walls. Three sections of the Carrier Platoon were detached on 17 April to Tyrnavos to protect a troop of 25 pdr guns. On 18 April, German tanks attacked. The remaining Bren Gun Carriers were on the plain, but were withdrawn to the rear under fire from both Australian and German <b>batteries.</b> After the <b>carriers</b> were in the rear, the east road was blown. However, the explosives had practically {{no effect on the}} road, but {{there was no time to}} bring up more explosives, so the road was left in that state. At dusk, 40 German tanks and 20 troop carrying lorries came out of Elasson and advanced along the east road. They were shelled by Australian artillery, dispersing the lorries. The tanks stopped at the road crater as the battalion withdrew down the road at night to Nea Anchialos on the Gulf of Volos. The third platoon of D Company engaged the tanks without much success with a Boys anti-tank rifle in the dark. Facing German air attacks, the battalion foot marched and then motor marched to {{a position}} slightly south of Molos.|$|R
