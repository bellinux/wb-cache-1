25|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is widely}} used {{as a source of}} renewable energy. The process produces a biogas, consisting of methane, carbon dioxide and traces of other ‘contaminant’ gases. This biogas can be used directly as fuel, in combined heat and power gas engines or upgraded to natural gas-quality <b>biomethane.</b> The nutrient-rich digestate also produced can be used as fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Biogas grid-{{injection}} is {{the injection}} of biogas into {{the natural gas}} grid.
