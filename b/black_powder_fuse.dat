50|$|A quick match or piped {{match is}} a type of <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> <b>fuse</b> that burns very quickly, some {{hundreds}} of feet per second. They consist of black match covered with a loose paper wrap (pipe). When lit, the flame propagates quickly down the paper pipe from the hot gases produced by the burning powder. Quick matches are used in professional fireworks displays to pass fire nearly instantly between devices that must be physically separated while firing simultaneously, such as a finale rack. Devices which should fire in sequence can be branched from a single master fuse, consisting of quick match spliced onto Visco fuses of various length for time delays.|$|E
50|$|Ignition of a {{thermite}} reaction normally requires a sparkler or easily obtainable magnesium ribbon, but may require persistent efforts, as ignition can be unreliable and unpredictable. These temperatures cannot be reached with conventional <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> <b>fuses,</b> nitrocellulose rods, detonators, pyrotechnic initiators, or other common igniting substances. Even when the thermite is {{hot enough to}} glow bright red, it will not ignite as it must be at or near white-hot to initiate the reaction. It is possible to start the reaction using a propane torch if done correctly.|$|R
5000|$|About 380 {{women and}} girls worked in the plant's [...] "F" [...] Building. The company had placed {{newspaper}} ads specifically recruiting [...] "girls" [...] for the job. The building had three divisions: the pellet room, where girls made the <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> <b>fuses</b> that ran {{through the center of}} the shrapnel shells; the loading room, where the fuses were inserted and [...] "pocket cups" [...] at the bottom of the shells were filled with loose powder; and the inspection room, where the finished product was inspected. Normally only about thirty girls worked in the pellet room, but two weeks earlier the company had hired about seventy more to fill a large rush order that was due to be shipped in a few days.|$|R
2500|$|To carve a tunnel, {{one worker}} held a rock drill on the granite face while {{one to two}} other workers swung eighteen-pound sledgehammers to {{sequentially}} hit the drill which slowly advanced into the rock. Once the hole was about [...] deep, it would be filled with <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> a <b>fuse</b> set and then ignited from a safe distance. Nitroglycerin, which had been invented less than two decades before {{the construction of the}} first transcontinental railroad, was used in relatively large quantities during its construction. [...] This was especially true on the Central Pacific Railroad, which owned its own nitroglycerin plant to ensure it had a steady supply of the volatile explosive. This plant was operated by Chinese laborers as they were willing workers even under the most trying and dangerous of conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Brooke's rifles fired both armor-piercing and {{explosive}} {{shells of}} his own design. The former were solid cylindrical projectiles with a blunt or flat nose to reduce {{the chance of a}} ricochet, and were often referred in contemporary accounts as [...] "bolts". The latter were hollow cylinders with rounded or pointed noses. They were filled with <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> with a <b>fuse</b> set to detonate a variable amount of time after being fired. His smoothbores used spherical solid shot for armored targets and hollow spherical explosive shells against unarmored targets.|$|R
50|$|A <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> {{substitute}} is {{a replacement}} for <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> used in muzzleloading and cartridge firearms. <b>Black</b> <b>powder</b> substitutes offer a number of advantages over <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> primarily including reduced sensitivity as an explosive and increased efficiency as a propellant powder.|$|R

50|$|Hodgdon's {{product line}} {{includes}} Pyrodex and Triple Seven, which are modern substitutes for <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> and {{intended for use}} in muzzleloaders and certain antique firearms. Consequences of <b>black</b> <b>powder's</b> easy ignition by sparks or static electricity make manufacture and storage hazardous. The sole factory of the United States' largest 20th-century <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> manufacturer was closed by an accidental explosion as 1970 legislation established new regulations discouraging merchants from stocking <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> for sale. Future historical re-enactments with replica firearms appeared doubtful until Hodgdon introduced <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> substitute Pyrodex in 1975 with <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> combustion characteristics and smokeless powder safety.|$|R
50|$|By {{property}} insurance and federal transportation regulations, <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> substitutes {{also can be}} transported and stored in interstate commerce in the United States using smokeless powder regulations, instead of the much more restrictive <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> regulations. Because of this, <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> substitutes are thus becoming more commonly available than traditional <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> which has largely vanished from the shelves of most retailers.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> Cartridge Rifle (BPCR) {{refers to}} modern {{shooting}} sports which employ <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> cartridge rifles. These firearms, often {{of the type}} referred to as [...] "buffalo rifles", are single-shot firearms using a fixed metallic catridge containing <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> which launches heavy projectiles at relatively low velocity.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]450/400 <b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> Express was a <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> rifle {{cartridge}} that {{was produced in}} two case lengths, 2⅜-inches and 3¼-inches.|$|R

50|$|An early {{problem was}} that there was no means of {{precisely}} measuring the time to detonation — reliable fuses did not yet exist and the burning time of the <b>powder</b> <b>fuse</b> was subject to considerable trial and error. Early <b>powder</b> burning <b>fuses</b> had to be loaded fuse down to be ignited by firing or a portfire put down the barrel to light the fuse. Other shells were wrapped in bitumen cloth, which would ignite during the firing and in turn ignite a <b>powder</b> <b>fuse.</b> Nevertheless, shells came into regular use in the 16th Century, for example a 1543 English mortar shell was filled with 'wildfire'.|$|R

25|$|In quarrying, high {{explosives}} {{are generally}} preferred for shattering rock. However, {{because of its}} low brisance, <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> causes fewer fractures and results in more usable stone compared to other explosives, making <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> useful for blasting monumental stone such as granite and marble. <b>Black</b> <b>powder</b> is well suited for blank rounds, signal flares, burst charges, and rescue-line launches. <b>Black</b> <b>powder</b> is also used in fireworks for lifting shells, in rockets as fuel, and in certain special effects.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]500 Nitro for <b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> {{cartridge}} {{used the}} same general case type as the [...]500 <b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> Express but was loaded with cordite instead of <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> and {{appeared on the scene}} sometime in the 1890s. The cartridge was intended for firearms designed to fire the [...]500 <b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> Express and pressures were kept low enough so as to operate safely in these older black-powder firearms yet provided a substantial increase in performance over the black-powder-loaded cartridge.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} with <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> BPN burns significantly hotter and leaves more of solid residues, therefore <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> is favored for multiple-use systems.|$|R

5000|$|Hodgdon's Pyrodex was {{the first}} widely {{available}} substitute on the market. Pyrodex is less sensitive to ignition than <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> and uses the same shipping and storage guidelines as smokeless powder. Pyrodex is more energetic per unit of mass than <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> but it is less dense, and can be substituted at a 1:1 ratio by volume for <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> in many applications. [...] Pyrodex is similar in composition to <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> consisting primarily of charcoal, sulfur, and potassium nitrate, but it also contains graphite and potassium perchlorate, plus additional ingredients protected by trade secret. Originally available as loose powder in two granularities, RS (Rifle/Shotgun) equal to FFG <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> and P (Pistol) equal to FFFg <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> Pyrodex is now becoming available in Select and solid pellet varieties. While Pyrodex offers improved safety and increased efficiency (in terms of shots per pound of <b>powder)</b> over <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> the level of fouling is similar; Pyrodex is caustic and corrosive. Therefore, the same cleaning regime used on black-powder fouling must be employed when Pyrodex has been used.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]450 <b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> Express {{also known}} as the [...]450 3¼-inch BPE was a popular <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> {{cartridge}} in the late 19th and early 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|Pyrodex, {{and most}} other <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> substitutes, are {{formulated}} to be a volume-for-volume equivalent of <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> not an equivalent mass-for-mass (weight-for-weight). Pyrodex is measured by volumetric measurement techniques, not in grains on a scale, due to the difference in density of Pyrodex versus <b>black</b> <b>powder.</b> For example, to measure a [...] "60 grain equivalent" [...] of Hodgdon's Pyrodex suitable {{for use in a}} muzzleloader rifle, one uses a volumetric measure that produces a volume of Pyrodex equal to the volume of a mass of 60 grains of <b>black</b> <b>powder.</b> Due to Pyrodex being less dense than <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> a measurement by weight on a scale of 60 grains of mass of Pyrodex would be near a 30 percent overload.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]45 BPM can be handloaded using a [...]460 S&W Magnum brass casing, a {{standard}} large pistol primer, from 40 grains <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> with filler {{as necessary to}} avoid air gaps on up to 60 grains <b>black</b> <b>powder.</b> A typical bullet would consist of soft lead from 150 to 250 grains in weight with a <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> appropriate lubricant in the groove(s).|$|R
40|$|Preventing <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> {{contamination}} from damaging a gas pipeline’s {{metering system}} requires regular dismantling and cleaning of its metering instruments, manifolds, impulse lines, and associated facilities. Determining which cleaning method to apply, however, requires gathering comprehensive {{information about the}} nature of the <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> problem. Only then can the operator determine which technique will provide the most efficient and cost-effective method of removing <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> from gas installations. Background Solid contaminants—known as black powder—found in natural gas transmission and distribution systems are a cause of increasing concern in the global natural gas industry. Chemical or biological reactions with steel found in natural gas pipelines, gas wells, and associated facilities can create <b>black</b> <b>powder.</b> Operators can detect <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> in both dry and wet gas pipelines and in conjunction with other contaminants such as oil, grease, liquid hydrocarbons, and sand. 1 <b>Black</b> <b>powder</b> influences the flow performance of gas pipelines and can also impair the function of valves and measurement systems, requiring the development of specifi...|$|R

30|$|Commercial carbon <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> (N 115) was {{supplied}} by Qingdao Degussa Company, Qingdao, China. To obtain stable nanofluids, the original carbon <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> was pretreated as follows: 15 g of original carbon <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> and 300 ml 30 % H 2 O 2 were added into a round-bottomed flask and heated to boiling under magnetic stirring. The reaction {{was carried out}} under stirring and boiling for 5 h. Then the mixture was filtrated at room temperature and dried at 100 °C. Pretreated carbon <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> was obtained by repeating the process twice. Then the pretreated carbon <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> was ground and dispersed into distilled water under ultrasonic vibration for 1 h. Carbon black nanofluids of different particle volume fractions were prepared by adjusting {{the amount of carbon}} black and water.|$|R

5000|$|Modern musket {{designs are}} also available, {{such as those}} made by Thompson Center, though they are often just called [...] "muzzle loaders" [...] or [...] "black powder rifles" [...] instead of [...] "muskets". These are {{typically}} used by hunters during hunting seasons specifically for <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> muzzle loaders. They often use <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> pellets instead of loose <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> and more modern projectiles such as sabots and maxi-balls.|$|R
50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>powder</b> is {{the oldest}} {{composite}} propellant. Its use in rockets preceded its use in guns. The three main components of <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> are charcoal, sulphur, and saltpetre (or potassium nitrate). It is known that by 1045, the Chinese were producing <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> because many references to the subject were found in The Wu-ching Tsung-yao (Complete Compendium of Military Classics). In the early thirteenth century the Chinese turned <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> propelled objects, formerly only used for entertainment, into weapons of war. The first recorded use of rockets as military weapons was in 1232. The Chinese ‘arrows of fire’ were fired from a sort of catapult launcher. The <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> was packed in a closed tube that had a hole in one end for escaping hot gases, and a long stick as an elementary stability and guidance system.|$|R
5000|$|In older <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> cartridges, {{the second}} number {{typically}} refers to powder charge, in grains. For example, the [...]50-90 Sharps has a [...]50-inch bore {{and used a}} nominal charge of 90.0 gr g of <b>black</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|R
50|$|With the {{increased}} {{safety of the}} <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> substitutes often comes a reduced sensitivity to ignition. Flintlocks in particular need very sensitive, finely granulated powder {{for use in the}} flash pan, and <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> tends to perform more reliably in these and traditional caplock guns than substitutes. Modern in-line muzzleloaders provide a stronger ignition than traditional designs, and this helps to increase reliability with the less flame sensitive substitutes. In addition, magnum percussion caps are often recommended for use with <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> substitutes for both inline and traditional caplock guns, in place of the #11 percussion caps traditionally used with <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> in these guns, to achieve the best ignition reliability.|$|R
50|$|Charcoal {{is used in}} the {{production}} of <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> which is used extensively in {{the production}} of fireworks. It is usually ground into a fine powder, with airfloat grade being the finest particle size available commercially. When used in <b>black</b> <b>powder</b> compositions, it is often ball-milled with other ingredients so that they are intimately mixed together. Certain charcoals perform better when used to make <b>black</b> <b>powder,</b> these include spruce, willow, paulownia and grapevine among others.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> forms {{throughout}} the pipeline process; from producing formations, through well bores, into gathering lines, in reservoirs for fluid separation, and along transmission pipelines. After refinement, <b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> continues {{to build in}} the gas plants and refineries, storage reservoirs and finally {{through to the end}} user.  <b>Black</b> <b>Powder</b> is a composite of iron oxides, iron sulphides, varying dirt such as silica and calcium as well as chloride, sodium and other material particulate. http://blackpowdersolutions.com/blackpowder/ ...|$|R
