5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>on</b> nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>on</b> steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E

5|$|GTAW can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>on</b> {{nearly all}} {{weldable}} metals, {{though it is}} most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>on</b> {{a wider range of}} material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E
