25|$|Is {{the main}} {{amplifier}} block also a two-port? The main amplifier {{is shown in}} the upper shaded box. The ground connections are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the ground connections are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the <b>base</b> <b>resistance</b> of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all ground connections G2 must be connected and also ground connection GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the ground connections as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) {{has been shown}} to increase in an intensity dependent manner in response to aerobic exercise. However, previous research investigating the use of resistance exercise to increase BDNF levels has been less conclusive, likely due to the low intensity nature of traditional resistance exercise programs. This study examined the influence of acute resistance exercise to-fatigue on serum BDNF levels and blood lactate. Design: Acute crossover study. Methods: Eleven untrained to intermediately trained males (age: 25. 0 ± 1. 3 year) and five untrained females (age: 23. 2 ± 1. 1 year) were recruited to undertake two bouts of resistance exercise. Strength (five sets of five repetitions, 180 s recovery) and hypertrophy (three sets of ten repetitions, 60 s recovery) <b>based</b> <b>resistance</b> exercise was implemented to-fatigue to examine the effect on serum BDNF and blood lactate levels immediately post-, and 30 min post-exercise. Results: An interaction (p 3 ̆c 0. 01; ES = 0. 52) was observed between conditions immediately post-exercise, with hypertrophy resulting in significantly greater BDNF levels when compared with strength exercise. Changes in lactate and BDNF from baseline to post- exercise were positively correlated following hypertrophy exercise (r = 0. 70; p 3 ̆c 0. 01), but not correlated following strength exercise (r = 0. 18; p = 0. 56). Conclusions: The use of a to-fatigue hypertrophy <b>based</b> <b>resistance</b> exercise protocol provides the necessary stimulus to increase peripheral serum BDNF.

Design: A randomised crossover intervention study. Methods: Forty-nine healthy elderly participants (23 males) aged 66. 7 +/- 4. 3 years (mean SD) participated in this study which involved undertaking 16 weeks of resistance training and 16 weeks of flexibility training in a random order separated by a four week washout period of usual activity. Prior to and following each training protocol period, participants underwent testing of arterial stiffness as augmentation index; and central blood pressure. Results: When all participants were compared no changes in any measure of arterial stiffness or central blood pressure following resistance training compared to flexibility training were found. When male and female participants were analysed separately, a statistically significant decrease in augmentation index was observed in females (- 5. 28 %; 95 % CI: - 10. 29 to - 0. 26; p = 0. 04) but not males (+ 1. 72 %; 95 % Cl: - 3. 04 to 6. 48; p = 0. 48).

Static cone penetration is well related to the pile loading process, since it is performed quasi-statically and resembles a scaled-down pile load test. In order {{to take advantage of the}} CPT for pile design, load-settlement curves of axially loaded piles bearing in sand were developed in terms of normalized <b>base</b> <b>resistance</b> (qb/qc) versus relative settlement (s/B). The normalized load-settlement curves obtained in this study allow determination of pile <b>base</b> <b>resistance</b> at any relative settlement level within the 0 – 20 % range. Both non-displacement and displacement piles were addressed. In order to obtain the pile base load-settlement relationship, a 3 -D non-linear elastic-plastic constitutive model was used in finite element analyses. A series of calibration chamber tests were modeled and analyzed using the finite element approach with the 3 -D non-linear elastic-plastic stress-strain model. The predicted load-settlement curves showed good agreement with measured load-settlement curves. Calibration chamber size effects were also investigated for different relative densities and boundary conditions using the finite element analysis. The value of the normalized <b>base</b> <b>resistance</b> qb/qc was not a constant, varying as a function of the relative density, the confining stress, and the coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest. The effect of relative density on the normalized <b>base</b> <b>resistance</b> qb/q c was most significant, while that of the confining stress at the pile base level was small. The values of the normalized <b>base</b> <b>resistance</b> q b/qc for silty sands were also addressed. Vertically loaded footings on sands were also modeled using the finite element method with the non-linear stress-strain model. The load-settlement responses obtained from these analyses were compared with those from an existing elasticity-based method. The application of cone penetration testing to footing design was investigated based on the results of the analyses. ...|$|E
