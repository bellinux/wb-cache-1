40|$|Volume {{regulation}} is a <b>basic</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>property,</b> which {{is required in}} every living organism. Cells that are subjected to hypo-osmotic shock will start to swell and subsequently will release K+ and Cl- through K+ and Cl- channels in order to restore their original volume. In 2014, two independent groups identified LRRC 8 A as {{a major component of}} Volume Regulated Anion Channels (VRAC). This thesis provides evidences, that in addition to LRRC 8 A other chloride channels, namely anoctamins or TMEM 16 and bestrophin 1 are involved in volume regulation and offers a putative mechanic model for VRAC activation. Additionally, regarding the high sequence similarity between Anoctamins and TMC (Transmembrane channel like proteins), the role of TMC in volume regulation and Ca 2 + signaling is investigated. Patch clamp analysis of ANO 6 (Anoctamin 6 or TMEM 16 F) overexpressing HEK 293 cells shows a two fold increase in swelling activated whole cell currents compared to control cells. These currents are inhibited by a potent inhibitor of VRAC {{as well as a number}} of inhibitors of Anoctamins. VRAC activity and RVD (Regulatory Volume Decrease) are strongly reduced when Ca 2 + is removed and the mechanisms are depending on the activation of ANO 6. In fact membrane stretch due to cell swelling activates TRP (Transient Receptor Potential) channels, therefore allowing Ca 2 + to enter the cells. Simultaneously the intracellular Cl- concentration is diluted due to water influx and releases ANO 6 from Cl- inhibition. In addition Ca 2 + entering cells during cell swelling may further activate PLA 2 (phospholipase A 2). This phospholipase cleaves fatty acid from the plasma membrane and the subsequent accumulation of lysophospholipids leads to membrane tension which - together with increased Ca 2 + levels - activates ANO 6 at the junctional zone. 	In addition to ANO 6, ANO 10 (Anoctamin 10 or TMEM 16 K) also plays a critical role in volume regulation. This function is identified in Xenopus laevis oocytes and HEK 293 cells. It appears that the expression of ANO 10 produces large outwardly rectifying whole cell currents when cells are subjected to hypotonic solution. On the other hands, expression of R 263 H-ANO 10, a coding variant of ANO 10, fails to produce swelling-activated whole cell currents. ANO 10 also augments Ca 2 + signaling in HEK 293 overexpressing cells, while Ca 2 + signaling is reduced when R 263 H-ANO 10 is expressed. These results are in agreement to the localization of ANO 10 which we found to be mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore we suggest that ANO 10 may facilitate volume regulation by changing Ca 2 + signaling. Since volume {{regulation is}} known to be involved in cell migration, the role of ANO 10 on macrophage migration and on their phagocytosis activity is investigated. The study shows that both migration and phagocytotic activity are reduced in the absence of ANO 10. These results suggest that ANO 10 is a new player in the innate immune system, controlling volume regulation and macrophage function. 	Bestrophin 1 is known to be a Ca 2 + activated Cl- channel in the retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). Its role in volume regulation was also investigated. Interestingly, Best 1 knock out mice show impairment related to volume regulation such as sperm morphology and motility. A study conducted in RPE cells isolated from patients with an inherited from of macular dystrophy, carrying heterozygous mutations in Best 1, shows absence of swelling-activated whole cell currents, while knockdown of LRRC 8 A (a putative major component of VRAC) in healthy RPE cells does not affect swelling-activated whole cell currents. Therefore Best 1 is suggested to be an essential component of VRAC in human RPE cells and mouse sperm. 	Since TMC proteins show sequence similarities to anoctamins, we examined their role in volume regulation. However, none of the TMCs can augment swelling-activated whole cell currents. Surprisingly TMC 8 largely reduced swelling-activated whole cell currents in overexpressing HEK 293 cells. Not only the swelling-activated currents, but also RVD is largely compromised in the presence of TMC 8. Ca 2 + measurements reveal that TMC 8 inhibits ATP-induced Ca 2 + release without affecting Ca 2 + level in the ER store or SOCE (Store Operated Calcium Entry). Chelation of intracellular Zn 2 + largely inhibited ATP-induced Ca 2 + release as well as ATP-activated ANO 1 currents. These and further results suggest that upon stimulation with ATP, Zn 2 + is co-released with Ca 2 + and further augment Ca 2 + release from the store. The presence of TMC 8 interferes with this process, since it is known that TMC 8 interacts with ZnT 1 -transporter and regulate Zn 2 + re-uptake into the ER via ZnT- 1...|$|E

40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} that infect humans, animals, {{and plants}} cause serious diseases that are deleterious {{to human health}} and agricultural productivity. Chemical and biological control methods have reduced {{the impact of these}} parasites. However, surviving environmental stages lead to persistent reinfection of host species. In addition, development of resistance to nematicides and anthelmintics by these parasites and reduced availability of some nematicides, for environmental protection, pose significant obstacles for current and future prospects of effective parasite control. Due to marked differences in host species, research on animal and plant parasitic nematodes often proceeds independently. Despite the differences between animals and plants, <b>basic</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>properties</b> are shared among these host organisms. Some common properties may be important for mechanisms [homologous or convergent (homoplastic) ] by which nematodes successfully infect these diverse hosts or by which animal and plant hosts resist infections by these pathogens. Here we compare host/parasite interactions between plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) and animal parasitic nematodes, with an emphasis on mammalian hosts (MPN). Similarities and differences are considered in the context of progress on molecular dissection of these interactions. A comprehensive coverage is not possible in the space allotted. Instead, an illustrative approach is used to establish examples that, it is hoped, exemplify the value of the comparative approach...|$|R
40|$|There are Ca {{channels}} in the plasma membrane {{and also the}} sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane in cardiac myocytes. The relationship between channel structure, associated proteins and function of these Ca channels is discussed. The sarcolemmal Ca channels are crucial both to the <b>basic</b> <b>cellular</b> electrophysiological <b>properties</b> and control of cardiac contractility (via excitation–contraction coupling). The intracellular Ca release channels (or ryanodine receptors) respond to triggering events mediated by sarcolemmal ion currents and are largely responsible for releasing Ca which activates the myofilaments to produce contraction. Several possible mechanisms of excitation–contraction coupling are discussed. The Ca released from the SR can also feedback on several sarcolemmal ion currents and alter action potential configuration as well as contribute to arrhythmogenesis. Ó 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Serotonin (5 HT) and {{nitric oxide}} (NO) are {{important}} signalling molecules with roles in behavioural control and various psychological conditions. Various lines of evidence suggest interactions between 5 HT and NO signalling, however {{little is known}} about their interaction in modulating intrinsic properties of cortical neurons and the effects on the neuronal network activity in the cortex. This project studied the effects of 5 HT and NO on cultured neurons isolated from Wistar rat cortices. 5 HT and NO produced diverse responses in cortical neurons, reflecting the heterogeneity of cortical neuron types. Neither 5 HT nor NO appeared to significantly modulate glutamate induced depolarisations. However, they affected the number of APs elicited by the glutamate response, hinting at the possible modulation of intrinsic membrane properties. Subsequently, k-Means clustering based on 10 electrophysiological parameters was used to divide cultured cortical neurons into 10 different cell types with consistent firing properties. 5 HT and NO had diverse, cell-type specific effects on neuronal excitability and cellular parameters in these cell types. Furthermore, 5 HT and NO showed complex interactions between each other, suggesting modulatory cross-talk. Using ODQ to block soluble guanylate cyclase activity suggests that NO effects are mediated not only by sGC/cGMP signalling, but also S-nitrosylation. Comparing results obtained in cell culture to data from acute cortical slices showed similarities in <b>basic</b> <b>cellular</b> <b>properties.</b> However, 5 HT and NO effects on pyramidal cell properties differed markedly between slices and cultures. At the network level, 5 HT increased the spontaneous EPSC frequency in pyramidal neurons through 5 HT 2 receptors, whereas NO had no effect. Interestingly, NO was able to reduce the 5 HT induced increase in EPSC frequency when inhibitory synaptic interactions were blocked, possibly by modulating 5 HT 1 receptor function. The results obtained demonstrate the interaction between 5 HT and NO in modulating both intrinsic membrane properties and neocortical network activity...|$|R
40|$|An {{isolated}} ventricular endocardial preparation {{removed from}} canine hearts {{one to two}} days after coronary artery occlusion and superfused in vitro is described. The alteration in electrophysiological characteristics of subendocardial Purkinje fibers surviving in infarcted regions {{and the relationship of}} these changes to the generation of ventricular arrhythmias is discussed. The advantages of such preparations for assessing the mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic drugs in post-infarction ventricular arrhythmias is discussed. Our efforts to understand the <b>basic</b> <b>cellular</b> electrical <b>properties</b> of cardiac muscle has been greatly aided by the use of isolated preparations of cardiac tissue. The use of such preparations permits the investigator to apply direct intracellular recording with glass microelectrodes. Indeed, much of what we know about quantitative cellular electrophysiology has resulted from study of isolated cardiac tissue. This has been due largely {{to the fact that it}} is technically difficult to record with glass microelectrodes from single cardiac cells in a beating heart, particularly from Purkinje fibers, since the endocardial surface is not readily accessible. A major goal of electrophysiological studies in isolated cardiac tissue has been to determine the origin and mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias and their modification by antiarrhythmic drugs. The majority of these studies have been done on essentially normal cardiac tissue isolated from healthy animals. The applicability of information on the mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic drugs obtained from studies on normal cardiac tissue to diseased hearts is questionable. Efforts have been made to simulate a pathological condition by exposing normal tissue to an altered extracellular environment such as hypoxia, or high extracellular potassium concentrations. All of these procedures still represent essentially acute interventions superimposed on normal electrical activity. In recent years, studies have begun to determine the alteration of electrical properties of cardia...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Cholinergic {{modulation}} of {{the superficial}} {{layers of the}} parasubiculum Stephen D. Glasgow, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2011 Recent {{evidence suggests that the}} parahippocampal area, including the entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum, may {{play a crucial role in}} spatial processing and memory formation. However, little is known about the <b>basic</b> <b>cellular</b> and network <b>properties</b> of the parasubiculum, an isocortical brain region that receives input from the hippocampus and other subcortical regions associated with spatial navigation, and projects exclusively to the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex. Neurons in layer II of the parasubiculum demonstrate theta-frequency membrane potential oscillations at near-threshold voltages that are generated via an interplay between a persistent Na+ current and the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current Ih, and these rhythmic fluctuations in membrane potential may contribute to the generation of oscillatory local field potentials. Further, the parasubiculum receives strong cholinergic projections from the medial septum. Acetylcholine has been linked to theta-frequency oscillations via regulation of cellular and network dynamics through membrane depolarization, while concurrently suppressing excitatory synaptic transmission, and it is likely that cholinergic receptor activation has similar effects in the parasubiculum. I found that activation of cholinergic receptors depolarizes layer II cells of the parasubiculum by exerting numerous effects on K+ channels, including IM and IKir, however also suppresses incoming excitatory synaptic transmission from the CA 1. These results indicate that increases in cholinergic tone during network-level theta-frequency oscillations in the parasubiculum may increase neuronal excitability by exerting strong effects on postsynaptic conductances, but may also regulate network dynamics by reducing the strength of incoming afferents. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{olfactory}} bulb and other brain areas, <b>basic</b> <b>cellular</b> and synaptic <b>properties</b> of individual neurons {{have been studied}} extensively in reduced preparations. Nevertheless, it is still poorly understood how intactions between multiple neurons shape spatio-temporal activity patterns and give rise to the computational properties of the the intact circuit. In this thesis, I used pharmacological manipulations of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors to examine the synaptic interactions underlying spontaneous and odor-evoked activity patterns in the intact {{olfactory bulb}} of zebrafish. Electrophysiological and one- and two-photon calcium imaging methods were used to record activity from the principal neurons of the OB (mitral cells, MCs), their sensory input, and local interneurons. The combined blockade of AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors abolished odor-evoked excitation of MCs, indicating that sensory input to the OB is mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors. Surprisingly, however, the blockade of AMPA/Kainiate receptors alone increased the mean response of MCs and decreased the mean response of interneurons (INs), and the blockade of NMDA receptors caused little or {{no change in the}} mean responses of MCs and INs. In addition, antagonists of both glutamate receptor types had diverse effects on the magnitude and time course of individual MC and IN responses and, thus, changed spatio-temporal activity patterns across neuronal populations. The blockade of GABA(A) receptors increased spontaneous and odor evoked firing rates of mitral cells and often induced rhythmic bursting. Moreover, the blockade of, GABA(A) or AMPA/kainate receptors abolished fast oscillatory activity in the local field potential. Blockade of GABA(B) receptors reduced calcium influx in afferent sensory axons and modulated response time courses of mitral cells. These results indicate that (1) IN activity during an odor response depends mainly on AMPA/Kainiate receptor input, (2) interactions between MCs and INs regulate the total OB output activity, (3) AMPA/Kainiate receptors and GABA(A) receptors underly the synchronization of odor-dependent neuronal ensembles and (4) odor-specific patterns of OB output activity are shaped by circuits containing iGlu receptors and GABA receptors. These results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the processing of odor-encoding activity patterns in the OB...|$|R
