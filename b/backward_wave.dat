50|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{transmission}} lines periodically loaded with capacitive and inductive elements in a high-pass configuration support certain types of <b>backward</b> <b>waves.</b> In addition, planar transmission lines are a natural match for 2-D wave propagation. With lumped circuit elements they retain a compact configuration and can still support the lower RF range. With this in mind, high pass and cutoff, periodically loaded, two-dimensional LC transmission line networks were proposed. The LC networks can be designed to support <b>backward</b> <b>waves,</b> without bulky SRR/wire structure. This was the first such proposal which veered away from bulk media for a negative refractive effect. A notable property of this type of network {{is that there is no}} reliance on resonance, Instead the ability to support <b>backward</b> <b>waves</b> defines negative refraction.|$|R

40|$|Wave {{separation}} {{analysis and}} wave intensity analysis (WIA) use (aortic) pressure and flow {{to separate them}} in their forward and <b>backward</b> (reflected) <b>waves.</b> While wave separation analysis uses measured pressure and flow, WIA uses their derivatives. Because differentiation emphasizes rapid changes, WIA suppresses slow (diastolic) fluctuations of the waves and renders diastole a seemingly wave-free period. However, integration of the WIA-obtained forward and <b>backward</b> <b>waves</b> {{is equal to the}} wave separation analysis-obtained waves. Both the methods thus give similar results including <b>backward</b> <b>waves</b> spanning systole and diastole. Nevertheless, this seemingly wave-free period in diastole formed the basis of both the reservoir-wave concept and the Instantaneous wave-Free Ratio of (iFR) pressure and flow. The reservoir-wave concept introduces a reservoir pressure, Pres, (Frank Windkessel) as a wave-less phenomenon. Because this Windkessel model falls short in systole an excess pressure, Pexc, is introduced, which is assumed to have wave properties. The reservoir-wave concept, however, is internally inconsistent. The presumed wave-less Pres equals twice the <b>backward</b> pressure <b>wave</b> and travels, arriving later in the distal aorta. Hence, in contrast, Pexc is minimally affected by wave reflections. Taken together, Pres seems to behave as a wave, rather than Pexc. The iFR is also not without flaws, as easily demonstrated when applied to the aorta. The ratio of diastolic aortic pressure and flow implies division by zero giving nonsensical results. In conclusion, presumptions based on WIA have led to misconceptions that violate physical principles, and reservoir-wave concept and iFR should be abandone...|$|R

40|$|Aortic {{pulse wave}} {{velocity}} (PWV), {{a measure of}} aortic stiffness, is an important indicator of cardiovascular risk. Derivation of PWV from uncalibrated proximal aortic or carotid pressure alone has practical advantages. However, when the time of return of the reflected wave, (Delta) t, {{is used to calculate}} PWV, inaccurate data are obtained. With aging PWV increases but (Delta) t hardly decreases, suggesting that the reflection site moves toward the periphery. We hypothesized that the forward and reflected waves in the distal aorta are not in phase, leading to an undefined reflection site. We derived forward and <b>backward</b> <b>waves,</b> at the entrance and distal end of a uniform tube, with length "L. " With the tube closed at the end, forward and reflected waves are there in phase, and PWV= 2 L/(Delta) t. When the tube is ended with the input impedance of the lower body, forward and <b>backward</b> <b>waves</b> at its end are not in phase, and (Delta) t is increased, suggesting that the reflection site is further away (tube seems longer), and PWV calculated from 2 L/(Delta) t is underestimated. Using an anatomically accurate model of the human arterial system, we show that the forward and <b>backward</b> <b>waves</b> in the distal aorta are not in phase. When aortic PWV increases, (Delta) t changes only little, and the reflection site appears to move to the periphery, similar to what is observed in humans. We conclude that to define the location of a reflection site is elusive and that PWV cannot be calculated from time of return of the reflected wav...|$|R
40|$|Aortic {{pulse wave}} {{velocity}} (PWV), calculated from pulse transit time (PTT) using 2 separate pulse recordings over a known distance, {{is a significant}} biomarker of cardiovascular risk. This study evaluates a novel method of determining PTT from waveform decomposition of central aortic pressure using a single pulse measurement. Aortic pressure was estimated from a transformed radial pulse and decomposed into forward and <b>backward</b> <b>waves</b> using a triangular flow wave. Pulse transit time was determined from cross-correlation of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>waves.</b> Pulse transit time, representing twice the PTT between 2 specific sites, was compared with independent measurements of carotid-femoral PTT in a cohort of 46 subjects (23 females; age 57 ± 14 years). Linear regression between measured PTT (y; milliseconds) and calculated PTT (x; milliseconds) was y= 1. 05 x- 2. 1 (r= 0. 67; P< 0. 001). This model was tested in a separate group of 44 subjects (21 females; age 55 ± 14 years) by comparing measured carotid-femoral PWV (y; meters per second) and PWV calculated using the estimated value of PTT (eTR/ 2) and carotid femoral distance (x; meters per second; y= 1. 21 x- 2. 5; r= 0. 82; P< 0. 001). Findings indicate that the time lag between the forward and <b>backward</b> <b>waves</b> obtained from the decomposition of aortic pressure wave {{can be used to}} determine PWV along the aortic trunk and shows good agreement with carotid-femoral PWV.
