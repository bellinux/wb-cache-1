25|$|Overfishing {{is a form}} of {{overexploitation}} where {{fish stocks}} are reduced to below acceptable levels. Overfishing can occur in water bodies of any sizes, such as ponds, rivers, lakes or oceans, and can result in resource depletion, reduced <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> rates and low biomass levels. Sustained overfishing can lead to critical depensation, where the fish population is no longer able to sustain itself. Some forms of overfishing, for example the overfishing of sharks, has led to the upset of entire marine ecosystems.|$|E

This paper presents results from experiments carried out on a newly constructed re-circulating water tunnel purpose built to investigate the effect of freshwater biofilms in hydraulic conduits. A baseline study of boundary layer velocity profiles and total drag measurements of a specially prepared rough test plate has been conducted to determine the plate’s roughness characteristics. Experimental measurements from the water tunnel are complemented with three-dimensional physical roughness data obtained from innovative photogrammetric methods. The roughness data from the water tunnel and photogrammetry are compared and are shown to agree by within 20 %...|$|R

25|$|Simple {{programs}} {{are capable of}} a remarkable range of behavior. Some have been proven to be universal computers. Others exhibit properties familiar from traditional science, such as thermodynamic behavior, continuum behavior, conserved quantities, percolation, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and others.

Another feature of simple programs is that, according to the book, making them more complicated seems to have little effect on their overall complexity. A New Kind of Science argues that this is evidence that simple {{programs are}} enough to capture the essence of almost any complex system.|$|E
25|$|Metabolism {{developed}} during the post war period in a Japan that questioned its cultural identity. Initially the group had chosen the name Burnt Ash School to reflect the ruined state of firebombed Japanese cities and the opportunity they presented for radical re-building. Ideas of nuclear physics and <b>biological</b> <b>growth</b> were linked with Buddhist concepts of regeneration. Although Metabolism rejected visual references from the past, they embraced concepts of prefabrication and renewal from traditional Japanese architecture, especially the twenty-year cycle of the rebuilding of the Ise Shrine (to which Tange and Kawazoe were invited in 1953). The sacred rocks onto which the shrine is built were seen by the Metabolists as symbolising a Japanese spirit that predated Imperial aspirations and modernising influences from the West.|$|E

25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through physical adsorption or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the tributyltin moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. Biocides are also added to pool water, drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control <b>biological</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Draw-off or Blow-down — The {{portion of}} the {{circulating}} water flow that is removed (usually discharged to a drain) {{in order to maintain}} the amount of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and other impurities at an acceptably low level.

2500|$|Slow {{sand filters}} {{may be used}} where there is {{sufficient}} land and space, as the water must be passed very slowly through the filters. These filters rely on biological treatment processes for their action rather than physical filtration. The filters are carefully constructed using graded layers of sand, with the coarsest sand, along with some gravel, {{at the bottom and}} finest sand at the top. Drains at the base convey treated water away for disinfection. Filtration depends on the development of a thin biological layer, called the zoogleal layer or Schmutzdecke, {{on the surface of the}} filter. An effective slow sand filter may remain in service for many weeks or even months if the pretreatment is well designed and produces water with a very low available nutrient level which physical methods of treatment rarely achieve. Very low nutrient levels allow water to be safely sent through distribution systems with very low disinfectant levels, thereby reducing consumer irritation over offensive levels of chlorine and chlorine by-products. Slow sand filters are not backwashed; they are maintained by having the top layer of sand scraped off when flow is eventually obstructed by <b>biological</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic {{conduits}} {{are susceptible}} to deterioration in their carrying capacity over time due to <b>biological</b> <b>growths</b> on their internal surfaces. This result is often termed biofouling. It is generally recognised that biofilms cause greater resistance to flow by increasing the effective roughness of the surface in contact with water. However, the detailed mechanisms by which <b>biological</b> <b>growths</b> affect the flow are not well understood. The present study was carried out {{with the cooperation of}} Hydro Tasmania, which is responsible for electricity generation in Tasmania through its hydro-electric schemes. Many of their facilities rely on open channels and pipelines for conveying water to power stations. Biofouling in open-channel networks requires increased flow depths to sustain design flows. This reduces the available freeboard, which increases the risk of overtopping and subsequent damage to channel structure and the surrounding environment. Maintaining design free board in the presence of biofouling will reduce channel flow capacity and power output. For pipe networks supplying hydro-electric power stations, biofouling will also reduce power generation capacity due to the increased energy loss lowering the effective head at the turbines. To research the effect biofouling has in reducing the efficiency of hydraulic conduits, a multi-faceted program was undertaken. The core of the work was completed on a purpose built water tunnel. Total drag and boundary layer measurements were undertaken in this tunnel. Analysis of the results from the water tunnel looked at the friction and roughness effects of clean and fouled smooth and rough test plates. Measured roughness was compared to physical roughness derived from photogrammetric methods. Novel photogrammetry methods were used to map the surface of biofilms on the smooth and rough test plates. This data was compared to water tunnel drag results. A field program supported the laboratory work. This consisted of a series of headloss tests of before and after the cleaning of biofouling material. Paint trials were also undertaken to find suitable candidates for the refurbishment of open channel structures. Water quality and temperature monitoring was undertaken to better characterise the water in which the biofilms grow. The final aspect of the field program was the mapping of biofilm surfaces using the novel close range photogrammetry. Plates with fine and coarse surface roughness were deployed in the field and allowed to have biofilms develop. Mapping of the biofilm at intervals was completed to investigate the character of biofilms on rough surfaces...|$|R
