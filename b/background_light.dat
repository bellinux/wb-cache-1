5|$|The {{most common}} and {{effective}} colours are red, yellow, black and white. These colours provide strong contrast with green foliage, resist changes in shadow and lighting, have strong contrast, are highly chromatic, and provide distance dependent camouflage. Some forms of warning colouration provide this distance dependent camouflage by having an effective pattern and colour combination that do not allow for easy detection by a predator from a distance, but are warning-like from a close proximity, allowing for an advantageous balance between camouflage and aposematism. Warning colouration evolves in response to <b>background,</b> <b>light</b> conditions, and predator vision. Visible signals may be accompanied by odours, sounds or behaviour to provide a multi-modal signal which is more effectively detected by predators.|$|E
5|$|A team {{composed}} of astronomers from France and Switzerland used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to examine Kepler-40. SOPHIE uses radial velocity measurements to examine stars for exoplanets. After <b>background</b> <b>light</b> was removed and alternative causes for radial velocity variations were disproved (for example, that Kepler-40 {{was actually a}} close binary star), the team used SOPHIE to analyze {{the properties of the}} actual star. The astronomers observing the star found that it is nearing the main sequence turn-off (the star fuses the last of its hydrogen and becomes a red giant). The establishment of stellar parameters helped the astronomers extrapolate the exoplanet's parameters and prove the existence of Kepler-40b. The discovered planet was the sixth transiting planet to have been discovered in orbit around stars with a radius of more than 1.8 times that of the Sun, after planets including Kepler-5 and Kepler-7.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by <b>background</b> <b>light</b> such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{presented}} a novel algorithm for the segmentation of uneven <b>background</b> <b>lighting</b> images with strong noise injection. We first treated the {{image as a}} gray wave in three-dimensional space and extracted grayscale wave curves in the horizontal and vertical directions. Then, we applied wave transformation on the curves using fuzzy membership to obtain the relative characteristic of each pixel {{in order to reduce}} the influence of the uneven <b>background</b> <b>lighting.</b> Simultaneously, the non-local spatial weight matrix and edge information were also taken into account in the transformation in order to improve the robustness of the transformation to noise injection and avoid false peak and trough labeling. Finally, we segmented the wave transformation image using intuitionistic fuzzy theory. In different experiments, our algorithm demonstrated superior performance against some well-known algorithms on several uneven <b>background</b> <b>lighting</b> images.|$|R

50|$|Most lights used {{in modern}} {{photography}} are {{a flash of}} some sort. The lighting for portraiture is typically diffused by bouncing it {{from the inside of}} an umbrella, or by using a soft box. A soft box is a fabric box, encasing a photo strobe head, one side of which is made of translucent fabric. This provides a softer lighting for portrait work and is often considered more appealing than the harsh light often cast by open strobes. Hair and <b>background</b> <b>lights</b> are usually not diffused. It is more important to control light spillage to other areas of the subject. Snoots, barn doors and flags or gobos help focus the lights exactly where the photographer wants them. <b>Background</b> <b>lights</b> are sometimes used with color gels placed in front of the light to create coloured backgrounds.|$|R
500|$|Atomic line {{filters are}} {{inherently}} very efficient filters, generally classified as [...] "ultra-high-Q" [...] as their Q factor {{is in the}} 105 to 106 range.

The passband of a typical Faraday filter may be a few GHz. The total output of a Faraday filter may be around 50% of the total input light intensity.

50|$|It {{is common}} to find {{structures}} with white xenon flashers/white strobes during the daytime, and red lights at night. Red lights are commonly found {{to be used in}} urban areas, since it is easier for pilots to spot them from above. White strobes (that flash round the clock) may also be used in urban areas. However, it has been recommended that flashing white strobes should not be used in densely populated areas; the lights usually merge with <b>background</b> <b>lighting</b> at nighttime, making it difficult for pilots to spot them and thereby aggravating the hazard. In addition, residents near the lit structure will complain of light trespass. In rural areas, red beacons/strobes may also be used during nighttime. However, white strobes are (sometimes) preferred since they reduce the maintenance cost (i.e. no maintenance of painting, no red side lights) and there are no <b>background</b> <b>lights</b> that would blend with the strobes.|$|R

50|$|In a phase-{{contrast}} microscope, {{image contrast}} is increased in two ways: by generating constructive interference between scattered and <b>background</b> <b>light</b> rays in {{regions of the}} field of view that contain the specimen, and by reducing the amount of <b>background</b> <b>light</b> that reaches the image plane. First, the <b>background</b> <b>light</b> is phase-shifted by −90° by passing it through a phase-shift ring, which eliminates the phase difference between the background and the scattered light rays.When the light is then focused on the image plane (where a camera or eyepiece is placed), this phase shift causes background and scattered light rays originating from regions {{of the field of}} view that contain the sample (i.e., the foreground) to constructively interfere, resulting in an increase in the brightness of these areas compared to regions that do not contain the sample. Finally, the background is dimmed ~70-90% by a gray filter ring—this method maximizes the amount of scattered light generated by the illumination (i.e., <b>background)</b> <b>light,</b> while minimizing the amount of illumination light that reaches the image plane. Some of the scattered light (which illuminates the entire surface of the filter) will be phase-shifted and dimmed by the rings, but to a much lesser extent than the <b>background</b> <b>light</b> (which only illuminates the phase-shift and gray filter rings).|$|E
