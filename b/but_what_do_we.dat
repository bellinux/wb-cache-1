2500|$|In March 2013, {{described}} by the Daily Post as a [...] "popular young leader" [...] on the Opposition benches, he strongly criticised {{what he saw as}} the Kilman government's lack of [...] "fiscal responsibility", with a lack of funding for decentralisation or for students' scholarships, while ministers and MPs still had their foreign travels funded. During a speech in Parliament criticising budget priorities, he mentioned Kilman's [...] "directive to the Public Service not to buy any new cars, and then they went and bought 25 million vatu worth of new vehicles. So who is the boss of the Public Service? Are you - the Prime Minister - not the boss?" [...] Highlighting the country's trade deficit, he added: “We see less exports and more imports. Since we joined the WTO, less exports and more imports. Local businesses are breaking down. We spend hundreds of millions of vatu in trade, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> do with it? We talk about more development needed in the productive sector, but kill it off". He nonetheless noted the budget safeguards on spending on education and health, and voted in favour of the budget so as not to block necessary spending on public services.|$|E
60|$|ZOO. Yes; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> {{know about}} this breath of life that puffs you up so exaltedly? Just nothing. So let us shake hands as {{cultivated}} Agnostics, and change the subject.|$|E

"Nay," [...] replied Ursula indifferently, [...] "one of them, methinks, was the Marquis de Suarez, for I {{caught sight}} of his black silk hose, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> care about these nincompoops, Margaret? Come and see the witch--we {{have no time to}} lose." ...|$|E
500|$|In addition, it {{has been}} claimed that the re-planning delayed the tram's completion. One of the {{designers}} of the tram noted that [...] "if we added up all the times {{we went back to}} try to save money, we probably lost a year. Maybe we saved $2 million, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> lose? If we had an extra year, that would have meant a lot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Ay, says John Wyse. We {{fought for}} the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O'Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> ever get for it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two {{down out}} of five," [...] said Badding, [...] "and twelve at the least against us. The odds are too long, little master. Let us at least go back, fill up once more, and raise a mantelet against the bolts, for they have an arbalist which shoots both {{straight}} and hard. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> must <b>do</b> quickly, for the darkness falls apace." ...|$|R
6000|$|GREAT. It was; but he {{gave them}} {{encouragement}} withal. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> talk of them? they {{were a couple of}} lion-like men: they had set their faces like flint. Do not you remember how undaunted they were when they stood before the judge? ...|$|E

5000|$|It was shit {{money and}} a shit deal, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> care? The initial {{contract}} got flushed down the toilet at Sammy Wong's hotel when we were playing a gig in San Francisco, and we didn't even bother to sign a new one. We made a verbal agreement with the Fagin of punk rock. Robbie, or the [...] "Posh One", was an ex-Brit, a sometimes substitute teacher who minored in punk rock exploitation. He was the perfect host for our first disc. Robbie had his own record company, Posh Boy Records. Jesus, even the name sounded like a scam.|$|R
6000|$|Alas, I had {{misunderstood}} {{the town}} boys. Beer was five cents in one saloon {{only in the}} whole burg, and we didn't strike that saloon. But the one we entered was all right. A blessed stove was roaring white-hot; there were cosey, cane-bottomed arm-chairs, and a none-too-pleasant-looking barkeeper who glared suspiciously at us as we came in. A man cannot spend continuous days and nights in his clothes, beating trains, fighting soot and cinders, and sleeping anywhere, and maintain a good [...] "front." [...] Our fronts were decidedly against us; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> care? I had the price in my jeans.|$|R
60|$|VERNON [laughs]. 'Pon my word it <b>does.</b> <b>But</b> <b>what</b> can <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> They'll {{never leave}} us--not one of them.|$|R
6000|$|So {{the matter}} rested--for awhile. Those who {{at this time}} knew Bertram best were {{confident}} enough that his belief was shaken, {{in spite of the}} remonstrance so loudly put forth in his first pages. He had intended to be honest in his remonstrance; but it is not every man who exactly knows what he does believe. Every man! Is there, one may almost ask, any man who has such knowledge? We all believe in the resurrection of the body; we say so at least, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> believe by it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{or other}} of us," [...] he reflected, [...] "we make these women what they are. And when we've made them, we can't do without them; we don't want to; but {{we give them}} no proper homes, so that they're reduced to prowl about the streets, and then we run them in. Ha! that's good--that's excellent! We run them in! And here we sit and carp. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> do? Nothing! Our system is the most highly moral known. We get the benefit without soiling even the hem of our phylacteries--the women {{are the only ones}} that suffer. And why should n't they--inferior things?" ...|$|E
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. That is true; but we, like them, get our {{dividends}} {{whether we}} work or not. We work partly {{because we know}} {{there would be no}} dividends if we did not, and partly because if we refuse we are regarded as mentally deficient and put into a lethal chamber. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> work at? Before the few changes we were forced to make by the revolutions that followed the Four Years War, our governing classes had been so rich, as it was called, that they had become the most intellectually lazy and fat-headed people {{on the face of the}} earth. There is a good deal of that fat still clinging to us.|$|E
5000|$|Grant's {{personality}} change prompted criticism, {{with one}} reviewer branding the character's [...] "new touchy feely attitude to life" [...] as [...] "implausible". Another commented [...] "This new unimproved family-friendly [...] "come on {{give me a}} hug" [...] Grant gives me the creeps. In just one crazed week the demented EastEnders scriptwriters undermined TV's top tough guy to such a profound extent that I can't see how he'll ever recover. With Phil and Grant reunited {{for the first time}} in six months, we were all looking forward to some classic Mitchell mayhem. In fact we had a right to expect carnage from the terrible twins. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> get? Grant's nauseating revelation that he underwent therapy to stop being so violent and antisocial." ...|$|R
6000|$|Another {{one of our}} grafts was [...] "passing the punk." [...] We {{were the}} {{celestial}} messengers, the fire-bringers, in that iron world of bolt and bar. When the men came in from work at night and were locked in their cells, they wanted to smoke. Then it was that we restored the divine spark, running the galleries, from cell to cell, with our smouldering punks. Those who were wise, or with whom <b>we</b> <b>did</b> business, had their punks all ready to light. Not every one got divine sparks, however. The guy who refused to dig up, went sparkless and smokeless to bed. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> care? We had the immortal cinch on him, and if he got fresh, {{two or three of}} us would pitch on him and give him [...] "what-for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'H'm,' said Taffy. 'That's a mixy noise. The {{end part}} is ah-carp-fish-mouth; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> can <b>we</b> <b>do</b> about the front part? Yer-yer-yer and ah! Ya!' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{exercise}} we get is principally at {{this period}} of the day, and consists in incessant dropping down from the deck to the cabin, and incessant scrambling up from the cabin to the deck. The dinner is a long business; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> care for that? We have no appointments to keep, no visitors to interrupt us, and {{nothing in the world}} to do but to tickle our palates, wet our whistles, and amuse ourselves in any way we please. Dinner at last over, it is superfluous to say, that the pipes become visible again, and that the taking of forty winks is only a prohibited operation {{on the part of the}} man at the helm.|$|E
6000|$|If {{these things}} be conceded, though only for argument, we may take up {{where we left}} it the thread of {{the thought of the}} natural man, called by the Scotch (with regrettable familiarity), [...] "The Old Man." [...] We can ask the next {{question}} so obviously in front of us. Some satisfaction is needed even to make things better. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> mean by making things better? Most modern talk on this matter is a mere argument in a circle--that circle which we have already made the symbol of madness and of mere rationalism. Evolution is only good if it produces good; good is only good if it helps evolution. The elephant stands on the tortoise, and the tortoise on the elephant.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{authorities}} are all bad," [...] Garcia said scornfully. [...] "They only think of feathering their own nests, and of quarrelling among themselves. The people are patriots, {{but what can}} they do when the Juntas keep the arms the English have sent us in their magazines, and divide the money among themselves? Then our generals know nothing of their business, and have their own ambitions and rivalries. We are all ready to fight; and when the drum is beaten and we are called out, we go willingly enough. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> do when we go out? We are marched backwards and forwards without motive; the officers are no good; and when at last we do see the French we are always beaten, and the generals and the officers are the first to run away.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> could <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{about the}} tent? It would be {{impossible}} to go away and leave that, with its contents, for a whole day.|$|R

6000|$|... "Too decorous, Comrade Jackson. I {{came over}} here principally, it is true, {{to be at}} your side, should you be in any way persecuted by scoundrels. But {{at the same time}} I confess that {{at the back of my}} mind there lurked a hope that {{stirring}} adventures might come my way. I had heard so much of the place. Report had it that an earnest seeker after amusement might have a tolerably spacious rag in this modern Byzantium. I thought that a few weeks here might restore that keen edge to my nervous system which the languor of the past term had in a measure blunted. I wished my visit to be a tonic rather than a sedative. I anticipated that on my return the cry would go round Cambridge, 'Psmith has been to New York. He is full of oats. For he on honey-dew hath fed, and drunk the milk of Paradise. He is hot stuff. Rah!' <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> find?" ...|$|E
60|$|See {{the spirit}} that was among the {{primitive}} professors, that knowing and believing how much it concerned them, in the propagating of Christianity, to show forth love to one another, that so all might know them to be Christ's disciples, rather than there should be any complainings among them, they sold all they had. Oh how zealous were these to practise, and, with one shoulder, to do that that was upon their hearts for God! I might further add, how often have we agreed in our judgment? and hath it not been upon our hearts, that this {{and the other thing}} is good to be done to enlighten the dark world, and to repair the breaches of churches, and to raise up those churches that now lie agasping, and among whom the soul of religion is expiring? <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> more than talk of them? Do not most decline these things when they either call for their purses or their persons to help in this and such like works as these? Let us then, in what we know, unite, that we may put it in practice, remembering that, if we know these things, we shall be happy if we do them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I had; I {{had very}} blasphemous thoughts, and I know that spirit of {{rebellion}} {{must have made}} {{the worst part of}} your lot. You did not feel how impossible it is for us to judge rightly of God's dealings, and you opposed yourself to his will. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> know? We cannot foretell the working of the smallest event in our own lot; how can we presume to judge of things that are so much too high for us? There is nothing that becomes us but entire submission, perfect resignation. As long as we set up our own will and our own wisdom against God's, we make that wall between us and his love which I have spoken of just now. But as soon as we lay ourselves entirely at his feet, we have enough light given us to guide our own steps; as the foot-soldier who hears nothing of the councils that determine the course of the great battle he is in, hears plainly enough the word of command which he must himself obey. I know, dear Mrs. Dempster, I know it is hard--the hardest thing of all, perhaps--to flesh and blood. But carry that difficulty to the Saviour along with all your other sins and weaknesses, and ask him to pour into you a spirit of submission. He enters into your struggles; he has drunk the cup of our suffering to the dregs; he knows the hard wrestling it costs us to say, [...] "Not my will, but Thine be done."' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{would be}} more thankful," [...] said Ippegoo, with a woe-begone expression, [...] "if we had saved even a spear; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> can <b>we</b> <b>do</b> without food or weapons?" ...|$|R
60|$|Why that's true, said he, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> can <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> there's {{no going}} to Church as the Case stands now, if {{we must not}} worship the Devil a little between whiles.|$|R
60|$|If Dr. Charcot had {{believed}} {{in what the}} French call suggestion mentale-- suggestion by thought-transference (which I think he did not)--he could have explained the healing of the Centurion's servant, 'Say the word, Lord, and my servant shall be healed,' by suggestion & distance (telepathy), and by premising that the servant's palsy was 'hysterical.' <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> mean by 'hysterical'? Nobody knows. The 'mind,' somehow, causes gangrenes, if not cancers, paralysis, shrinking of tissues; the mind, somehow, cures them. And what is the 'mind'? As my object is to give savage parallels to modern instances better vouched for. I quote a singular Red Indian cure by 'suggestion.' Hearne, travelling in Canada, in 1770, met a native who had 'dead palsy,' affecting the whole of one side. He was dragged on a sledge, 'reduced to a mere skeleton,' and so {{was placed in the}} magic lodge. The first step in his cure was the public swallowing by a conjurer of a board of wood, 'about the size of a barrel-stave,' twice as wide across as his mouth. Hearne stood beside the man, 'naked as he was born,' 'and, notwithstanding I was all attention, I could not detect the deceit.' Of course, Hearne believes that this was mere legerdemain, and (p. 216) mentions a most suspicious circumstance. The account is amusing, and deserves the attention of Mr. Neville Maskelyne. The same conjurer had previously swallowed a cradle! Now bayonet swallowing, which he also did, is possible, though Hearne denies it (p. 217).|$|E
6000|$|Now in {{contrast}} to all these abominations, old Salvian sets, boldly and honestly, the superior morality of the barbarians. That, he says, {{is the cause of}} their strength and our weakness. We, professing orthodoxy, are profligate hypocrites. They, half heathens, half Arians, are honester men, purer men than we. There is no use, he says, in despising the Goths as heretics, while they are better men than we. They are better Christians than the Romans, because they are better men. They pray to God for success, and trust in him, and we presumptuously trust in ourselves. We swear by Christ: <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> do but blaspheme him, when we swear 'Per Christum tollo eum,' 'I will make away with him,' 'Per Christum hunc jugulo,' 'I will cut his throat,' and then believe ourselves bound to commit the murder which we have vowed? [...] . 'The Saxons,' he says, 'are fierce, the Franks faithless, the Gepidae inhuman, the Huns shameless. But is the Frank's perfidy as blameable as ours? Is the Alman's drunkenness, or the Alan's rapacity, as damnable as a Christian's? If a Hun or a Gepid deceives you, what wonder? He is utterly ignorant that there is any sin in falsehood. But what of the Christian who does the same? The Barbarians,' he says, 'are better men than the Christians. The Goths,' he says, 'are perfidious, but chaste. The Alans unchaste, but less perfidious. The Franks are liars, but hospitable; the Saxons ferociously cruel, but venerable for their chastity. The Visigoths who conquered Spain,' he says, 'were the most [...] "ignavi" [...] (heavy, I presume he means, and loutish) of all the barbarians: but they were chaste, and therefore they conquered.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Not a scriptural development. Let me {{press on}} you, my {{clerical}} brethren, most earnestly this one point. It is {{time that we}} should make up our minds what tone Scripture does take toward nature, natural science, natural Theology. Most of you, I doubt not, have made up your minds already; and in consequence have no fear of natural science, no fear for natural Theology. But I cannot deny that I find still lingering here and there certain of the old views of nature of which I used to hear but too much some five-and-thirty years ago--and that from better men than I shall ever hope to be--who used to consider natural Theology as useless, fallacious, impossible; {{on the ground that}} this Earth did not reveal the will and character of God, because it was cursed and fallen; and that its facts, in consequence, were not to be respected or relied on. This, I was told, was the doctrine of Scripture, and was therefore true. But when, longing to reconcile my conscience and my reason on a question so awful to a young student of natural science, I went to my Bible, what did I find? No word of all this. Much--thank God, I may say one continuous undercurrent--of the very opposite of all this. I pray you bear with me, even though I may seem impertinent. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> find in the Bible, with the exception of that first curse? That, remember, cannot mean any alteration in the laws of nature by which man's labour should only produce for him henceforth thorns and thistles. For, in the first place, any such curse is formally abrogated in the eighth chapter and 21st verse of the very same document--"I will not again curse the earth any more for man's sake. While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease." [...] And next: the fact is not so; for if you root up the thorns and thistles, and keep your land clean, then assuredly you will grow fruit-trees and not thorns, wheat and not thistles, according to those laws of nature which are the voice of God expressed in facts.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on the 2016 U.S. presidential {{election}} {{in an interview with}} the Radio Times, Attenborough jokingly stated about the rise of Donald Trump: [...] "Well, we lived through that with earlier presidents – they’ve been equally guilty… <b>But</b> <b>what</b> alternative <b>do</b> <b>we</b> have? <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> have any control or influence over the American elections?
