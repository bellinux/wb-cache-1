60|$|We {{passed the}} first {{three or four days}} in looking about us, and, on the whole, we have been rather pleased with the place. Our house is but a stone's throw from the water, at a point where there is what in the Manhattanese dialect would be called a battery.[34] This <b>battery</b> <b>leads</b> to the mole and the great square. At the first corner of the latter stands a small semi-castellated edifice, with the colours of the canton on the window-shutters, which is now in some way {{occupied}} for public purposes, and which formerly was the residence of the bailli, or the local governor that Berne formerly sent to rule them {{in the name of the}} Burgerschaft. The square is quite large, and usually contains certain piles of boards, &c. that are destined for the foot of the lake, lumber being a material article in the commerce of the place. On this square, also, is the ordinary market and several inns. The town-house is an ancient building in a more crowded quarter, and at the northern gate are the remains of another structure that has an air of antiquity, which I believe also belongs to the public. Beyond these and its glorious views, Vévey, in itself, has but little to attract attention. But its environs contain its sources of pride. Besides the lake-shore, which varies in its form and beauties, it is not easy to imagine a more charming acclivity than that which lies behind the town. The inclination is by no means as great, just at this spot, at it is both farther east and farther west, but it admits of cultivation, of sites for hamlets, and is much broken by inequalities and spacious natural terraces. I cannot speak with certainty of the extent of this acclivity, but, taking the eye for a guide, I should think there is quite a league of the inclined plane in view from the town. It is covered with hamlets, chateaux, country-houses, churches and cottages, and besides its vines, of which there are many near the town, it is highly beautiful from the verdure of its slopes, its orchards, and its groves of nut-trees.|$|E
50|$|The battery {{used in the}} H100 {{series is}} {{physically}} similar to the battery used in iPods and other DAPs. It is possible to replace the factory battery with a higher capacity one (up to 2200 mA·h has been reported) for greatly increased playback time. In some instances the polarity of the <b>battery</b> <b>leads</b> must be reversed, and the installation process will void the warranty.|$|E

Death caused by aggravated battery (vold med døden til følge) describes the situation where the perpetrator has the intention to commit an aggravated battery but where the <b>battery</b> <b>leads</b> to the unintentional death of the victim. The punishment is imprisonment for up to ten years.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{rectangular}} plan design, {{with the main}} battery oriented towards the sea, while the smaller main building is oriented towards land. The battery emplacements had parapets of shallow height, that were expanded to include four cannons. The strong house is subdivided into three compartments, with vaulted ceiling, and a terrace for defence. In {{the centre of the}} structure is a cistern. The frontspeice is marked by a portico, with simple arch flanked on either side by geometric pieces of masonry, while surmounted by the coat-of-arms and crown of Portugal in stone. Initially the fort consisted of {{a rectangular}} plan, in which the side facing the land included three rectangular, vaulted divisions. An intermediary plan with enclosure, from which was organized the communication of the fort, quarters and by staircase the cannon emplacements. The latter, of reasonable dimensions, occupied about half the surface of walls, and could accommodate seven pieces of artillery firing at will. Another staircase, developed on one wall of the <b>battery,</b> <b>leads</b> to a paved terrace and parapet, which served as a musket firing line.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe need of {{high energy}} density <b>battery</b> <b>leads</b> to explore new {{materials}} for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Recent study focused on the uses of molybdenum oxides as an alternate to carbon anode for LIBs. To obtain better electrochemical performance nano belts of MoO 3 were prepared using one step hydrothermal synthesis, whereas MoO 2 was prepared by heating MoO 3 in reducing atmosphere. Effect of binder selection {{on the performance of}} MoO 3 was studied and found that CMC binder exhibits better electrochemical performance compared to PVDF. It has also been observed that the cyclic stability of MoO 3 electrode using PVDF binder was improved dramatically when the electrode was heated above 220 °C in vacuum. A stable capacity of 600 mAh g- 1 was obtained for MoO 3 electrode using CMC binder. On the other hand a stable electrochemical performance was achieved for MoO 2. A reversible capacity of 680 mAh g- 1 was achieved after 30 cycles...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid wind-diesel {{systems are}} an {{interesting}} solution for the electrification of isolated consumers. The proposed system, including a properly sized <b>battery,</b> <b>leads</b> to a significant reduction of the fuel consumption, in comparison with a diesel-only installation, also protecting the diesel generator from excessive wear. On the other hand, a properly designed wind-diesel installation remarkably reduces the required battery capacity, {{in relation to a}} wind-only based stand-alone system, especially in medium-low wind potential areas. In this context, a complete sizing model, based on a long-term energy production cost analysis is developed, able to predict the optimum configuration of a hybrid wind-diesel stand-alone system on the basis of minimum long-term cost. According to the application results obtained for representative wind potential cases, the proposed hybrid system guarantees one year's long energy autonomy of a typical remote consumer, presenting a significant cost advantage in relation either to a diesel-only or to a wind-based stand-alone system.

40|$|In the {{development}} of the next generation of batteries with high capacity, improving our understanding of the complex interplay between mechanics and chemistry in electrode materials appears as a crucial issue. The lithiation reactions in <b>batteries</b> <b>lead</b> to a variety of mechanical phenomena, such as large deformations, plasticity and fracture. Conversely, mechanics can influence the chemistry of lithiation in a significant manner. Stress affects the kinetics of surface and bulk reactions and the diffusion of lithium within the host. In this work we develop a continuum theory to investigate the strong coupling between mechanics and chemistry in electrode materials. The theory couples mass transport to large, inelastic deformations and is written within a consistent thermodynamic framework. In particular, the model introduces a coupling between the kinetics of plastic flow and that of insertion reaction. The model formulation and parameter identification is supported by ab-initio calculations, as well as experimental measurements on thin film electrodes...|$|R
