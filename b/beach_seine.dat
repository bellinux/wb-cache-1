25|$|Substantial fishery {{activities}} {{take place}} throughout {{the range of}} the common stingaree. Large numbers are caught incidentally by trawlers of the Eastern King Prawn (EKP) and the East Coast Trawl Fishery (ECTF) off Queensland, and the Ocean Prawn Trawl Fishery off New South Wales. To a lesser extent, it is also caught by estuary trawl and seine fisheries, <b>beach</b> <b>seine</b> fisheries and, at the southern extreme of its range, the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). Commercially caught rays usually survive to be discarded. However, some fishers remove stingrays from nets using metal spikes to pierce their craniums ("spiking"); stingarees also have a tendency to abort their young when caught. Recreational surf anglers in Queensland and northern New South Wales regularly catch common stingarees, and often leave them on the beach to die.|$|E
2500|$|Sillaginids {{are taken}} {{by a variety of}} fishing methods, with inshore catches {{predominantly}} taken using <b>beach</b> <b>seine</b> nets and cast nets. Due to the alert nature of sillaginids, skill is required on creeping up quietly {{enough to be able to}} net fish with a cast net, with experienced fishers often paddling into the sun toward a school and drifting slowly upon it before casting the net. In deeper waters, commercial trawlers and longliners take the most fish, with a number of sillaginids taken in prawn trawls as bycatch. The fish are normally marketed fresh locally under various names, with [...] "Ashuos" [...] commonly used in many countries for various sillaginids. At least one export fishery exists in Australia whereby S. flindersi is exported to Thailand where the fish are repackaged and sent to Japan frozen.|$|E

50|$|Fairly common {{within its}} range, the brown whipray is {{regularly}} caught by intensive bottom trawl and <b>beach</b> <b>seine</b> fisheries {{operating in the}} Arafura Sea. The skin is highly valued, while the meat and cartilage are also utilized. In 1996 and 1998, this species {{was one of the}} elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) most often caught incidentally by the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) of northern Australia; the survival rate of captured rays seemed to be relatively high. The bycatch rate is thought to have dropped substantially since the mandatory installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) and other bycatch reduction devices on Australian trawlers. As most of the brown whipray's range lies within Australian waters, where it is now minimally threatened by human activity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern.|$|E
