40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic methodology to estimate allowable limits for rail head wear {{in terms of}} vertical head-height loss, gage-face side wear, and/or {{the combination of the}} two. This methodology is based on the principles of engineering fracture mechanics. The concept of applying the principles of engineering fracture mechanics to examine structural integrity was originally introduced by the U. S. Air Force, and is now embraced by the commercial aircraft industry. Aircraft structures are based on fracture mechanics (also referred to as damage tolerance) principles. Moreover, the approach in conducting rail integrity research sponsored by the Government is based on damage tolerance principles. The fracture mechanics methodology to estimate rail head <b>wear</b> <b>limits</b> is based on various assumptions regarding operational and environmental factors. These factors include rail size, foundation modulus, temperature difference, train speed, and rail test interval (i. e. tonnage between rail tests). This paper describes the methodology based on engineering fracture mechanics to estimate rail <b>wear</b> <b>limits.</b> In addition, results and sensitivity studies from applying the methodology are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nickel super-alloys are {{characterized}} by: high temperatures resistance, high hardness and low thermal conductivity. For this reason they {{are widely used}} in critical operating conditions. However, due to their excellent mechanical properties, nickel super-alloys are hard to machine. Tool wear {{is a major problem}} in nickel super-alloys machining; the high temperature at the tool rake face is a principal wear factor. Flank wear is {{the most common type of}} tool wear; it offers predictable and stable tool life evaluation. In this work, the authors present a flank wear evaluation in Inconel 718 turning, in order to develop a predictive model for CAM optimization. An appropriate database has been developed thanks to an experimental activity (VB as a function of: the cutting time T, cutting speed S and feed rate F). The objective of the optimization procedure is to maximize the Material Removal Rate (MRR) under the constraint represented by the flank <b>wear</b> <b>limit.</b> The developed procedure operates directly on the part program code, using the original one as starting point for the application of the knowledge about the wear behaviour. After the optimization phase the given output is represented by a new part program code obtained in accordance with: the maximum MRR within the respect of the <b>wear</b> <b>limit...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Brakes {{and tires}} {{are the major}} {{contributors}} for catastrophic failure of ground vehicles. Braking system is the utmost important besides tire {{to ensure the safety}} of users and vehicle. Ensuring good condition of brake lining is very crucial to ensure the efficiency of the braking system, where, the worn off brake lining not only endangers life but also damages the entire brake associated parts such as hub, disk, shaft, etc. In this paper, Malaysian made luxury car Proton Perdana V 6 brake pads were investigated to be embedded with a lining <b>wear</b> <b>limit</b> alert system. The current spring steel alert system has some drawbacks where, the alerting sound is only activated while the car moves and secondly, when the car is on move, rarely the alerting sound reaches the driver. Therefore, a critical investigation of the existing pads manufactured in Malaysia and their characterizations are conducted to identify the most suitable sensor spot on the brake pad. Later, a micro sensor is embedded into the pad and fully tested on a specially designed test rig. The evaluation of thickness, hardness, layer properties and critical wear region has enabled the spotting of exact sensor location. The embedment of the micro switch was successfully done and tested to be very efficient in alerting the driver upon reaching the maximum lining <b>wear</b> <b>limit.</b> Index Term — Brake lining monitoring system, Micro switch, micro sensing, brake pad evaluation...|$|R
5000|$|Tributaries {{flowing into}} the Minnesota River had to drop down into the deep glacial valley, {{creating}} numerous waterfalls. [...] The waterfall on Minneopa Creek was likely once near its mouth on the river. Over the millennia downcutting of the creek has carved a gorge through the soft Jordan Sandstone, causing the waterfall to [...] "migrate" [...] upstream. [...] The double waterfall in Minneopa {{is the result of}} there being three layers of differing hardness in the sandstone. The upper and lower layers are softer than the middle, which creates a short stretch of erosion-resistant creekbed between two waterfalls. [...] The gorge is littered with blocks of the middle sandstone that broke off as the supporting layer <b>below</b> <b>wore</b> away. Weathering from the constant spray of the falls helps keep the gorge walls nearly vertical.|$|R
