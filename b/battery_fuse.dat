They are used also in electric vehicles, e.g., in forklift trucks. Because strip fuses require the use of tools for replacement they are therefore legally considered non-serviceable components for end-users.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, Fisher-Price {{undertook}} a monumental recall {{of up to}} 10 million Power Wheels 12 volt and Super 6 volt vehicles manufactured since 1986. The recall and repair program was conducted to replace <b>battery</b> <b>fuses</b> and strengthen <b>battery</b> connectors {{in order to prevent}} the units from overheating. The main difference of a post recall Power Wheel is that the original [...] "H" [...] (or on very early Power Wheels, [...] "S") connectors are removed and replaced with the larger, black [...] "A" [...] connectors. If a Power Wheels ride-on was built in or before 1998 and has the Black [...] "A" [...] connectors, then the recall work has probably been performed.|$|R

25|$|No {{one in the}} {{collective}} was experienced with explosives. Terry Robbins and Cathy Wilkerson lacked knowledge even in the basics of electricity. Members worked up a simple circuit without safety features, consisting of a <b>battery,</b> a <b>fuse,</b> a clock, and wires connecting these elements. They inserted dynamite into a one-foot length of water pipe packed with nails. Precisely what went wrong remains uncertain, but the resulting series of blasts in the sub-basement of the townhouse killed those near the bomb and caused {{the collapse of the}} townhouse.|$|R
50|$|Externally, {{a notable}} {{feature of the}} 404 and 405 was the {{abandonment}} of the BMW-style radiator grille for one much more like an aero-engine. The 405, although the only four-door car ever built by Bristol, had styling {{that the company was}} later to refine for many years on their later Chrysler V8-engined cars during the 1960s. It was also the model that introduced the Bristol feature of sizable lockers in the front wings accessed externally by gullwing doors. The locker on the nearside held the spare wheel and jack, whilst that on the offside housed the <b>battery</b> and <b>fuse</b> panel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine requires regular maintenance to ensure its continued function. Engine oil, power steering and brake fluid are examples of engine maintenance that must be kept and checked at regular intervals. Often wear and tear over time can leave an engine totally unusable, {{in which case the}} restorer might remove the existing engine {{and replace it with a}} similar or modern engine substitute. In order to conduct an engine restoration first a technician will conduct a thorough inspection. Often pre-restored vehicle have engines that have gone without maintenance for years and therefore require engine restoration to return them to working order. The engine is removed from the car and inspected for broken and non-functional parts. Typical parts that require replacing include the pistons, spark plugs, fuel lines <b>battery,</b> <b>fuses,</b> timing belt and various gaskets. All are subject to deterioration over time. Structural components like the engine block, cam shaft and crank shaft are less likely to require repair but not uncommon. [...] Typically, after all required parts are gathered, the disassembled pieces will be cleaned, lubricated (if required), and reassembled. The engine is then replaced within the car. A mechanic will then perform a series of tests to ensure that the engine is in working, road worthy condition. [...] This is known as a pre-start engine check. First all the lines and hoses are checked for breaks and leaks. Second the radiator is topped off with water to ensure that the system is sealed off. Next the oil level is replenished. Finally the battery charge is checked and the ignition system is inspected. The engine is then ready to be started.|$|R
5000|$|As well as {{releasing}} surges {{of electromagnetic}} energy, Static can also drain sources of electricity, such as power lines, <b>batteries</b> and <b>fuse</b> boxes to recharge/replenish his own energy supply. Whenever Static has used his powers {{to a high}} degree, or experience any other such large energy-drain, he will also experience a sudden, acute sense of fatigue, as his electromagnetic powers are tied into his own bioelectric energy levels. In the episode [...] "Aftershock", in the 1st season of the animated series, an analysis of his blood shows that Static's electrolytes/blood-salt levels are higher-than-normal, highlighting that Static needs higher blood-salt levels to {{support the use of}} his powers, but the higher sodium levels seem to have no effect on his health.|$|R
40|$|A {{thermal plasma}} is an {{electrically}} conductive gas capable of generating temperatures up to 10, 000 ?C near its column. The energy generated by plasma arcs {{has recently been}} applied to hazardous waste disposal. Since 1989 the US Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Laboratories have been active participants {{in research and development}} toward establishing plasma arc technology (PAT) as an efficient, economical and safe hazardous waste immobilization tool. In the U. S. the removal and disposal of asbestos contaminated material (ACM) generate significant amounts of hazardous waste. Recently, PAT has been used to convert ACM safely and efficiently into an innocuous ceramic substance no longer requiring Class I disposal. In addition to ACM waste disposal, PAT meets the waste disposal needs of pyrotechnic smoke assemblies, thermal <b>batteries,</b> proximity <b>fuses,</b> and contaminated soil. This paper will provide an overview of PAT and discuss Army and Department of Defense hazardous waste disposal needs...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{substation}} {{transformer protection}} was pro-vided by relayed circuit breakers or circuit-switchers, power fuses, or relayed-remote fault-interrupting schemes. Relayed protective schemes required an expen-sive substation control house and station <b>batteries.</b> Power <b>fuses</b> {{can only be}} applied where the continuous and fault-interrupting currents are within their more limited capa-bilities. A new transformer protective device was recently developed to address the short-comings of traditional pro-tective measures. The device has high interrupting capac-ity similar to circuit breakers, and higher continuous current capacity than fuses. But, like power fuses, the new device derives power for fault sensing and tripping from the fault current itself – a relay control house is not required {{and the need for}} batteries and associated mainte-nance is eliminated, providing the most economical pro-tection possible. Unlike power fuses, separate secondary neutral current sensing can be applied for more sensitive protection against ground faults and three-phase tripping is possible, even for single-phase faults. The transformer protective device has a 31. 5 -kA inter-rupting rating and a total 5 -cycle operating time. It is pow-ered from the current transformers installed on the primary bushings of the transformer. It is furnished with a compact control cabinet, which contains three single-phase self-powered overcurrent relays, and optional fourth secondary neutral current relay. The electrically linked pole-units are lightweight and have minimal real estate requirements. In many cases, the device can be installed on the transformer, or on existing structures...|$|R
