500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was looking at them when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
500|$|Stenson {{assessed}} that Steph [...] "really isn't all bad, {{more of a}} lovable rogue {{who just}} likes making mischief for attention." [...] She deemed her character [...] "very unpredictable", {{with a great deal}} of confidence. The LINC Online called her a [...] "beautiful blonde wild child with a penchant for arrogance and displays of egotism". Sarah Moolla of The People branded her [...] "superficial", the Daily Record Merle Brown referred to her as [...] "a true [...] female, and Emma Johnson of the Liverpool Echo assessed that she had a [...] "couldn't-care-less" [...] attitude. BBC America described Steph as a two-sided character. They observed that as well as a bitch, she could be [...] "dishonest, vain, jealous and small-minded", and wrote [...] "She causes trouble when she wants to and will happily lie and gossip to get her own way." [...] Conversely, they noted that for those on her good side, [...] "She can <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> friend, a confidante and sweet natured girl".|$|E
500|$|Lynsey Hanley {{writing for}} The Daily Telegraph {{described}} [...] "Girl" [...] as an obvious {{choice for a}} single and hailed it as [...] "Beyoncé's requisite feminist anthem". A reviewer from Billboard magazine felt that the band's [...] "personal transition from teen-dom to womanhood" [...] was most evident on [...] "Girl" [...] among other songs. Slant Magazine's Eic Henderson {{felt that it was}} a [...] "smooth bump-and-grinder... almost sunk by the group's hyperbolic vocal arrangements". Vibes writer Dimitri Enrlich concluded, [...] "Destiny's Child refuses to play it safe with cookie-cutter formulas" [...] something he found evident on [...] "Girl". The Observer reviewer Kitty Empire noted that the band's characteristic female solidarity, [...] "is limply expressed in 'Girl', on which they purport to <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> friend". While reviewing #1's, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine described the song as [...] "lovely". Jess Harvell writing for Pitchfork Media opined, [...] "'Girl' was a stroll over a 9th Wonder-produced Dramatics sample through bros-before-hoes territory as latte frothy as its 'Sex & the City' video." [...] Idolator's Mike Wass gave a more mixed review for [...] "Girl" [...] describing it as [...] "slightly sappy".|$|E

500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like that, you need him to <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia." [...] Semin's agent came to his client's defense, stating he [...] "always cares." [...] Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English, the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived, further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted. When asked about the comments, former Capitals forward David Steckel stated that, [...] "It's not like he went out and told lies." [...] Bradley later apologized for his comments in an interview with the Sun Sentinel.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Angie, Den's first wife, Chrissie [...] "has {{a strong}} will and fights {{for what she}} wants". However, as Oberman noted, [...] "there is enough of Angie in Chrissie to see that Den likes {{a certain type of}} strong woman. Chrissie is Angie with 15 years of {{feminism}} behind her", explaining in an interview with Radio 4: [...] "I like to think of Chrissie as Angie with benefits... She's his [...] equal a bit more than Angie was." [...] Oberman later expanded: [...] "Chrissie, unlike Angie, won't hit the bottle as soon as Den starts playing away. She's proved she's ready to sit and wait for her revenge. She's a great, strong character". Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> friend. But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation. Oberman has stated that she was thrilled to be [...] "playing such a strong female character", whom she described as not a bad person at heart but one willing to stand and [...] "fight in her corner".|$|E

2500|$|At Princeton, Cappon {{became known}} for two trademarks. [...] The {{first was the}} [...] "Iron Five," [...] his {{practice}} of picking the five best players and playing them without substitution in every game. [...] The second was the [...] "five-man weave" [...] offense. [...] Cappon once joked about the Iron Five tradition, saying, [...] "If you start five men, they should <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> men, and if they're in shape, and play the way they should, {{there should be no}} need to substitute." [...] After a pause, Cappon then added, [...] "but more important than all that, I haven't got anybody worth a damn on the bench." [...] Cappon did not believe in recruiting, and Princeton did not offer athletic scholarships. [...] Accordingly, Cappon worked with whatever talent showed up. [...] One former Princeton player later wrote: [...] "It was short, white basketball at its best. Cappy's teams and best players were tough, gritty, aggressive, and smart." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Gatiss {{said that}} Capaldi's Doctor was [...] "sort of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and even Christopher Eccleston style...it's someone who's not {{immediately}} going to <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> friend {{and can be}} quite abrupt and rude." [...] Moffat added to this analysis of the character by saying, [...] "He has a tremendous ability with throwaway humour {{and a lot of}} it is around the fact that sometimes he is terribly rude. I think kids will think he is the rude Doctor [...] You might want to cuddle him but he really will resist." [...] It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share [...] "a certain acid wit" [...] of Malcolm Tucker, the role Peter Capaldi is most famous for, [...] "specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous". Capaldi has stated that all of the previous actors who had played the Doctor were channelled in his portrayal and that his particular influences were Hartnell, Pertwee and Davison.|$|E
2500|$|Meyer and Duncan {{made their}} first three vintages at the Christian Brothers winery, and in 1975 bought the Franciscan Winery, selling it in 1978 {{to buy the}} Silver Oak winery near Oakville and buying up new land. The Silver Oak winery began {{production}} in 1981 and the 1982 harvest was considered by Meyer to be [...] "something special" [...] and was attempted to be replicated in later years. Growth of the company from 1977 onwards enabled Silver Oak to purchase further vineyards in the 1980s and early 1990s, {{becoming one of the}} most successful Cabernet Sauvignon brands. By the 1994 vintage, the concept changed and the Silver Oak Napa became a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, but still aged solely in American oak, a California take on the classic Bordeaux chateau-bottled red wine. Meyer was President of the American Vineyard Foundation in the 1990s, and also held several other important positions in the wine industry. He breathed new life into the flailing American Vineyard Foundation from the late 1980s; Wines and Vines stated that Meyer's most important contribution will be his influence in bringing growers and winemakers together to shape the very future of California wine." [...] He trained Daniel Baron extensively to replace himself as Silver Oak's chief winemaker. In the late 1990s, he was diagnosed with Type-2 Diabetes and a degenerative brain disease. In January 2001 he sold his share of the company to Ray Duncan, citing health problems, [...] but continued as a consulting winemaker until his death in August 2002. Meyer once said [...] "Only one wine can <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best,</b> and I felt that cabernet was what we did best in Napa and Sonoma".|$|E

2500|$|On 29 May 1942 it was {{announced}} that all Jews living in the occupied zone had to wear a yellow star of David with the words Juif or Juive written on it at all times by 7 June 1942. Ousby described the purpose of the yellow star [...] "not just to identify but [...] to humiliate, and it worked".On 14 June 1942, a 12-year-old Jewish boy committed suicide in Paris as his classmates were now shunning the boy with the yellow star. As a form of quiet protest, many Jewish veterans started to wear their medals alongside the yellow star, which led the Germans to ban all Jewish veterans from wearing their medals alongside the yellow stars of David due to being [...] "inappropriate", as it increased popular sympathy for men who fought and suffered for France. At times, ordinary people would show sympathy for Jews; as a Scot married to a Frenchman, Janet Teissier du Cros wrote in her diary about a Jewish woman wearing her yellow star of David going shopping: [...] "She came humbly up and stood hesitating {{on the edge of the}} pavement. Jews were not allowed to stand in queues. What they were supposed to do I never discovered. But the moment the people in the queue saw her they signed to her to join us. Secretly and rapidly, as in the game of hunt-the-slipper, she was passed up till she stood at the head of the queue. I am glad to say that not one voice was raised in protest, the policeman standing near turned his head away, and that she got her cabbage before any of us".By 1942, the Paris Kommandantur was receiving an average of 1,500 corbeaux (poison pen letters) a day. One corbeaux written by a Frenchwoman read:"Since you are taking care of the Jews, and if your campaign is not just a vain word, then have a look at the kind of life led by the girl M.A, formerly a dancer, now living at 41 Boulevard de Strasbourg, not wearing a star. This creature, for whom being Jewish is not enough, debauches the husbands of proper Frenchwomen, and you may well have an idea what she is living off. Defend women against Jewishness-that will <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>best</b> publicity, and you will return a French husband to his wife". In the summer of 1942, a committee consisting of SS Hauptsturmführer Theodor Dannecker, the Commissioner for Jewish Affairs Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, and general secretary of the police René Bousquet had been planning a grand rafle (great round-up) of Jews to deport to the death camps. On the morning of 16 July 1942, the grand rafle was launched with 9,000 French policemen rounding up the Jews of Paris, leading to some 12,762 Jewish men, women and children being arrested and brought to the Val d'Hiv sports stadium, from where they were sent to the Drancy camp and finally Auschwitz. The grand rafle was a joint operation; the overwhelming majority of those who arrested the Jews were French policemen. During the grand rafle, some 100 Jews warned by friends in the police killed themselves, while 24 Jews were killed resisting arrest. One Jewish Frenchwoman, Madame Rado, who was arrested during the grand rafle with her four children, noted about the watching bystanders: [...] "Their expressions were empty, apparently indifferent". When taken with the other Jews to the Place Voltaire, one woman was heard to shout [...] "Well done! Well done!" [...] while the man standing to her warned her [...] "After them, it'll be us. Poor people!". Rado herself survived Auschwitz, but her four children were killed in the gas chambers.|$|E
