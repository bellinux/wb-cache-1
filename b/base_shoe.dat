5000|$|The use of pads is controversial. Some {{criticize the}} band {{that holds the}} pad on, which they believe cuts into the hoof and may wear a slot into it. However, {{trainers}} commonly loosen the band when the horse is not being exercised, which may minimize the problem. Under normal conditions, if a pad is lost, it usually only affects the pad and not the <b>base</b> <b>shoe,</b> which remains intact. Injuries are usually very limited from [...] "throwing" [...] a set of pads. It is dangerous if a horse wearing pads pulls off a shoe, as not only will the pad come off, but the band may tear off part of the hoof wall. Horses wearing pads should not be turned out.|$|E

5000|$|Stacks are {{composed}} of multiple hoof-shaped pads, (wafer-like hoof-shaped objects) usually made of plastic, although {{they can also be}} made of leather, rubber or polyurethane. Ordinary pads are added under a horse's natural hoof, with a horseshoe at ground level. While single, relatively thin pads, either flat or with a small wedge-shaped, are used with horseshoes in many circumstances and can protect the sole of the hoof or make simple alterations to action. But in this context, as an action device, stacks (also called [...] "performance packages") are built-up sets of multiple pads, sometimes of a combination of materials, and can even be made of wood. They vary in height; they may be up to 4 in thick in the heel and no more than 2 in thick in the toe. Pads that are built up on a horseshoe have a metal band that runs across the front of the hoof to help keep them on the horse's foot. This design is an extension of a <b>base</b> <b>shoe,</b> and can be taken off or changed without having to completely re-shoe the horse. While the design is intended to exaggerate the horse's action, the shape of the stacks and added weight to the horse’s foot cause the foot to strike with more force and at an abnormal angle. [...] Soring occurs when items are concealed between the pad and hoof such that painful pressure occurs to the sole of the hoof making the horse lift its feet faster and higher. [...] Permissible thickness` and weight vary between categories of competition.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing trend among shoe {{manufacturers}} to introduce customized shoes to satisfy varying customer style, fit, and comfort needs, thus to increase the product's added value. This study presents a computer-aided design (CAD) system for designing a customized shoe last based on the chosen shoe style and customer's foot features. The CAD system first automatically extracts 18 important foot features from a laser-scanned customer's foot. Then, it applies a global grading with a local deformation approach that can deform the <b>base</b> <b>shoe</b> last with the customer's chosen style to the customized shoe last based on the extracted foot features while maintaining the customer's chosen style. Finally, the system evaluates the final foot shoe last fit and represents the fit in a contoured figure. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed CAD system can be adopted by shoe manufacturers to make customized shoes with the customer's chosen style and foot size and shape. close 121...|$|E
