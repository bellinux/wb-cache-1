DeWyze has since expressed dissatisfaction with the album and said that winning American Idol did not turn out to <b>be</b> <b>everything</b> that he had thought it would be.|$|E

500|$|Family matters {{also made}} Priestley's time in America difficult. His {{youngest}} son Harry died on December 11, 1795, probably of malaria. Mary Priestley died on September 17, 1796; {{she was already}} ill and never fully recovered after the shock of her son's death. On September 19 of that year Joseph wrote: [...] "This day I bury my wife....she had taken much thought in planning the new house and {{now that it is}} far advanced and promises to <b>be</b> <b>everything</b> she wished, she is removed to another." [...] After dinner on Monday 14 April 1800, various members of Priestley's household fell ill, with symptoms of food poisoning, which prompted the Reading Advertiser to falsely accuse Priestley's son William, of trying to poison them with arsenic.|$|E

After Gaga sings [...] "I'm gonna drink my tears and cry / 'cos I know you love me baby" [...] during the techno-inspired bridge, she alludes to the alleged affair between Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy with the lyrics [...] "Put your hands on me / John F. Kennedy / I'll make you squeal baby", singing in an impassive and monotonous manner.|$|E

It's more about our people than {{it is about the}} organization itself this time around." [...] It was noted that [...] "the bad guy [...] is in charge and Inhumans are being hunted" [...] could be taken as a commentary on the political climate under the Presidency of Donald Trump. On approaching this subject, Tancharoen said that there was no nervousness in the writer's room, and Whedon said that the similarities to Trump's America was simply an attempt to [...] "paint the reality where, what if the world just turned upside down?" [...] The pod sees Hydra based out of the Triskelion, a S.H.I.E.L.D. building that was destroyed by Hydra previously in the MCU. It also features the return of the character Grant Ward to the series, with Whedon explaining, [...] "We figured when you get dropped into an alternate reality, what better way to show that it might not <b>be</b> <b>everything</b> you imagined than the return of one of our most loved and most hated characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Songs of Innocence {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticised Songs of Innocence for [...] "aim for a one-size-fits-all, vaguely inspirational tone, with a lean approach to details despite the press kit assertion that it's all 'very, very personal'". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said U2 [...] "sounded as impersonal as ever" [...] {{and that the}} album was [...] "flat and strangely complacent", while finding the more personal songs derivative of contemporary rock bands such as Imagine Dragons and Airborne Toxic Event. In a review for The Guardian, Caspar Llewellyn Smith wrote that U2 was [...] "treading old ground without much {{of a sense of}} how to move forward." [...] Ben Patashnik of NME said only [...] "Iris", [...] "Song for Someone", and [...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] were [...] "standouts", and he criticised the release strategy, judging [...] "the fact it's free makes it seem cheap." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine deemed the album a thematic success that was [...] "otherwise marred by the kind of slick MOR pablum that plagued the band's last few efforts". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt U2 did not challenge themselves sonically and that the album represents the contradictions in the band's music: [...] "They camouflage their nostalgia in the sound of modernity; they play gigantic music about intimacy... They want to <b>be</b> <b>everything</b> to everyone and, in attempting to do so, they've wound up with a record that appeals to a narrow audience".|$|E

2500|$|The Wizard is the {{national}} leader of Oz, thus it is fitting for him to symbolize the President(s) of the United States during the 19th century. Politicians {{have been known to}} have many faces; it is a must {{if they want to be}} able to <b>be</b> <b>everything</b> for everyone. The Great and Terrible Wizard of Oz agrees to meet with each traveler separately, allowing him to alter his appearance to best fit each character. When the gang returns having completed the Wizard's task, they discover that the Wizard is a fake and is actually just [...] "a common man" [...] who has made everyone believe he was powerful. The Scarecrow adds that he is a humbug, in which the Wizard gladly says that is he is exactly that. The Wizard made promises he could not keep, as did many 19th-century politicians. The Wizard later states: [...] "How can I help being a humbug… when all these people make me do things that everyone knows can't be done," [...] showing that he was able to deceive others because others were willing to be deceived.|$|E
2500|$|Krause {{made another}} {{transaction}} in 1988 to which Jordan strongly objected. It {{was clear that}} the Bulls needed a center if they were to contend for a title, so Krause dealt Charles Oakley to New York for Bill Cartwright. Oakley, who happened to be Jordan's best friend on the team, was extremely tough, particularly on the boards and on defense. When the Pistons came after Jordan with their physical players, Oakley was his bodyguard. Cartwright was a true center, unlike the power forward Oakley, but was much older. Although Cartwright did not have Oakley's reputation as a lockdown defender, he was very effective at preventing opposing centers from dominating games, and was a more capable inside scorer. Jordan despised the trade, {{not only because of the}} players involved but also because of how they learned of it: via television, while he and Oakley were on their way to Las Vegas to see a Mike Tyson fight. Cartwright turned out to <b>be</b> <b>everything</b> the Bulls needed, however, providing a presence in the middle for all three Bulls championships from 1991–1993. Perhaps most importantly, Cartwright proved to be the league's best center at defending Patrick Ewing, the New York Knicks' star who was the key player on the Bulls' most important early-1990s conference rival.|$|E

2500|$|After the Council, Paul VI contributed in {{two ways}} to the {{continued}} growth of ecumenical dialogue. The separated brothers and sisters, as he called them, {{were not able to}} contribute to the Council as invited observers. After the Council, many of them took initiative to seek out their Catholic counterparts and the Pope in Rome, who welcomed such visits. But the Catholic Church itself recognized from the many previous ecumenical encounters, that much needed to be done within, to be an open partner for ecumenism. To those who are entrusted the highest and deepest truth and therefore, so Paul VI, believed that he had the most difficult part to communicate. Ecumenical dialogue, in the view of Paul VI, requires from a Catholic the whole person: one's entire reason, will, and heart. Paul VI, like Pius XII before him, was reluctant to give in on a lowest possible point. And yet, Paul felt compelled to admit his ardent Gospel-based desire to <b>be</b> <b>everything</b> to everybody and to help all people Being the successor of Peter, he felt the words of Christ, [...] "Do you love me more" [...] like a sharp knife penetrating to the marrow of his soul. These words meant to Paul VI love without limits, and they underscore the Church's fundamental approach to ecumenism.|$|E
2500|$|Critics' {{reviews of}} From the Sky Down were mixed. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an {{enthusiastic}} review, describing it as [...] "one {{of the most}} transcendent close-up looks at {{the process of creating}} rock & roll I've ever seen." [...] In his opinion, the film was a [...] "stirring testament to what it really means when four people in this world can create magical things because they band together." [...] Hank Steuver of The Washington Post called it an [...] "intriguing" [...] documentary that [...] "becomes a revealing and even enlightening meditation on the mystery of why some bands stay together and some don't." [...] The reviewer said the film is [...] "refreshingly blunt and beautifully assembled" [...] and praised Guggenheim for asking the band tough questions about that period in their history. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating, calling it an [...] "essential companion piece" [...] to the reissue of Achtung Baby. Wheeler wrote that [...] "the process of U2 dreaming itself a new fashion while struggling to get its joy back is tightly and adroitly explored". Radio broadcaster Alan Cross wrote that the viewer will [...] "come out with a new appreciation of {{what it takes to be}} U2". Cross enjoyed the scenes in which the band revisit old DAT tapes demonstrating the evolution of the songs [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] and [...] "One", along with the animated scenes. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that the documentary is not a [...] "complete record" [...] of Achtung Babys conception, but that it [...] "offers fans a rare glimpse at the process behind U2's music, and for non-fans, it attempts to set a context in which they can appreciate what it is that U2 accomplished". Like other reviewers, he highlighted the scene in which the band revisits the recording of [...] "One" [...] as one of the film's most important. McWeeny ended his review by saying, [...] "This may not <b>be</b> <b>everything</b> I wanted from the movie, but it's solid, and the glimpse we get of real creative alchemy is impressive, indeed." ...|$|E
