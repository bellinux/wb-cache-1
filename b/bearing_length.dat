40|$|This work {{presents}} a sensibility {{analysis for the}} journal bearings of combustion engines mass balancing systems. Applying it, it's possible to improve the journal bearings and avoid possible failures. This analysis consists on studying {{the effects of the}} variation of the journal bearings main parameters (radial clearance, journal bearing diameter and journal <b>bearing</b> <b>length)</b> on the journal bearings operating conditions (minimum film thickness, maximum pressure and power loss). The analysis also includes the comparison and selection of the different metallic materials {{that can be used in}} these journal bearings, as well as the selection of the lubrication system groove suitable for the journal bearings used in this kind of application. This sensibility analysis shows that: increasing the radial clearance, the minimum film thickness increases, the maximum pressure remains approximately the same and the power loss decreases; increasing the journal <b>bearing</b> <b>length,</b> the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases; increasing the journal bearing diameter, the minimum film thickness and power loss increase and the maximum pressure decreases.

40|$|Summary. -Experiments are {{described}} which show {{the effects of}} <b>bearing</b> <b>length,</b> bearing clearance, and lubricant viscosity on the critical whirling speeds of a single-shaft rotor system supported in plain bearings. The critical speed of a two-bearing-shaft rotor system is shown to depend upon rotor unbalance for bearings of normaI clearance. When the clearance is small relative to the <b>bearing</b> <b>length,</b> unsymmetric stiffness characteristics are obtained and produce two critical speeds instead of one. The lubricant in a drip-ieed bearing is shown to have a stiffening effect, with consequent increase of critical whirling speed. It is also shown that the critical whirl amplitudes with dry bearings can be appreciably larger than those obtained with lubricated bearings. 1. 1.

The experiments described in this report show the effects that lubrication and dimensional changes of plain bearings can have on the critical whirling speed of a simple shaft-rotor system. A shaft supported by two bearings with a rotor midway between the bearings, is shown to have non-linear stiffness characteristics.

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members have}} many {{advantages}} over hot-rolled steel members. However, they {{are susceptible to}} various buckling modes at stresses below the yield stress of the member because of their relatively high width-to-thickness ratio. Web crippling {{is a form of}} localized failure mode that can occur when the members are subjected to transverse high concentrated loadings and/or reactions. The four common loading conditions are the end-one-flange (EOF), interior-one-flange (IOF), end-two-flange (ETF) and interior-two-flange (ITF) loadings. Recently a test method has been proposed by AISI to obtain the web crippling capacities under these four loading conditions. Using this test method 42 tests were conducted in this research to investigate the web crippling behavior and strengths of unlipped channels with stocky webs under ETF and ITF cases. DuraGal sections having a nominal yield stress of 450 MPa were tested with different web slenderness and <b>bearing</b> <b>lengths.</b> The flanges of these channel sections were not fastened to the supports. In this research the suitability of the currently available design rules for unlipped channels subject to web crippling was investigated, and suitable modifications were proposed where necessary.

40|$|Variation in equine hoof {{conformation}} between farriery interventions lacks research, despite {{associations with}} distal limb injuries. This study aimed to determine linear and angular hoof variations pre- and post-farriery within a {{four to six}} week shoeing/trimming interval. Seventeen hoof and distal limb measurements were drawn from lateral and anterior digital photographs from 26 horses pre- and post-farriery. Most lateral view variables changed significantly. Reductions of the dorsal wall, and weight bearing and coronary band lengths resulted in an increased vertical orientation of the hoof. The increased dorsal hoof wall angle, heel angle, and heel height illustrated this further, improving dorsopalmar alignment. Mediolateral measurements of coronary band and weight <b>bearing</b> <b>lengths</b> reduced, whilst medial and lateral wall lengths from the 2 D images increased, indicating an increased vertical hoof alignment. Additionally, dorsopalmar balance improved. However, the results demonstrated that a four to six week interval is sufficient for a palmer shift in the centre of pressure, increasing the loading on acutely inclined heels, altering DIP angulation, and increasing the load on susceptible structures (e. g., DDFT). Mediolateral variable asymmetries suit the lateral hoof landing and unrollment pattern of the foot during landing. The results support regular (four to six week) farriery intervals for the optimal prevention of excess loading of palmar limb structures, reducing long-term injury risks through cumulative, excessive loading...|$|R
