25|$|India had won {{the series}} 1–0, and secured their first series victory in England since 1986. Overall, the series had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> one, with two evenly matched sides {{competing}} well. England were unlucky not to win the first test at Lords due to rain, although they had had their chances. India seized on the opportunities they created at Trent Bridge to take the lead, and then first and foremost batted England out of contention in the final test, before thinking about winning it, which they did very effectively.|$|E

He prepared to enter the Nikolaevskoe Cavalry School. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a cornet in the Horse Guards Regiment, which his father had once commanded and in which he had been enrolled at birth. He is reputed to have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> equestrian, and he competed in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, coming seventh. Before World War I, he instigated the idea of a national Russian sports competition, the very beginning of what under Soviet rule became the Spartakiad.|$|E

They had no family in Canada and, after their two children were born, they searched for a spiritual home and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1964. [...] "We were pacifists before we were Quakers," [...] Franklin says, [...] "but it was a very easy transition to Quakerism for us, and it has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> home and an extended family for us and our children." [...] Franklin spent her last years in a nursing home with Fred, who survived her. She died on July 22, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

He said that Cobb had not <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> fielder, [...] "so he blamed me."

2500|$|José Perurena, {{president}} of the International Canoe Federation expressed his satisfaction with the coverage on the closing press conference of the event, having emphasized the records that were set in the World Championship: [...] "I'm absolutely content. The finals over the weekend took place {{in front of a}} crowd of 15,000 people, and more than 400 correspondents reported from the event, both are record numbers in the history of canoeing." [...] Perurena also highlighted the innovative technologies that debuted on the competition and made the broadcast more enjoyable. His view was shared by Italian Canoe Federation president Luciano Buonfiglio, who stated that [...] "for the member countries of the international federation, Szeged has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> occasion, in the best way, to showcase our sport on the international stage.

2500|$|The town of Yucca Valley {{has had a}} {{contract}} with Copeland Lowery since January 2003. [...] The town initially paid $3,000 per month plus expenses; that was increased in August 2005 to $3,500. (The Center for Public Integrity shows [...] "less than $10,000" [...] in fees for both 2003 and 2004.; the difference was presumably part of the underreporting that was identified in June 2006.) Since contracting with Copeland Lowery, the town has received nearly $4.4 million in federal funds, with money going toward road improvements, better flood control and two solar projects for municipal buildings. [...] The firm lobbies not only Lewis, but also California's two U.S. senators and others who may {{have a role in}} issues of concern, Town Manager Andy Takata said. [...] "We felt they have done a good job for us," [...] Takata said. [...] "Jerry Lewis has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> Congressman for us all these years."

2500|$|In 1924 Crawford {{finished}} {{up at his}} grammar school {{with the intention of}} traveling. At the young age of 16 he found himself on a ship destined for Australia, and arrived on its shores in 1924. Crawford had originally intended to travel to Canada, however, his father suggested Australia because of the warmer climate. Crawford described his younger self as a [...] "starry eyed idealist". Once in Australia, Crawford worked as a stockman on a cattle station known as 'Kamileroi'. For the next five years, he worked as a station hand in the Gulf Country. Working in the Gulf Country alongside the Indigenous Australian people and seeing the brutal way in which they were treated spurred Crawford's passion for equal rights. His empathy for the Indigenous Australians can be seen in this quote taken from an interview, [...] "the Aborigine has always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> humane person". Crawford's first brush with the law was because he gave meat (intended for white people) to Aboriginal stockmen while he worked as a butcher. He considered himself lucky as he was not thrown in gaol but given a warning by the police. He used this personal experience as inspiration for his plays. [...] With the intention of travelling around Australia, Crawford undertook menial work to make the necessary money. [...] Although his time working and travelling around Australia was an experience, Crawford stated [...] "you wouldn't get me back there".|$|E
