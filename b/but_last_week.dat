During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half.

We did good when we first moved, <b>but</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> we did not have a good week, ratings wise. It is going to take the people that like the show to watch the show and start the campaign and show their support if they want to see us stick around for another season." ...|$|E
