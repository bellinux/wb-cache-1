Critics claimed that it led Blair to see military force as [...] "just another foreign policy option" [...] {{and that the}} apparent ease of the success shifted his focus towards {{the effectiveness of the}} use of force rather than the political and military risks. In his autobiography, Blair described the operation as one of the least-discussed aspects of his time in office <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of which he is most proud. He was keen to intervene in other African nations where civilian populations were at risk, particularly Darfur and Zimbabwe, but a lack of political support, combined with the pressure of large deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq after the 11 September attacks on the United States, prevented further interventions in Africa. It was not until 2011—when Operation Ellamy was launched as part of a multi-national intervention in Libya—that the United Kingdom undertook another military intervention in Africa.|$|E
6000|$|This is {{an entirely}} {{different}} question from that concerning the [...] rate of wages before discussed (Book II, Chap. II). That had to do [...] {{with the amount of}} the capital which each laborer, on an average, [...] received as real wages, and this average rate was affected by the [...] number of competitors for labor, as compared with the existing [...] capital, taking into account the nature of the industries in a [...] country. An increase of population, bringing more laborers to [...] compete for employment, will lower the average amount of real [...] wages received by each one; and a decrease of population will [...] bring about the reverse. The rate of wages, however, now that we [...] are considering the matter {{from the point of view}} of the [...] capitalist, is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> to be considered affecting [...] cost of labor. The former question was one as to the [...] distribution of capital; the latter is one as to the amount by [...] which the total production is greater than the total capital [...] advanced. Since all capital consists of advances to labor, the [...] present inquiry is one in regard to the quantity of advances [...] compared with the quantity returned; that is, the relation of the [...] total capital to the total production arising from the use of that [...] capital. In the diagram before used (p. 179) the question is not [...] how the contents of circle B are to be distributed, but the [...] relative size of circle B to circle A. In order to produce circle [...] A, it is necessary to advance what is represented by circle B.|$|E
60|$|This is {{to speak}} of {{literature}} at its highest; and with the four great elders who are still spared to our respect and admiration, with Carlyle, Ruskin, Browning, and Tennyson before us, it would be cowardly to consider it at first in any lesser aspect. But while we cannot follow these athletes, while we may none of us, perhaps, be very vigorous, very original, or very wise, I still contend that, in the humblest sort of literary work, we have it in our power either to do great harm or great good. We may seek merely to please; we may seek, having no higher gift, merely to gratify the idle nine days' curiosity of our contemporaries; or we may essay, however feebly, to instruct. In each of these we shall {{have to deal with}} that remarkable art of words which, because it is the dialect of life, comes home so easily and powerfully to the minds of men; and since that is so, we contribute, in each of these branches, to build up the sum of sentiments and appreciations which goes by the name of Public Opinion or Public Feeling. The total of a nation's reading, in these days of daily papers, greatly modifies the total of the nation's speech; and the speech and reading, taken together, form the efficient educational medium of youth. A good man or woman may keep a youth some little while in clearer air; but the contemporary atmosphere is all-powerful in the end on the average of mediocre characters. The copious Corinthian baseness of the American reporter or the Parisian chroniquear, both so lightly readable, must exercise an incalculable influence for ill; they touch upon all subjects, and on all with the same ungenerous hand; they begin the consideration of all, in young and unprepared minds, in an unworthy spirit; on all, they supply some pungency for dull people to quote. The mere body of this ugly matter overwhelms the rare utterances of good men; the sneering, the selfish, and the cowardly are scattered in broad sheets on every table, while the antidote, in small volumes, lies unread upon the shelf. I have spoken of the American and the French, not because they are so much baser, but so much more readable, than the English; their evil is done more effectively, in America for the masses, in French for the few that care to read; but with us as with them, the duties of literature are daily neglected, truth daily perverted and suppressed, and grave subjects daily degraded in the treatment. The journalist is not reckoned an important officer; yet judge of the good he might do, the harm he does; judge of it by one instance only: that when we find two journals on the reverse sides of politics each, on the same day, openly garbling a piece of news for the interest of its own party, we smile at the discovery (no discovery now!) as over a good joke and pardonable stratagem. Lying so open is scarce lying, it is true; <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that we profess to teach our young is a respect for truth; and I cannot think this piece of education will be crowned with any great success, so long as some of us practise and the rest openly approve of public falsehood.|$|E

All these arguments fail; their fatal flaws have been repeatedly exposed in the literature. However, we give herein a novel, formal modal argument showing that since it's mathematically possible that human minds are hypercomputers, such minds are in fact hypercomputers. We take considerable pains to anticipate and rebut objections to this argument...|$|E
