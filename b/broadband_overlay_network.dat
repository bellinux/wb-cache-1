40|$|Application-layer {{multicast}} (ALM) protocols differ in, {{among other}} aspects, the topology {{of the underlying}} <b>overlay</b> <b>network</b> (e. g., tree, mesh or ring). Therefore, comparing the performance of ALM <b>overlay</b> <b>networks</b> {{is an important step}} towards assessing the inherent advantages and/or limitations of each <b>overlay</b> <b>network</b> topology. In particular, ring-based ALM <b>overlay</b> <b>networks</b> have the advantages of (a) providing a constant node degree; i. e., the number of neighbors each group member has on the <b>overlay</b> <b>network</b> is constant and independent {{of the size of the}} multicast group and (b) enabling the implementation of secure, reliable and totally-ordered message delivery through the use of a ring with a token that contains ordering and flow control information. Motivated thus, we present in this paper a simulation-based performance evaluation and comparison between two ALM <b>overlay</b> <b>networks.</b> The first connects the multicast group members in a ring <b>overlay</b> <b>network</b> while the second connects them in a tree. Simulation results, which have been conducted in J-Sim, have shown that although a ring <b>overlay</b> <b>network</b> incurs a higher path stretch and a higher link stress than a tree <b>overlay</b> <b>network,</b> it provides a constant and lower node degree and a higher data delivery ratio despite the failure/leaving of a single multicast group member than those provided by a tree <b>overlay</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R

While a large collection of scalable peer-to-peer <b>overlay</b> <b>networks</b> has been proposed in recent years, manyfundamental questions have remained open. Some of these are: * Is it possible to design deterministic peer-to-peer <b>overlay</b> <b>networks</b> with properties comparable torandomized peer-to-peer systems? * How can peers of non-uniform bandwidth be organized in an <b>overlay</b> <b>network?</b> We propose a dynamic <b>overlay</b> <b>network</b> called Pagoda that provides solutions to both of these problems. The Pagoda network has a constant degree, a logarithmic diameter, and a 1 /logarithmic expansion, and therefore matches the properties of the best randomized <b>overlay</b> <b>networks</b> known so far. However, incontrast to these networks, the Pagoda is deterministic and therefore guarantees these properties. The Pagoda can be used to organize both nodes with uniform bandwidth and nodes with non-uniform band-width. For nodes with uniform bandwidth, any node insertion or deletion can be executed with logarithmic work, and for nodes with non-uniform bandwidth, any node insertion and deletion can be executedwith polylogarithmic work. Moreover, the Pagoda <b>overlay</b> <b>network</b> can route arbitrary multicast problems with a congestion that is within a logarithmic factor of what a best possible <b>overlay</b> <b>network</b> oflogarithmic degree for that particular multicast problem can achieve, even though the Pagoda is a constant degree network. This holds even for nodes of arbitrary non-uniform bandwidths. We also showthat the Pagoda network can be used for efficient data management...|$|R
