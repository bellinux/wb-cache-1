50|$|<b>Bride</b> <b>kidnapping,</b> {{also known}} as {{marriage}} by abduction or marriage by captive, {{is a form of}} forced marriage practised in some traditional cultures. <b>Bride</b> <b>kidnapping</b> has reportedly occurred in countries spanning Central Asia, the Caucasus region, parts of Africa, and among the Hmong in southeast Asia, the Tzeltal in Mexico, and the Romani in Europe. Though the motivations behind <b>bride</b> <b>kidnapping</b> vary by region, the cultures with traditions of marriage by abduction are generally patriarchal with a strong social stigma against sex or pregnancy outside marriage and illegitimate births. In most cases, however, the men who resort to capturing a wife are often of lower social status, whether because of poverty, disease, poor character or criminality. In some cases, the couple collude together to elope under the guise of a <b>bride</b> <b>kidnapping,</b> presenting their parents with a fait accompli. These men are sometimes deterred from legitimately seeking a wife because of the payment the woman's family expects, the bride price (not to be confused with a dowry, paid by the woman's family).|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} <b>bride</b> <b>kidnapping</b> in Kyrgyzstan is under dispute. Russian and later USSR colonizing powers made the ancient {{practice}} of the nomads illegal, and so {{with the fall of}} the Soviet Union and the subsequent independence of the Central Asian nations, many have revived old customs as a way of asserting cultural identity. Rejecting a kidnapping is often culturally unacceptable for women, and perceived as a rejection of the Kyrgyz cultural identity. The practice is also associated with asserting masculinity. Recent studies challenge the claims that <b>bride</b> <b>kidnapping</b> used to be prevalent. According to Kyrgyz historians, and Fulbright scholar Russell Kleinbach, whereas kidnappings were rare until Soviet times, the <b>bride</b> <b>kidnapping</b> tradition has dramatically increased in the 20th century. The rise in bride kidnappings may be connected with difficulty in paying the required bride price (kalym).|$|E
