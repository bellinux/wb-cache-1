His Historia Anglorum leaves off in 1154, with the promise of another book for the new reign; however since that <b>book</b> was <b>never</b> <b>written</b> it may be assumed that Henry died shortly afterwards.|$|R

50|$|ANNA was a {{prolific}} writer and wrote about {{a variety of}} topics. He did most of his writing after he retired in 1957. He did write a little earlier in life, however; in 1930 he published the first Math book ever written in Tamil. This was the only textbook he wrote {{with the purpose of}} paying back the loans that he had needed to give all of his siblings a solid education. From then on he only <b>wrote</b> religious <b>books,</b> and <b>never</b> <b>wrote</b> for money. All the money he received from the books was donated to the Ramakrishna Mission. In 1946, ANNA wrote his first book based on the Bhagavad Gita; it was published in the city of Attur. Between this time and 1957, ANNA still wrote here and there in his free time.|$|R
50|$|Sun Bin's Art of War (孫臏兵法) is a {{military}} treatise authored by Sun Bin. The book {{was believed to be}} lost after the Han Dynasty, and although there were numerous references to it in post-contemporary texts, some historians still believed that the <b>book</b> was <b>never</b> <b>written</b> and could be a forgery. However, in April 1972, archaeologists excavated several fragments of scrolls from a tomb in Linyi, Shandong province. Sun Bin's Art of War was found among the scrolls. Although ancient texts mention that the original Sun Bin's Art of War was 89 chapters long, the rediscovered copy had 16 verifiable chapters only. As fragments of Sun Tzu's The Art of War were discovered as well, historians believed that some of the chapters might belong to The Art of War instead.|$|R

Rinpoche continued to teach throughout the world. Then, in 1989 in Nepal, Rinpoche met Andrew Harvey and invited him to help on the project. About the writing process, co-editor Patrick Gaffney said, [...] "Probably, a <b>book</b> has <b>never</b> been <b>written</b> in such an unusual way." ...|$|R
50|$|Moya’s {{first trip}} to Cuba was in 1964 with writer Froylán Manjarrez and {{cartoonist}} Rius to capture the Cuban Revolution for a <b>book</b> which was <b>never</b> <b>written.</b> Over four weeks he took mostly photographs for newspapers. However, {{on the last day}} of the trip, they were granted an interview with Che Guevara, and Moya did a series of nineteen portraits of the revolutionary at the Central Bank of Cuba. One notable photo from this series is El Ché melancólico (Melancholy Che), showing Che Guevara smoking a cigar, with a sad-like expression. It is one of two iconic photos of Che Guevara.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} June 1943, Gollancz {{suffered}} a serious nervous breakdown, {{believed to have been}} brought on by overwork (he had cut out holidays and reduced his social and cultural life) and his identification with the Nazis' victims. After his recovery he started work on a book to be called The Necessity for Zionism; although the <b>book</b> was <b>never</b> <b>written,</b> he did publish a number of books on Jewish topics. His work for Zionism at this time led to him being appointed as a governor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In May 1945 he wrote his last major contribution to Jewish refugees, the pamphlet [...] "Nowhere to Lay Their Heads": The Jewish tragedy in Europe and its solution, a personal appeal for the opening up of Palestine for large scale Jewish immigration from Europe, which he distributed for free and was a great success.|$|R

This <b>book</b> was, however, <b>never</b> <b>written</b> in this format by Grey! It was a shotgun marriage of sorts, cobbled together by Harpers from two other books that Grey did actually write: Last of the Duanes (written in 1913 but not published until 1996) and Rangers of the Lone Star (written and serialized in 1914 as The Lone Star Ranger but not published as a book until 1997) ...|$|R

He had written two years earlier to Hańska: [...] "There's no doubt about it – it is a magnificent poem. I had never really read it before.… The passion is sublime, and I now understand why you have a cherished and special devotion to this book.… All in all, I am very pleased with it." [...] In a preface to the third edition, he described his plans for a part of La Comédie Humaine called Scènes de la vie militaire (Scenes from Military Life). In addition to Les Chouans with its focus on guerrilla combat, he planned another called Les Vendéans about the earlier full-scale civil war. Although in 1844 he discussed traveling to western France to write the <b>book,</b> it was <b>never</b> <b>written.</b>|$|R
40|$|What is a „Book"? In {{this article}} the author defines {{the book as}} any text carrier {{regardless}} of form. The article starts off with {{an account of the}} Swedish art historian Lars Vilks' activities at Kullaberg in Sweden. Vilks {{is best known for his}} stone sculpture on the beach which was later judged to be a book, given the title Arx, complete with ISBN-number and cataloguing data in the Swedish National Database LIBRIS. The University Library in Lund, which is a deposit library, has claimed a deposit copy, a task which is easier said than done. Arx is 6 meters high and 12 meters wide and weighs 150 tons. With Arx as his starting point the author contends that the definition of a book is not all that simple. He goes on to recount the history of the book starting with oral legends and ending with the electronic book, which he judges to be the next logical step in the cvolutionary proccss of the book. He also cites other examples of unusual books including imaginary books, <b>books</b> that were <b>never</b> <b>written</b> etc...|$|R

This article {{examines}} the influence of Spanish sainete (in {{the second half of}} the eighteenth century) on the birth of Catalan «costumista» literature in the first half of the nineteenth century. Taking as a point of analysis the work of Francesc Renart i Arús, a undervalued playwright, it offers a biographical sketch, and informs the reader about some forgotten and neglected works. It expands the number of titles of the author, and points out to some errors of attribution of <b>books</b> that he <b>never</b> <b>wrote.</b> Overall, it stresses the dedication and importance of Renart i Arús on the birth and introduction of dramatic poetry in the Catalan eigtheen century commercial theater.

5000|$|... “Probably, a <b>book</b> has <b>never</b> been <b>written</b> in such {{an unusual}} way. If it was difficult, it was because it {{presented}} so many challenges. One of the greatest was how to find Rinpoche's voice, that intimate, warm, clear and humorous voice that is so supremely eloquent when communicating live. Rinpoche {{is a master of}} the great oral tradition of Tibet, stretching back over centuries, the hallmark of which is the power to transmit directly, from heart to heart, mind to mind, in the medium of words, something which is beyond words. There were other important issues. We implored Rinpoche to include his own personal experiences and memories from his life, which was an act of great daring for a Tibetan. Rinpoche wove in consciously, too, different layers of meaning which could be understood by people with different degrees of spiritual experience. Again, one of Rinpoche's greatest concerns was to ensure the authenticity of the teachings, and he fused into the book answers to questions about the teachings concerning death presented to His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, and other great masters.” ...|$|R
