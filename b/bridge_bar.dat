50|$|Upon {{arrival in}} the Maltese capital city of Valletta, teams had {{to head to the}} <b>Bridge</b> <b>Bar</b> and were given a drink order from the {{bartender}} consisting of a bottle of liquor and two glasses. They then had to carry the order on a tray up Saint Ursula street's staircase to the Upper Barrakka Gardens where a group of the Knights of Malta waited for their order. If either teammate dropped anything from their tray along the way up the steps, they would have to go back down to the <b>Bridge</b> <b>Bar</b> and pick up a broom and dustpan to clean up before the bartender would replace their broken items. Once teams successfully delivered the order to the Knights, they would give them their next clue.|$|E

50|$|After a brief {{introduction}} {{the first}} violin states the C minor principal {{theme of the}} last movement. It is written in a sonata rondo form lacking a proper development section. The first theme is temperate, rather smooth than impulsive. The first subject, however, is much broader and includes a full version of the theme, a transitory section developing the material and another statement of the theme (again in C minor). After some <b>bridging</b> <b>bars</b> the gloomy and desperate second subject (in F minor) is heard. Although attempting to change the mode to the major, it ends in minor. The music proceeds to a repetition of the whole first subject, by which the second appearance of the main theme is in G minor. Its complaints are answered by {{the resolution of the}} second subject (in C minor). In the coda the essential figures of the principal theme are heard once more. The final chord ends the quartet strongly and mercilessly.|$|R

Baroque violins are almost always fitted with gut strings, as opposed to the more common metal and synthetic strings on a modern instrument, and played with a bow made on the baroque model rather than the modern Tourte bow.

50|$|The Bidwell <b>Bar</b> <b>Bridge,</b> in Oroville, California, {{refers to}} two {{suspension}} bridges that cross {{different parts of}} Lake Oroville.

The $35,000, 240-foot (73 m) -long original was completed in December 1855, and was built of materials transported from Troy, New York, via Cape Horn. Most of the money was put up by Judge Joseph Lewis, a Virginian who moved to Bidwell's Bar in 1849. The bridge originally crossed the Middle Fork Feather River {{and is the only}} one of several suspension bridges built in the area in the 1850s that still remains. It remained open to vehicle traffic until 1954.|$|R
