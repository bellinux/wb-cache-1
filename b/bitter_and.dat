The McEwan's ales were eclipsed by John Smith's <b>Bitter</b> <b>and</b> Belhaven Best and cask-conditioned beers such as Deuchars IPA, whilst the lager fell behind Tennent's.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Pickett feared {{prosecution}} for his execution of deserters and temporarily fled to Canada. He returned to Virginia in 1866, {{where he died}} at age 50 in 1875.

5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often <b>bitter</b> <b>and</b> harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

5|$|Mary, disspirited, yields to Gilmore's importunements, warning {{him that}} theirs {{must be a}} long {{engagement}} and that she will end it if Captain Marrable finds himself able to marry a woman without a fortune.

5|$|The {{inconclusive}} {{report was}} the subject of <b>bitter</b> <b>and</b> personal debate among Kennedy's senior advisers. Various courses of action towards Vietnam were discussed, such as fostering a regime change or taking a series of selective measures designed to cripple the influence of Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's brother and chief political adviser. Nhu and his wife Madame Ngô Đình Nhu were seen as the major causes of the political problems in South Vietnam. The inconclusive result of Krulak and Mendenhall's expedition resulted in a follow-up mission, the McNamara–Taylor mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial and}} {{execution}} of Riel caused a <b>bitter</b> <b>and</b> prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades.

In Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.|$|E

5|$|Himmler and Potthast confessed {{their love}} for each other at Christmastime in 1938. At first they tried to keep it platonic, but they fell into an adulterous {{relationship}}. Himmler's wife since 1928 and mother of their daughter, Margarete Himmler, found out about Himmler's relationship with Potthast at some time in February 1941. She felt humiliated and <b>bitter,</b> <b>and</b> Potthast's parents rejected the extramarital relationship. Potthast first took up residence in Grunewald and from 1943 she lived in Brückentin, near the estate of Oswald Pohl, because she was a friend of his wife, Eleonore. Lina Heydrich, wife of Himmler's right-hand man Reinhard Heydrich, and Gerda Bormann, spouse of Martin Bormann, were also counted among her friends. Later she lived in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius deterrimus is an edible mushroom, but is {{much less}} {{appreciated}} than the similar L.deliciosus. The first tastes slightly <b>bitter</b> <b>and</b> is often infested by maggots. Like L.deliciosus, this fungus is mainly stir-fried in butter or oil; if it is cooked in water, the flesh becomes very soft. Young fruit bodies can be also pickled, or dried for later use. As the fungus is often heavily infested by maggots, skilled mushroom pickers prefer young fruit bodies. The urine discolours to red if {{a large amount of}} milk caps are eaten, but this is entirely harmless and is not evidence for an impairment to health. The red-coloured azulene compounds, ingested with the mushroom food, are more or less excreted with the urine.|$|E

Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a journalist and later a Federal Member of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Echmarcach {{may well}} have {{controlled}} Mann throughout his second reign in Dublin. Silver hoards uncovered on Mann, dated by their coins to the years 1030s1050s, {{may well be the}} by-product of the intense conflict over control of the island. There is evidence indicating that, {{at some point in the}} early eleventh centuryperhaps in the 1020s1030sa mint may have developed and functioned on Mann. Coins that appear to have been minted on the island roughly coincide with Echmarcach's rule. These coins are very similar to those produced in Dublin, and may be evidence that Echmarcach attempted to harmonise the coinage utilised within his realm. The production of coins on Mann appears to be evidence of a sophisticated economy in the Isles. In fact, the wealth and sophistication of commerce in Echmarcach's realm could in part explain why the constant struggle for control of Dublin and the Isles was so <b>bitter,</b> <b>and</b> could account for Þórfinnr's apparent presence in the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Boddingtons {{bought the}} Oldham Brewery for £23million, hoping to combine Oldham's {{strength}} in lager and keg bitter {{with their own}} expertise in cask ales. After the acquisition, the company owned 272 public houses, 70 per cent of which were within 20 miles of its Manchester brewery. In 1983, Boddingtons Bitter was distributed in the Home Counties for the first time. In 1985 Boddingtons paid £27.5million for the 160,000 barrel capacity Higsons Brewery in Liverpool and its tied estate of 160 public houses to form a combine with a £65million turnover. The Guardian commented {{that the company had}} paid mere asset value for Higsons as the company had been reporting poor profits. There was virtually no overlap between the two companies, and the takeover brought Boddingtons to Merseyside for the first time. By this time Strangeways was producing only two beers, a <b>bitter</b> <b>and</b> a mild, with bitter constituting over 90 per cent of production. In 1986, the company employed 280 people and operated 530 tied houses, and while Strangeways Brewery had a capacity of 500,000 barrels a year, it was operating at around 50 per cent capacity. That year the company introduced its own lager, brewing Kaltenberg under licence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the northernmost}} {{part of the}} {{battlefield}} was also witnessing heavy fighting. Prince Liechtenstein's heavy cavalry began to assault Kellerman's lighter cavalry forces after eventually arriving at the correct position in the field. The fighting initially went well for the French, but Kellerman's forces took cover behind General Caffarelli's infantry division once it became clear Russian numbers were too great. Caffarelli's men halted the Russian assaults and permitted Murat to send two cuirassier divisions (one commanded by d'Hautpoul {{and the other one}} by Nansouty) into the fray to finish off the Russian cavalry for good. The ensuing mêlée was <b>bitter</b> <b>and</b> long, but the French ultimately prevailed. Lannes then led his V Corps against Bagration's men and after hard fighting managed to drive the skilled Russian commander off the field. He wanted to pursue, but Murat, who was in control of this sector in the battlefield, was against the idea.|$|E

5|$|The acts became {{controversial}} {{from prosecution}} thereunder of a Congressman {{and a number}} of newspaper editors. Indeed, the Federalist administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Democratic–Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial {{on the eve of the}} 1800 presidential election – timing that hardly appeared coincidental, according to biographer Ferling. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Democratic–Republicans. However, other historians have emphasized that the Acts were employed for political targeting from the outset, causing many aliens to leave the country. The Acts as well allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists, even on the floor of Congress. In any case, the election of 1800 in fact became a <b>bitter</b> <b>and</b> volatile contest, with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other and its policies; after Democratic–Republicans prevailed in the elections of 1800, they used the acts against Federalists before the laws finally expired.|$|E
5|$|Under an Act of Parliament of 1874, the South Yorkshire {{company was}} {{absorbed into the}} Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Despite the railway competition, traffic levels {{remained}} healthy, with the waterways carrying a total of 982,000 tons in 1878, {{but there was a}} growing dissatisfaction with the situation, particularly the high tolls compared to the railways, and the refusal to allow steam haulage, which had been in use on the neighbouring Aire and Calder Navigation for over 50 years. In an attempt to improve the situation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Ltd was formed in 1888, with the intention of buying back the canals from the railway company, and upgrading them to offer effective competition to the railways. As a result of their efforts, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Co was created by an Act of Parliament dated 26 August 1889, with powers to raise £1.5 million to purchase and improve four canals. These were the Sheffield Canal, the River Don Navigation, the Dearne and Dove Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. The intention was to upgrade the Don and the Stainforth and Keadby to take 300 or 400 ton barges, to investigate the use of compartment boats, and to build a new port facility at Keadby, where coal could be trans-shipped to seagoing vessels. Negotiations with the railway company were long and <b>bitter,</b> <b>and</b> the Navigation company only managed to raise £625,000 of the £1.14 million purchase price, with the result that although ownership of the waterways was transferred to them, the railway company still nominated five of the ten directors, and thus retained significant control.|$|E
