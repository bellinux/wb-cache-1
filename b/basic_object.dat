25|$|Grothendieck's {{emphasis}} {{on the role of}} universal properties across varied mathematical structures brought category theory into the mainstream as an organizing principle for mathematics in general. Among its uses, category theory creates a common language for describing similar structures and techniques seen in many different mathematical systems. His notion of abelian category is now the <b>basic</b> <b>object</b> of study in homological algebra. The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck's influence, though unintentional.|$|E

2500|$|Projective {{geometry}} {{also includes}} a full theory of conic sections, a subject also extensively developed in Euclidean geometry. There are advantages {{to being able to}} think of a hyperbola and an ellipse as distinguished only by the way the hyperbola lies across the line at infinity; and that a parabola is distinguished only by being tangent to the same line. The whole family of circles can be considered as conics passing through two given points on the line at infinity — at the cost of requiring complex coordinates. Since coordinates are not [...] "synthetic", one replaces them by fixing a line and two points on it, and considering the linear system of all conics passing through those points as the <b>basic</b> <b>object</b> of study. This method proved very attractive to talented geometers, and the topic was studied thoroughly. An example of this method is the multi-volume treatise by H. F. Baker.|$|E

In a previous paper by the authors, formal systems for deriving the admissible rules of Intuitionistic Logic and a class of modal logics were defined in a proof-theoretic framework where the <b>basic</b> <b>objects</b> of the systems are sequent rules. Here, the framework is extended to cover derivability of the admissible rules of intermediate logics and a wider class of modal logics, in this case, by taking hypersequent rules as the <b>basic</b> <b>objects.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Admissible {{rules of}} a logic are those rules {{under which the}} set of theorems of the logic is closed. In this paper, a Gentzen-style {{framework}} is introduced for analytic proof systems that derive admissible rules of non-classical logics. While Gentzen systems for derivability treat sequents as <b>basic</b> <b>objects,</b> for admissibility, the <b>basic</b> <b>objects</b> are sequent rules. Proof systems are defined here for admissible rules of classes of modal logics, including K 4, S 4, and GL, and also Intuitionistic Logic IPC.

40|$|Categorizations which humans {{make of the}} {{concrete}} world are not arbitrary but highly determined. In taxonomies of concrete objects, there is one level of abstraction at which the most basic category cuts are made. Basic categories are those which carry the most information, possess the highest category cue validity, and are, thus, the most differentiated from one another. The four experiments of Part I define <b>basic</b> <b>objects</b> by demonstrating that in taxonomies of common concrete nouns in English based on class inclusion, <b>basic</b> <b>objects</b> are the most inclusive categories whose members: (a) possess significant numbers of attributes in common, (b) have motor programs which are similar to one another, (c) have similar shapes, and (d) can be identified from averaged shapes {{of members of the}} class. The eight experiments of Part II explore implications of the structure of categories. <b>Basic</b> <b>objects</b> are shown to be the most inclusive categories for which a concrete image of the category as a whole can be formed, to be the first categorizations made during perception of the environment, to be the earliest categories sorted and earliest named by children, and to be the categorie...|$|R
