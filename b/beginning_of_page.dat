They construct and then characterize the performance of classifiers that predict whether an escalation will occur in issued queries following the visit to a page. Their findings show that features such as serious illness preceding benign explanations in page (e.g., cancer is mentioned before caffeine in pages pertaining to headaches), serious illness vs. benign explanation appears in page title or near <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>page,</b> page from Web forum, and page has external verification are all important predictors of subsequent escalation (or non-escalation).|$|E

40|$|AbstractEye {{movements}} {{during the}} reading <b>of</b> multi-line <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> texts were analyzed {{to determine the}} trajectory of reading saccades. The results of two experiments showed that the trajectory {{of the majority of}} forward-directed saccades was negatively biased, i. e., the trajectory fell below the start and end location of the saccadic movement. This is attributed to a global top-to-bottom orienting of attention. The curvature size and the proportion of negative trajectories were diminished when linguistic processing demands were high and when the <b>beginning</b> lines <b>of</b> a <b>page</b> were read. Longer pre-saccadic fixations also yielded smaller saccadic curvatures, and they resulted in fewer negatively curved forward-directed saccades in Experiment 1 although not in Experiment 2. These findings indicate that the top-to-bottom pull of saccadic trajectories is modulated by processing demands and processing opportunities. The results are in general agreement with a time-locked attraction–inhibition hypothesis, according to which the horizontal movement component of a saccade is initially subject to an automatic top-to-bottom orienting of attention that is subsequently inhibited...|$|R
