5|$|In May 2006, former Sports Illustrated writer Jeff Pearlman {{released}} a revealing biography of Bonds entitled Love Me, Hate Me: <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> and the Making of an Anti-Hero. The book also contained many allegations against Bonds. The book, which describes Bonds as a polarizing insufferable braggart with a legendary ego and staggering ability, relied on over five hundred interviews, except with Bonds himself.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{made his}} first Major League relief {{appearance}} on August 5 against the Padres due to an early exit by starter Noah Lowry and an overworked bullpen. He pitched a scoreless seventh inning. He recorded his first career run batted in (RBI) two days later against the Nationals' Mike Bacsik, in the same game that <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> hit his record-breaking 756th career home run.|$|E
50|$|After {{reporting}} on the BALCO case, Fainaru-Wada and Williams took their interviews and observations and published Game of Shadows, a journalistic book that explored every aspect of BALCO, beginning with Conte’s early struggles as an aspiring musician and ending with the federal bust of the BALCO headquarters. Publicly, {{most of the attention}} the book received was due to the incriminating evidence of <b>Barry</b> <b>Bond’s</b> ties to BALCO.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{score was}} composed by Lalo Schifrin {{and includes a}} driving main title vocal theme and a soft end title theme ("My Liquidator"), both sung by Shirley Bassey. Other than the [...] "Goldfinger"-type title song, Lalo Schifrin deliberately avoided the John <b>Barry</b> James <b>Bond</b> style of music.|$|R
5|$|<b>Barry</b> Lamar <b>Bonds</b> (born July 24, 1964) is an American former {{professional}} baseball left fielder who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants. Bonds received seven NL MVP awards and 14 All-Star selections, {{and is considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest baseball players of all time.|$|R
5|$|Hank Greenberg, Stan Musial, Alex Rodriguez, and Robin Yount {{have won}} at {{different}} positions, while Rodriguez {{is the only}} player who has won the award with two different teams at two different positions. <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> has won the most often(seven times) and the most consecutively(2001–04). Jimmie Foxx was {{the first player to}} win multiple times; 9players have won three times, and 19 have won twice. Frank Robinson is the only player to win the award in both the American and National Leagues.|$|E
5|$|In baseball, {{the home}} run {{is one of the}} most popular aspects of the game. Thus, the career record for home runs is among the most {{important}} and respected records in baseball. The road to this record has been closely followed and each additional home run Bonds hits extends the current record further. On August 7, 2007, <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> became the major leagues' career home run champion by hitting his 756th career home run, which surpassed Hank Aaron's total. the ball was caught by Pistolay.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{was called}} up to the Giants on May 26, , as a reliever. He made his MLB debut two days later on May 28 against the Colorado Rockies. He pitched one inning in relief and retired all three batters he faced (Todd Helton, Matt Holliday, and Garrett Atkins). His {{performance}} was overshadowed, however, because <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> hit his 715th {{home run in the}} same game to surpass Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time home run list.|$|E
500|$|Not Your Kind of People {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received a weighted average score of 63 based on 28 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". In his review for The Guardian, Dave Simpson gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, stating that it [...] "returns to the blueprint of their first two, best albums" [...] while lessening the electronics and augmenting the crunchy guitars, with a contemporary production. He praised the title track, deeming it a [...] "surprise" [...] and a [...] "beautiful, otherworldly cross between a John <b>Barry</b> <b>Bond</b> theme and a David Bowie outsider anthem." [...] Cameron Adams of The Courier-Mail wrote that [...] "musically, they still find that sweet spot between Motown and Nirvana, via the Pretenders and Prodigy", and considered it [...] "refreshing" [...] that the band is [...] "still pushing pop music to its darkest limits." ...|$|R
50|$|Unusually, {{the score}} was {{recorded}} in Paris - all of <b>Barry's</b> previous <b>Bond</b> scores had been recorded at London's CTS Studios. The film's production base was in France and it was decided the film would be scored there as well. Like some Bond films, the score for Moonraker has never received an extended release, due {{to the loss of}} the original session masters which appear to have been misplaced in France.|$|R
50|$|The 1973 BBC {{documentary}} Omnibus: The British Hero had Christopher Cazenove playing Hannay in a {{scene from}} Mr. Standfast, {{as well as a}} number of other such heroic characters, including Beau Geste, Bulldog Drummond and James <b>Bond.</b> <b>Barry</b> Foster played Hannay in a 1977 television adaptation of The Three Hostages.|$|R

He {{has been named}} MVP more times than any other player {{in the history of}} the other three North American major {{professional}} leagues (Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association, and National Football League). <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> is second, having won the MVP award seven times in the MLB. Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers teammate Mark Messier are the only players to win the Hart Trophy with more than one team.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> {{received}} the award in 2002, becoming the third player so honored {{for breaking the}} single-season home run record. Bonds {{was the first of}} two players to receive the award that season, along with Rickey Henderson. The award was given in each year from 2004 until 2007: Roger Clemens was honored during the 2004 All-Star Game, and Ichiro Suzuki was presented with the award for breaking the single-season hits record in 2005. Rachel Robinson was honored in 2007, receiving the award for establishing the Jackie Robinson Foundation. She was the first woman and the first non-player to be thus honored.|$|E

The song {{was described as}} influenced by Shirley Bassey and released as the album's lead single. The second track, [...] "Paper Bag", is about being obsessed with someone {{and not being able}} to have them. It is followed by the third single [...] "Human", a track with a mambo-style beat. The fourth song, [...] "Pilots", which describes travelers floating in the atmosphere above the earth, was inspired by John <b>Barry's</b> James <b>Bond</b> theme songs. In the United Kingdom, a remixed version of the song was released as a single, reaching number 68 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|R
5|$|In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 {{home run}} club {{is a group}} of batters who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs, a record which stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974. Aaron's {{ultimate}} career total, 755, remained the record until <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season.

5|$|Nathan was {{promoted}} to the San Francisco Giants on April 20, 1999, taking the roster spot of superstar slugger <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds,</b> who went {{on the disabled list}} after left elbow surgery. He made his major league debut the next day, pitching seven shutout innings and winning his first major league decision against the Florida Marlins, 4–0.

50|$|Bonds helped run Marion Barry's first {{campaign}} for the District of Columbia Board of Education in 1971. She was elected Ward 2 delegate to the Black Political Convention in 1972. In 1973, she ran in a special election for the Ward 2 seat on the District of Columbia Board of Education. Bill Treanor won the election with 62 percent of the vote. Bonds worked as ward and precinct coordinator for Clifford Alexander's {{campaign for}} District mayor in 1974. She served as deputy campaign manager for Barry's 1978 and 1982 bids for District mayor. In 1979, Mayor <b>Barry</b> named <b>Bonds</b> special assistant for constituent services.|$|R

40|$|Like {{other aspects}} of the James Bond films’ {{well-established}} narrative formula and glossy packaging, music is used to provide both continuity and innovation within the series, combining accessible orchestral scoring with original standalone pop songs featuring well-known vocalists, and making a significant contribution to the marketing and economic success of the franchise. Behind this signature sound was British composer John Barry, who assisted Monty Norman in scoring Dr. No and went on to provide incidental music and title songs for a further eleven <b>Bond</b> films. <b>Barry’s</b> <b>Bond</b> scores combine a 1960 s-inflected mixture of big band brass and sweeping, romantic string lines with classic song writing skills that continue to provide a template for contemporary artists and composers working on the series. This chapter focuses upon the engagement of music with the Bond film’s problematic and complex politics of gender and identity, exploring the often contradictory representations of femininity found both within the narrative and in its title sequences with particular reference to 1964 's 'Goldfinger'. It discusses the overall dominance of 'Bond's' music within the film, but also argues that the characterisation of Jill and Tilly Masterson and Pussy Galore makes significant use of music - and its unexpected absence - to create spaces for alternative and/or queer understandings of femininity within the film, and opportunities for female defiance of Bond's (often problematically forceful) all-conquering vision of heterosexual masculinity. A key element within this analysis is discussion of the film's title sequence and the role of Shirley Bassey's 'Goldfinger' track as a dual signifier of both misogynist dominance and charismatic female resistance...|$|R
5|$|Robertson {{made his}} MLB debut on September 2, 2002 against the Texas Rangers. He was {{starting}} {{in place of}} Roy Oswalt, who was serving a suspension for hitting a batter with a pitch. He allowed two runs in 2⅔ innings and got the loss in his only start that year. He got his second decision in a 5–2 loss to the San Francisco Giants on September 28. In the game, the Giants clinched a playoff spot, and <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> {{hit a home run}} off Robertson into McCovey Cove to seal the game for them. He finished the season with a 6.52 ERA in 9⅔ innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Cubs {{finished}} the previous {{season at the}} bottom of the Central division with a 68–94 record while the Giants won the West at 90–72, though were defeated by the eventual 1997 World Series champion Florida Marlins in the NLDS. The Giants' <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> drew criticism for his postseason performance, which had been a recurring criticism dating back to his time with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Cubs made several offseason acquisitions following the 1997 season including trading Doug Glanville for second baseman Mickey Morandini along with signing Jeff Blauser and Henry Rodríguez as free agents.|$|E
5|$|The {{only player}} to win Gold Gloves as an infielder and outfielder is Darin Erstad, who won Gold Gloves as an outfielder in 2000 and 2002 {{and as a}} first baseman in 2004, all with the Anaheim Angels. The only other player to win Gold Gloves at {{multiple}} positions is Plácido Polanco, who won at second base (2007, 2009 AL) and third base (2011 NL). Family pairs to win Gold Gloves include brothers Ken and Clete Boyer (third base), brothers Sandy Alomar, Jr. (catcher) and Roberto Alomar (second base), Bengie and Yadier Molina (catcher), father and son Bobby and <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> (outfield), and father and son Bob (catcher) and Bret Boone (second base).|$|E
25|$|He met John <b>Barry</b> (of James <b>Bond</b> soundtrack fame) in {{the early}} 1980s, and began working with him on several movie soundtracks, {{including}} Jagged Edge and A View to a Kill. It was during the A View to a Kill sessions in 1985 that Elias met and became friends {{with the members of}} pop group Duran Duran (they performed the title song for the movie).|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} also the first to drop the {{distinctive}} plucked guitar from the Bond theme heard over the gun barrel sequence - in all subsequent John <b>Barry</b> James <b>Bond</b> scores, this theme would be heard on strings and trumpet. Not present on the album but heard in the film is a brief reprise, for recognition purposes, of the song [...] "Live and Let Die" [...] when a character (Sheriff JW Pepper) from the previous film reappears. The next three Bond films would wittily feature excerpts from the familiar music of other films, too (though classics rather than Bond films), while On Her Majesty's Secret Service had included a janitor character whistling the theme from Goldfinger as an in-joke.|$|R
5000|$|David contributed {{lyrics to}} three James Bond film themes: in {{addition}} to [...] "The Look of Love" [...] from Casino Royale with Bacharach, he wrote [...] "We Have All the Time in the World", with John Barry and sung by Louis Armstrong for the 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and in 1979, [...] "Moonraker", also with <b>Barry,</b> sung by <b>Bond</b> regular Shirley Bassey for the film of the same name.|$|R
5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds,</b> who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting one}} {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent Mayne and Armando Ríos respectively. The Cubs double switched, {{bringing}} in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Among outfielders {{and among}} all Silver Slugger winners, <b>Barry</b> <b>Bonds</b> {{has won the}} most awards, winning twelve times between 1990 and 2004. All of his awards were won in the National League. Manny Ramirez leads the American League with eight wins. Ken Griffey, Jr., Vladimir Guerrero, and Tony Gwynn have each won seven Silver Sluggers in the outfield; Juan González, Kirby Puckett, and Sammy Sosa have won six times. Two players have won five times (Albert Belle and Dave Winfield), and four-time winners include Andre Dawson, Matt Holliday, Dale Murphy, Gary Sheffield, and Ryan Braun. There have also been 7 three-time outfield winners and 18 two-time awardees. The most recent winners are Ryan Braun, Matt Kemp, and Justin Upton in the National League, and José Bautista, Curtis Granderson, and Jacoby Ellsbury in the American League.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the Xbox One and {{transition}} of Phil Spencer {{to the head of the}} Xbox division in 2014, he and software engineering vice president Kareem Choudhry restarted the backwards compatibility program in relative secret within the company. Choudhry brought on previous engineers that worked on Trioxide, including Kevin La Chapelle, Jonathan Morrison, and <b>Barry</b> <b>Bond,</b> to restart the program. The team chose to start with Castle Crashers, which included Xbox networking features, to test backwards compatibility. Castle Crashers frequently crashed to a screen with alphanumeric codes, which La Chapelle was able to obtain from the game's developers, The Behemoth, which helped them to rapidly diagnose problems and fix the compatibility issues. Solving most of the major problems through Castle Crashers, the background compatibility team decided to let the program be announced at E3 2015 with plans to have one hundred titles available by the end of 2015. However, by E3, they still found problems with some games running at extremely low framerates. During the event, Morrison recognized that a fundamental difference between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One was its scheduling rate, and when they returned, Morrison's idea helped them to rapidly complete work to meet its promised goal by the end of that year. [...] Individual games still brought some difficulty, specifically Halo Reach, but this prompted the team to develop automatic tools that could be used to identify where Xbox 360 titles would be difficult to run as-is on the Xbox One and how to work around those; this further set up the potential to improve Xbox 360 games on the future iterations of the Xbox One, such as the Xbox One X to improve graphics support.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon O'Brien wrote positively for AllMusic that [...] "The Sea {{is still a}} huge leap forward from her past three efforts, and had it been released as the follow-up to Northern Star, rather than 12 years down the line, it could possibly have sustained her initial solo success." [...] O'Brien, who rated it three-and-a-half out of five stars, went to praise the tracks [...] "Think About It" [...] and [...] "Stupid Game", which he considered [...] "bombastic Katy Perry/Kelly Clarkson-esque pop/rock anthems which prove she can still compete with those who were barely in their teens during the peak of Spicemania, while the grandiose [...] "Get Out of Here" [...] sounds like Muse's cover of [...] "Feeling Good" [...] crossed with a John <b>Barry's</b> James <b>Bond</b> score." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Barry was a {{contestant}} on Survivor: Panama — Exile Island, the 12th {{season of}} the reality competition series Survivor. He started in the older male tribe and immediately bonded with Terry Deitz due to their common flying backgrounds. When the four tribes were reduced to two, Barry and Deitz made an all-male alliance with Austin Carty and Nick Stanbury from the younger tribe. <b>Barry</b> also <b>bonded</b> with Ruth-Marie Milliman, which led to her being blindsided when she was voted out in Episode Four. He reconciled with his alliance-mates and finally revealed to Stanbury his background as an astronaut in Episode Six. When the Casaya tribe won the combined Reward/Immunity Challenge in that episode and sent Sally Schumann to Exile Island (making her immune from the Tribal Council vote), Barry's fate was sealed. Carty and Stanbury were allied, so when Deitz voted against him, Barry was voted out 3-1.|$|R
