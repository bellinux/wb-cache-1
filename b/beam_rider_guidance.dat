50|$|The Soviet KBP Instrument Design Bureau {{developed}} the somewhat similar AT-11 Sniper missile, launched by a 125 mm gun. It utilizes a laser <b>beam</b> <b>rider</b> <b>guidance</b> system, and a tandem warhead to defeat {{explosive reactive armour}} as used on the T-80 and T-90 tanks.|$|E
40|$|A new laser <b>beam</b> <b>rider</b> <b>guidance</b> {{system was}} {{developed}} for hypervelocity missile. The technique {{is based on an}} off-axis laser beam that is pointing at a constant offset of the target. The missile’s sensors get the guiding information by detecting the scattering of the beam created by the particles present in the atmosphere. In order to evaluate the performances of the technique, an hardware in the loop facility was implemented. Three degrees of freedom duplicating the vertical, lateral and spin axes of the missile are represented and the 6 DOFs are modeled. The features of the guidance technique as well as the details of the hardware in the loop facilities are presented...|$|E
50|$|LOSBR {{suffers from}} the {{inherent}} weakness of inaccuracy with increasing range as the beam spreads out. Laser <b>beam</b> <b>riders</b> are more accurate in this regards, but are all short-range, and even the laser can be degraded by bad weather. On the other hand, SARH becomes more accurate with decreasing distance to the target, so the two systems are complementary.|$|R
50|$|The Seaslug Mark 1 was {{powered by}} the solid-fuel Foxhound {{sustainer}} motor and Gosling booster motors. It had a radio proximity fuze and 200 lb blast warhead.The Mark 1 was a <b>beam</b> <b>rider</b> missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.|$|R
50|$|The missile {{used by the}} RBS 23 {{system is}} based on the RBS 70, but unlike its {{predecessor}} (which is laser <b>beam</b> <b>rider)</b> it is a radar command control missile, which means that the missile itself and the target have to be tracked by the fire control radar until impact. A booster has been added also. The missile is claimed to have high acceleration and high manoeuvrability. It is equipped with a fragmentation and shaped charge warhead and with both a proximity fuse and an impact fuse.|$|R
5000|$|Caprilli {{examined}} horses free jumping (without tack or rider), using {{photographs to}} document their shape over fences, {{and found that}} they always landed on their forelegs. He then developed his theory on the position the rider should take while over a fence: one that would {{not interfere with the}} horse's jumping movement and most importantly one that would not touch the horse's mouth. Caprilli also wanted to train a horse that could think for itself, without needing the <b>rider's</b> <b>guidance,</b> and did not like [...] "spot" [...] jumping, where the rider tried to add in or lengthen the stride of the horse before the fence.|$|R
50|$|The {{inherent}} {{disadvantage of}} the radar beam riding {{system is that}} the beam spreads as it travels outward from the broadcaster. As the missile flies towards the target, it therefore becomes increasingly inaccurate. This {{is not a problem}} at short ranges, but as many early surface-to-air missiles were designed to work at long ranges, this was a major issue. For example, earlier versions of the RIM-2 Terrier missile introduced in the 1950s were <b>beam</b> <b>riders,</b> but later variants employed semi-active radar homing to improve their effectiveness against high-performance and low-flying targets. In contrast to beam riding, semi-active guidance becomes more accurate as the missile approaches the target.|$|R
5000|$|The MoD {{contract}} {{includes the}} design, development and qualification of a laser <b>beam</b> <b>rider</b> version of LMM, together with production of an initial quantity of 1,000 missiles. These will be operated {{from the new}} Lynx Wildcat and Thales graphics have shown helicopters carrying twin 7 round launchers. These are due to enter service in 2015. The contract was funded by a deal to [...] "re-role previously contracted budgets to facilitate the full-scale development, series production and introduction of the LMM." [...] In other words, other contract(s) were cut and the funds switched to paying for LMM. The most likely contract affected is for the Starstreak, which is approaching {{the end of its}} term.|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{designing}} a self-adaptive missile guidance system is presented. The system inputs {{are assumed to}} be known in a statistical sense only. Newton's modified Wiener theory is utilized {{in the design of the}} system and to establish the performance criterion. The missile is assumed to be a <b>beam</b> <b>rider,</b> to have a g limiter, and to operate over a flight envelope where the open-loop gain varies by a factor of 20. It is shown that the percent of time that missile acceleration limiting occurs can be used effectively to adjust the coefficients of the Wiener filter. The result is a guidance system which adapts itself to a changing environment and gives essentially optimum filtering and minimum miss distance...|$|R
40|$|An {{articulated}} robotic manipulator (ARM) {{system is}} being designed for space applications. Work {{being done on}} a concept utilizing an infinitely stiff laser beam for position reference is summarized. The laser beam is projected along the segments of the ARM, and the position is sensed by the <b>beam</b> <b>rider</b> modules (BRM) mounted on the distal ends of the segments. The BRM concept {{is the heart of}} the system. It utilizes a combination of lateral displacements and rotational and distance measurement sensors. These determine the relative position of the two ends of the segments with respect to each other in six degrees of freedom. The BRM measurement devices contain microprocessor controlled data acquisition and active positioning components. An indirect adaptive controller is used to accurately control the position of the ARM...|$|R
40|$|Laser beam {{positioning}} and <b>beam</b> <b>rider</b> modules {{were incorporated}} into the long hollow flexible segment of an articulated robot manipulator (ARM). Using a single laser beam, the system determined {{the position of the}} distal ARM endtip, with millimetric precision, in six degrees of freedom, at distances of up to 10 meters. Preliminary designs, using space rated technology for the critical systems, of a two segmented physical ARM, with a single and a dual degree of freedom articulation, were developed, prototyped, and tested. To control the positioning of the physical ARM, an indirect adaptive controller, which used the mismatch between the position of the laser beam under static and dynamic conditions, was devised. To predict the behavior of the system and test the concept, a computer simulation model was constructed. A hierarchical artificially intelligent real time ADA operating system program structure was created. The software was designed for implementation on a dedicated VME bus based Intel 80386 administered parallel processing multi-tasking computer system...|$|R
50|$|The CLOS {{system uses}} only the angular {{coordinates}} between the missile {{and the target}} to ensure the collision. The missile is made {{to be in the}} line of sight between the launcher and the target (LOS), and any deviation of the missile from this line is corrected. Since so many types of missile use this guidance system, they are usually subdivided into four groups: A particular type of command guidance andnavigation where the missile is always commanded to lie on the line of sight (LOS)between the tracking unit and the aircraft is known as command to line of sight(CLOS) or three-point guidance. That is, the missile is controlled to stay as close aspossible on the LOS to the target after missile capture.is used to transmit guidance signals from a ground controller to the missile. More specifically, if the beam acceleration is taken into account and added to the nominal acceleration generated by the beam-rider equations, then CLOS guidance results. Thus, the <b>beam</b> <b>rider</b> acceleration command is modified to include an extra term. The beam-riding performance described above can thus be significantly improved by taking the beam motion into account. CLOS guidance is used mostly in shortrange air defense and antitank systems.|$|R

6000|$|When I was {{thirteen}} years old I was smitten with {{love for a}} horse I once saw--an untamable-looking brute, that rolled his eyes, turbulently, under a cloud of black mane tumbling over his forehead. I could not take my sight off this proud, beautiful creature, and I longed to possess him with a great longing. His owner--a worthless vagabond, as it happened--marked my enthusiastic admiration, and {{a day or two}} afterwards, having lost all his money at cards, he came to me, offering to sell me the horse. Having obtained my father's consent, I rushed off to the man with all the money I possessed--about thirty or thirty-five shillings, I believe. After some grumbling, and finding he could get no more, he accepted the money. My new possession filled me with unbounded delight, and I spent the time caressing him and leading him about the grounds in search of succulent grasses and choice leaves to feed him on. I am sure this horse understood and loved me, for, in spite of that savage look, which his eyes never quite lost, he always displayed a singular gentleness towards me. He never attempted to upset me, though he promptly threw--to my great delight, I must confess--anyone else who ventured to mount him. Probably the secret of his conduct was that he hated the whip. Of this individual, if not of the species, the celebrated description held true:--"The horse is a docile animal, but if you flog him he will not do so." [...] After he had been mine a few days, I rode on him one morning to witness a cattle-marking on a neighbouring estate. I found thirty or forty gauchos on the ground engaged in catching and branding the cattle. It was rough, dangerous work, but apparently not rough enough to satisfy the men, so after branding an animal and releasing him from their lassos, several of the mounted gauchos would, purely for sport, endeavour to knock it down as it rushed away, by charging furiously on to it. As I sat there enjoying the fun, my horse stood very quietly under me, also eagerly watching the sport. At length a bull was released, and, smarting from the fiery torture, lowered his horns and rushed away towards the open plain. Three horsemen in succession shot out from the crowd, and charged the bull at full speed; one by one, by suddenly swerving his body round, he avoided them, and was escaping scot-free. At this moment my horse--possibly interpreting a casual touch of my hand on his neck, or some movement of my body, as a wish to join in the sport--suddenly sprang forward and charged on the flying bull like a thunderbolt, striking him full {{in the middle of his}} body, and hurling him with a tremendous shock to earth. The stricken beast rolled violently over, while my horse stood still as a stone watching him. Strange to say, I was not unseated, but, turning-round, galloped back, greeted by a shout of applause from the spectators--the only sound of that description I have ever had the privilege of listening to. They little knew that my horse had accomplished the perilous feat without his <b>rider's</b> <b>guidance.</b> No doubt he had been accustomed to do such things, and, perhaps, for the moment, had forgotten that he had passed into the hands of a new owner--one of tender years. He never voluntarily attempted an adventure of that kind again; he knew, I suppose, that he no longer carried on his back a reckless dare-devil, who valued not life. Poor Picáso! he was mine till he died. I have had scores of horses since, but never one I loved so well.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine the}} effect of headlight configuration (daytime running lights, high <b>beam,</b> modulating) and <b>rider</b> color (bright yellow, blue denim, and black torso and helmet) on the conspicuity of a motorcycle to a driver of a passenger vehicle in a simulated environment. To achieve this, 36 participants completed three drives on a National Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS) - 2 driving simulator. During two of the drives, participants were presented with six oncoming motorcycles and three leading parked motorcycles, each with a different combination of rider color and headlight configuration. Each of the nine motorcycles was present in either the urban or rural driving environment. Participants indicated when each motorcycle was first visible to them by pressing a button on the steering wheel of the driving simulator. The detection distances from the motorcycles to the participant vehicles were then recorded. Participants were within one of two groups: younger drivers (25 to 55) or older drivers (65 and older). This research applied repeated measures analysis of variance to investigate the impact of headlight configurations and rider color on motorcycle conspicuity in urban and rural environments. The researchers found that oncoming motorcycles with modulating headlights were detected at the greatest distance compared to motorcycles with high beam or daytime running lights. Participant ability to detect an oncoming motorcycle was also significantly influenced by the combination of headlight configurations with black or bright yellow rider colors. Leading motorcycles in urban environments were detected at a greater distance compared to those in rural environments. Leading motorcycles with riders having bright yellow clothing and helmet were detected at the greatest distance, followed by motorcycles with riders having blue denim and black rider colors. A significant interaction effect among the driving environment, rider color, and age group was also found for the detection distance of leading motorcycles...|$|R
