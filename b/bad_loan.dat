On 4 July the bank confirmed that a request of reducing non-performing loans from European Central Bank was received. In 2015 {{the bank had}} €46.9 billion NPLs in gross and €24.2 billion in net. The bank targeted to reduce the gross NPLs to total loans ratio to 20% in 2018. However, this was still higher than the Italian average at 31 December 2015.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{recession}} in the 1990s had profound effects on the keiretsu. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This {{had the effect of}} blurring the lines between the keiretsu: Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as Sony, began outperforming their counterparts within the system.|$|E

The junior tranche would be allocated to the shareholders of the bank (for a proposed €1.6 billion); the mezzanine tranche would be sold to Atlante for €1.6 billion (revised to purchase junior mezzanine tranche for €1.526 billion in December 2016); the senior tranches would be sold to the market {{with some of them}} being eligible to state guarantee (Garanzia sulla Cartolarizzazione delle Sofferenze) for €6 billion. It was expected to reduce the gross NPLs ratio to 17.8%, on par with Italian average but still higher than many European peers. In December 2016, the disposal plan was modified: a senior mezzanine tranche (for €1.171 billion) was added—to be underwritten by the bank itself.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effect of <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> on the lending {{potential}} and financial performance of banks. Secondary data that span a period of 5 years (2008 - 2013) is used. This data is sourced from the annual reports of four banks listed on Ghana Stock Exchange. Pearson’s correlation test and ordinary leas squares regression are used to analyse data. A high negative correlation between <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> and lending potential (i. e. amount allocated each year by banks for lending to SMEs) is found at 5 % level of significance, r (20) =-. 824, p =. 000. Also, <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> make a high negative correlation with return on investment or net profit at 5 % significance level, (20) =-. 917, p <. 05. <b>Bad</b> <b>loans</b> significantly predict lending potential at 5 % significance level (t =- 6. 174, p <. 000), where <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> account for 67. 9 % {{of the variation in}} in this respect. Moreover, <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> significantly predict net profit at 5 % significance level (t =- 9. 77, p <. 000), with 84. 1 % of the variation in net profit accounted for by it. It is therefore evident that banks would have to hedge against the realisation of <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> to maximise their financial performance, and to improve access to credit facilities to creditworthy SMEs and other borrowers...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of economy-wide {{corruption}} on <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> across a large sample of countries. The evidence reveals that greater corruption is associated with more <b>bad</b> <b>loans.</b> Loan defaults are lower in faster growing economies, in economies with higher lending rates and in nations in the Euro zone, ceteris paribus. However, other institutional controls, including central bank autonomy, financial underdevelopment, bank-based economies and transition nations fail to show appreciable effects on the incidence of <b>bad</b> <b>loans.</b> The findings are robust to an alternate corruption measure and to endogeneity of corruption.

40|$|The Albanian Banking System {{has gone}} through {{significant}} changes in its development performance. This progress presents numerous difficulties and challenges which help to further consolidate the system. Currently in the Albanian banking sector there are 16 operating commercial banks, five banks have been in operation since 1997. This tripling {{of the number of}} banks in operation shows the expansion this sector has had over the years, the development of which is associated with numerous problems and challenges. One of the problems facing the banking system is <b>bad</b> <b>loans,</b> whose treatment has taken a great importance in recent years, especially in the period after the global financial crisis. Albania is also affected by the financial crises, so this study has special importance for its banking system. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to become acquainted in detail with the problem of <b>bad</b> <b>loans,</b> the factors that cause it and the economical consequences. Factors affecting the determination of <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> come not only from macroeconomic indicators, which are seen as exogenous factors that include the banking industry as well.
