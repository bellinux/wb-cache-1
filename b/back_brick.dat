The building has a flat roof with piers, which project above the roof, contrasting white concrete coping, and courses of molded brick. The large central entrance facing Main Street is surrounded with glazed white brick and has inset double doors with rectangular lights {{topped by a}} divided transom. A plaque above the entrance is inscribed [...] "I.W. Hunt 1919." [...] Flanking the entrance are huge plate glass display windows with smooth white concrete sills, clerestory windows, and fabric awnings.

It is one of the events that celebrates the old tradition of teenagers cruising from hangout spot to hangout spot. For Genesee County teens these included A&W, Varsity, Colonel’s and Walli’s, most of which resided on or close to Saginaw Street. Most of the buildings are long gone yet the tradition of cruising continues, especially during five days out of the year at the <b>Back</b> to the <b>Bricks</b> and Under the Arches car cruise. The celebration began as a one-day event in 2005 on Saginaw Street in Flint, Michigan with only a few hundred cars and spectators, and has grown to expand beyond these boundaries. By 2008 <b>Back</b> to the <b>Bricks</b> had rapidly grown to over 25,000 car participants and over 250,000 spectators over a five-day span.|$|R
