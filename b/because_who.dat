I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway <b>because</b> <b>who</b> knows how long the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest}} of the week we just go and work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And if we do it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Different {{kinds of}} stories call for {{different}} kinds of characters, tension, pacing, themes, and dialogue. [...] A fast-paced action adventure needs fast-paced dialogue in every scene to keep the story moving forward quickly. [...] Likewise, a literary story needs the dialogue to match {{the pace of the}} other elements in the story—it needs to move more slowly. [...] Genre stories generally move quickly, employing more dialogue and action and less slow-paced narrative, because they are generally plot-driven rather than character-driven, like literary and mainstream stories. [...] The emphasis is on the action that keeps the plot moving rather than the narrative that keeps the character growing. [...] It pays to know the characters <b>because</b> <b>who</b> they are determines how slowly or quickly they talk.|$|E

2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading. Not only are GDP data frequently revised after first publication, but the popular idea that GDP equals [...] "the whole economy" [...] is a fallacy. The more that the national accounts system has been revised across fifty years, and the more that economic theory and practice has changed, the less meaningful national accounts aggregates have become in capturing {{what is happening in}} reality. Analysts end up doing a lot of detailed disaggregate research to figure out what is going on, because the official national accounts aggregates don't tell them what they want to know (more detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling datamining). The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things <b>because</b> <b>who</b> exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E

If he had guessed anything at all it would be rather remarkable of him. As for what there was to guess, he couldn't--if this was present to him--have arrived at it save by his own acuteness. That acuteness was therefore immense; and if it supplied the subtlety she thought of leaving him to, his portion would be none so bad. Neither, for that matter, would hers be--which she was even actually enjoying. She wondered if really then there mightn't be something for her. She hadn't been sure in coming to him that she was [...] "better," [...] and he hadn't used, he would be awfully careful not to use, that compromising term about her; in spite of all of which she would have been ready to say, for the amiable sympathy of it, [...] "Yes, I must be," [...] for he had this unaided sense of something that had happened to her.
