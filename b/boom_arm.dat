5000|$|A [...] "boom arm" [...] {{attaches}} {{to the top of}} the stand so the microphone can move in the horizontal plane. A guitar player, for example, might use this to place the microphone directly in front of his mouth without having the upright portion of the stand in the way of the guitar. It also lets musicians have the microphone closer to the sound source when floor space is at a premium. This can be particularly useful when placing microphones on a drum stand when the microphone stands must compete for space with things like cymbal stands. <b>Boom</b> <b>arms</b> are offered both in fixed length and adjustable (telescoping) lengths.|$|R

The purpose of the computer model is to support research that is investigating the safe speed range for the vertical movement of roof bolter <b>boom</b> <b>arms</b> to reduce worker injuries in underground coal mines. The information obtained for this paper is based upon a project that is investigating means to reduce workers risks of injury from exposure to mining machinery. The methodology being employed by the project includes human factors design considerations, anthropometric modeling and simulation tools, laboratory validation, engineering interventions, and collaboration with industry and an equipment manufacturer. The results of this study were used to (1) determine the input parameters that are unique to the mining environment and needed to develop a credible, computer-based, human-machine interactive model, (2) develop test methods to measure the required parameters, and (3) to refine the human-machine interactive computer model...|$|R

Political engagement, economic and security interests, conflict resolution and human rights are common themes underlying much of Germany’s involvement in the Indian Ocean region. Key points: Berlin is active in promoting social, political and economic engagement in a region of declining European influence and is anxious to secure access to resources as China and India become more engaged in the region. Germany seeks to promote a “value-driven foreign policy” in the region, championing conflict resolution, democracy and human welfare.

50|$|Log booms {{were used}} in the United States and British North America {{throughout}} the 19th and early 20th centuries. During the largely bloodless Aroostook War that centred on the disputed border between Maine and New Brunswick, hastily built booms proved pricy for local governments. The 1,300-foot-long Aroostook Boom, made of confiscated timber and containing seven piers, cost the state of Maine more than $15,000 to construct. Licensed loggers commonly sent their wood in easily manageable raft units, but illegal lumbermen cunningly sent loose timber, complicating the sorting process and angering officials. Booms often caused friction between the disputing governments; when political tensions intensified, loggers and soldiers targeted enemy <b>booms</b> with <b>arms</b> and explosives.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] An {{excavator}} is {{a typical}} hydraulic heavy-duty human-operated machine used in general versatile construction operations, such as digging, ground leveling, carrying loads, dumping loads and straight traction. Normally backhoe excavators are working under worst working conditions. Due to severe working conditions, excavator parts are subjected to high loads and must work reliably under unpredictable working conditions. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze the existing design and redesign the excavator boom which is suitable for side digging and also for digging over hanged part of wall. Modeling of excavator attachment like <b>boom,</b> long <b>arm,</b> small arm, cylinder, bucket & coupling is done by using INVENTOR software. Model is exported through IGES file format for MESHING in Altair Hypermesh Analysis Software. Meshing is done using suitable type of elements. Material property is assigned; Boundary conditions and the forces are applied. Static analysis is done in INVERTOR software which is being supported by ANSYS software. During operation of excavator at different positions the stresses induced in the attachments varies. The forces applied in the analysis were calculated by using INVENTOR software, and reported that the <b>Arm,</b> <b>Boom</b> and Bucket shows stress in the attachment are coming under allowable limit. For reducing stresses and for optimum weight of the excavator parts, thickness of the material is reduced in the modeling. Keyword [...] Rotary excavator boom, bucket, INVENTOR software. I...|$|R

50|$|In filmmaking {{and video}} production, a crane shot is a shot {{taken by a}} camera on a moving crane or jib. Most cranes {{accommodate}} both the camera and an operator, but some can be moved by remote control. Camera cranes {{go back to the}} dawn of movie-making, and were frequently used in silent films to enhance the epic nature of large sets and massive crowds. Another use is to move up and away from the actors, a common way of ending a movie. Crane shots are often found in what are supposed to be emotional or suspenseful scenes. One example of this technique is the shots taken by remote cranes in the car-chase sequence of the 1985 film To Live and Die in L.A..

50|$|Long reach {{excavators}} {{are often}} confused with high reach demolition machines - {{but the two}} products are very different. Long reach machines are not suitable for the high side twisting forces that can be exerted by demolition attachments and many demolition machines are unstable at large radius - so they are often assisted with electronic cut off devices that restrict the operating radius of the machine. Long reach machines excel at dredging operations where large quantities of material needs {{to be removed from}} underwater while the physical plant stays above water. The high reach excavator is a development of the excavator with an especially long <b>boom</b> <b>arm,</b> that is primarily used for demolition. Instead of excavating ditches, the high reach excavator is designed to reach the upper stories of buildings that are being demolished and pull down the structure in a controlled fashion. It has largely replaced the wrecking ball as the primary tool for demolition.Ultra high reach demolition excavators (UHD) refers to demolition excavators with several tens of meters of reach. Reaches of up to 48 m are in operation as of 2016.|$|E

40|$|Problem: Incident {{investigation}} reports do {{not usually}} contain {{enough information to}} aid in studying <b>boom</b> <b>arm</b> vertical speed for roof bolting machines to determine the impact that appendage speed had on an operator's risk of experiencing a contact. Laboratory experiments with human subjects are also not feasible because of safety and ethical issues. Method Researchers successfully developed a three-dimensional computer model that uses virtual human simulation software as the primary means to gather contact data when the <b>boom</b> <b>arm</b> touches the operator's hand, arm, head, or leg. Results: Data analysis of roof bolter simulations shows that {{the speed of the}} <b>boom</b> <b>arm</b> is {{the most important factor in}} determining the risk of an operator making contact. Regardless of other variables, contact incidents were always greater when the bolter arm was moving up, greater on the hand, and greater for the <b>boom</b> <b>arm</b> part of the machine. The reason why the subject experiences more contacts when the <b>boom</b> <b>arm</b> is moving up rather than down is that more risky behaviors occur during drilling and bolting when the <b>boom</b> <b>arm</b> is ascending. Based on the data collected, boom speeds greater than 13 in/sec result in a substantial increase in risk to the roof bolter operator of making contact. Speeds less than or equal to 13 in/sec are associated with a more modest relative risk of making contact, which represents a decrease in potential hazard. Impact on Industry: The use of such information can be quite helpful in making recommendations to machine design and task procedures to reduce the likelihood that roof bolter operators will experience injury due to contact with a moving roof bolting machine's <b>boom</b> <b>arm...</b>|$|E
