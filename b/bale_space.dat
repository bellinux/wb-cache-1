50|$|Bale Cube (or <b>Bale</b> Capacity)- The <b>space</b> {{available}} for cargo measured in cubic {{feet to the}} inside of the cargo battens, on the frames, and to the underside of the beams. It is a measurement of capacity for cargo in bales, on pallets, etc., where the cargo does not conform to the shape of the ship.|$|R
50|$|Body {{cultural}} studies {{also contributed to}} a differentiation between what in everyday language often is confused as ‘space’ and ‘place’ whose dialectics were shown by the Chinese-American philosopher Yi-Fu Tuan (see <b>Bale</b> 2004). <b>Space</b> can be described by coordinates and by certain choreographies. Spatial structures can be standardized and transferred from place to place, which {{is the case with}} the standardized facilities of sports. Place, in contrast, is unique - it is only here or there. Locality is related to identity. People play in a certain place - and create the place by play and game. The place plays with the people, as a co-player.|$|R
50|$|Gross {{register}} tonnage (GRT) represents the total internal volume of a vessel, where one register ton {{is equal to}} a volume of 100 cubic feet (2.83168 m3), a volume that, if filled with fresh water, would weigh around 2,800 kg or 2.8 tonnes. The definition (and calculation) of the internal volume is complex; for instance, a ship's hold may be assessed for bulk grain (accounting for all the air space in the hold) or for <b>bales</b> (omitting the <b>spaces</b> into which bulk, but not baled cargo, would spill). If V stands for the total internal volume in m3, then the GRT equals V / 2.83168, so for a ship of 10,000 m3 total internal volume, the gross {{register tonnage}} is 10,000 / 2.83168 = 3531.47 GRT. Gross register tonnage was replaced by gross tonnage in 1994 under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969, {{and is no longer}} a widely used term in the industry.|$|R
40|$|One {{problem in}} {{high-density}} environment {{such as in}} Lae Lae isle, Makassar-Indonesia is the unavailability of shared public space. Lae Lae isle, one small island in front of Makassar city is a densely populated, where 0. 22 km 2 is occupied by 1. 563 people. Common sights in this isle are many people, all generations gathering {{on a bench in}} everywhere, and the bench called Bale bale. It is used by islander for private space and further change into shared place. The aims of this study are to identify the types, characteristics, and activity people on Bale bale. Further to consider about ???sharing system of Bale bale??? for shared place. This study is based on a phenomenon in field, so that empirical research study conducted in Lae Lae isle to collect the primary data, secondary data can be obtained by literature study. The field surveys were conducted three times, that is in November 2009, September 2010, and November 2011. The method of field survey included the mapping of the Bale bale???s locations, observing users behaviors, measuring of the Bale bales, documenting of users??? activities by camera, and interviewing the owners and users of the Bale bales. Seventy-two questionnaires were distributed to owners and users of the Bale bales in October 2009. The following are the main findings of this study: (1) There were 225 Bale bales scattered in Lae Lae isle, such as around the dwelling, along the roadside, along the beach, and in others public spaces. A social factor is influence on people use a Bale bale or a bench in a different place. (2) The owner can put the Bale bale anywhere in public space in Lae Lae isle without permission to neighbors. Bale bale was classified into five types, namely, siring, terrace, yard, roadside, and seashore type. It has a variety of sizes and it is not influence to number of users on Bale bale. Number of users on Bale bale is depending on the type and location of Bale bale. Further, Bale bale has two forms, that is prototype of Bale bale and hut-shaped of Bale bale. The main activity people on Bale bale is sitting and chatting, other activities are sleeping, eating, working, nurse the baby, folding the laundry, and hair lice cleaning. (3) The Bale bale is not merely a simple bench, but it is a gathered place, not only space but it is a place, which ???create a room and brings about the openness the open. Bale bale is owned by individual, and put it around their house, but at the same time; a) Sometimes Bale bales moved to better environment, not only by owner but also by neighbors. b) Whether they have own Bale bale or not, islanders visit and use others Bale bales in comfortable environment. c) Not only family and neighborhood, but also visitors are permitted to use every Bale bale in Lae Lae isle. By these customs and rules, islanders can share good environment in high-density island. (4) The Bale bale is a private space was changed into shared place, which is consideration by their custom and location of Bale <b>bale</b> in public <b>spaces.</b> The provision of sitting <b>space</b> like <b>Bale</b> bale as a shared place for social space, especially in the high-density environment is necessary...|$|R
