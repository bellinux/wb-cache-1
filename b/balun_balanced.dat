The impedance bandwidth of the balun determined by a back-to-back configuration can sometimes overestimate the balun operating bandwidth. With the conventional balun with a 180 ° phase delay line, {{it is observed that}} the <b>balun</b> <b>balance</b> over the operating frequencies becomes much more improved as the CPS length increases to over 0. 1 [*]λg.

40|$|Coaxial antennas with {{properties}} {{similar to}} those of a two-wire dipole antenna are presented and analyzed. Since coaxial antennas extend along a straight line and can have almost any radius, they may be easily inserted into confined spaces that require an antenna. Coaxial antennas are easy to construct, naturally adapted to a coaxial input connection, thus avoiding the use of a <b>balun</b> (a <b>balanced</b> to unbalanced adapter), and avoid using a T-shaped structure (as for the two-wire dipole). By altering in specific ways the inner and outer conductors of a 50 Ω transmission line, four different coaxial antennas are formed that have characteristics {{similar to those}} of a two-wire dipole antenna. These antennas are compared and discussed, while noting the similarities and differences between them and the two-wire dipole antenna. The antenna parameters determined are the near-field and far-field radiation patterns, the input impedance and the input reflection coefficient (S 11). The antennas are modeled using a high frequency structure simulator (HFSS), then constructed and their properties measured to confirm the calculations and simulations.

40|$|Balanced {{excitations}} {{are required}} to achieve ultra wideband performance with the novel reflector antenna feeds consisting of pair(s) of interleaved spiral, log-periodical or other travelling-wave structures, which are currently being developed for radio astronomic instruments [1]–[3]. This excitation is commonly realized by using a <b>balun</b> interfacing the <b>balanced</b> antenna to single-ended amplifiers. However, practical designs of such passive networks are often bulky and lead to power dissipation losses. Power dissipation reduces the antenna radiation efficiency and increases the system thermal noise temperature. Another limiting factor is that the ultra wideband balun design restricts the reference impedance for the optimum noise matching between the antennas and low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). To obviate these disadvantages, differential low-noise amplifiers (dLNA), which can be directly integrated at the antenna terminals, represent an interesting alternative solution...|$|R

40|$|Modern satellite, {{wireless}} communication, and {{radar systems}} often demand wideband performance for multi-channel operation {{and the ability}} to steer multiple beams for multiple moving targets. This dissertation covers a variety of topics to design low-cost and wideband antenna systems. The main areas of study are microwave devices controlled piezoelectric transducers (PETs) and wideband <b>baluns</b> and <b>balanced</b> microwave circuits using parallel-strip lines. Some focus has also been given to the design of Rotman lens for multiple beam generation and Vivaldi antenna arrays for wideband two-dimensional scanning. The dielectric perturbation technique controlled by PET is introduced to design a wideband phase shifter and a QPSK modulator, and to tune the resonant frequency of a slot dipole. The designed PET-controlled phase shifters are used for beam steering in a dual beam phased array using a bidirectional feeding scheme and a five-beam phased array using a microstrip Rotman lens. Vivaldi-type antennas are commonly used to achieve wideband performance. Very wideband performance can be achieved using an antipodal tapered slot antenna because of its inherent simple wideband transition from microstrip line to parallel-strip line. An antipodal tapered slot antenna and a phased array are designed to span 10 to 35 GHz. In addition, a 4 ?? 4 two-dimensional antenna array is designed using wideband antipodal tapered slot antennas, and two sets of PET-controlled phase shifters for E- and H-plane scanning are fabricated to steer the beam. As a microwave system using wideband antenna array, a new low-cost and wideband phased array radar is developed using a modulated pulse over 8 to 20 GHz band. The double-sided parallel-strip line as a balanced line is presented. The parallelstrip line offers much flexibility for microwave circuit designs. This transmission line makes it possible to realize a low impedance line and allows the design of a compact wideband balun and junction. Wideband transitions (or baluns) from parallel-strip line to microstrip line, a typical unbalanced transmission line, are realized to cover several octave bandwidth. Balanced microwave filters and a hybrid coupler are developed using the parallel-strip line...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, various {{architectures}} of 3 D compact microwave <b>balanced</b> to unbalanced (<b>balun)</b> transformers for Bluetooth/WiFi antenna {{applications are}} successfully designed and optimized using the Design of Experiments (DOE) approach. Two different multilayer topologies, one microstrip and one stripline, are investigated on Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) substrate. The design goals for both <b>baluns</b> are perfectly <b>balanced</b> outputs from 2 to 3 GHz and a resonant frequency of exactly 2. 4 GHz. It is demonstrated, using only eight simulations, that perfectly balanced outputs are not possible under the given {{conditions in the}} case of the microstrip balun. Nevertheless, the stripline balun can be optimized due to its almost symmetrical structure, and both simulations and measurement results verify the conclusions. The DOE method is very simple to implement and gives a clear understanding of the system behavior at the beginning of the design process, reducing the amount of work required for achieving the design goals by orders of magnitude compared to the widely used trial-and-error approach. The matching and unique measurement issues regarding the calibration, placement of probes and the deembedding of the microstrip to coplanar waveguide (CPW) transitions are discussed in detail for the optimized stripline balun. This technique can be easily applied to the fast and efficient optimization of complicated radiation structures, such as reconfigurable or multilayer mutliband antenna arrays...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents new circuit architectures {{and techniques}} {{for improving the}} performance of several key BiCMOS RFIC building blocks used in radar and wireless communication systems operating up to millimeter-wave frequencies, {{and the development of}} an advanced, low-cost and miniature millimeter-wave concurrent dual-band transmitter for short-range, high-resolution radar and high-rate communication systems. A new type of low-power active balun consisting of a common emitter amplifier with degenerative inductor and a common collector amplifier is proposed. The parasitic neutralization and compensation techniques are used to keep the <b>balun</b> well <b>balanced</b> at very high frequencies and across an ultra-wide bandwidth. A novel RF switch architecture with ultra-high isolation and possible gain is proposed, analyzed and demonstrated. The new RF switch architecture achieves an ultra-high isolation through implementation of a new RF leaking cancellation technique. A new class of concurrent dual-band impedance matching networks and technique for synthesizing them are presented together with a 25. 5 / 37 -GHz concurrent dual-band PA. These matching networks enable simultaneous matching of two arbitrary loads to two arbitrary sources at two different frequencies, utilizing the impedance-equivalence properties of LC networks that any LC network can be equivalent to an inductor, capacitor, open or short at different frequencies. K- and Ka-band ultra-low-leakage RF-pulse formers capable of producing very narrow RF pulses in the order of 200 ps with small rising and falling time for short-range high-resolution radar and high-data-rate communication systems are also developed. The complete transmitter exhibiting unique characteristics obtained from capabilities of producing very narrow and tunable RF pulses with extremely RF leakage and working concurrently in dual bands at 24. 5 and 35 GHz was designed. Capability of generating narrow and tunable RF pulses allows the radar system to flexibly work at high and multiple range resolutions. The extremely low RF leakage allows the transmitter to share one antenna system with receiver, turn on the PA at all time, comply the transmitting spectrum requirements, increase the system dynamic range, avoid harming to other systems; hence improving system size, cost and performance. High data-rate in communication systems is achieved as the consequence of transmitting very narrow RF pulses at high rates. In addition, the dissertation demonstrates a design approach for low chip-area, cost and power consumption systems in which a single dual-band component (power amplifier) is designed to operate with two RF signals simultaneously...|$|R

With full design equations, the proposed <b>balun</b> presents perfect <b>balanced</b> output and good input matching and the measurement results make a good agreement with the simulations. Second, Yagi-Uda antenna is also introduced as an entry to fully understand the quasi-Yagi antenna. Both of the antennas have the same design requirements and present the radiation properties. The arrangement of the antenna’s elements and the end-fire radiation property of the antenna have been presented. Finally, the quasi-Yagi antenna is used as an application of the balun where the proposed balun is employed to feed a quasi-Yagi antenna. The antenna is working in the S-band radio frequency and achieves a measured 36 % fractional bandwidth for return loss less than - 10 dB.
