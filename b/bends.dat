5|$|Meanders are sinuous <b>bends</b> in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around <b>bends.</b> As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E

This study aims to propose a set of principles to be followed for the planning of <b>bending</b> sequences and selection of <b>bending</b> tools for 2. 5 D sheet metals. To this end, we first define basic <b>bending</b> patterns by characterizing each pattern with a set of operation rules.

In order to select the <b>bending</b> tools, we combine the contours of each <b>bending</b> operation, choose appropriate <b>bending</b> punches from the bending-tool database, and then undertake an interference check with the <b>bending</b> contours...|$|R

The highway proceeds southward, entering {{rural areas and}} intersecting several small roads. The road continues, entering the former community of Gough and intersects FM 2068. FM 1528 turns due eastward and continues, exiting the Gough area. The roadway proceeds east, intersecting several county roads and traveling past several small houses. The highway <b>bends</b> southward and travels a short distance before it intersects SH 24. The highway runs concurrently with SH 24 for a short distance before splitting off, proceeding into the community of Klondike. The road turns northeast, after it proceeds through Klondike and intersects FM 2890. The roadway continues northeastward, passing through the Cooper Wildlife Management Area, as well as traveling over a creek leading to Cooper Lake before it reenters rural areas.

40|$|AbstractTo {{improve the}} forming quality and forming {{limit of the}} {{numerical}} control (NC) <b>bending</b> of high-pressure titanium alloy tubes, in this study, using three-dimensional (3 D) finite element method, deformation behavior of medium-strength TA 18 high-pressure tubes during NC <b>bending</b> with different <b>bending</b> radii is investigated. The {{results show that the}} cross-sectional deformation and the wall thickness variation during NC <b>bending</b> of TA 18 tubes using a small <b>bending</b> radius (less than 2 times of tube outside diameter) are clearly different from that using a normal <b>bending</b> radius (between 2 and 4 times of tube outside diameter). For <b>bending</b> with a normal <b>bending</b> radius, with or without a mandrel, the distribution of the flattening in the <b>bending</b> area resembles a platform and an asymmetric parabola, respectively. For <b>bending</b> with a small <b>bending</b> radius, with or without a mandrel, the flattening both distributes like a parabola, but the former has a stable peak which deflects toward the initial <b>bending</b> section, and the latter has a more pronounced peak with a <b>bending</b> angle and deflects slightly toward the <b>bending</b> section. The wall thickness variations with a normal <b>bending</b> radius, with and without a mandrel, both resemble a platform when the <b>bending</b> angle exceeds a certain angle. For the <b>bending</b> with a small radius, the distribution of the wall thickness variation without a mandrel follows an approximate parabola which increases in value as the <b>bending</b> angle increases. If a mandrel is used, the thickening ratio increases from the initial <b>bending</b> section to the <b>bending</b> section...|$|R

50|$|The Three-Roll Push <b>Bending</b> (TRPB) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used freeform-bending process to manufacture <b>bending</b> geometries consisting of several plane <b>bending</b> curves. Nevertheless, a 3D-shaping is possible. The profile is guided between bending-roll and supporting-roll(s), while being pushed through the tools. The position of the forming-roll defines the <b>bending</b> radius. The <b>bending</b> point is the tangent-point between tube and bending-roll. To change the <b>bending</b> plane, the pusher rotates the tube around its longitudinal axis. Generally, a TRPB tool kit can be applied on a conventional rotary draw <b>bending</b> machine. The process is very flexible since with a unique tool set, several <b>bending</b> radii values Rm can be obtained, although the geometrical precision of the process is not comparable to rotary draw <b>bending.</b> <b>Bending</b> contours defined as spline- or polynomial-functions can be manufactured.|$|R
