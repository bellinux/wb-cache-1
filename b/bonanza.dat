5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of <b>Bonanza</b> Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into <b>Bonanza,</b> later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on <b>Bonanza.</b> Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give it much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{literature has}} examined the causes, consequences, and policy responses to surges in international capital flows. A related strand of papers has attempted to catalog current account reversals and capital account "sudden stops. " This paper offers an encompassing approach with an algorithm cataloging capital inflow <b>bonanzas</b> in both advanced and emerging economies during 1980 - 2007 for 181 countries and 1960 - 2007 for a subset of 66 economies from all regions. In line with earlier studies, global factors, such as commodity prices, international interest rates, and growth in the world’s largest economies, have a systematic effect on the global capital flow cycle. <b>Bonanzas</b> are no blessing for advanced or emerging market economies. In {{the case of the}} latter, capital inflow <b>bonanzas</b> are associated with a higher likelihood of economic crises (debt defaults, banking, inflation and currency crashes). <b>Bonanzas</b> in developing countries are associated with procyclical fiscal policies and attempts to curb or avoid an exchange rate appreciation - very likely contributing to economic vulnerability. For the advanced economies, the results are not as stark, but <b>bonanzas</b> are associated with more volatile macroeconomic outcomes for GDP growth, inflation, and the external accounts. Slower economic growth and sustained declines in equity and housing prices follow {{at the end of the}} inflow episode. capital inflows; commodity prices; financial crises; procyclical policies...|$|R

5|$|Bona Allen saddles were {{available}} through the Sears mail order catalog, and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company, including cowboy actors Gene Autry, the cast of <b>Bonanza,</b> and Roy Rogers, who used a Bona Allen saddle on his horse Trigger. A statue of Roy Rogers and a Bona Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E

25|$|In January 2012 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority {{issued an}} {{airworthiness}} directive grounding all <b>Bonanzas,</b> Twin <b>Bonanzas</b> and Debonairs {{equipped with a}} single pole-style yoke, having forward elevator control cables more than 15 years old, until they could be inspected. The AD was issued based on two aircraft found to have frayed cables, one of which suffered a cable failure just prior to takeoff and resulting concerns {{about the age of}} the cables in fleet aircraft of this age. At the time of the grounding some <b>Bonanzas</b> had reached 64 years in service. Aircraft with frayed cables were grounded until the cables were replaced and those that passed inspection were required to have their cables replaced within 60 days regardless. The AD affected only Australian aircraft and was not adopted by the airworthiness authority responsible for the type certificate, the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA instead opted to issue a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) requesting that the elevator control cables be inspected during the annual inspection.|$|R

5|$|Of the {{estimated}} 30,000 to 40,000 people who reached Dawson City during the gold rush, only around 15,000 to 20,000 finally became prospectors. Of these, {{no more than}} 4,000 struck gold {{and only a few}} hundred became rich. By the time most of the stampeders arrived in 1898, the best creeks had all been claimed, either by the long-term miners in the region, or by the first arrivals of the year before. The <b>Bonanza,</b> Eldorado, Hunker and Dominion Creeks were all taken, with almost 10,000 claims recorded by the authorities by July 1898; a new prospector would have to look further afield to find a claim of his own.|$|E

5|$|On August 16, 1896, an American {{prospector}} named George Carmack, his Tagish wife Kate Carmack (Shaaw Tláa), {{her brother}} Skookum Jim (Keish), and their nephew Dawson Charlie (K̲áa Goox̱) were travelling {{south of the}} Klondike River. Following a suggestion from Robert Henderson, a Canadian prospector, they began looking for gold on <b>Bonanza</b> Creek, then called Rabbit Creek, one of the Klondike's tributaries. It is not clear who discovered the gold: George Carmack or Skookum Jim, but the group agreed to let George Carmack appear as the official discoverer because they feared that mining authorities would be reluctant to recognize a claim made by an Indigenous Person.|$|E
5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} <b>bonanza,</b> usually a carcass, {{with a series of}} loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E
5|$|The {{road that}} became SR28 was paved around 1932, {{and has been}} used for flumes in the timber {{industry}} since 1880.

The highway gained fame for many years as the location of the Ponderosa Ranch, filming location of the television series <b>Bonanza.</b> On June 7, 1994, the Nevada Department of Transportation(NDOT) designated SR28 as a scenic byway, named North Shore Road. Later in September 1996, SR28 and part of US50 was designated as Lake Tahoe - Eastshore Drive, a National Scenic Byway.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the impacts of coffe <b>bonanzas</b> and crisis on the Colombian economy, given its importance, {{has been one of}} the favorite topics of research both by colombian and foreign economists, Cárdenas(1991);Carkovic (1992); Cuddington (1986); Ocampo (1994); Posada(1992);Urrutia and Suescún(1994). The political economy aspects behind the policy response by colombian authorities has not had similar emphasis in the literature. Such is the topic of this paper. The article stars with a historical overview of the international coffee price with the purpose of identifying the major periods of <b>bonanzas</b> and crissi. In a chronological pattern, the paper discusses the main institutional and political economy issues that took place then and the extent to which they may explain the macroeconomic response to <b>bonanzas</b> and crisis. The paper singles out the key role traditionally played by the coffee growers represented through the National Federation of Coffee Growers and poses the question of what should be its future role, in a country where coffee has lost its importance in foreign exchange earnings and in GDP, but where the coffee activity continues to be an important source of rural employment and where the coffee producers maintain a political and economic leadership in key regions of the country. ...|$|R

5|$|Thousands of {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Dakota Territory in the 1870s and 1880s for its cheap land, and the population began to rise. Many established small family farms, but some investors bought thousands of acres for <b>bonanza</b> farms, where they supervised the cultivation and harvesting of wheat as a commodity crop. The city grew quickly after {{the arrival of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887. In 1883, the University of North Dakota was established, six years before North Dakota was admitted as an independent state born from the Dakota Territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1898, Dawson's {{population}} rose further to 30,000 as stampeders arrived over the passes. The centre of the town, Front Street, was lined with hastily built buildings and warehouses, together with log cabins and tents spreading out across {{the rest of the}} settlement. There was no running water or sewerage, and only two springs for drinking water to supplement the increasingly polluted river. In spring, the unpaved streets were churned into thick mud and in summer the settlement reeked of human effluent and was plagued by flies and mosquitoes. Land in Dawson was now scarce, and plots sold for up to $10,000 ($8 million) each; prime locations on Front Street could reach $20,000 ($16 million) while a small log cabin might rent for $100 ($2,700) a month. As a result, Dawson's population spread south into the empty Hän village, renaming it Klondike City. Other communities emerged closer to the mines, such as Granville on Dominion Creek and Grand Forks on <b>Bonanza</b> Creek.|$|E
5|$|Mauricio González-Gordon y Díez, Marquis of <b>Bonanza</b> (18 October 1923 – 27 September 2013) was a Spanish sherry {{maker and}} a conservationist. Most {{of his life}} he worked for the family company, González Byass, where he {{increased}} its exports to a worldwide level. His family estate was located in the wetland region called Doñana in southern Spain and was threatened by drainage efforts in the early 1950s. González-Gordon with the help of researchers and international support managed to preserve the site, {{while at the same time}} donating some of his family land to the conservation effort. Afterward, González-Gordon became one of the founders of the Spanish Ornithological Society in 1954. His conservation efforts for Doñana culminated in the creation of the Doñana National Park in 1969. The area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.|$|E
