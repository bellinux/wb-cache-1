40|$|A {{large amount}} of fine {{granular}} materials (< 6 mm) are produced during the mining of oil shale. The combustion characteristics of oil shale improve with decreasing size of these materials, for which reason fine-grain oil shale has a high utility value. However, fine oil shale also contains {{a significant amount of}} inorganic mineral impurities which can be reduced by physical separation to improve the oil quality. Based on an analysis of the physical properties of oil shale, this paper proposes a compound dry separation process for the cleaning of < 6 mm oil shale grains. The effects of the vibration intensity, air velocity, and <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> of the employed separator on the separation results and oil content of the cleaned oil shale were systematically analyzed. Under the optimal vibrational conditions defined by a vibration intensity of 25. 76 (amplitude = 4. 0 mm, frequency = 40 Hz), air velocity of 0. 66 m/s, and <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> of 45 degrees, the yield comprised 35. 8 % concentrate and 64. 2 % tailings, with corresponding oil contents of 10. 02 % and 0. 85 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> and leg height on sitting {{forces in a}} {{wheelchair}} were studied, using a force plate mounted on a wheelchair seat. Readings of both normal force (perpen-dicular to the seat) and shear force were measured while the chair's <b>back</b> <b>angle</b> and footrest height were changed. Pressure under the ischial tuberosities was also measured during the footrest height adjustments. Five normal subjects sat directly on the plate as well as upon ROHO and Jay cushions placed on the force plate. Returning the back to the upright position after a recline caused the normal force (± SD) to increase 5. 4 ± 2. 5, 9. 5 ± 4. 0, and 10. 0 ± 2. 3 kg for the hard surface, Jay cushion, and ROHO cushion respectively, while shear at the plate increased to 5. 1 ± 2. 2, 11. 6 ± 2. 6, and 12. 3 ± 2. 7 kg for the hard surface, Jay cushion, and ROHO cushion respectively. Leaning forward (away from the back) caused all the forces to return to measurements close to the starting values. The {{results suggest that the}} wheelchair user should momentarily lean forward after a recline to reduce undesired forces. If a cushion with firm thigh support is used, ischial tuberosity pressure can be reduced by lowering the leg height as much as possible, which causes a levering action by lifting the pelvis.
