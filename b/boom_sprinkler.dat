40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} {{experiments}} were conducted during summer season of 2009 in Germany {{to evaluate and}} develop the performance of nozzle boom machines (NBM) vs. boom machine with drag hoses (BDH). Laboratory tests were carried out to investigate {{the performance of the}} drag hoses at four different levels of pressure. From these laboratory tests it was possible to choose the suitable hose size. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of <b>boom</b> <b>sprinkler</b> machines before and after modification. Using the boom machine with drag hoses mounted on the boom system at a medium or low pressure instead of the sprinklers can be an alternative to the use of boom systems in some crops and topographical conditions. The water loss can be minimized with this system. The results indicated that, the hose with orifice plate diameter of 4 mm was chosen at operating pressure ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 3 bar. Using boom with drag hoses after modification showed that the average water depth was about 13 mm and the highest value was measured directly under the hoses. The boom with drag hoses has very important advantages in comparison to nozzle boom or sprinkler machines. As a conclusion, the boom machine with drag hoses is suitable for using to improve the water relations and energy saving...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{concerned the}} effect of drying out of soil on the yield {{of a number of}} vegetables and the practical use of irrigation. From the extensive literature published in various countries on this aspect of irrigation research, a series of soil moisture conditions for vegetables (early potatoes, carrots, broad beans, beet root, endive, lettuce, cauliflower, dwarf beans, Scottish kale, Savoy cabbage, spinach and strawberries) was achieved on a trial plot of rather drought-susceptible soil by preventing natural precipitation by removable glass-covers and by irrigation with mobile <b>sprinkler</b> <b>booms.</b> These conditions varied in the limit of drying measured as percentage soil moisture on a weight basis and expressed as average moisture tension (pF), either constant for the entire growing period or varied at different stages of crop development (sensitive period experiments). In other experiments drying of the soil was slowed down by small daily irrigations based on estimated evaporation in the previous 24 hours or at a fixed amount. The yield and crop quality was strongly correlated with the average pF, however sometimes as optimum curve for parts of the growing period...|$|R
