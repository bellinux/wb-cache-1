2500|$|The {{brakes on}} the new TL have been {{increased}} in size, from the older [...] front disc and [...] rear disc to the now Ridgeline-sized [...] front discs and [...] rear disc, still incorporating an internal rear drum e-brake while maintaining hydraulic discs for the foot applied <b>brakes.</b> The <b>bolt</b> pattern on the car {{is no longer a}} 5 x [...] but a 5 x [...] for this generation.|$|R
50|$|A second free-turning pinion wheel {{which also}} meshed with the rack, was {{mounted on the}} leading driving axle. It had grooved <b>brake</b> drums <b>bolted</b> to each side and acted as a brake only, with the brakes being applied by a hand {{mechanism}} from the footplate. The brakes on the driving and free-turning pinion wheels were separately controlled, while the vacuum brake gear on the engine was only used to control the brakes of the train.|$|R
50|$|The {{brakes on}} the new TL have been {{increased}} in size, from the older 11.8 in front disc and 11.1 in rear disc to the now Ridgeline-sized 12.6 in front discs and 13.2 in rear disc, still incorporating an internal rear drum e-brake while maintaining hydraulic discs for the foot applied <b>brakes.</b> The <b>bolt</b> pattern on the car {{is no longer a}} 5 x 114.3 mm but a 5 x 120 mm for this generation.|$|R
5000|$|The Savage 110 BA is a bolt-action sniper/tactical rifle {{manufactured}} by the Savage Arms Company. The rifle is designated with an [...] "LE" [...] code; [...] "Law Enforcement". All 110 BA series rifles are configured with AccuTrigger, matte-blued barreled action, fluted heavy free-floating barrel, muzzle <b>brake,</b> oversized <b>bolt</b> handle, external box magazine (holding 5 - 6 rounds), magpul adjustable stock, adjustable pistol grip, and three swivel studs for sling and bipod mounting.|$|R
5000|$|No {{specific}} problems have occurred {{with the engine}} or transmission. The steering <b>brakes</b> are overstressed. <b>Bolts</b> in the steering slide of one steering brake have torn out three times and the brake bands {{have had to be}} changed twice because the rivets were over-heated." ...|$|R
50|$|The E30 M3 {{differed}} from the standard E30 by having a 5x120 wheel bolt pattern. The E30 M3 had increased caster angle through major front suspension changes. The M3 had specific solid rubber offset control arm bushings. It used aluminium control arms and the front strut tubes were changed to a design similar (bolt on kingpins and swaybar mounted to strut tube) to the E28 5-series. This included carrying over the 5 series front wheel bearings and <b>brake</b> caliper <b>bolt</b> spacing. The rear suspension was a carry over from the E30.|$|R
5000|$|These CAD models {{describe}} {{not simply}} the envelope or shape of the object, but CAD models also embody the [...] "design intent" [...] (i.e., critical features {{and their relationship to}} other features). An example of design intent not evident in the shape alone might be a <b>brake</b> drum's lug <b>bolts,</b> which must be concentric with the hole in the centre of the drum. This knowledge would drive the sequence and method of creating the CAD model; a designer with an awareness of this relationship would not design the lug bolts referenced to the outside diameter, but instead, to the center. A modeler creating a CAD model will want to include both Shape and design intent in the complete CAD model.|$|R
40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{understanding}} how to mitigate the safety hazard of splash and spray around heavy vehicles, a computational study of the aerodynamics and spray dispersion about a simplified trailer wheel assembly has been completed. A tandem dual slick (TDS) wheel model that neglects complex geometric features such as <b>brakes,</b> wheel <b>bolts</b> and wheel cutouts but with the same dimensions as an actual trailer wheel assembly was used. A detailed simulation of the wheels alone demonstrated that the flow field is both unsteady and complex, containing a number of vortical structures that interact strongly with spray. Preliminary simulations with fenders and fairings demonstrated that these devices prevent the ballistic transport of drops larger than approximately 0. 1 mm, but the fine mist speculated {{to be responsible for}} visibility reduction is unaffected. This work suggests that to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to design and evaluate spray mitigation strategies the jet or sheet breakup processes can be modeled using an array of injectors of small (< 0. 01 mm) water droplets; however the choice of size distribution, injection locations, directions and velocities is largely unknown and requires further study. Possible containment strategies would include using flow structures to 'focus' particles into regions away from passing cars or surface treatments to capture small drops...|$|R
50|$|The Jatimatic is an automatic, open bolt, blowback-operated firearm. A unique {{feature of}} this design is {{the angle of the}} bolt guide rails in {{relation}} to the bore axis. When fired, the telescopic bolt which encloses the barrel for most of its length, recoils up an inclined plane at a 7Â° angle to the barrel, giving an element of <b>braking</b> to the <b>bolt,</b> and also resisting the upward movement of the barrel during fully automatic fire. This arrangement aligns the shooter's hand wrapping the pistol grip directly with the longitudinal axis of the barrel. The pistol grip is also located higher than on many other submachine guns, causing recoil to be directed backwards to the user rather than upwards, eliminating muzzle climb and making the weapon more controllable when being fired one-handed.|$|R
40|$|DE 102007044718 B 3 UPAB: 20090313 NOVELTY - The device (11) has {{a holding}} device (27) for {{rotatable}} fastening of vehicle wheels (33). A drum (16) is formed around the wheels such that the wheels are brought in engagement with an inner circumferential surface of the drum. A drive device (12) is provided for rotation in the drum. A loading device (26) positions the wheels towards the drum based on operating load simulations. The loading device has a kinematic actuator with working cylinders (27), where the actuator supports an upper platform (31) that is changeable in angle and positions. The device (27) is arranged at the platform. USE - Device for testing vehicle wheels, wheel hubs, wheel bearings, wheel <b>bolts,</b> <b>brake</b> disks and brake drums under load conditions. ADVANTAGE - The loading device has the kinematic actuator with working cylinders, where the actuator supports an upper platform that is changeable in angle and positions, thus realizing complete movement degrees of freedom corresponding real time driving operations in the labor-assisted testing device. The device is designed such that simple maintenance, and simple assembly and disassembly of the device re maintained...|$|R
