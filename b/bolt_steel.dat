30|$|A special <b>bolt</b> <b>steel</b> formula {{has been}} developed, which changes the steel {{mechanical}} properties. With suitable rolling method, a high strength (500 – 600  MPa), high elongation bolt material has been developed. Using new 19 structure wires instead of 7 structure wires, a large elongation, powerful cable bolt has been developed. Also, a bolt torque multiplier has been developed, which enables the output torque of bolt driller to be amplified 6 times, and solves {{the problems of}} rock bolt prestressing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{metallurgical}} influence on rock bolt stress corrosion cracking {{for a range of}} (1) existing rock <b>bolt</b> <b>steels</b> and (2) commercial <b>steels.</b> Rock <b>bolt</b> <b>steels</b> 1355, MAC and MA 840 B displayed SCC when loaded at 0. 019 MPa s(- 1) in the sulphate pH 2. 1 solutions at the free corrosion potential. They had comparable threshold stresses and comparable stress corrosion crack vel) cities. Rock <b>bolts</b> <b>steel</b> 5152 CW 10 D had the best SCC resistance of the rock <b>bolt</b> <b>steels</b> tested. Cold work increased the resistance of 5152 to SCC. The five commercial steels 1008, X 65, X 70, 4140 and 4145 H were subjected to the linearly increasing stress test (LIST) in the dilute pH 2. 1 sulphate solution at their free corrosion potential and at increasingly negative applied potential values to - 1500 mV. The increasingly negative applied potential increases the aggressivity of SCC conditions because of increasing hydrogen liberated at the specimen surface. The steels 1008, X 65 X 70 and 4145 H resisted SCC for all applied potentials including - 1500 mV. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Fatigue {{strength}} of a pre-strained <b>bolt</b> <b>steel,</b> SCM 3, has been investigated {{in relation to the}} effects of the amount of pre-strain and the additional straining of the pre-strained specimen {{in the course of the}} fatigue process and the influence of the time when the secondary strain was applied. This simulated re-fastening the relaxed bolts commonly encountered in service. Furthermore, differing from the current investigations, where average diametral strain is used, actual surface strain which was obtained by FEM analysis was employed considering the fact that the fatigue damage is concentrated on the specimen surface...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} rock bolt Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC), a series of experiments have been performed in Linearly Increasing Stress Test (LIST) apparatus. One series of experiments determined the threshold stress of various bolt metallurgies (900 MPa for Steel A, and 800 MPa for Steel B and C). The high values of threshold stress suggest that SCC begins in rock bolts when they are sheared by moving rock strata. Typical crack velocity values have been measured to be 2. 5 x 10 (- 8) m s(- 1), indicating {{that there is not}} much benefit for rock <b>bolt</b> <b>steel</b> of higher fracture toughness. Another series of experiments were performed to understand the environmental conditions causing SCC of steel A and galvanised Steel A rock <b>bolt</b> <b>steel.</b> SCC only occurred for environmental conditions for which produce hydrogen on the sample surface, leading to hydrogen embrittlement and SCC. Fracture surfaces of LIST samples failed by SCC were found to display the same fracture regions as fracture surfaces of rock bolts failed in service by SCC: Tearing Topography Surface (TTS), Corrugated Irregular Surface (CIS), quasi Micro Void Coalescence (qMVC) and Fast Fracture Surface (FFS). Water chemistry analysis were carried out on samples collected from various Australian mines in order to compare laboratory electrolyte conditions to those found in underground mines...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT•To {{examine a}} {{possible}} contribution of hydrogen on the crack initiation and propagation behaviour of high strength <b>bolt</b> <b>steel,</b> ASTM A 490, fatigue tests {{was carried out}} under hydrogen environment. The conventional fatigue limit in air that is 300 MPa, disappears in hydrogen environment and shows unexpectedly low stress level around 50 MPa at 107 due to the subsurface development of mechanistic damage caused by hydrogen. Test results show that fatigue-dominated mode of fracture at higher stress levels and the hydrogen-dominated mode of fracture at lower stress levels describe {{the nature of the}} fatigue fracture in hydrogen environment. Appearance of the QC facet on the fracture surface due to hydrogen should explain the initiation and propagation of the crack at the stress level far below the fatigue limit in air...|$|E

Then a parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of different restraint measures on the local buckling behaviour and the sensitivity of the buckling behaviour to the initial imperfection. Fitted formulae were developed to calculate the structural field capacity of the <b>bolted</b> <b>steel</b> plates, and recommended values of stiffener size were also provided to facilitate the strengthening design of steel jacketing...|$|R

30|$|An {{example of}} a unique fire testing furnace based on {{electrical}} heating is the University of Sheffield’s connection testing furnace (Yu et al. 2011). This relatively small-scale facility was custom designed to allow testing of <b>bolted</b> <b>steel</b> connections at elevated temperature under the appropriate combinations of moment, shear, thrust, and rotation that would be expected in a real building in a fire. Heating is accomplished using electrical resistance heaters, and loading is applied by a relatively complicated mechanism of restraining frames and loading jacks. This allows detailed, rational studies of the response of <b>bolted</b> <b>steel</b> connections under {{a wide range of}} possible structural and thermal actions.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} anchor bolts embedded in unreinforced concrete, monotonically loaded in shear is described. The anchor bolts are embedded sufficiently {{to develop the}} minimum tensile strength of the <b>bolt</b> <b>steel.</b> Pairs of anchor bolts (double-bolt anchorages) with varying spacings and edge distances are loaded in shear in the direction perpendicular {{to the line of}} the bolts. Single-bolt anchorages are also tested in shear with varying edge distances and compared with the results of the double-bolt anchorage tests. Concrete failure with wedge cone is observed in most cases. The effects of the edge distance and bolt spacing on the shear resistance of anchor bolts are discussed. The ACI Committee 349 shear resistance formula has been found to give good estimates of the singlebolt anchorage tests. However, the concept of wedge cone interaction, commonly used for calculating the tensile pull-out capacity of anchor bolt groups, is found not directly applicable to double-bolt anchorages under shear. The influence of the support conditions of the concrete test blocks on anchor bolt shear strengths is also investigated...|$|E
40|$|To improve mine safety, the Bureau of Mines has {{conducted}} {{a search for}} better materials and systems to anchor roof bolts. This report describes {{a study on the}} ability of a gypsum-based anchoring medium to withstand short- and long-term loads. Results showed that 2 -ft-long bolts anchored with gypsum that was injected as plaster slurry at a 0. 370 water-cement ratio and cured for 10 min sustained pull test loads equal to the ultimate strength of the <b>bolt</b> <b>steel</b> (about 37, 000 lb). For comparison, the minimum required capacity is 17, 600 lb. Long-term loads of 15, 500 lb were sustained with estimated 10 -yr movement of less than 1 / 2 in. Two-foot-long bolts anchored with gypsum installed in a cartridge in which the water was contained in tiny capsules sustained a pull test load of about 30, 300 lb at a 0. 319 water-cement ratio and 10 -min cure time. At a 0. 288 water-cement ratio, load capacity was about 37, 000 lb. The lower load capacities of cartridge-installed bolts resulted primarily from the remnants of the water-wax capsules. Above 10, 000 lb, creep movement of cartridge-grouted bolts appears excessive, but longer bolts may be capable of resisting creep better...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{compares the}} shear behavior of fiber glass (FG) bolt, rock <b>bolt</b> (<b>steel</b> rebar bolt) and cable bolt for the bolt contribution to bolted concrete surface shear strength, and bolt failure mode. Two double shear apparatuses of different size {{were used for}} the study. The tensile strength, the shear strength and the deformation modulus of bolt control the shear behavior of a sheared bolted joint. Since the strength and deformation modulus of FG bolt, rock bolt and cable bolt obtained from uniaxial tensile tests are different, their shear behavior in reinforcing joints is accordingly different. Test results showed that the shear stiffness of FG bolted joints decreased gradually from the beginning to end, while the shear stiffness of joints reinforced by rock bolt and cable bolt decreased bi-linearly, which is clearly consistent with their tensile deformation modulus. The bolted joint shear stiffness was highly influenced by bolt pretension in the high stiffness stage for both rock bolt and cable bolt, but not in the low stiffness stage. The rock bolt contribution to joint shear strength standardised by the bolt tensile strength was the largest, followed by cable bolts, then FG bolts. Both the rock bolts and cable bolts tended to fail in tension, while FG bolts in shear due to their low shear strength and constant deformation modulus...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{quenched}} and tempered microstructures on the diffusion coefficient and solubility of hydrogen in high tensile strength <b>bolt</b> <b>steel</b> have been investigated {{by means of the}} electrochemical permeation technique. The results obtained are as follows : (1) The diffusion coefficient was minimum when the steel had the as-quenched martensitic structure or the low temperature tempered martensite, and it increased with increasing tempering temperature. The mixed structure of ferrite and lamellar pearlite obtained by furnace cooling from a temperature above Ac_ 3 gave a higher diffusion coefficient than the tempered spheroidal pearlite. On the other hand, the solubility of hydrogen showed a behavior opposite to the diffusion coefficient. (2) The low diffusion coefficient and high solubility are attributed predominantly to hydrogen trapping at the lattice imperfections, such as dislocations and faults etc., which were introduced by martensitic transformation during quenching. (3) With regard to the effect of cathodic current density, i. e., the hydrogen concentration directly below the surface on hydrogen diffusion in tempered steel, the diffusion coefficient hardly depended upon the hydrogen concentration but the solubility of hydrogen increased up to a certain value with increasing cathodic current density. On the other hand, the hydrogen permeation current efficiency decreased with increasing cathodic current density. (4) The activation energies for hydrogen diffusion in the tempered martensite, tempered fine and/or spheroidal pearlites in the temperature range of 6 to 61 ℃, were almost constant (about 8. 1 kcal/mol) but the pre-exponential factor increased with tempering temperature. The heats of solution of hydrogen in the tempered martensite and tempered pearlites were almost the same (about - 10. 3 kcal/mol), indicating the exothermic reaction. However, the pre-exponential factor decreased with increaing tempering temperature...|$|E
40|$|Six service-failed rock bolts, all {{broken through}} the {{threaded}} region {{at the end}} of the bolt, were examined. All bolts were made from 840 Grade steel, a medium carbon manganese silicon vanadium hot rolled microalloyed steel, and had a diameter of 22 mm. All six bolts had been installed in a single mine which had a high-pH, sulphate-rich groundwater. Prior to investigating the failed bolts, some preliminary studies were undertaken to provide background information for the work. The first of these involved tensile testing of notched and un-notched rock bolts made from the same steel as the failed rock bolts. The notched rock bolt contained a 2 mm deep flat-bottomed V notch with a bottom width of 0. 5 mm, while the full rock bolt profile was retained for the un-notched test. The un-notched rock bolt underwent substantial necking and failed by microvoid coalescence. The notched rock bolt showed no appreciable macroscopic plasticity and failed by cleavage. Additionally, a sample from the same rock <b>bolt</b> <b>steel</b> was loaded through the threads in bending until failure occurred. Fracture initiated at the base of one of the threads and propagated in a ductile manner by microvoid coalescence for the first 1. 5 mm of the fracture, but thereafter by brittle cleavage. Stable cracks were also produced at the base of the adjoining threads. The effect of corrosion by mine water on the appearance of ductile (microvoid coalescence) and brittle (cleavage) fracture surfaces in the same steel was also examined. Corrosion substantially changed the appearance of both types of fracture surface, but the two different types of fracture were still quite different in appearance. Five of the six rock bolts were found to have failed by stress corrosion, with cracking initiating at the base of one of the threads. In two of these cases, the stress corrosion crack initiated from a 1 - 2 mm deep pre-existing crack, considered to have been induced by bending. One of the six bolts failed by overload. Laps were seen frequently at the root of the cold rolled threads but these did not appear to have played a significant role in the failures...|$|E
