The code used for health effects is the biological model developed for tactical nuclear weapons warfare survival of young adults in a 1 g environment. We find the risks of early lethality to be very small especially if appropriate medical action (antibiotics and blood transfusions) is taken soon after the exposure. The primary concern would then be for the development of cancer later in life. Although leukemia could occur relatively soon after the exposure, the risk of solid tumors might be best controlled by using mature individuals for the mission, and thereby offset cancer ris [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The Langley cosmic ray {{transport}} {{code and}} the Langley nucleon transport code (BRYNTRN) {{are used to}} quantify the transport and attenuation of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar proton flares through the Martian atmosphere. Surface doses are estimated using both a low density and a high density carbon dioxide model of the atmosphere which, in the vertical direction, provides a total of 16 g/sq cm and 22 g/sq cm of protection, respectively. At the Mars surface during the solar minimum cycle, a <b>blood-forming</b> <b>organ</b> (BFO) dose equivalent of 10. 5 to 12 rem/yr due to galactic cosmic ray transport and attenuation is calculated. Estimates of the BFO dose equivalents {{which would have been}} incurred from the three large solar flare events of August 1972, November 1960, and February 1956 are also calculated at the surface. Results indicate surface BFO dose equivalents of approximately 2 to 5, 5 to 7, and 8 to 10 rem per event, respectively.

40|$|In this study, the {{ionizing}} radiation environment is estimated, using the Mission Radiation Calculation (MIRACAL) program, for several long-duration-stay Mars missions proposed for {{early in the}} 21 (sup st) century. Both minimum energy and fast transfer missions are evaluated and their 30 -day maximum, annual maximum, and total slab skin and <b>blood-forming</b> <b>organ</b> (BFO) doses are compared. When large flares were included while the astronauts were on the surface, the delivered dose did not significantly contribute to the total dose (less than 4 cSv BFO dose, or 8 percent of the guideline annual limit, for the most energetic event simulated) due to the substantial protection provided by the Martian atmosphere. However, dose delivered by large flares during transit is dependent on vehicle shielding and distance from the Sun. All of the fast transfer missions studied had lower total and annual maximum doses than the corresponding minimum energy transfer missions (on average, 30 % less for missions having no large flares and the shielding thicknesses evaluated in this study). For all the missions studied, having the astronauts spend one-third of their day during transit in a 10 g/sq cm storm shelter resulted in an approximate 10 % reduction in the total mission dose...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} dose received by crew members in interplanetary space {{is influenced by}} the stage of the solar cycle. Using the recently developed models of the galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) environment and the energy-dependent radiation transport code, we have calculated the dose at 0 and 5 cm water depth; using a computerized anatomical man (CAM) model, we have calculated the skin, eye and <b>blood-forming</b> <b>organ</b> (BFO) doses as a function of aluminum shielding for various solar minima and maxima between 1954 and 1989. These results show that the equivalent dose is within about 15 % of the mean for the various solar minima (maxima). The maximum variation between solar minimum and maximum equivalent dose is about a factor of three. We have extended these calculations for the 1976 - 1977 solar minimum to five practical shielding geometries: Apollo Command Module, the least and most heavily shielded locations in the U. S. space shuttle mid-deck, center of the proposed Space Station Freedom cluster and sleeping compartment of the Skylab. These calculations, using the quality factor of ICRP 60, show that the average CAM BFO equivalent dose is 0. 46 Sv/year. Based on an approach that takes fragmentation into account, we estimate a calculation uncertainty of 15 % if the uncertainty in the quality factor is neglected...|$|R

40|$|The {{radiation}} risk to astronauts {{has always}} been based on measurements using passive thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). The skin dose is converted to dose equivalent using an average radiation quality factor based on model calculations. The radiological risk estimates, however, are based on organ and tissue doses. This paper describes results from the first space flight (STS- 91, 51. 65 degrees inclination and approximately 380 km altitude) of a fully instrumented Alderson Rando phantom torso (with head) to relate the skin dose to organ doses. Spatial distributions of absorbed dose in 34 1 -inch-thick sections measured using TLDs are described. There is about a 30 % change in dose as one moves from the front {{to the back of}} the phantom body. Small active dosimeters were developed specifically to provide time-resolved measurements of absorbed dose rates and quality factors at five organ locations (brain, thyroid, heart/lung, stomach and colon) inside the phantom. Using these dosimeters, it was possible to separate the trapped-proton and the galactic cosmic radiation components of the doses. A tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) and a charged-particle directional spectrometer (CPDS) were flown next to the phantom torso to provide data on the incident internal radiation environment. Accurate models of the shielding distributions at the site of the TEPC, the CPDS and a scalable Computerized Anatomical Male (CAM) model of the phantom torso were developed. These measurements provided a comprehensive data set to map the dose distribution inside a human phantom, and to assess the accuracy and validity of radiation transport models throughout the human body. The results show that for the conditions in the International Space Station (ISS) orbit during periods near the solar minimum, the ratio of the <b>blood-forming</b> <b>organ</b> dose rate to the skin absorbed dose rate is about 80 %, and the ratio of the dose equivalents is almost one. The results show that the GCR model dose-rate predictions are 20 % lower than the observations. Assuming that the trapped-belt models lead to a correct orbit-averaged energy spectrum, the measurements of dose rates inside the phantom cannot be fully understood. Passive measurements using 6 Li- and 7 Li-based detectors on the astronauts and inside the brain and thyroid of the phantom show the presence of a significant contribution due to thermal neutrons, an area requiring additional study...|$|R

40|$|NASA's {{long-range}} plans include possible human exploratory {{missions to}} the moon and Mars within the next quarter century. Such missions beyond low Earth orbit will expose crews to transient radiation from solar particle events which include high-energy galactic cosmic rays and high-energy protons. Because the radiation levels in space are high and the missions long, adequate shielding is needed to minimize the deleterious health effects of exposure to radiation. The focus of this study is radiation exposure to the <b>blood-forming</b> <b>organs</b> of the NASA astronauts. NASA/JSC developed the Phantom Torso Experiment for Organ Dose Measurements which housed active and passive dosimeters that would monitor and record absorbed radiation levels at vital organ locations. This experiment was conducted during the STS- 9 I mission in May ' 98 and provided the necessary space radiation data for correlation to results obtained from the current analytical models used to predict exposure to the <b>blood-forming</b> <b>organs.</b> Numerous models (i. e., BRYNTRN and HZETRN) have been developed and used to predict radiation exposure. However, new models are continually being developed and evaluated.

It is the intent of this research effort to compare the modeled data to the findings from the STS- 9 I mission; assess the accuracy and efficiency of this model; and to determine its usefulness for predicting radiation exposure and developing better guidelines for shielding requirements for long duration manned missions...|$|E
