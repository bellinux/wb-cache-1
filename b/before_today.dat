500|$|Tyrion tells Jon that he isn't [...] "better" [...] {{than any}} of his new [...] "brothers," [...] but only more fortunate, as he was trained by a master-at-arms, while the others are all orphan boys or criminals who have likely never held a sword <b>before</b> <b>today.</b> To make amends, Jon decides to give his fellow {{recruits}} proper sword training. Later, Tyrion is beseeched by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and the elderly, blind Maester Aemon to ask his sister and brother-in-law for more men for the Night's Watch, as the wildlings are massing in numbers greater than the Watch is able to deal with, and rumours that the White Walkers have returned are becoming more widespread. Tyrion is skeptical, but agrees to do so. Before leaving the Wall, Tyrion fulfills his ambition to urinate {{off the top of the}} Wall and says goodbye to Jon, who finally accepts Tyrion as a friend.|$|E

2500|$|Unkei ( [...] ; c. 1150– 1223) was a Japanese {{sculptor}} of the Kei school, which {{flourished in}} the Kamakura period. He specialized in statues of the Buddha and other important Buddhist figures. Unkei's early works are fairly traditional, similar in style to pieces by his father, Kōkei. However, the sculptures he produced for the Tōdai-ji in Nara show a flair for realism different from anything Japan had seen <b>before.</b> <b>Today,</b> Unkei is {{the best known of}} the Kei artists, and many art historians consider him its [...] "most distinguished member".|$|E
2500|$|Graph was {{partially}} salvaged and scrapped in 1947.

2500|$|Tenses that refer {{specifically}} to [...] "today" [...] are called hodiernal tenses; {{these can be}} either past or future. Apart from Kalaw Lagaw Ya, another language which features such tenses is Mwera, a Bantu language of Tanzania. It is also suggested that in 17th-century French, the passé composé served as a hodiernal past. Tenses which contrast with hodiernals, by referring to the past <b>before</b> <b>today</b> or the future after today, are called pre-hodiernal and post-hodiernal respectively. Some languages also have a crastinal tense, a future tense referring {{specifically to}} tomorrow (found in some Bantu languages); or a hesternal tense, a past tense referring specifically to yesterday (although this name is also sometimes used to mean pre-hodiernal). A tense for after tomorrow is thus called post-crastinal, and one for before yesterday is called pre-hesternal.|$|E
