Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports. A service is held annually to <b>bless</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E

5000|$|Under kashrut, {{the dietary}} rules of Jewish law or (Halacha), some {{orthodox}} rabbis find {{significance to the}} order in which one eats a Krembo. <b>The</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> biscuit is boreh miney mezonot, whereas <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> cream and chocolate is shehakol nihiyya bidvaro. According to halacha, when eating a dish of mixed components, one need pronounce only <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> main components, thus for a chocolate croissant one would say <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> dough, and skip <b>the</b> <b>blessing</b> over <b>the</b> chocolate. But {{in the case of the}} Krembo, there is no consensus as to which is the [...] "main" [...] component: the biscuit, or the cream and chocolate. One solution is to bless over each component separately.|$|R

2500|$|According to <b>the</b> Torah, Aaron <b>blessed</b> <b>the</b> {{people after}} {{offering}} sacrifices, and YHWH promises that [...] "I will place {{my name on}} their hands" [...] (the Kohanim's hands) [...] "and <b>bless</b> them" [...] (<b>the</b> Jews receiving <b>the</b> <b>blessing).</b> <b>The</b> Jewish Sages stressed that although the priests are the ones carrying out <b>the</b> <b>blessing,</b> it is not them or the ceremonial practice of raising their hands that results in <b>the</b> <b>blessing,</b> but rather it is God's desire that His blessing should be transferred {{by means of the}} Kohanim's hands.|$|R

25|$|Under {{the temple}} and priesthood {{restrictions}} before 1978, black members of African descent could {{not receive the}} priesthood or participate in temple ordinances besides baptisms for the dead. For {{a time in the}} 1960s and 1970s, they were not allowed to perform baptisms for the dead either. For young men and men in the LDS church, holding the priesthood is required to hold leadership roles, perform baptisms, to <b>bless</b> <b>the</b> sacrament, to bless babies and to <b>bless</b> <b>the</b> sick. Since black men could not hold the priesthood, they were excluded from holding leadership roles and performing these rituals. Temple ordinances are necessary for members to receive the endowment and marriage sealings necessary for exaltation, and black members could not enjoy these privileges. Church leaders taught that these restrictions were commanded by God. In 1978, the First Presidency and the Twelve, led by Spencer W. Kimball, declared they had received a revelation instructing them to reverse the racial restriction policy. After this revelation, black men could receive the priesthood and black people could receive temple ordinances.|$|E
