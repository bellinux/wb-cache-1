25|$|With Lord Fitzwilliam, in Grosvenor Square, for {{the purpose}} of {{discussing}} the subject of a coalition with him, and of endeavouring to prevail on him to speak to Fox—Lord Fitzwilliam's sentiments perfectly right—he said his opposition never had been to the constitution of the country, but to the Government when it acted in a way he thought contrary to the constitution; that, therefore, when that was in danger he ceased to be in opposition. On going over the matter it became evident that the great obstacle would arise from Fox's being too much entangled with Grey, Lambton, and that set of men who had lately separated themselves from the party, in order to form a party of their own, and who publicly professed doctrines and opinions in direct opposition to what he and I considered to be for the good and welfare of the public. That this would indeed be very hard and unreasonable, that for the sake of these very men, who both in their public and private capacity had been as inimical as possible, an arrangement should be broken off so salutary and so advisable. Lord Fitzwilliani and myself agreed on every point; he, however, went <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> in insisting on the indispensable necessity of Pitt resigning the Treasury for another Cabinet office. He acquiesced in the wisdom of trying to bring Fox to be less attached to these false friends, and said Tom Grenville was the best man to speak to him. Lord Fitzwilliam expressed his dislike to Sheridan, said he might have a lucrative place, but never could be admitted to one of trust and confidence. On my wishing him not to leave town, he said he could safely trust his conscience with the Duke of Portland, and was at the same time ready to return at the shortest notice.|$|E

The three men slid , dodging crevasses up to [...] wide, and ending their descent by overturning on an ice ridge. Evans later wrote: [...] "How we ever escaped entirely uninjured is <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> to explain".|$|E

500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} for the 'Best Actress' BAFTA award for Dot's single-hander EastEnders episode in 2009; {{she became the first}} soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. The show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described Brown's BAFTA nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA– of which I'm a member– to connect with a big audience." [...] Brown has also won 'Best Actress' for her role as Dot at the Inside Soap Awards in 2001 and 2004, as well as the 'Outstanding Achievement' award in 2003, and 'Best Couple' in 2005 with John Bardon, as Dot and Jim Branning. She and Bardon also won 'Best On-Screen Partnership' at the British Soap Awards in both 2002 and 2005, while in 2005, Brown won a 'Lifetime Achievement' award for her role, again at the British Soap Awards. The role also resulted in several award nominations including a 'Most Popular Actress' nomination at the National Television Awards in 2005, and a 'Best Actress' nomination at the 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards among others. Dot was also voted the 46th best television character in a television poll entitled The 100 Greatest Television Characters.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{nominated}} in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards {{based on her}} performance in the episode, becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988, when Jean Alexander was shortlisted {{for her role as}} Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street. She commented that she was proud to be nominated, but was not overly excited as: [...] "I don't believe anything is going to happen until it does, until you see your name on a paper or it actually happens and you have something in your hand." [...] Brown lost out to Anna Maxwell Martin, but the show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, described the nomination as his proudest moment of 2009, saying: [...] "I'm not one to complain to the referee, but it's <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> why she didn't win. Week in, week out, she turns out amazing performances. The audience knew it and we knew it. With the greatest respect to the actress who won, you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment. It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA [...] to connect with a big audience." [...] McLean agreed that Brown deserved to win, but commented on the awards: [...] "never underestimate snobbery towards soap." [...] Brown spoke of the nomination in 2013, saying: [...] "You never [...] if you're in a soap. [...] I would've liked it, yes. I would've felt it had crowned my acting in a way, made it sound worthwhile, I think. So I didn't care that I didn't get nominated for any other awards that time!" ...|$|E

2500|$|God speaks from a whirlwind. His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor {{enter into}} the {{courtroom}} confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence. Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: [...] "Where were you when I laid {{the foundations of the}} earth?" [...] Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly. In 42:1–6 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge [...] "of things <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> which I did not know". Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and [...] "therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes." ...|$|E

Curley was sentenced to a 7 to 23 month jail term, with 4 months of it as house arrest, followed by 2 years of probation and a $5,000 fine.

2500|$|Immediately after {{reports of}} the slaying spread, {{blockades}} were set up several miles northeast and southwest on Highway 67 East. Sheriff Davis called in officers from the entire area {{to help in the}} investigation; some of which included two agents from the FBI, Captain Gonzaullas and other Rangers, Sheriff Presley and his deputies, Sheriff Jim Sanderson from Little River County, Arkansas State Police, local police, and many others. In the house, investigators found a trail of blood with scattered teeth. On the dining room table was Mrs. Starks' work for making a dress. Gonzaullas, after seeing the [...] "virtual river of blood", stated that [...] "It is <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> why she did not bleed to death." [...] There were only two bullet holes in the window, leading Sheriff Davis to believe an automatic rifle was used. Investigators declared that after the killer shot Virgil, he waited patiently outside the window to shoot the wife.|$|E
2500|$|Unionists criticised the decision. Martin Smyth said, [...] "We {{are told}} that the two {{communities}} have to live together. We had a classic illustration of a name that brought the two communities together – Londonderry. 'London' indicates the British tradition and 'Derry' the Irish tradition. But the Government decided {{to do away with}} 'London' {{in the name of the}} Council." [...] William Ross said, [...] "Derry has never been used as the name of the city or of the island of Londonderry except as a shortened version of a longer name. The name was Derry Columbkille for centuries. It was Londonderry for centuries. Before that it was Derry Calgach [...] Those who sought the change sought it for no good reason. Their aim was to open a door. [...] It is <b>beyond</b> <b>me</b> how the name Derry city council will be separated from the concept of Londonderry city in the public mind. Everyone in Northern Ireland knows that the Republican elements in Londonderry city will ignore the name as they have always done. They now have a lever to put up Derry city right across the board. [...] People in Northern Ireland see it as an anti-British move by the most extreme Republican movements in Londonderry and the rest of Northern Ireland." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{major issue}} {{contemporary}} critics had with Leskov's prose {{was what they}} perceived to be an [...] "overabundance of colours"; the grotesque expressiveness of the language he used. This view was shared by some of his colleagues. Leo Tolstoy who rated Leskov very high still thought he was [...] "too over the top" [...] in his linguistic experiments. In a December 3, 1890, letter, writing {{of the short story}} [...] "The Hour of God's Will", he remarked: [...] "This fairytale is excellent, {{but it would have been}} much better if not for this overabundance of talent." [...] Leskov was unrepentant. [...] "To write in a simple manner as Lev Nikolayevich does, is <b>beyond</b> <b>me.</b> Such a gift is not mine... take me as I am, for I've gotten used to polishing my stuff and simply cannot work in any other way," [...] he wrote to Chertkov in one of his 1888 letters. [...] "My clergymen talk like clergymen do, and my muzhiks talk like muzhiks talk in real life... this folkish, vulgar and intricate language is not of my invention, I've listened for years to Russian people talking... and I can say that in my books they talk like they do in real life, not in literary fashion," [...] he insisted later, speaking to biographer Anatoly Faresov.|$|E
