However, the wide-scale deployment of WDM-PONs has been delayed mainly due to {{the high cost of}} wavelength-specific optical components. To realize cost-effective WDM-PONs, various wavelength-independent, so called colorless architectures, have been developed so that all the subscribers can have identical optical network units (ONUs). In such WDM-PONs, however, single-fiber bidirectional transmission results in degradation of system performance caused by interference between the signals and <b>backreflections.</b> This thesis investigates the impact of <b>backreflections</b> on single-fiber bidirectional WDM-PONs.

40|$|<b>Backreflections</b> {{from the}} {{external}} world are among the worst enemies of lasers. Most people with some knowledge in optics {{are well aware of}} that. Optical feedback can induce fluctuations in the output power, lasing frequency drifts, bifurcation phenomena, mode hopping and ultimately chaos. In other words, under strong feedback conditions a laser can behave very differently from what a laser is expected to do. Yet, in some circumstances, your worst enemy can even become your best friend [...] . Each time a system suffers from strong sensitivity to some external agents, we can think of exploiting this vulnerability for sensing. <b>Backreflections</b> from objects to be monitored are indeed at the basis of what is commonly known as optical feedback interferometry (OFI), {{which is one of the}} most widely employed techniques in sensing applications, for instance in measurements of displacement, velocity, and vibration. In OFI, two possible approaches can be used to access information on the target. We can do it optically, by measuring the variations induced by the optical feedback on the intensity of the light emitted by the rear facet of the laser diode; or electrically, by measuring the voltage variations induced across the laser terminals. In both cases, to achieve high sensitivity, it is fundamental to work with the maximum signal-to-noise ratio. It is not surprising that both optical and electrical OFI signals depend on the laser structure and on the operation parameters, such as the laser bias current. What is far less obvious is that the dependence of the OFI signal strength versus injection current can be dramatically different for the optical and electrical signals. Some observations of this tricky behaviour were reported in the literature, but a clear understanding of this phenomenon was still missing [...] . until the work by Al Roumy and co-workers. These researchers have succeeded at developing a simple model that provides a clear explanation of the dependence of the OFI signal on laser diode injection current and temperature. Compared to previous studies, the key used in their model is to include a realistic dependence of the laser slope efficiency on the injection current and temperature. Nothing more than that, yet extraordinarily effective. In fact, their model nicely shows why the optical signal strength increases with injection current, while the electrical signal is at a maximum just above the laser threshold, and subsequently decreases at higher injection current. Moreover, the same model provides also a clear explanation of the more pronounced decrease in the optical signal with temperature, compared to the electrical signal. As a main result, golden rules to select the optimum injection current to maximise OFI sensitivity are provided for both optical and electrical read-out configurations. The biasing strategy is indeed radically different for the two schemes, the first exhibiting better sensitivity at higher bias current, the second having the optimal injection current close to threshold. This study was limited to single-mode laser structures, but the authors are confident on its extension to multiple transverse or longitudinal mode operation. Finally, note that there is also lesson to be learned from the approach itself followed in this work. The model was derived from the Lang and Kobayashi equations, which were proposed more than thirty years ago to study the effects of weak optical feedback on semiconductor laser properties. The results achieved by Al Roumy and coworkers were somewhat hidden inside these equations, but nobody had been able to unveil them before. This demonstrates that new stories may come from well-known models, so we must never believe that old models have already told us everything they can...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) {{has emerged}} as a practical noninvasive technology for imaging the microstructure of the human eye in vivo. Using optical interferometry to spatially-resolve <b>backreflections</b> from within tissue, this high-resolution technique provides cross-sectional images of the anterior and posterior eye segments that had previously only been possible with histology. Current commercially-available OCT systems suffer limitations in speed and sensitivity, preventing them from effective screening of the retina and having a larger impact on the clinical environment. While other technological advances have addressed this problem, they are inadequate for imaging the choroid, which can be useful for evaluating choroidal disorders as well as early stages of retinal diseases. The objective of this thesis was to develop a new ophthalmic imaging method, termed optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI), to overcome these limitations. Preliminary imaging of the posterior segment of human eyes in vivo was performed to evaluate the utility of this instrument for comprehensive ophthalmic examination. (cont.) The 1050 -nm OFDI system developed for this thesis comprised a novel wavelength-swept laser that delivered 2. 7 mW of average power at a sweep rate of 18. 8 kHz, representing a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in speed over previously-demonstrated lasers in the 1050 -nm range and below. The system, with an optical exposure level of 550 gW, achieved resolution of 10 gm in tissue and sensitivity of > 92 dB over a depth range of 2. 4 mm. Two healthy volunteers were imaged with the OFDI system, with 200, 000 A-lines over 10. 6 seconds in each imaging session. In comparison to results from a state-of-the-art spectral-domain OCT system, the OFDI system provided deeper penetration into the choroid. This thesis demonstrates OFDI's capability for comprehensive imaging of the human retina, optic disc, and choroid in vivo. The deep penetration power of the system enabled the first simultaneous visualization of retinal and choroidal vasculature without the exogenous dyes required by angiography. The combined capability for imaging microstructure and vasculature using a single instrument may be a significant factor influencing clinical acceptance of ophthalmic OFDI technology. by Edward Chin Wang Lee.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model for two-, three-, and four-level system rare-earth-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers is presented. Fiber amplifier gain {{is expressed in}} terms of easily measured attenuation coefficients, intrinsic saturation powers, and cross saturation powers at the pump and signal wavelengths. System-independent formulas are given for the slopes and thresholds of ring and linear fiber lasers. Good agreement between theory and experiment is shown for erbium-doped fiber amplifiers and lasers and thulium-doped fiber lasers. Approximate system-independent solutions are also given for fiber amplifiers with excited state absorption at either the pump or signal wavelengths. A novel technique, requiring only one tunable light source, is proposed for finding the best pump wavelength when pump ESA is present. Analysis of erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) gain and noise yields a new expression for the amplifier signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) {{as a function of the}} fiber length. This leads to a new expression for the fiber length that optimizes the output SNR. Optical gain switching of EDFAs with short pulses at wavelengths within the amplifier bandwidth is modelled to determine how the pump and signal powers, pulse energy, fiber length, and dopant concentration affect the switching time and gain compression. Greater than 20 dB gain compression with nanosecond switching times is demonstrated with good agreement between theory and experiment. Remote EDFA switching from as far as 50 km away is demonstrated. The distance is limited by spontaneous Raman scattering of the switching pulses. These limitations are experimentally and theoretically investigated.

A complete model for the analysis of Bragg grating assisted devices in waveguide structures has been developed. Bragg grating based optical Add/Drop multiplexers (OADM) have been simulated and studied by using this modelling tool. A fully optimised design for an OADM based on null coupler and tilted Bragg grating has been proposed. This device can exhibit optimised Add and Drop actions with suppressed <b>backreflections</b> and crosstalk to a level lower than - 40 dB. A novel interferometric OADM configuration based on a full cycle full (100 %) coupler is also proposed. This design exhibits fully optimised and symmetrical Add/Drop actions in contrast to the compromised performance of traditional interferometric configurations. A software simulation tool has also been developed and employed for the theoretical characterization of optical filters, linking this way the proposed devices to real communication system issues related to high bit rate WDM networks. The effect of group delay ripple in WDM filters is studied for different modulation formats and a simplified figure of merit is proposed for the characterization of the effect.

In this thesis I propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel wavelength remodulation scheme for WDM PONs that employs Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) for downstream and Return to Zero DPSK (RZ-DPSK) for upstream. The use of DPSK enhanced the system with improved receiver sensitivity and RZ-DPSK improved the tolerance toward chromatic dispersion. In addition, I investigate the <b>Backreflection</b> (BR) penalty resulting from beat noise of BRs with upstream signal in a bidirectional WDM PON system that uses remodulation and phase modulation as a modulation format. I experimentally demonstrate the optimal conditions to operate the system and minimize the BR penalty...|$|E
