5|$|Along with Democrats John Stuart Williams, William Lindsay, and J. Proctor Knott, and Republican Robert Boyd, McCreary was {{nominated}} for a U.S. Senate seat in 1878. Democrats were divided by sectionalism and initially unable to unite <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their four candidates. After more than a week of caucusing among Democratic legislators, the nominations of McCreary, Knott, and Lindsay were withdrawn, and Williams was elected over Boyd. Historian Hambleton Tapp opined that the withdrawals were likely a part of some kind of deal among legislators, although the details of the deal, if it ever existed, were not made public.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Point {{revealed}} in 1990 {{that a new}} roller coaster would be built for the 1991 season. It was officially named Mean Streak on October 24, 1990. Construction commenced later that year and continued through spring of the following year. Mean Streak opened with the park's seasonal debut on May 11, 1991, in the Frontiertown section of the park <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad's stations. The ride's media day press conference was held on May 22, 1991.|$|E
5|$|Fulfordgate did not {{initially}} have any covered stands, and the dressing rooms consisted {{of an old}} army hut, before open stands were bought from York Race Committee. The ground was gradually built up and improved, and covered accommodation was available after two years. In 1927, new turnstiles were installed and stronger fencing was built around the pitch, which {{made it more difficult}} for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch. Nine-tier terracing replaced the old banking <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1,000 supporters and there a small seated stand was erected.|$|E

5|$|York's {{first ground}} was Fulfordgate, which was located on Heslington Lane, Fulford in the {{south-east}} of York. With the ground not ready, York played {{their first two}} home matches at Mille Crux, Haxby Road, before they took to the field at Fulfordgate for a 4–1 win over Mansfield Town on 20 September 1922. Fulfordgate was gradually improved; terracing was replaced banking <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to house 1,000 supporters, and a small seated stand was erected. By the time of York's election to the Football League in 1929, the ground was estimated to hold a capacity of 17,000. However, attendances declined in York's second and third Football League seasons, and the directors blamed this on the ground's location. In April 1932, York's shareholders voted to move to Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club, on a 21-year lease. This site was located near the city centre, and had a significantly higher population living nearby than Fulfordgate.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Mesozoic to present, {{the region}} went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences. Commencing 66million years ago the Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain-building and erosion in western North America that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains. This cycle of uplift and erosion left <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most {{complete}} non-marine Cenozoic rock sequences found in North America. Conglomerate rocks composed of quartzite and interspersed with mudstone and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range. These deposits also have trace quantities of gold and mercury. During the Eocene and Oligocene, volcanic eruptions from the ancestral Absaroka Range buried the region under various volcanic deposits. Sedimentary basins developed in the region due to drop faulting, creating an ancestral Jackson Hole and by the Pliocene (10million years ago), an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake. During the Quaternary, landslides, erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson Hole and left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes. The most recent example of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park, when the Gros Ventre landslide was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1837 and the {{depression}} that followed caused many to blame Van Buren and his Democratic Party {{for the hard}} times, making {{it more likely that}} the Whig nominee in 1840 would be the next president. In addition to Harrison and Webster, Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky sought the nomination, as did General Winfield Scott. Some Whigs argued that because {{the depression}} was driving many to their ranks, {{there was no need to}} nominate a relative outsider such as Harrison; the party could win <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its statesmen, Clay or Webster, and by 1838, Clay was the frontrunner. A slaveholder, he commanded the near-united support of the South, though this came at the price of alienating many Northern Whigs. There was wide consensus in the party that a national convention was needed to decide on a presidential candidate, and in late 1837, the Whig congressional caucus agreed to work with the state parties to organize a convention. After considerable maneuvering, a convention to nominate candidates for president and vice president was called by the congressional caucus in May 1838, to be held at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania beginning on December 4, 1839. Having failed to gain much support, Webster dropped out of the race in June 1839.|$|E

25|$|This {{technique}} provides insights {{in other}} situations {{such as the}} Monty Hall problem, a game show scenario in which a car is hidden <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three doors, and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others. Once the contestant has chosen a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat, eliminating that door as an option. With only two doors left (one with the car, the other with another goat), the player must decide to either keep their decision, or switch and select the other door. Intuitively, one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability, and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference. But probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information, and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.|$|E
25|$|A local tale {{says that}} about 1938–41, when both {{boulders}} were in place, a farmer named James Reynolds often drove {{his horse and}} cart along this pathway. Several times, a hooded grey ghost would hide behind two boulders and would leap out from <b>behind</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the stones at sunset, and try to grab the horse's reins before vanishing. This, although terrifying the animals, {{seems not to have}} perturbed the man unduly. However, he ordered that the stone in question be laid upon his grave after his death, in an attempt at 'laying' the apparition. James Reynolds died in 1941 and, in accordance with his wishes, the boulder now lies atop his grave, his wife Ann Elizabeth also being interred there in 1967. There is no record {{as to whether or not}} the 'exorcism' was successful, and indeed, a local woman who knew the Reynolds could not confirm the story. The other stone of the pair can now be seen lying against the north wall of the churchyard.|$|E
