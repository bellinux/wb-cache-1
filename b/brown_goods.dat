50|$|The fair {{revolves}} around hybrid components {{that are made}} {{of a combination of}} materials and depicts their entire value chain in industrial manufacturing - from raw materials, development and prototyping to tool and die manufacturing, production plants, machines, automation technology, concrete applications and finished products.The composite materials that are used the most are metals, plastics and, to an increasing extent, ceramics. The resulting components are primarily used in the electronics, electrical engineering and automotive sectors. Other application sectors include information and communications technology, medicine, power engineering, building-services and sanitary engineering, the consumer-goods industry and white and <b>brown</b> <b>goods.</b> Hybrid solutions made of multiple materials are also increasingly being used in the lightweight-design sector.When it was first held in 2008, hybridica had 130 exhibitors from ten countries and more than 7,800 visitors from 21 countries.

5000|$|Consumer {{electronics}} or home electronics are electronic or {{digital equipment}} intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment (flatscreen TVs, DVD players, DVD movies, iPods, video games, remote control cars, etc.), communications (telephones, cell phones, e-mail-capable laptops, etc.), and home-office activities (e.g., desktop computers, printers, paper shredders, etc.). In British English, {{they are often}} called <b>brown</b> <b>goods</b> by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from [...] "white goods" [...] such as washing machines and refrigerators. In the 2010s, this distinction is not always present in large big box consumer electronics stores, such as Best Buy, which sell both entertainment, communications, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. Consumer electronics stores differ from professional audio stores in that the former sells consumer-grade electronics for private use, whereas the latter sells professional-grade electronics designed for use by audio engineers and audio technicians.|$|E
30|$|Of {{course the}} {{depicted}} controls {{in the white}} and <b>brown</b> <b>goods</b> as well as miscellaneous area assume an extensive integration into a home automation network. Some of the explained functionalities are not yet readily available as off-the-shelf products, {{but it can be}} expected to reach the desired level of integration in the near future. Some first approach {{can be seen in the}} technology described in [10] which allows to intervene in the operation mode of connected electric consumer goods. This way the stand-by energy demand of devices can be extensively reduced and also a feedback to the user about the energy demand of different devices can be realized. Integration of white goods into a home network such as it is provided by a KNX system is described in [11]. Overall, considerable progress in this area can be expected. Therefore, the use cases of white and <b>brown</b> <b>goods</b> portrayed in this chapter might to some degree be viewed as future oriented; however, they will not be fictional for long when observing the prospering market of smart home equipment.|$|E
