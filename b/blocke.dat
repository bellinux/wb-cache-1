A great number of new articles related to the iron metabolism {{have been published in}} recent years explaining new findings.

40|$|Objective: Tongue cancer (TC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common oral cancers. Prognostic {{evaluation}} of this tumor includes histologic grade and TNM stage. In this study, we evaluated the expression of p 53, Ki- 67, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX 2) and correlated it with the clinicopathologic variables to assess their potential for use as prognostic markers. We compared the p 53 positive and negative group. Design: A retrospective and prospective study with 45 cases of biopsy proven TC which were studied for the expression of p 53, Ki- 67, EGFR, and SOX 2. The results were correlated with known clinicopathologic variables using Chi-square test. The p 53 positive and negative groups were compared. Materials and Methods: Archieved blocks of biopsy proven TC were retrieved. Using 4 micron sections of the <b>blockes</b> immunostaining for p 53, Ki 67, EGFR and SOX 2 was done. Results: P 53 expression was 68. 9 %, Ki- 67 was 88. 9 %, EGFR was 48. 9 %, and SOX 2 was 35. 6 %. Expression of p 53 and Ki- 67 did not show any correlation with any of the clinicopathologic variables. There was a statistically significant association between EGFR expression and lymph node (LN) positivity (P = 0. 001). Stage of tumor and SOX 2 positivity showed a significant correlation (P = 0. 03). The comparison of p 53 positive and negative groups did not reveal a significant difference. Conclusion: p 53 -negative TC is not significantly different from the p 53 -positive TC at presentation. The absence of mutant p 53 in more than 30 % TC points toward the possible etiological role of human papillomavirus in TC. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the possible use of EGFR for prediction of LN metastasis and SOX 2 as a prognostic marker...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{different}} farming systems and garlic (Allium sativum L.) clones on yield quality and quantity of garlic, an experiment was conducted with split plot arrangement with three completely randomized <b>blockes</b> in the 2005 growing season at the experimental research station of Shahid Beheshti University at Zirab, north of Iran. Two factors were involved in the experiment: farming systems in three levels (intensive, conventional and organic farming), as main plots and garlic clones in three levels (Atoo, Hamedani and Khorassani) as sub-plots. The studied factors in this experiment consisted of leaf number, LAI, stem height and diameter, bulb yield, weight of bulbs, number of cloves, weight of cloves and level of allicin. Results showed that the farming systems had significant effect (p≤ 0. 05) on LAI, number of plant and bulb yield, but the effect on the other factors was not significant. The highest and lowest bulb yields were obtained in intensive (9. 5 ton ha - 1) and organic (7. 4 ton ha - 1) systems, respectively. All of the top factors were significantly (p≤ 0. 01) affected by garlic clones. Maximum and minimum yields were obtained from Hamedani, Atoo (9. 2 ton ha - 1) and Virani (7. 1 ton ha - 1) clones, respectively. Level of allicin was not significantly affected by farming systems but, differences among garlic clones were significant. Maximum and minimum allicin yields were obtained from Hamedan (5. 96 mg g - 1) and Virani (4. 52 mg g - 1) clones, respectively. As a result, however, organic farming systems can not influence the yield in short term, but can increase it by applying crop rotation, use of organic fertilizer and cover crops in the long term...|$|R
40|$|In {{externally}} fertilizing fishes, multiple {{factors of}} the spawning environment {{may affect the}} sperm viability, and thus the fertilization rate. In this thesis, the sperm activation effect of osmolality of non-electrolytes and electrolytes activation media, pH and ion channel inhibitors on Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, {{and the effect of}} environmentally relevant pollutants (cadmium, malathion and rotenone) on sperm fitness (motility and morphology) were investigated. Seminal fluid samples collected from male fishes (200 - 250 g) were subjected to activation treatments, then analyzed for sperm motility using motility score, and motility variables using Hobson sperm tracker for straight line velocity (VSL), beat cross frequency (BCF) and percentage of motile cells (MOT). For the ion channel inhibitors and pollutants, the effect on sperm motility variables of VSL, VCL (curvilinear velocity) and LIN (linearity) were determined. Multivariate analysis was also carried out {{to determine the effects of}} ion channel inhibitors and pollutants on sperm subpopulations. The effects of pollutants on sperm morphology were observed using microscopy techniques, namely, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Sperm motility was initiated when the sperm were exposed to hypoosmotic electrolytes and non-electrolytes solution. We also found that sperm show optimal activity at pH range of 6 - 8 which depicts that the effect of pH on sperm motility is negligible. Lanthanum (calcium channel blocker) and flunarizine (sodium-calcium exchanger pump blocker) were found to inhibit sperm motility at 25 and 5 µM, respectively, suggesting that both ion channels play a significant role in sperm activation in O. niloticus. In contrast amiloride, ouabain and quinine showed no effects on activation, indicating that epithelial sodium channels, sodium-potassium ATPase and voltage gated potassium channels respectively are unlikely to have major roles in sperm activation or motility. The spermatozoa of Oreochromis niloticus were uniflagellate with clearly differentiated oval-shaped head, midpiece and flagellum. Sperm exposed to hypoosmotic shock showed swelling of the midpiece and sleeve structure. The pollutants showed dose- and time-dependent effect on sperm motility of the fast linear sperm subpopulation. Sperm morphology was not affected. Sperm motility was inhibited at 0. 44, 0. 03 and 0. 063 µM, cadmium, malathion and rotenone respectively. Both cadmium and malathion exerted effects very quickly after exposure. The effect of cadmium, which can exert toxicity by calcium antagonism, is consistent with the effects of calcium channel <b>blockes</b> and further supports an important role for calcium in sperm activation and motility. Malathion had effects at relatively low, environmentally relevant concentrations, suggesting the presence of functionally important acetylcholinesterase activity in sperm, and also the presence of activation cytochrome P 450 activity. Rotenone, a well known mitochondrial poison, affected motility only after 15 min of pretreatment. The alteration of sperm trajectories in fast linear spermatozoa subpopulation by pollutants at submicromolar concentrations as demonstrated in our study implies potentially serious consequences for fish populations in polluted environments. Furthermore the results indicate that fish sperm motility as assessed by CASA could be an ecologically relevant, sensitive, and ethically acceptable method for toxicity testing in environmental risk assessment.
