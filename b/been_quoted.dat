5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among scholars is {{the role played by}} Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has <b>been</b> <b>quoted</b> by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims without taking a stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must {{have played a role in}} the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E
5|$|Bernoulli's work {{influenced}} {{many contemporary}} and subsequent mathematicians. Even the afterthought-like tract on calculus has <b>been</b> <b>quoted</b> frequently; most notably by the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin. Jacob's program of applying his art of conjecture to the matters of practical life, which was terminated by {{his death in}} 1705, was continued by his nephew Nicolaus Bernoulli, after having taken parts verbatim out of Ars Conjectandi, for his own dissertation entitled De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure which was published already in 1709. Nicolas finally edited and assisted in the publication of Ars conjectandi in 1713. Later Nicolaus also edited Jacob Bernoulli's complete works and supplemented it with results taken from Jacob's diary.|$|E

5|$|Curium is {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the 242Cm and 244Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains {{the high price of}} curium, which has <b>been</b> <b>quoted</b> at 160–185 USD per milligram, with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for 242Cm and 170 USD/g for 244Cm. In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from 238U in a series of nuclear reactions. In the first chain, 238U captures a neutron and converts into 239U, which via β− decay transforms into 239Np and 239Pu.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having <b>been</b> <b>quoted</b> by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note {{of the work}} in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino.

In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Galaxy Game and Computer Space, numerous other games have been directly inspired by Spacewar. These include Orbitwar (1974, PLATO network computers), Space Wars (1977, arcade), and Space War (1978, Atari 2600). Additionally, in Asteroids (1979), designer Ed Logg used elements from Spacewar, namely the hyperspace button {{and the shape}} of the player's ship. Products as late as the 1990 computer game Star Control drew direct inspiration from Spacewar. Russell has <b>been</b> <b>quoted</b> as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games without feeling restricted to using Russell's own code or design.|$|E

5|$|The two-player {{game has}} the players {{engaged in a}} dogfight between two spaceships set against the {{backdrop}} of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has <b>been</b> <b>quoted</b> as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.|$|E

40|$|Stock {{options are}} usually sold in bundles of 100 units, and their price can <b>be</b> <b>quoted</b> either per unit or per bundle. In this article, {{the effect of}} {{different}} methods of quoting financial asset prices on the subjective value of a contract was examined experimentally.

We found that participants bid (ask) a higher price when prices <b>are</b> <b>quoted</b> per unit than when they <b>are</b> <b>quoted</b> per bundle. The results indicated that different quoting methods affect the bidding price for risky assets. These results can {{have important implications for}} trading on financial markets. ...|$|R
