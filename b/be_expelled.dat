5|$|Chabaneau {{was born}} in 1754 in Nontron, a village in the Dordogne {{department}} of France. His uncle, {{a member of the}} order of Saint Anthony, encouraged him to study theology. While Chabaneau excelled in his studies, his distaste for metaphysical speculation led him to antagonize his teachers, which in turn caused him to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from school.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2014, Joe Anglin (Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre) {{quit the}} caucus to sit as an Independent MLA stating {{that he had}} found out he was out to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> due to his public criticisms of Smith's advisers. Anglin had {{previously}} lost his bid to be renominated in his riding as Wildrose's candidate for the next provincial election.|$|E
5|$|Burnett's {{actions were}} deemed treasonable by {{his colleagues in}} Congress, and he was {{expelled}} from the House in 1861. He {{is one of only}} five members of the House of Representatives ever to <b>be</b> <b>expelled.</b> Following his expulsion, Burnett served in the Provisional Confederate Congress and the First and Second Confederate Senates. He was indicted for treason after the war, but never tried. He returned to the practice of law, and died of cholera in 1866 at the age of 40.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the {{congregation}} began some joint programming with Anshe Sefard, New Orleans' only other remaining Orthodox synagogue, {{and in the}} summer hired Uri Topolosky as its new rabbi. A graduate of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, Topolosky had previously served as the associate rabbi of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, and {{had been one of}} 21 rabbis arrested at the United Nations during an April 2007 sit-in demanding that Iran <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from the U.N.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund {{appointed}} a Calvinist bishop {{as the only}} religious leader of the Romanians in his realm in November 1566. The Diet also ordered that all Romanian priests who refused to convert to Calvinism were to <b>be</b> <b>expelled,</b> but this decision was not carried out. Influenced by Dávid and Biandrata, John Sigismund became receptive to Anti-Trinitarian ideas from early 1567. With John Sigismund's support, Dávid published five books to promote his views, reproving for idolatry those who accepted the dogma of the Trinity.|$|E
5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters the tank, the vapors inside the tank must be somehow expelled. Depending on local regulations, the vapors can <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> {{into the atmosphere}} or discharged back to the pumping station {{by way of a}} vapor recovery line. It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain proper trim.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{the rest}} of the British {{communist}} movement the NCP from the beginning had to deal with what they saw as ultra-leftism and right-wing deviation. All were defeated at congresses over the years and many <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> for factionalism. In the early 1980s an extreme pro-Soviet faction called [...] "Proletarian" [...] <b>was</b> <b>expelled.</b> In the early 1990s another small group <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> which later formed the Communist Action Group.|$|R

5|$|The {{sovereign}} however may remove {{an individual}} from the Privy Council. On 8 June 2011, the former MP Elliot Morley was expelled following his conviction {{on charges of}} false accounting {{in connection with the}} British parliamentary expenses scandal. Before this, the last individual to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from the Council against his will was Sir Edgar Speyer, Bt., who was removed on 13 December 1921 for collaborating with the enemy German Empire, during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Three {{months after}} the conquest of Granada, in 1492, the Alhambra Decree ordered all Jews in Spain to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> or converted; this marked the {{beginning}} of intolerant policies. In 1497, Spain's western neighbor Portugal expelled its Jewish and Muslim populations, as arranged by Spain's cardinal Cisneros in exchange for a royal marriage contract. Unlike the Jews, Portuguese Muslims were allowed to relocate overland to Spain, and most did.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) {{after the start of}} a meal is always present. In some individuals, the regurgitation is small, occurring {{over a long period of}} time following ingestion, and can be rechewed and swallowed. In others, the amount can be bilious and short lasting, and must <b>be</b> <b>expelled.</b>|$|E

50|$|In October 1940, 115,000 Poles <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from their}} homes in central Warsaw {{to make room for}} the Jewish Ghetto, {{constructed}} there by German authorities. (Jews <b>were</b> then <b>expelled</b> {{from their homes}} elsewhere and forced to move into the Ghetto.)

5|$|In Besançon, {{the people}} called for Catholic Philip II of Spain {{to help fight}} all heresies in 1571. In {{response}} to this, the new archbishop, Claude de La Baume, demanded that anybody suspected of heresy <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from Besançon. Local authorities kept count of the Protestants in the city, expelling fifty of them later. The outcast Protestants took refuge in Switzerland and Montbéliard. In the midst of increasing violence in the region after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572, the Protestant personae non gratae gathered in Montbéliard and Neuchâtel before marching to Besançon in 1575.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the same}} year, he {{decided to return to}} Bucharest, but his stay was cut short when the Austrian authorities, who, under the {{leadership}} of Johann Coronini-Cronberg, had taken over administration of the country as a neutral force, asked for him to <b>be</b> <b>expelled.</b> Returning to Paris, Heliade continued to publish works on political and cultural issues, including an analysis of the European situation after the Peace Treaty of 1856 and an 1858 essay on the Bible. In 1859, he published his own translation of the Septuagint, under the name Biblia sacră ce cuprinde Noul şi Vechiul Testament ("The Holy Bible, Comprising the New and Old Testament").|$|E
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When {{the water in the}} digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.|$|E
50|$|His {{most notable}} {{appointment}} was as ambassador to Moscow from 1977 to 1980, until he <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> as a tit-for-tat when the Soviet ambassador Vsevolod Sofinsky <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> for passing {{funds to the}} pro-Soviet Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|The MAS {{tendency}} <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from the}} party at the Seventh National Plenum of the party. Some MAS members, who had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from PDCH, founded the Socialist Party (PASO) in November 1978. The MAS split significantly weakened the PDCH.|$|R
50|$|Placental {{expulsion}} (also called afterbirth) {{occurs when}} the placenta {{comes out of the}} birth canal after childbirth. The period from just after the baby <b>is</b> <b>expelled</b> until just after the placenta <b>is</b> <b>expelled</b> <b>is</b> called the third stage of labor.|$|R
5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Alan Eagleson, a {{longtime}} {{executive director of}} the National Hockey League Players Association, was inducted as a builder. He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to mail fraud and embezzling {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} from the National Hockey League Players' Association pension funds. His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine if he should <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from the Hall. Originally, the Hall of Fame was not going to become involved in the issue, but was forced to act when dozens of inductees, including Bobby Orr, Ted Lindsay and Brad Park, campaigned for Eagleson's expulsion, even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed. He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign.|$|E
5|$|In April 1839, the {{accusation}} of poisoning the young prince in 1837, {{along with two}} other fabricated cases, was revived against Bhimsen and his party, and forged papers and evidence were produced professing to incriminate him. Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, blindly believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor {{and put him in}} house arrest in a room at the ground floor of his own Bagh Durbar. Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidence, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured. Except for Mathabar Singh, who managed to escape to India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from every public offices for seven generations.|$|E
50|$|Several Jews <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> from Iceland and in {{the late}} 1930s Icelandic {{authorities}} offered {{to pay for the}} further expulsion of Jews to Germany if the Danish authorities would not take care of them after they had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from Iceland.|$|R
50|$|Robert Wilson <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from the}} Progressive Conservative caucus on November 20, 1980, {{and from the}} Progressive Conservative party on November 28, 1980.

50|$|According to S. Banasiak, 3,109,900 Germans <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> to the Soviet and British {{occupation}} {{zones in}} Germany and thereby registered by Polish officials between 1945 and 1950. Registration by Polish officials was not exhaustive, especially in 1945. An unknown number left without formal registration or <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> by Soviet military authorities without notifying by Polish officials responsible for statistics. Also, especially in 1945, many Germans {{returned to their}} former homes and some <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> more than once.|$|R
5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills, and doubles back to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in {{a steady stream of}} mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of the gills varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.|$|E
5|$|On December 16, 1945, Arévalo was {{incapacitated}} for a {{while after}} a car accident. The leaders of the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), which was the party that supported the government, were afraid that Arana would {{take the opportunity to}} launch a coup and so struck a deal with him, which later {{came to be known as}} the Pacto del Barranco (Pact of the Ravine). Under the terms of this pact, Arana agreed to refrain from seizing power with the military; in return, the PAR agreed to support Arana's candidacy in the next presidential election, scheduled for November 1950. Arévalo himself recovered swiftly, but was forced to support the agreement. However, by 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana due to his lack of support for labor rights. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana. In 1947 Arana had demanded that certain labor leaders <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from the country; Árbenz vocally disagreed with Arana, and the former's intervention limited the number of deportees.|$|E
5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a {{hillside}} to watch the final death throes of the creature at a safe distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1955 the Turkish {{government}} sponsored anti-Greek {{riots and}} pogrom in Istanbul. The dispute over Cyprus kept anti-Greek feelings in Turkey high. At {{the height of}} the intercommunal violence in Cyprus, thousands of Greeks <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> from Turkey, mostly Istanbul. In March of that year all persons (over 6,000) with Greek citizenship <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> [...] "on the grounds that they were dangerous to the 'internal and external' security of the state."
