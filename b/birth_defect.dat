40|$|Stillbirths, {{those with}} and without <b>birth</b> <b>defects,</b> are an {{important}} public health topic. The National Center on <b>Birth</b> <b>Defects</b> and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted two workshops during April and July 2005. Both workshops explored the challenges of conducting surveillance of stillbirths. Workshop participants considered an approach that added the surveillance of stillbirths, those {{with and without}} <b>birth</b> <b>defects,</b> as part of existing population-based <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> surveillance programs in Iowa and Atlanta. The workshops addressed three key aspects for expanding <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> programs to conduct active, population-based surveillance on stillbirths: (1) case identification and ascertainment, (2) data collection, and (3) data use and project evaluation. Participants included experts in pediatrics, obstetrics, epidemiology, maternal-fetal medicine, perinatology and pediatric pathology, midwifery, as well as practicing clinicians and pathologists.

50|$|Even though âscientifically {{rigorous}} {{studies of}} causes of human <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> generally require evaluation {{of hundreds of}} <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> or more", the CDPH's objectives were limited and largely focused on evaluating risk factors because of the fewer than dozen cases of <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> in Kettleman City. The CDPH investigated a total of 11 eligible children born with major, structural <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> between 2007 and March 31, 2010 to mothers {{who had lived in}} the Kettleman City area during their pregnancies. Through a mixed-methods approach consisting of interviews and supplementary medical history reports the CDPH did not find a specific cause or environmental exposure among the mother that would explain {{the increase in the number}} of children born with <b>birth</b> <b>defects.</b> It was found that some children had multiple abnormalities, while others had single <b>defects.</b> All the <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> represented different underlying conditions, but a few shared some features.

40|$|<b>Birth</b> <b>defects</b> {{refer to}} a group of diverse {{congenital}} conditions, which are responsible for stillbirths, neonatal deaths, chronic medical conditions and disability. Due to their low prevalence and high mortality, <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> are not considered to be a significant health problem in India. Various data however identify that India may harbour a significant burden of <b>birth</b> <b>defects,</b> and that these conditions may be responsible for a considerable proportion of neonatal deaths in India. Although it is widely assumed that survival of patients with <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> is low, data suggests that in 2002, there were nearly six million Indians living with impairments arising at birth. These data urge the need for implementation of a national <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> programme in India, with a strong component of prevention. The need for significant research investments to understand the epidemiology and public health impact of <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> in India is identified.

25|$|Another health {{implication}} is {{the depletion of}} folate within the body, where the overexposure to UV light can lead to megaloblastic anemia.

Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and can stunt fetal growth or weight, create distinctive facial stigmata, damaged neurons and brain structures, and cause other physical, mental, or behavioural problems. Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading known cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with brain insulin and insulin-like growth factor resistance.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundPrevious studies noted {{associations}} between <b>birth</b> <b>defects</b> and some antibiotics (e. g., nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides) but not others (e. g., penicillins).

25|$|Spina bifida is a <b>birth</b> <b>defect</b> {{where there}} is {{incomplete}} closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. There are three main types: spina bifida occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases {{it may be the}} middle back or neck. Occulta has no or only mild signs. Signs of occulta may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot, or swelling on the back {{at the site of the}} gap in the spine. Meningocele typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine. Myelomeningocele, also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe form. Associated problems include poor ability to walk, problems with bladder or bowel control, hydrocephalus, a tethered spinal cord, and latex allergy. Learning problems are relatively uncommon.|$|E
25|$|A low {{socioeconomic}} status in a deprived neighborhood may include exposure to âenvironmental stressors and risk factors.â Socioeconomic inequalities are commonly {{measured by the}} Cartairs-Morris score, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Townsend deprivation index, and the Jarman score. The Jarman score, for example, considers âunemployment, overcrowding, single parents, under-fives, elderly living alone, ethnicity, low social class and residential mobility.â In Vosâ meta-analysis these indices are used to view the effect of low SES neighborhoods on maternal health. In the meta-analysis, data from individual studies were collected from 1985 up until 2008. Vos concludes that a correlation exists between prenatal adversities and deprived neighborhoods. Other {{studies have shown that}} low SES is closely associated with the development of the fetus in utero and growth retardation. Studies also suggest that children born in low SES families are âlikely to be born prematurely, at low birth weight, or with asphyxia, a <b>birth</b> <b>defect,</b> a disability, fetal alcohol syndrome, or AIDS.â Bradley and Corwyn also suggest that congenital disorders arise from the motherâs lack of nutrition, a poor lifestyle, maternal substance abuse and âliving in a neighborhood that contains hazards affecting fetal development (toxic waste dumps).â In a meta-analysis that viewed how inequalities influenced maternal health, it was suggested that deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use. After controlling for socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, several individual studies demonstrated an association with outcomes such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth.|$|E
