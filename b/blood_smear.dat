5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made by examination of the peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>smear</b> when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E

25|$|On {{a stained}} <b>blood</b> <b>smear,</b> {{platelets}} appear as dark purple spots, about 20% {{the diameter of}} red blood cells. The smear is used to examine platelets for size, shape, qualitative number, and clumping. The ratio of platelets to red blood cells in a healthy adult ranges from 1:10 to 1:20.|$|E

40|$|It {{is unusual}} to find {{microorganisms}} in peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>smears,</b> and their presence is frequently associated with overwhelming sepsis and consequently a poor prognosis. In this report, we demonstrate 4 cases with bacteria in <b>blood</b> <b>smears.</b> Two {{of them had}} a fatal outcome, but the other 2 were caused by a contamination either via the central venous catheter or in vitro, both without dramatic outcome. The finding of bacteria in <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> has to be interpreted carefully, and thorough examination of peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> may be of great importance in the early diagnosis of bacteremia; however, in vitro contamination must be excluded...|$|R
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>smears</b> are an {{essential}} component of a Complete Blood Count (CBC) as they can be used to confirm and complement analyzer data and evaluate for morphologic abnormalities that cannot be detected by analysers alone. CBCs are used clinically to investigate sick patients, chemotherapy patients, and often also as a part of an annual screening process. Haematology abnormalities most often evaluated include anaemia, inflammatory disease, leukaemias, and bleeding disorders. This practical session is to follow the lecture on how to make and stain <b>blood</b> <b>smears.</b> In this practical session registrants will be encouraged to perform <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> via both the push and coverslip methods while being guided by both trained scientists and a veterinary clinical pathologist.

25|$|Laboratory {{tests for}} {{thrombocytopenia}} might include full blood count, liver enzymes, kidney function, vitamin B12 levels, folic acid levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>smear.</b> If {{the cause for}} the low platelet count remains unclear, a bone marrow biopsy is usually recommended to differentiate cases of decreased platelet production from cases of peripheral platelet destruction.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of TTP {{is based on}} the clinical symptoms with the concomitant presence of thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100×109/L) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the <b>blood</b> <b>smear,</b> a negative direct antiglobulin test (coombs test), elevated levels of hemolysis markers (such as total bilirubin, LDH, free hemoglobin and an unmeasurable haptoglobin), after exclusion of any other apparent cause.|$|E
25|$|Initially, in {{the first}} stage of the disease, there are fevers, headaches, itchiness, and joint pains. This begins one to three weeks after the bite. Weeks to months later the second stage begins with confusion, poor coordination, {{numbness}} and trouble sleeping. Diagnosis is via finding the parasite in a <b>blood</b> <b>smear</b> or in the fluid of a lymph node. A lumbar puncture is often needed {{to tell the difference between}} first and second stage disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hereditary elliptocytosis is usually made by coupling {{a family history}} of the condition with an appropriate clinical presentation and confirmation on a <b>blood</b> <b>smear.</b> In general it requires that at least 25% of erythrocytes in the specimen are abnormally elliptical in shape, though the observed percentage of elliptocytes can be 100%. This is in contrast {{to the rest of the}} population, in which it is common for up to 15% of erythrocytes to be elliptical.|$|E
25|$|Many {{diseases}} involving {{red blood}} cells are diagnosed with a blood film (or peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>smear),</b> where {{a thin layer of}} blood is smeared on a microscope slide. This may reveal abnormalities of red blood cell shape and form. When {{red blood cells}} sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as rouleaux formation, and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during inflammation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to distinguish between T cells and B cells in a peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>smear.</b> Normally, flow cytometry testing is used for specific lymphocyte population counts. This {{can be used to}} determine the percentage of lymphocytes that contain a particular combination of specific cell surface proteins, such as immunoglobulins or cluster of differentiation (CD) markers or that produce particular proteins (for example, cytokines using intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS)). In order to study the function of a lymphocyte by virtue of the proteins it generates, other scientific techniques like the ELISPOT or secretion assay techniques can be used.|$|E
40|$|Fetal blood {{sampling}} {{is a widely}} used technique for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, {{despite the fact that}} examination of <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> is a critical step in the study of a large variety of disorders, the place of fetal <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> analysis has been overshadowed by more sophisticated diagnostic tools such as those offered by molecular biology. Nevertheless, as highlighted by four cases presented in this paper, the role of fetal <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> examination must be re-emphasized. The recognition of abnormal cytological findings limits the number of possible aetiologies, thus elegantly contributing to the diagnosis without multiplying unnecessary test techniques...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, the {{identification}} of blood parasites {{has been based on}} visual examination of <b>blood</b> <b>smears.</b> This approach depends on individual expertise in making <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> and identifying parasites, which can vary widely from person to person. Recent work has shown that reading <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> is significantly less sensitive than using molecular studies in identification. Thus, the accuracy of the data can fluctuate greatly. This project compares the ability of investigators to identify infected birds using microscopes and <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> with their ability to identify infected birds through molecular analysis of blood from the same sample. During fall migration (September – October) 2011, raptors were trapped at the Idaho Bird Observatory near Boise, Idaho. Blood samples were collected from both jugular and wing veins. <b>Blood</b> <b>smears</b> were made and some of the blood was stored for subsequent molecular analysis. Species of interest were American kestrels (Falco sparverius), Cooper’s hawks (Accipter cooperi), northern goshawks (A. gentilis), sharp-shinned hawks (A. striatus), and red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis). Avian malaria parasite lineages (Plasmodium and Haemoproteus spp.) and Leucocytozoon occur in Accipitridae and Falconidae and were analyzed for prevalence via <b>blood</b> <b>smears,</b> DNA extractions, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) screening. By comparing and contrasting these two techniques I identify parasite prevalence that was previously undefined or misidentified through visual screening. Using molecular methods could impact the current taxonomic assessments based on parasite morphological descriptions and potentially impact future management and conservation efforts of wild raptors and their vectors...|$|R
25|$|Upshaw–Schulman {{syndrome}} (USS) is the recessively inherited form of {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (TTP), a {{rare and}} complex blood coagulation disease. USS {{is caused by the}} absence of the ADAMTS13 protease resulting in the persistence of ultra large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF), causing episodes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy with disseminated multiple small vessel obstructions. These obstructions deprive downstream tissues from blood and oxygen, which can result in tissue damage and death. The presentation of an acute USS episode is variable but usually associated with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with schistocytes on the peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>smear,</b> fever and signs of ischemic organ damage in the brain, kidney and heart.|$|E
25|$|Microscopically, in a Wright's stained {{peripheral}} <b>blood</b> <b>smear,</b> {{a normal}} lymphocyte has a large, dark-staining nucleus {{with little to}} no eosinophilic cytoplasm. In normal situations, the coarse, dense nucleus of a lymphocyte is approximately {{the size of a}} red blood cell (about 7μm in diameter). Some lymphocytes show a clear perinuclear zone (or halo) around the nucleus or could exhibit a small clear zone {{to one side of the}} nucleus. Polyribosomes are a prominent feature in the lymphocytes and can be viewed with an electron microscope. The ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis, allowing the generation of large quantities of cytokines and immunoglobulins by these cells.|$|E
25|$|Abdominal pain due to hypersplenism and splenic {{infarction}} and right-upper quadrant pain {{caused by}} gallstones are major clinical manifestations. However, diagnosing thalassemiæ from symptoms alone is inadequate. Physicians note these signs as associative {{due to this}} disease's complexity. The following associative signs can attest to {{the severity of the}} phenotype: pallor, poor growth, inadequate food intake, splenomegaly, jaundice, maxillary hyperplasia, dental malocclusion, cholelithiasis, systolic ejection murmur in the presence of severe anemia and pathologic fractures. Based on symptoms, tests are ordered for a differential diagnosis. These tests include complete blood count; hemoglobin electrophoresis; serum transferrin, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity; urine urobilin and urobilogen; peripheral <b>blood</b> <b>smear,</b> which may show codocytes, or target cells; hematocrit; and serum bilirubin.|$|E
40|$|Background: Due to students’ initial inexperience, slides are {{frequently}} broken and <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> are damaged in microscopy training, {{leading to the}} need for their constant replacement. To minimize this problem a method of preparing <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> on transparent acetate sheets was developed with the goal of implementing appropriate and more readily available teaching resources for the microscopic diagnosis of malaria. Methods: Acetate sheets derived from polyester were used to standardize the preparation and staining of thin and thick <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> on transparent acetate sheets. Thick and thin <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> were also prepared using the conventional method on glass slides. The staining was conducted using Giemsa staining for the thick and thin smears. Results: Microscopic examination (1, 000 x) of the thin and thick <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> prepared on transparent acetate produced high-quality images for both the parasites and the <b>blood</b> cells. The <b>smears</b> showed up on a clear background and with minimal dye precipitation. It was possible to clearly identify the main morphological characteristics of Plasmodium, neutrophils and platelets. After 12 months of storage, there was no change in image quality or evidence of fungal colonization. Conclusion: Preparation of thin and thick <b>blood</b> <b>smears</b> in transparent acetate for the microscopic diagnosis of malaria does not compromise the morphological and staining characteristics of the parasites or blood cells. It is reasonable to predict the applicability of transparent acetate in relevant situations such as the training of qualified professionals for the microscopic diagnosis of malaria and the preparation of positive specimens for competency assessment (quality control) of professionals and services involved in the diagnosis of malaria...|$|R

The accuracy of these tests, typically used for routine screening or diagnosis of heartworm infection, is improved by multiple testing. The modified Knott test and millipore filtration are more sensitive because they concentrate microfilariae, improving the chance of diagnosis. The direct smear technique allows examination of larval motion, helping in the distinction of D. immitis from Acanthocheilonema reconditum. This distinction is important because {{the presence of the}} latter parasite does not require expensive and potentially harmful therapy. However, the potential for a microfilaremic infections is 5-67%. The number of circulating microfilariae does not correlate with the number of adult heartworms, so is not an indicator of disease severity.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} most commonly by serologic {{testing of the}} blood {{for the presence of}} antibodies against the ehrlichia organism. Many veterinarians routinely test for the disease, especially in enzootic areas. During the acute phase of infection, the test can be falsely negative because the body will not have had time to make antibodies to the infection. As such, the test should be repeated. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test can be performed during this stage to detect genetic material of the bacteria. The PCR test is more likely to yield a negative result during the subclinical and chronic disease phases. [...] In addition, blood tests may show abnormalities in the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and most commonly platelets, if the disease is present. Uncommonly, a diagnosis can be made by looking under a microscope at a <b>blood</b> <b>smear</b> for the presence of the ehrlichia morulae, which sometimes can be seen as intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies within a white blood cell.|$|E
