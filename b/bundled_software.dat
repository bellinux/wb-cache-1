5|$|Windows RT was {{released}} to mixed reviews from various outlets and critics. Some felt that Windows RT devices had advantages over other mobile platforms (such as iOS or Android) {{because of its}} <b>bundled</b> <b>software</b> {{and the ability to}} use a wider variety of USB peripherals and accessories, but the platform was criticized for its poor software ecosystem, citing the early state of Windows Store and its incompatibility with existing Windows software, and other limitations over Windows 8.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} original release in July 2015; critics praised Microsoft's decision {{to provide a}} desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows, contrasting the tablet-oriented approach of 8, although Windows 10's touch-oriented user interface mode was panned for containing regressions upon the touch-oriented interface of Windows 8. Critics also praised the improvements to Windows 10's <b>bundled</b> <b>software</b> over Windows 8.1, Xbox Live integration, {{as well as the}} functionality and capabilities of Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. However, media outlets have been critical of changes to operating system behaviors, including mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners, and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{characterized}} the initial release of Windows 10 in July 2015 as being rushed, citing the incomplete state {{of some of}} the operating system's <b>bundled</b> <b>software</b> (such as the Edge web browser), as well as the stability of the operating system itself on launch. However, TechRadar felt that Windows10 would be [...] "the new Windows7", citing the operating system's more familiar user interface, improvements to bundled apps, performance improvements, a [...] "rock solid" [...] search system, and the Settings app being more full-featured than its equivalents on8 and8.1. The Microsoft Edge web browser was praised for its performance, albeit not being in a feature-complete state on-launch. While considering them a [...] "great idea in principle", concerns were shown for Microsoft's focus on the universal app ecosystem, noting that [...] "It's by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows10 from iOS and Android simply because they can convert their apps easily. It may well become a no-brainer for them, but at the moment a conscious decision is still required." ...|$|E
5000|$|Early {{microcomputer}} companies {{varied in}} {{their decision to}} <b>bundle</b> <b>software.</b> BYTE in 1984 observed that [...] "Kaypro apparently has tremendous buying and bargaining power", noting that the Kaypro 10 came with both WordStar and Perfect Writer, plus [...] "two spelling checkers, two spreadsheets, two communications programs and three versions of BASIC". Compaq, by contrast, did not <b>bundle</b> <b>software,</b> stating that [...] "You remove the freedom from the dealers to really merchandise when you <b>bundle</b> in <b>software</b> ... Why should you be constrained to use the software {{that comes with a}} piece of hardware? I think it can tend to inhibit sales over the long run." [...] MacWrite's inclusion with early Macintosh computers discouraged developers from creating other word processing software for the computer.|$|R

2500|$|The {{end user}} license {{agreement}} (EULA) for Apple gives the consumer {{the opportunity to}} reject the license and obtain a refund. The current Microsoft Windows license lets the manufacturer determine the refund policy. With previous versions of Windows, it was possible to obtain a refund if the manufacturer failed to provide the refund by litigation in the small claims courts. On 15 February 1999, a group of Linux users in Orange County, California held a [...] "Windows Refund Day" [...] protest in an attempt to pressure Microsoft into issuing them refunds. In France, the Linuxfrench and AFUL (French speaking Libre Software Users' Association) organizations along with free software activist Roberto Di Cosmo started a [...] "Windows Detax" [...] movement, which led to a 2006 petition against [...] "racketiciels" [...] (translation: Racketware) with 39,415 signatories and the DGCCRF branch of the French government filing several complaints against <b>bundled</b> <b>software.</b> On March 24, 2014, a new international petition was launched by AFUL on the Avaaz platform, translated into several languages and supported by many organizations around the world.|$|E
2500|$|On July 23, 2009, Logic Pro 9 was announced. A {{major new}} feature {{included}} [...] "Flex Time", Apple's take on [...] "elastic" [...] audio, which allows audio to be quantized. A {{version of the}} pedalboard from GarageBand was included, together with a new virtual guitar amplifier where the modeled components could be combined in different ways. There were also a number of improvements to audio editing, fulfilled user requests such as [...] "bounce in place" [...] and selective track and channel strip import, {{as well as an}} expanded content library including one more Jam Pack. Some of the <b>bundled</b> <b>software,</b> including MainStage 2 and Soundtrack Pro 3, was also improved. Logic Pro 9 is Universal Binary, although not officially supported for use on PowerPC computers. SoundDiver, which had been quietly bundled with previous versions, was dropped, eliminating support for arguably the world's most popular synthesizer editor/librarian. As Apple has bundled so many software instruments with Logic, it is not likely that we'll see the return of integration with external synthesizer hardware to the Logic platform.|$|E

40|$|Bundling {{has been}} a widely used selling {{strategy}} in the software industry. In terms of fighting against <b>software</b> piracy, the <b>bundling</b> of <b>software</b> applications that are prone to different levels of piracy has been proposed {{as a way to}} minimize the negative impact due to software piracy. Until recently, software implementations have mostly been at the client’s end, which requires a variety of antipiracy strategies. With the emergence of software as a service model, software implementations move to the server’s end, which gives the software vendor greater flexibility to curb software piracy. In this paper, we analyze software piracy issues where a monopolist software vendor has the option to <b>bundle</b> <b>software</b> as a product and/or a service. Our study yields some interesting managerial perspectives to this newly emerging phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Software as {{a service}} (SaaS) has moved quickly from a {{peripheral}} idea to a mainstream phenomenon. By <b>bundling</b> a <b>software</b> product with delivery and maintenance service, SaaS providers can effectively differentiate their products with traditional shrink-wrap software (SWS). This research uses a game theoretical approach to examine short- and long-term competition between SaaS and SWS providers. We analyze the factors that affect equilibrium outcomes, including user implementation costs, SaaS provider's operation efficiency, and quality improvement over time. <b>Bundling</b> <b>software</b> with service lowers software implementation cost for users, and our results suggest that it increases equilibrium prices. In providing software services, SaaS providers have to incur significant operation cost. In the long run, service operation cost may significantly affect SaaS firm's ability to improve its software quality.

50|$|By {{the late}} 1960s change was coming: as {{operating}} systems and programming language compilers evolved, software production costs were dramatically increasing relative to hardware. A growing software industry was {{competing with the}} hardware manufacturers' <b>bundled</b> <b>software</b> products (the cost of bundled products {{was included in the}} hardware cost), leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of manufacturer's software to be bundled with hardware product costs. In the United States vs. IBM antitrust suit, filed 17 January 1969, the U.S. government charged that <b>bundled</b> <b>software</b> was anticompetitive. While some software continued to come at no cost, there was a growing amount of software that was for sale only under restrictive licences.|$|E
50|$|After Adam Osborne {{sold his}} {{computer}} book-publishing company to McGraw-Hill in 1979, {{he decided to}} sell an inexpensive portable computer with <b>bundled</b> <b>software</b> and hired Lee Felsenstein to design it. The resulting Osborne 1 featured a 5 inch (127 mm) 52-column display, two floppy-disk drives, a Z80 microprocessor, 64 KB of RAM, and could fit under an airplane seat. It could survive being accidentally dropped and included a <b>bundled</b> <b>software</b> package that included the CP/M operating system, the BASIC programming language, the WordStar word processing package, and the SuperCalc spreadsheet program. Osborne obtained the software in part by offering stock in the new Osborne Computer Corporation, which he founded in January 1981.
