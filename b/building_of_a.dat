5|$|An {{agreement}} {{exists between}} BAA and West Sussex County Council preventing the <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second runway before 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the Department for Transport, at which proposals for additional facilities and runways were considered. It was agreed {{that there would}} be no further expansion at Gatwick unless it became impossible to meet growth targets at London Heathrow Airport within existing pollution limits.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station {{was a source of}} electricity for local homes. The <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> power station brought major environmental improvements to what was a highly polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E

5|$|By the 1970s {{the airport}} was again {{in need of}} {{expansion}} and modernization. In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed passenger capacity. This plan included the <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new terminal and a new parallel runway across Donelson Pike to handle increasing operations by reducing the time between consecutive takeoffs and landings.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Log Revolution and the end of April 1991, nearly 200 incidents involving the use of explosive devices and 89 attacks on the Croatian police were recorded. The Croatian Ministry of the Interior started arming an increasing number of special police forces, and this led to the <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> real army. On 9 April 1991, Croatian President Tuđman ordered the special police forces to be renamed Zbor Narodne Garde ("National Guard"); this marks the creation of a separate military of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{after his}} {{accession}} to the throne, George V ordered {{the revival of}} the Installation ceremony, perhaps prompted by the first Installation ceremony of the more junior Order of St Michael and St George, held a few years earlier, and the <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new chapel for the Order of the Thistle in 1911. The Installation ceremony took place on 22 July 1913 in the Henry VII Chapel, and Installations have been held at regular intervals since.|$|E

5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} the {{families}} who owned the manor {{in what was then}} an isolated rural community. Agriculture, hand loom weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants until the middle of the 19th century. A chapel built before 1541 was replaced by the present church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led to the <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel. A grammar school was founded by charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1556.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} races of {{professional}} road cycling. It was first run in 1896 and has stopped only for the two world wars. The race was created by two Roubaix textile manufacturers, Théodore Vienne (born 28 July 1864) and Maurice Perez. They had been behind the <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> velodrome on 46,000 square metres at the corner of the rue Verte and the route d'Hempempont, which opened on 9 June 1895.|$|E

Roger also was accused of avarice, and of making unworthy clerical appointments. However, he also started the rebuilding of York Minster, which had been damaged by fire in 1137, and helped with the <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church at Ripon. He also endowed the school at York with an annual income of 100 shillings.|$|E
5|$|Since 1771, Battersea and Chelsea {{had been}} linked by the modest wooden Battersea Bridge. As London grew {{following}} {{the advent of}} the railways, Chelsea began to become congested, and in 1842 the Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues recommended the building of an embankment at Chelsea to free new land for development, and proposed the <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new bridge downstream of Battersea Bridge and the replacement of Battersea Bridge with a more modern structure.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–08 {{volcanic}} activity of Mount St. Helens {{has been documented}} as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano.

Boats carrying 15tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting of a pair of gates to hold back the water, and an agreement to build a towpath between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|E
5|$|The <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church {{dedicated}} to Saint George during the 6th century CE indicates that {{by this time}} Jifna, now under Byzantine rule, had become a Christian town.

By 1881, the line was completed up to Darjeeling.|$|E
