40|$|The {{brushless}} {{doubly fed}} reluctance machine (BDFRM) {{is a potential}} low cost alternative to the existing solutions in applications with limited variable speed ranges. The cost eﬀectiveness of the BDFRM drive {{can be attributed to}} the possibility of using a partially rated power electronic converter and reliable, maintenance-free operation aﬀorded by the absence of <b>brush</b> <b>gear.</b> This paper proposes a load model based observer algorithm for speed and direct torque (and ﬂux) control (DTC) of this machine without using a shaft position sensor. The preliminary results have demonstrated good controller performance over the desired speed range for diﬀerent loading conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{brushless}} {{doubly fed}} induction generator (BDFIG) {{has been proposed}} as a viable alternative in wind turbines to the commonly used doubly fed induction generator (DFIG). The BDFIG retains {{the benefits of the}} DFIG, i. e. variable speed operation with a partially rated converter, but without the use of <b>brush</b> <b>gear</b> and slip rings, thereby conferring enhanced reliability. As low voltage ride-through (LVRT) performance of the DFIG-based wind turbine is well understood, this paper aims to analyze LVRT behavior of the BDFIG-based wind turbine in a similar way. In order to achieve this goal, the equivalence between their two-axis model parameters is investigated. The variation of flux linkages, back-EMFs and currents of both types of generator are elaborated during three phase voltage dips. Moreover, the structural differences between the two generators, which lead to different equivalent parameters and hence different LVRT capabilities, are investigated. The analytical results are verified via time-domain simulations for medium size wind turbine generators as well as experimental results of a voltage dip on a prototype 250 kVA BDFIG...|$|E

25|$|In {{the ensuing}} dogfight, Boelcke and Böhme, unaware of each other's presence, {{closed in on}} the same aircraft, flown by Captain Arthur Knight. Von Richthofen dived in on the flight path of that very same aircraft; he was chasing the other DH.2, piloted by Lieutenant Alfred Edwin McKay. Boelcke swerved to avoid a {{collision}} with the interceding aircraft. Böhme's landing <b>gear</b> <b>brushed</b> Boelcke's upper wing. As the fabric peeled off the upper wing of his aircraft, Boelcke struggled for control. He and his aircraft fell out of sight into a cloud. When it emerged, the top wing was gone. However, Boelcke made a relatively soft crash-landing. The impact seemed survivable. However, his lap belt did not restrain him, and he never wore a helmet when he flew.|$|R
40|$|The Compact Drilling and Sample System (CDSS) was {{developed}} to drill into terrestrial, cometary, and asteroid material in a cryogenic, vacuum environment in order to acquire subsurface samples. Although drills were used by the Apollo astronauts some 20 years ago, this drill is {{a fraction of the}} mass and power and operates completely autonomously, able to drill, acquire, transport, dock, and release sample containers in science instruments. The CDSS has incorporated into its control system the ability to gather science data about the material being drilled by measuring drilling rate per force applied and torque. This drill will be able to optimize rotation and thrust in order to achieve the highest drilling rate possible in any given sample. The drill can be commanded to drill at a specified force, so that force imparted on the rover or lander is limited. This paper will discuss the cryo dc <b>brush</b> motors, carbide <b>gears,</b> cryogenic lubrication, quick-release interchangeable sampling drill bits, percussion drilling and the control system developed to achieve autonomous, cryogenic, vacuum, lightweight drilling...|$|R

40|$|TheraDrive is an {{effective}} system for post-stroke upper extremity rehabilitation. This system uses off-the-shelf computer gaming wheels with force feedback to help reduce motor impairment and improve function {{in the arms of}} stroke survivors. Preliminary results show that the TheraDrive system lacks a robust mechanical linkage that can withstand the large forces exerted by patients, and it lacks a patient-specific adaptive controller to deliver personalized therapy. It is also not capable of delivering effective therapy to severely low-functioning patients. A new low-cost, high-force haptic robot with a single degree of freedom has been developed to address these concerns. The resulting TheraDrive consists of an actuated hand crank with a compliant transmission. Actuation is provided by a <b>brushed</b> DC motor, <b>geared</b> to output up to 23 kgf at the end effector. To enable a human to interact with this system safely, a special compliant element was developed to double as a failsafe torque limiter. A set of strain gauges in the handle of the crank are used to determine the interaction forces between human and robot for use by the robot’s impedance controller. The impedance controller is used to render a one-dimensional force field that attracts or repels the end effector from a moving target point that the human must track during therapy exercises. As exercises are performed, an adaptive controller monitors patient performance and adjusts the force field accordingly. This allows the robot to compensate for gravity, variable mechanical advantage, limited range of motion, and other factors. More importantly, the adaptive controller ensures that exercises are difficult but doable, which is important for maintaining patient motivation. Experiments with a computer model of human and robot show the adaptive controller’s ability to maintain difficulty of exercises after a period of initial calibration...|$|R

Seven human subjects (3 normal, 4 stroke-impaired) were used to test this system alongside the original TheraDrive system in order to compare both systems. Data showed that the new system produced a larger change in normalized trajectory tracking error when assistance/resistance was added to exercises when compared to the original TheraDrive. Data also showed that adaptive control led subject performance to be closer to a desired level. Motivation surveys showed no significant difference in subject motivation between the two systems.

40|$|The {{wind power}} {{generation}} is rapidly becoming competitive with {{conventional fossil fuel}} sources and already today is at par with new coal or gas fired power stations. The wind turbine design objectives have changed {{over the past decade}} from being convention-driven to being optimized driven within the operating regime and market environment. The wind turbines are growing in size, designs are progressing from fixedspeed, stall-controlled having drive trains with gearboxes, to become pitch controlled, variable speed and with or without gearboxes. The advancement in power electronics devices further supports the trend toward variable speed turbines. Today, the wind turbines in the market have a variety of innovative concepts, with proven technology for both generators and power electronics interface. However, the increasing penetration of large wind farms into electrical power systems also poses different kind of challenges due to their intermittent nature. This inspires the designers to develop both custom generators and power electronics devices with sophisticated modern control system strategies. Recently, variable-speed permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion systems (WECS) are becoming more attractive in comparison to fixed-speed WECS. In the variable-speed generation system, the wind turbine can be operated at maximum power operating points over a wide speed range by adjusting the shaft speed optimally. Moreover, the use of Permanent Magnet reduces size, and weight of overall WECS, as there is no need of field winding and its excitation system. The absence of rotor winding also reduces heat dissipation in the rotor and hence improves the overall efficiency. This kind of configuration also find special favor for off-shore wind application, where the geared doubly fed induction generator requires regular maintenance due to tearing-wearing in <b>brushes</b> and <b>gear</b> box. To perform maximum power point tracking at different wind speeds, the variable speed operation of PMSG is required. For the variable speed operation of PMSG, generally vector control is preferred as it allows the independent torque and field control just like a simple DC motor control. The vector control of PMSG essentially requires the rotor position and speed information. For this purpose, usually shaft mounted speed and position sensors are used, resulting into additional cost and complexity of the system. In order to eliminate the sensors and their associated problems, a novel adaptive networkbased fuzzy-inference system (ANFIS) architecture is proposed for rotor position and speed estimation over wide range of speed operation. The ANFIS architecture has well known advantages of modeling a highly non-linear system, as it combines the capability of fuzzy reasoning in handling the uncertainties and capability of artificial neural network (ANN) in learning from processes. Thus, the ANFIS is used to develop an adaptive model of variable speed PMSG under highly uncertain operating conditions, which also automatically compensates any variation in parameters such as inductance, resistance etc. An error gradient based dynamic back propagation method has been used for the on-line tuning of ANFIS architecture. In the proposed work a PMSG based WECS is modeled for both isolated and grid connected system. In the isolated WECS operation, a wind-battery hybrid system is presented. The battery energy storage system (BESS) in the isolated system is used to absorb the wind power fluctuations and varying load demand. In grid connected system, the fault ride through capability of WECS is demonstrated under grid voltage sag/swell conditions. Another objective is to develop an advance controller for grid side inverter. Since the inverter works under highly fluctuating operating conditions, {{it is not possible to}} set the optimal value of gains for the conventional proportional-integral (PI) regulator. This may lead to false operation of inverter. To alleviate this problem an adaptive neurofuzzy controller is developed, which has well known advantages in modeling and control of a highly non-linear system. The main objective is to achieve smooth operation of grid side inverter, where the conventional PI controller may fail due to the rapid change in the dynamics of the overall system. The combined capability of neuro-fuzzy controller in handling the uncertainties and learning from the processes is proved to be advantageous while controlling the inverter under fluctuating operating conditions. Moreover, in the proposed work, the grid side inverter rating is also optimally utilized by incorporating the power quality improvement features. Normally, the grid interfacing inverter has very low utilization factor 20 - 30...|$|R
