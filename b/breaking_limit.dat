An additional amplification takes place, when the frequency of EM-wave is nearing to the spike plasma frequency. Results are obtained in the perturbative approach, when dimensionless external EM-wave amplitude {{is used as a}} small parameter.

The use of these last ones increases the weight in the conveyors and causes a greater consumption of energy; in addition, an overload could bring with it bigger breakages and the increase of the costs in the interruptions. The value of the resistance to the static flexion of conventional materials (like Pinus Caribaea and Lysiloma Bahamensis), with values of maximum resistance to the static flexion (FH) : FH= 113, 19 MPa y FH = 46, 33 MPa respectively, was obtained experimentally.

The Movie Channel temporarily truncated the length of its promotional breaks to five minutes or less in an on-air strategical test during February and March 1993, dispensing of fixed start times at the top and bottom of the hour – at which most of TMC's weekday daytime film telecasts had been scheduled, along with some films aired in other dayparts, since the 1988 format revamp – in favor of airtimes set at top-of-the-hour, bottom-of-the-hour and random five-minute intervals regardless of daypart.

This paper reports on our rst attempts to compute highly-nonlinear wave {{interaction with}} bottom-mounted coastal structures using a high-order Boussinesq method. The results pre-sented here include the classical linear diraction pattern around a breakwater (for validation), and the nonlinear interaction of waves with a bottom-mounted plate where we {{compare to the}} experimental measurements discussed by Molin et al. [1] at the 18 th workshop. The computed results involving linear breakwater diraction, while not perfect, are in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions. More impressively, a highly-nonlinear simulation involving run-up on a vertical plate is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. 1 The Boussinesq model The Boussinesq method used to make these computations is derived in [2, 3], where it is shown to accurately propagate nonlinear traveling waves in dimensionless water depths up to kh 25 (k the wavenumber, h the water depth) {{right up to the}} stable <b>breaking</b> <b>limit.</b> The associated wave kinematics (vertical distribution of pressure and velocity) are accurate up to kh 12. In [6] the method has been used to investigate three-dimensional instabilities leading to crescent wave patterns of extreme nonlinearity. To brie y outline the method, we consider water waves in three-dimensions using a coordinate system having the origin on the still-water plane, with the z-axis pointing vertically upwards. The uid domain is bounded by the sea bed at z = h(x), with x = [x; y], and the free surface at z = (x; t), where t is time.

40|$|Constitutive {{modelling}} of skins {{that account}} for damage effects is important to provide insight for various clinical applications, such as skin trauma and injury, artificial skin design, skin aging, disease diagnosis, surgery, as well as comparative studies of skin biomechanics between species. In this study, a new damage model for human and animal skins is proposed for the first time. The model is nonlinear, anisotropic, invariant-based, {{and is based on}} the Gasser–Ogden–Holzapfel constitutive law initially developed for arteries. Taking account of the mean collagen fibre orientation and its dispersion, the new model can describe a wide range of skins with damage. The model is first tested on the uniaxial test data of human skin and then applied to nine groups of uniaxial test data for the human, swine, rabbit, bovine and rhino skins. The material parameters can be inversely estimated based on uniaxial tests using the optimization method in MATLAB with a root mean square error ranged between 2. 15 % and 12. 18 %. A sensitivity study confirms that the fibre orientation dispersion and the mean fibre angle are among the most important factors that influence the behaviour of the damage model. In addition, these two parameters can only be reliably estimated if some histological information is provided. We also found that depending on the location of skins, the tissue damage may be brittle controlled by the fibre <b>breaking</b> <b>limit</b> (i. e., when the fibre stretch is greater than 1. 13 – 1. 32, depending on the species), or ductile (due to both the fibre and the matrix damages).

The proposed constitutive model may be applied to various clinical applications that require knowledge of the mechanical response of human and animal skins...|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} model is formulated in a Weyl space, W_ 4, yielding a Weyl covariant dynamics of massless chiral Dirac fermion fields for leptons and quarks {{as well as}} the gauge fields involved for the groups D(1) (Weyl), U(1) _Y× SU(2) _W (electroweak), SU(3) _c (colour), SO(3, 1) (gravity) and SO(4, 1) (strong interaction, symmetry breaking). The dynamics is based on a gauge and Weyl invariant Lagrangean density L. Gravitation is included from the beginning as the gauge aspect of the Lorentz group which is here extended in the hadronic sector of the model to the ten parameter SO(4, 1) de Sitter group. A part of the dynamics is, as usual, a scalar isospinor field ϕ being a section on a bundle related to the electroweak gauge group and to symmetry breaking. In parallel to ϕ on the leptonic side a section ξ̃^a on the hadronic side is considered as part of the dynamics, governing the symmetry breaking SO(4, 1) ⟶ SO(3, 1) and recovering gravitation in the symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>limit</b> outside the regions in space-time where strong interactions persist. Besides spin, isospin and helicity the Weyl weights determine the form of the contributions of fields in L. Of particular interest is the appearance of a current-current self-interaction of quark fields allowed by the Weyl weight changing the debate about quark masses. In a second step the D(1) -Weyl symmetry is explicitly broken and a universal mass scale is established through the mass of the ϕ-field appearing in the symmetry breaking Lagrangean L_B. The Weyl symmetry breaking is governed by the relation D_μΦ^ 2 = 0, where Φ is the norm of ϕ. After D(1) symmetry breaking the masses of the weak bosons and of the electron appear on the scene through the energy-momentum tensor of the ϕ-field...|$|E
