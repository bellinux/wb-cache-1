5|$|Historian Keith W. Olson {{has written}} that Nixon left a {{negative}} legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious {{than those of the}} incumbent. Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease {{in the power of the}} presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>in</b> the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over <b>Bush</b> <b>in</b> the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, {{because in recent decades}} the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E
5|$|In rare cases, a {{plant species}} {{may only be}} {{effectively}} pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are endangered {{at least in part}} because their pollinator is also threatened.
