The intension of corona could affect the electromagnetic environment of converter station and generate audible noise. By establishing the calculation models of electric field strength along the <b>tube</b> <b>bus</b> surface and the electric field strength on ground, the paper computes the corona onset voltage gradient and gives the relation curve of high and electrode spacing of <b>tube</b> <b>bus.</b> If the <b>tube</b> <b>bus</b> in HVDC converter substation is installed at the high and electrode spacing, got by the relation curve, it will not generate corona and its electric field strength will meet the requirements.

5000|$|A typical {{alternating}} current furnace {{is powered by}} a three-phase electrical supply and therefore has three electrodes. Electrodes are round in section, and typically in segments with threaded couplings, so that as the electrodes wear, new segments can be added. The arc forms between the charged material and the electrode, the charge is heated both by current passing through the charge and by the radiant energy evolved by the arc. The electric arc temperature reaches around 3000 °C (5000 °F), thus causing the lower sections of the electrodes glow incandescently when in operation. The electrodes are automatically raised and lowered by a positioning system, which may use either electric winch hoists or hydraulic cylinders. The regulating system maintains approximately constant current and power input during the melting of the charge, even though scrap may move under the electrodes as it melts. The mast arms holding the electrodes can either carry heavy busbars (which may be hollow water-cooled copper pipes carrying current to the electrode clamps) or be [...] "hot arms", where the whole arm carries the current, increasing efficiency. Hot arms can be made from copper-clad steel or aluminium. Large water-cooled cables connect the <b>bus</b> <b>tubes</b> or arms with the transformer located adjacent to the furnace.

40|$|Off-Chip buses {{constitute}} {{a significant portion}} of the total system power in embedded systems. Past research has focused on encoding contiguous bit positions in data values to reduce the transition activity in the off-chip data buses. In this paper, we propose TUnable <b>Bus</b> Encoding (<b>TUBE)</b> scheme to reduce the power consumption in the data buses, which exploits repetition in contiguous as well as non-contiguous bit positions in order to encode data values. We also solve the problem of keeping just one control signal for our codec design. We compare our results with some of the already existing best schemes such as Frequent Value encoding (FVE) and FV-MSB-LSB encoding schemes. We find that our scheme achieves an improvement of 21 % on average and up to 28 % on some benchmarks over the FVE scheme and up to 84 % over unencoded data. In comparison to FV-MSB-LSB encoding scheme, our scheme improves the energy savings by 10 % on average and up to 21 % for some media applications at the expense of minimal 0. 45 % performance overhead. We present a hardware design of our codec and provide a detailed analysis of the hardware overhead in terms of area, delay and energy consumption. We find that our codec can be easily implemented in an on-chip memory controller with small area requirement of 0. 0521 mm 2.

40|$|Abstract—Off-Chip buses {{constitute}} {{a significant portion}} of the total system power in embedded systems. Many research works have focused on reducing power consumption in the off-chip buses. While numerous techniques exist for reducing bus power in address buses, only a handful of techniques have been proposed for off-chip data bus power reduction. In this paper, we propose two novel data bus encoding schemes to reduce power consumption in the data buses. The first scheme called Variable Length Value Encoder (VALVE) is capable of detecting and encoding variable lengths of repeated bit patterns in the data. The second technique called Tunable <b>Bus</b> Encoder (<b>TUBE)</b> encodes repetition in contiguous as well as noncontiguous bit positions of data values. Both schemes require just one external control signal to encode data values. TUBE is the first proposed hardware-based bus encoding scheme capable of detecting and encoding both contiguous and noncontiguous bit patterns of varying widths. Experimental evaluation on a large set of benchmarks shows an energy reduction of 58 percent and 60 percent on average for VALVE and TUBE, respectively. We evaluate the performance penalty incurred due to the codec delay and it is found to be 0. 45 percent of the total program execution time. We also quantify our hardware overhead in terms of area, delay, and energy consumption. In 0. 18 m technology, VALVE and TUBE require a modest area of 0. 0486 mm 2 and 0. 0521 mm 2, respectively.

5|$|The Emirates Stadium {{is served}} {{by a number of}} London Underground {{stations}} and <b>bus</b> routes. Arsenal <b>tube</b> station is the closest for the northern portion of the stadium, with Highbury & Islington tube station servicing the southern end. While Holloway Road tube station is the closest to the southern portion, it is entry-only before matches and exit-only afterwards to prevent overcrowding. Drayton Park station, adjacent to the Clock End Bridge is shut on matchdays as the rail services to this station do not operate at weekends nor after 10pm. £7.6 million was set aside in the planning permission for upgrading Drayton Park and Holloway Road; however Transport for London decided not to upgrade either station, in favour of improvement works at the interchanges at Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park, both of which are served by Underground and National Rail services and are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The Emirates Stadium is the only football stadium that stands beside the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh and is just over 2 miles from London King's Cross.|$|R
40|$|International audienceZadie Smith's three novels {{signal a}} sullen yet {{coherent}} {{evolution in the}} representation of both real and fictional London. Each of the three texts reveals a threefold failure {{in the way the}} city can become the ideal place for the characters to know and fulfil themselves. London is first a mere topographical and cultural gridlock: its neighbourhoods are overdetermined in a way that leads to the negation of the individual, leaving no space for action and banning any type of self-improvement. Yet Smith's London in White Teeth is not as coded as often claimed, and may provide some tools to pervert this conditioning of places and people. The novels indeed examine the dynamics between place and action, description and narration, or between space and time. One way to free oneself from this geographical determination is thus to act and search in space for the traces of one's past to let one's future emerge. And again the characters have to pervert the “straight line” and follow more oblique ways to be allowed to do something by themselves. Leaving both space and time for the event to happen leads to a first recourse to chance and randomness. London's second failure lies in its intrinsic overdetermination: life is eventually more important than place, and people more powerful than the city. Walking aimlessly or not across London is what enables the characters to meet and “connect”, to find their own ways of living and being, and to design a new urban pattern allowing for chance. The three novels will reverse their initial representation of London with a network of movement and transfer of energy. The <b>bus</b> and <b>Tube</b> meshes then map a new city in which chance overcomes determination. Yet the final failure in this writing of London underlines how vain and fruitless this movement may be. While The Autograph Man suggests that it is only within the space and time of movement that one can really free oneself from determination and find the real London, in On Beauty Smith lays the groundwork for her fiction to come. By revisiting Forster's Howards End, Smith resorts to an exceedingly polarized world and implies that though extremes never change, in-between there is space for chaos and for a new literary grip on contemporary places and people, London and Londoners above all...|$|R
