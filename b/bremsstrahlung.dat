5|$|Commercially, the {{radioactive}} isotope bismuth-213 {{can be produced}} by bombarding radium with <b>bremsstrahlung</b> photons from a linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.|$|E
5|$|Remote {{observation}} of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy. For example, in high-energy environments {{such as the}} corona of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate conservation of energy and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> radiation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to relatively long-wavelength radiation, Jupiter also emits synchrotron radiation (also {{known as the}} Jovian decimetric radiation or DIM radiation) with frequencies {{in the range of}} 0.1–15GHz (wavelength from 3m to 2cm), which is the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> radiation of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet. The energy of the electrons that contribute to the DIM emissions is from 0.1 to 100MeV, while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1–20MeV. This radiation is well understood and was used {{since the beginning of the}} 1960s to study the structure of the planet's magnetic field and radiation belts. The particles in the radiation belts originate in the outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated, when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting <b>bremsstrahlung</b> and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
25|$|If {{the plasma}} is {{optically}} thin, the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> radiation leaves the plasma, carrying {{part of the}} internal plasma energy. This effect {{is known as the}} <b>bremsstrahlung</b> cooling. It is a type of radiative cooling. The energy carried away by <b>bremsstrahlung</b> is called <b>bremsstrahlung</b> losses and represents a type of radiative losses. One generally uses the term <b>bremsstrahlung</b> losses in the context when the plasma cooling is undesired, as e.g. in fusion plasmas.|$|E
25|$|In most fusion plasmas, <b>bremsstrahlung</b> {{radiation}} {{is a major}} energy loss channel. (See also <b>bremsstrahlung</b> losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas.) For the p–11B reaction, some calculations indicate that the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> power {{will be at least}} 1.74 times larger than the fusion power. The corresponding ratio for the 3He-3He reaction is only slightly more favorable at 1.39. This is not applicable to non-neutral plasmas, and different in anisotropic plasmas.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bremsstrahlung</b> is {{also the}} {{dominant}} emission mechanism for H II regions at radio wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, e.g. , the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> {{produced}} by shielding the beta radiation with the normally used dense materials (e.g. lead) is itself dangerous; in such cases, shielding must be accomplished with low density materials, e.g. Plexiglas (Lucite), plastic, wood, or water; as the atomic number is lower for these materials, {{the intensity of}} <b>bremsstrahlung</b> is significantly reduced but a larger thickness of shielding is required to stop the electrons (beta radiation).|$|E
25|$|In {{electron}} and positron emission by {{beta decay}} the photon's energy {{comes from the}} electron-nucleon pair, with the spectrum of the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> decreasing continuously with increasing energy of the beta particle. In electron capture, the energy comes {{at the expense of}} the neutrino, and the spectrum is greatest at about one third of the normal neutrino energy, decreasing to zero electromagnetic energy at normal neutrino energy. Note that in the case of electron capture, <b>bremsstrahlung</b> is emitted even though no charged particle is emitted. Instead, the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> radiation may be thought of as being created as the captured electron is accelerated toward being absorbed. Such radiation may be at frequencies that are the same as soft gamma radiation, but it exhibits none of the sharp spectral lines of gamma decay, and thus is not technically gamma radiation.|$|E
25|$|A {{rotating}} charge, such as {{the electron}} classically orbiting around the nucleus, would constantly lose energy in form of electromagnetic radiation (via various mechanisms: dipole radiation, <b>Bremsstrahlung,...).</b> But such radiation is not observed.|$|E
25|$|X-rays: high-energy X-rays (produced by <b>bremsstrahlung)</b> allow {{irradiation}} {{of large}} packages and pallet loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization {{does not require}} chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an X-ray generator that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as tantalum or tungsten with high-energy electrons in {{a process known as}} <b>bremsstrahlung</b> conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.|$|E
25|$|The cosmic {{radiation}} {{at sea level}} usually manifests as 511keV gamma rays from annihilation of positrons created by nuclear reactions of high energy particles and gamma rays. At higher altitudes {{there is also the}} contribution of continuous <b>bremsstrahlung</b> spectrum.|$|E
25|$|In megatesla {{magnetic}} fields a quantum mechanical effect may suppress energy transfer from the ions to the electrons. According to one calculation, <b>bremsstrahlung</b> losses {{could be reduced}} to half the fusion power or less. In a strong magnetic field cyclotron radiation is even larger than the <b>bremsstrahlung.</b> In a megatesla field, an electron would lose its energy to cyclotron radiation in a few picoseconds if the radiation could escape. However, in a sufficiently dense plasma (ne > 2.5×1030 m−3, a density {{greater than that of}} a solid), the cyclotron frequency is less than twice the plasma frequency. In this well-known case, the cyclotron radiation is trapped inside the plasmoid and cannot escape, except from a very thin surface layer.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{ratios of}} fusion to <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> power {{will likely be}} {{significantly}} lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that {{the energy of the}} fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by <b>Bremsstrahlung.</b> However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and will remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.|$|E
25|$|Photons from astrophysical {{sources that}} carry {{energy in the}} gamma {{radiation}} range are often explicitly called gamma-radiation. In addition to nuclear emissions, they are often produced by sub-atomic particle and particle-photon interactions. Those include electron-positron annihilation, neutral pion decay, <b>bremsstrahlung,</b> inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bremsstrahlung</b> {{emitted from}} plasma is {{sometimes}} referred to as free/free radiation. This refers {{to the fact that the}} radiation in this case is created by charged particles that are free; i.e., not part of an ion, atom or molecule, both before and after the deflection (acceleration) that caused the emission.|$|E
25|$|So the {{resulting}} output of a tube {{consists of a}} continuous <b>bremsstrahlung</b> spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes range from roughly 20 kV to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 keV to 150 keV.|$|E
25|$|The ions {{undergoing}} fusion in many {{systems will}} essentially never occur alone {{but will be}} mixed with electrons that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk electrical charge and form a plasma. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable {{to or greater than}} that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit x-ray radiation of 10–30 keV energy, a process known as <b>Bremsstrahlung.</b>|$|E
25|$|Broadly speaking, <b>bremsstrahlung</b> or braking {{radiation}} is any radiation produced {{due to the}} deceleration (negative acceleration) of a charged particle, which includes synchrotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a relativistic particle), cyclotron radiation (i.e. photon emission by a non-relativistic particle), and the emission of electrons and positrons during beta decay. However, the term is frequently used in the more narrow sense of radiation from electrons (from whatever source) slowing in matter.|$|E
25|$|Extraterrestrial, {{high energy}} gamma rays include the gamma ray {{background}} produced when cosmic rays (either high speed electrons or protons) collide with ordinary matter, producing pair-production gamma rays at 511 keV. Alternatively, <b>bremsstrahlung</b> are produced at energies {{of tens of}} MeV or more when cosmic ray electrons interact with nuclei of sufficiently high atomic number (see gamma ray image of the Moon {{at the beginning of}} this article, for illustration).|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{detector}} All plasma loses {{energy by}} emitting light. This covers the whole spectrum: visible, IR, UV, and X-rays. This occurs anytime a particle changes speed, for any reason. If {{the reason is}} deflection by a magnetic field, the radiation is Cyclotron radiation at low speeds and Synchrotron radiation at high speeds. If the reason is deflection by another particle, plasma radiates X-rays, known as <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> radiation. X-rays are termed in both hard and soft, based on their energy.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Cherenkov {{radiation}} at superluminal {{speed of}} any particle (protons, electrons, neutrinos) having a charge structure. In this case, emission of <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> can occur, until the particle falls below threshold and subluminal speed is reached again. This {{is similar to}} the known Cherenkov radiation in media, in which particles are traveling faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium. Deviations from the limiting velocity can be constrained by observing high energy particles of distant astronomic sources that reach Earth.|$|E
25|$|The Z-machine at Sandia National Laboratory, a z-pinch device, {{can produce}} ion {{energies}} {{of interest to}} hydrogen–boron reactions, up to 300 keV. Non-equilibrium plasmas usually have an electron temperature higher than their ion temperature, but the plasma in the Z machine has a special, reverted non-equilibrium state, in which the ion temperature is 100 times higher than electron temperature. These data represent a new research field, and indicate that <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> losses could be in fact lower than previously expected in such a design.|$|E
25|$|Deceleration {{of a free}} charged particle, such as an electron, {{can produce}} visible radiation: {{cyclotron}} radiation, synchrotron radiation, and <b>bremsstrahlung</b> radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster {{than the speed of}} light in that medium can produce visible Cherenkov radiation. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by chemoluminescence. In living things, this process is called bioluminescence. For example, fireflies produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.|$|E
25|$|The terms atomic battery, nuclear {{battery and}} {{radioisotope}} battery are used interchangeably {{to describe a}} device which uses the radioactive decay to generate electricity. These systems use radioisotopes that produce low energy beta particles or sometimes alpha particles of varying energies. Low energy beta particles are needed to prevent the production of high energy penetrating <b>bremsstrahlung</b> radiation that would require heavy shielding. Radioisotopes such as plutonium-238, curium-242, curium-244 and strontium-90 have been used. Tritium, nickel-63, promethium-147, and technetium-99 have been tested.|$|E
25|$|Also {{indirect}} {{constraints on}} neutrino velocity, {{on the basis}} of effective field theories such as SME, can be achieved by searching for threshold effects such as Vacuum Cherenkov radiation. For example, neutrinos should exhibit <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> in the form of electron-positron pair production. Another possibility in the same framework is the investigation of the decay of pions into muons and neutrinos. Superluminal neutrinos would considerably delay those decay processes. The absence of those effects indicate tight limits for velocity differences between light and neutrinos.|$|E
25|$|Thunderstorms {{can produce}} a brief pulse of gamma {{radiation}} called a terrestrial gamma-ray flash. These gamma rays {{are thought to be}} produced by high intensity static electric fields accelerating electrons, which then produce gamma rays by <b>bremsstrahlung</b> as they collide with and are slowed by atoms in the atmosphere. Gamma rays up to 100 MeV can be emitted by terrestrial thunderstorms, and were discovered by space-borne observatories. This raises the possibility of health risks to passengers and crew on aircraft flying in or near thunderclouds.|$|E
25|$|The huge {{size of the}} Sun {{and stars}} means that the x-rays {{produced}} in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They {{are said to be}} opaque to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be optically thin for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, Bussard {{argued that}} the plasma had a {{different}} structure, temperature distribution and well profile. These characteristics have not been fully measured and {{are central to the}} device's feasibility. Bussard's calculations indicated that the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> losses would be much smaller. According to Bussard the high speed and therefore low cross section for Coulomb collisions of the ions in the core makes thermalizing collisions very unlikely, while the low speed at the rim means that thermalization there has almost no impact on ion velocity in the core. Bussard calculated that a polywell reactor with a radius of 1.5 meters would produce net power fusing deuterium.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} reactor designs, whether {{based on}} magnetic or inertial confinement, the <b>bremsstrahlung</b> can easily escape the plasma {{and is considered}} a pure energy loss term. The outlook would be more favorable if the plasma could reabsorb the radiation. Absorption occurs primarily via Thomson scattering on the electrons, which has a total cross section of σT = 6.65×10−29 m². In a 50–50 D-T mixture this corresponds {{to a range of}} 6.3 g/cm²./σT = 2.5×(1.67×10−24 g)/(6.65×10−25 cm²) = 6.28 g/cm² This is considerably higher than the Lawson criterion of ρR > 1g/cm², which is already difficult to attain, but might be achievable in inertial confinement systems.|$|E
25|$|Matter attenuates {{radiation}} in most cases, so placing any mass (e.g., lead, dirt, sandbags, vehicles) {{between humans}} and the source will reduce the radiation dose. This {{is not always the}} case, however; care should be taken when constructing shielding for a specific purpose. For example, although high atomic number materials are very effective in shielding photons, using them to shield beta particles may cause higher radiation exposure due to the production of <b>bremsstrahlung</b> x-rays, and hence low atomic number materials are recommended. Also, using material with a high neutron activation cross section to shield neutrons will result in the shielding material itself becoming radioactive and hence more dangerous than if it were not present.|$|E
25|$|Aneutronic fusion loses much of {{its energy}} as light. This energy results from the {{acceleration}} and deceleration of charged particles. These speed changes {{can be caused by}} <b>Bremsstrahlung</b> radiation or cyclotron radiation or synchrotron radiation or electric field interactions. The radiation can be estimated using the Larmor formula and comes in the X-ray, IR, UV and visible spectrum. Some of the energy radiated as X-rays may be converted directly to electricity. Because of the photoelectric effect, X-rays passing through an array of conducting foils transfer some of their energy to electrons, which can then be captured electrostatically. Since X-rays can go through far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.|$|E
25|$|The {{detailed}} analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular power spectrum, and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a map is in principle a simple Fourier transform, decomposing {{the map of the}} sky into spherical harmonics, in practice it is hard to take the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such as <b>Bremsstrahlung,</b> synchrotron, and dust that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed, resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed so as not to distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Several {{types of}} astrophysical objects emit, fluoresce, or reflect X-rays, from galaxy clusters, through black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) to galactic {{objects such as}} {{supernova}} remnants, stars, and binary stars containing a white dwarf (cataclysmic variable stars and super soft X-ray sources), neutron star or black hole (X-ray binaries). Some solar system bodies emit X-rays, the most notable being the Moon, {{although most of the}} X-ray brightness of the Moon arises from reflected solar X-rays. A combination of many unresolved X-ray sources is thought to produce the observed X-ray background. The X-ray continuum can arise from <b>bremsstrahlung,</b> black-body radiation, synchrotron radiation, or what is called inverse Compton scattering of lower-energy photons by relativistic electrons, knock-on collisions of fast protons with atomic electrons, and atomic recombination, with or without additional electron transitions.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} gamma rays on Earth are {{observed}} in the gamma decay of radionuclides and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. There are rare terrestrial natural sources, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, that produce gamma rays not of a nuclear origin. Additionally, gamma rays are produced {{by a number of}} astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary gamma rays via <b>bremsstrahlung,</b> inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation. However, a large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft. Gamma rays are produced by nuclear fusion in stars including the Sun (such as the CNO cycle), but are absorbed or inelastically scattered by the stellar material, reducing their energy, before escaping and are not observable from Earth as gamma rays.|$|E
