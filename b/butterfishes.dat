5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and <b>butterfishes.</b> However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the abundance, distribution, reproduction and feeding behaviour of the Odax pullus (<b>butterfish)</b> around the Kaikoura Peninsula. O. pullus {{is one of}} a small number of species of herbivorous fish inhabiting temperate marine waters and is one of only two herbivorous species that are widely distributed in New Zealand and extend their ranges into cold southern latitudes. In this study, the abundance of <b>butterfish</b> across habitats and depths, and associations with other mobile reef fish species, were examined monthly for thirteen months. This enabled a determination of the spatial and temporal variability of <b>butterfish</b> populations. Visual underwater transects at nine sites showed that <b>butterfish</b> were associated exclusively with habitats dominated by large brown algae, particularly Lessonia variegata, Marginariella boryana and Carpophyllum spp. Abundance declined during winter, probably because larger fish migrated into deeper reef habitats. Recruitment occurred during summer. <b>Butterfish</b> are wide-ranging along the patch reefs around Kaikoura and there were no marked differences in the depth distribution of the different ontogenetic stages. Histological examination of gonads was used to determine sex, minimum size to reproduction, reproductive seasonality and length of the spawning season. <b>Butterfish</b> are reproductive from July to December, with peak gonad ripeness occurring in, September and October. There was a clear separation between sizes of female and male fish. No individuals 380 mm SL contained both sperm and retained eggs. Nineteen female <b>butterfish</b> reached maturity at around 200 mm SL, which is smaller than found in earlier studies in the North Island. Scales and otoliths were used to estimate age. The number of distinct rings in these structures agreed well until the age six years, after which scales tended to under-estimate age. Despite the distinct size separation of female and male fish, the two sexes overlapped in ages over years 4 - 6. However, most of the oldest fish were males. <b>Butterfish</b> appear to be a fast-growing, relatively short-lived species that reaches a maximum age of around ten years. Very similar colour patterns of larger females and males indicated that visual sexing is often not accurate and, therefore, histological examination of the gonads is necessary to determine sex reliably, at least for larger individuals. Gut contents were analysed to determine the diet of <b>butterfish</b> and how it compared to findings of studies done in the North Island. The latitudinal change in the species mix of dominant large brown algae is reflected in the diet of O. pullus. Around Kaikoura, <b>butterfish</b> feed predominantly on the laminarian Lessonia variegata which is very abundant in subtidal habitats. <b>Butterfish</b> in northern New Zealand feed predominantly on Ecklonia radiata and Carpophyllum spp. This latitudinal diet shift indicates that <b>butterfish</b> are highly adaptable in their feeding habit. Furthermore, a small proportion of <b>butterfish</b> (6. 5 %) targeted salps in their feeding. The presence of animal material in the gut contents of herbivorous fish has usually been ascribed to incidental feeding, {{but it is clear that}} this feeding is both opportunistic and selective in <b>butterfish</b> populations around Kaikoura. Spawning and its associated behaviours were not seen during this study, probably because they occur either in open water or else on deeper reefs. However, the sex distribution in Odax pullus indicates that this species has a complex social system and there is clear evidence of male territoriality during the reproductive period. There is considerable fishing pressure on <b>butterfish</b> populations around Kaikoura, which targets mostly larger fish. Despite this, the populations around Kaikoura seem to be robust. <b>Butterfish</b> have only a moderate life span for an inshore fish, but there are many juveniles in the local populations, indicating that there was successful recruitment for at least a few years...|$|R

40|$|The {{domestic}} <b>butterfish</b> (Peprilus triacanthus) fishery off the Northeast USA {{has increased}} in importance in recent years, {{to the extent that}} the quantity allocated to foreign countries fishing within USA waters has been decreased to by-catch levels. This restriction resulted in closure of a portion of the foreign squid fishery in 1985, when the by-catch quota for <b>butterfish</b> was exceeded. This analysis is designed to determine co-occurrence between long-finned squid (Loligo pea/ei) and <b>butterfish</b> particularly in directed fisheries for each species with a view that areal, diel, and/or seasonal regulations of these fisheries may be feasible to reduce the potential adverse effects of high by-catch rates. Squid and <b>butterfish</b> exhibited high degrees of overlap in temperature and depth preferences as indicated by seasonal and spatial distribution data from research and fishery sources. Commer-cial fishery data, however, suggested that by-catch of <b>butterfish</b> in the directed squid fishery can be maintained at relatively low levels (~ 6 %), when the fishery was prosecuted offshore during the winter. The domestic USA fishery, operating with effort directed at either species at various times of the year, has not been limited as to by-catch of either species. If a need develops, it is likely that seasonal and areal management measures could result in significant reductions in the by-catch of either species...|$|R

40|$|Allegations {{of growth}} {{overfishing}} of the already depleted snapper (Pagrus auratus) stock in Denham Sound, Shark Bay, Western Australia, due to prawn trawling, and concerns for by-catch species generally, {{led to the}} investigation of size-related catchability and cod-end selectivity of juvenile snapper and western <b>butterfish</b> (Pentapodus vitta). The cod-end selectivity of prawn trawling was investigated by fitting a fine-mesh cod-end cover to commercial trawl nets to measure the size of fish passing through the cod-end. A Leslie-Delury depletion experiment involving trawling the same area over four consecutive nights {{was used to determine}} the catchability coefficients of snapper and <b>butterfish.</b> The size of snapper and <b>butterfish</b> caught on the trawlable grounds ranged from 3 to 18 and 5 to 20 cm fork length (FL), respectively. Ontogenetic changes in habitat preference meant that snapper were susceptible to commercial trawling only between approximately 9 - 17 months of age. Retention of snapper and <b>butterfish</b> in the trawl nets increased with increasing length, with the deeper-bodied snapper retained at smaller lengths. Catchability coefficients also increased with fish length. A single trawl pass was estimated to remove up to 57 % and 52 % of juvenile snapper and <b>butterfish,</b> respectively. The rate of natural mortality (M) for juvenile snapper was estimated to be high; mean M = 2. 58 (92 % year- 1). Catchability of <b>butterfish</b> was low prior to their sexual maturation and trawling is assessed not to be a threat to this species. To reduce the impact of prawn trawling on snapper recruitment in Denham Sound, restricting trawling from areas where juvenile snapper are in high abundance, combined with fish escape panels, would be preferable to increasing mesh size in commercial trawl gear...|$|R
50|$|Opahs closely {{resemble}} in shape the unrelated <b>butterfish</b> (family Stromateidae). Both have falcated (curved) pectoral fins and forked, emarginated(notched) caudal fins. Aside from being significantly larger than <b>butterfish,</b> opahs have enlarged, falcated pelvic fins with about 14 to 17 rays, which distinguish them from superficially similar carangids—positioned thoracically; adult <b>butterfish</b> lack pelvic fins. The pectorals of opahs are also inserted (more or less) horizontally rather than vertically. The anterior portion of an opah's single dorsal fin (with about 50-55 rays) is greatly elongated, {{also in a}} falcated profile similar to the pelvic fins. The anal fin (around 34 to 41 rays) is about as high {{and as long as}} the shorter portion of the dorsal fin, and both fins have corresponding grooves into which they can be depressed.|$|R
40|$|The Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, {{our client}} for this masters project, is {{evaluating}} {{how best to}} transition from a primarily single-species management approach to an integrated multi-species management paradigm. In this connection, we explore how economic considerations may be incorporated into an integrated multi-species management approach by focusing on two closely associated stocks managed by the Council: longfin squid and Atlantic <b>butterfish.</b> We take several different approaches in our analysis of the two fisheries, our ultimate objectives being (i) to characterize {{the behavior of the}} fleets based upon historical landings data and geospatial analysis; and (ii) to provide the Council with insight into the potential impact of management constraints and ecosystem interactions on economic benefits in the fisheries. To illustrate potential impacts to economic benefits, we develop a two-species bioeconomic model and derive optimal harvest levels for the stocks, taking into account varying degrees of management constraints and ecosystem interactions. Based upon our analysis of landings data, we found that the Council’s allocation of the longfin squid landings quota among trimester management periods is no longer representative of actual landings in the fishery throughout the year. As a result, there is potential that the fishery may be forced to close prematurely in the summer months, thereby reducing economic benefits to participants who are highly dependent on revenues from the fishery. We also found, based upon our geospatial analysis of <b>butterfish</b> landings and <b>butterfish</b> bycatch in the longfin squid fishery, that a statistically significant correlation exists between the distance to shore from the point of catch and the <b>butterfish</b> bycatch rate. With respect to the model, we explored the importance of three parameters not generally included in a single-species model: predation, bycatch by fishermen, and benefits to the longfin squid population of additional <b>butterfish.</b> We found that all three have potential economic impacts. We also found that the amount of the total allowable catch of <b>butterfish</b> allocated to a bycatch cap imposed on the longfin squid fishery is higher than necessary to prevent early closure of the longfin squid fishery and could result in lost revenues in the <b>butterfish</b> fishery...|$|R
