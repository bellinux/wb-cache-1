5|$|Ash died in 1887, and the United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations (now called The Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations) began {{a search}} for a successor, to serve as rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol and as Chief Rabbi of New York City. This search was opposed by Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes, of Congregation Shearith Israel. Mendes felt that the money and energy would be better spent on {{supporting}} the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), which he had co-founded with Sabato Morais in 1886. In his view, training American-born rabbis at the Seminary would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> effective means of fighting the growing strength of American Reform Judaism: these native English-speaking rabbis would appeal to the younger generation far more than imported, Yiddish-speaking ones.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{preparing}} and filing all business and {{personal income tax}} returns {{is estimated to be}} $250–$300 billion each year. Approximately {{the same amount of money}} was estimated for calculating the tax implications of business decisions. That means approximately $500 to $600 billion was spent in the process of collecting roughly four times as much in taxes. According to a 2005 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the efficiency cost of the current tax system—the output that is lost over and above the tax itself—is between $240 billion and $600 billion every year. Supporters argue that the FairTax system would reduce these compliance and efficiency costs by 90% and return a larger share of that money to the productive economy. With the FairTax system, the cost of compliance would be built into the tax by allowing the business and the State to keep 1/4 of 1% of taxes collected. A 2007 study by the Beacon Hill Institute found that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> efficient taxation system from the point of view of the administration, collection, and filing costs.|$|E
25|$|Going {{into the}} 2005 Ashes series having not won since the 1980s {{but with an}} unbeaten series record going back six series it was a highly {{anticipated}} series with Australian captain Ricky Ponting predicting {{it to be the}} closest Ashes since England's last win. Seemingly the pressure affected Strauss even at Lord's, {{along with the rest of}} the team, as he contributed 2 to their 190 and a slightly more impressive 37 to their 180 in a losing first Test, though Strauss did catch Ponting in the first innings. The second Test proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> dramatic affair and Strauss improved somewhat on his showing at Lord's with an opening stand of 112 opposite Trescothick, falling two short of a half century to the spin of Shane Warne. While this healthy platform pushed England towards a 99 run lead in the first innings, it was Strauss' paltry second innings of six which garnered more attention: four deliveries before the end of play on day two a Warne legbreak spun prodigiously from the rough across Strauss' body to knock down leg stump. Those six runs are arguably crucial though, as England's winning margin was simply two runs. The number six would follow him into the next Test at Old Trafford, making way for Vaughan to bat the first century of the series. Strauss followed in his captain's footsteps in the second innings adding 106 of his own to help set a target of 371 for the Australians who managed to stave off losing their final wicket to secure a draw and maintain a 1–1 series score.|$|E

[...] Chronicles of Chaos also praised its concept, and {{went on to say that}} it might be one of the best albums in the band's discography, Alternative Press and Q each complimented the album's production, while Billboard highlighted the album's lyrical content and Manson's [...] "diatribes on religion, sex and prejudice."

500|$|The Naval Institute's Proceedings {{magazine}} devoted {{space in}} two of its 1902 issues to possible improvements in battleship design. The first article was authored by Lieutenant Matt H.

This paper provoked enough thought that Proceedings published comments on the story from Captain William M. Folger, Professor P.R. Alger and naval constructor David W. Taylor—an up-and-coming officer and future head of the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C). These comments expressed doubt that the proposed vessel could be modified into a feasible design, but they praised his thoughts as {{a step in the}} right direction. Alger believed that Signor was on the right track in suggesting larger armament, though he thought that triple turrets would be unworkable and eight 12-inch guns in four twin turrets would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> realistic arrangement.

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{wrote that}} [...] "The Open Door is a muddle of affections.

Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called the album [...] "less fun", [...] and {{said some of the}} songs are similar to each other. St. Louis Post-Dispatchs Sara Berry critiqued, [...] " [...] sound remains essentially the same: the strange but amicable marriage of churning guitar riffs to lead singer Amy Lee's silky soprano". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called the album a 45-minute [...] "romantic piece" [...] and said, [...] "if [...] featured more open-throated crooning and less teeth-gritting anger it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> interesting record". She also added that the sound of the album gets [...] "black and blacker" [...] and, [...] "Lyrics tend toward repetition of words like 'darkness,' 'haunting,' and 'rage'". Christa Titus of Billboard called it a [...] "far more nuanced, moody and richly textured effort" [...] than Fallen. Postmedia News gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "While it's similar in style and sound to its predecessor, The Open Door loses the punchy power rifts and instead persuades the listener with piano and airy vocals". Andre Farias of Christianity Today admitted that [...] "The sound is loud, yes, but it's almost indistinguishable from its predecessor—a disappointment considering the opus was nearly three-and-a-half years in the making".|$|E
500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla {{with the idea of}} exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so you have to be very careful".|$|E
