This paper discusses joint activities {{over the past year}} among Norwegian, Russian, and U. S. technical experts on solid radioactive waste storage technologies in the Arctic for the Russian Navy. These are Western as well as Russian developments and will facilitate meeting the Russian Navy’s needs for storing solid radioactive waste from decommissioned nuclear submarines. The first <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> multiple-use steel <b>containers</b> for transportation and storage of solid radioactive waste have been fabricated at a Russian shipyard and work on the second batch is in process. The partners are also working on single-use concrete containers for transportation and long-term storage, lightweight modular storage buildings, and Russian-made radiation monitoring equipment for use in waste storage facilities. All work is directed at applications in northwest Russia where the Russian Navy is decommissioning large numbers of nuclear submarines and accumulating large amounts of solid radioactive waste. The mission of AMEC Project 1. 4 is to improve the Russian Navy’s capabilities in solid radioactive waste storage and thus minimize the spread of radiological contamination. The ultimate goal of this project is a safe, secure...|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} {{model to}} be presented is typically applicable to the batch processing industry where a <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> product is blended and subsequently packaged into various types <b>of</b> <b>containers.</b> When a product is packaged into more than one type container immediately after its manufacture, these items {{are said to be}} jointly replenished. In the case of joint replenishment, the economic lot size for each item cannot be determined without considering the rest of the items within the group. This is so because each time a <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> a product is made, there is a primary set-up cost for the manufacture of the product and a secondary set-up cost for each of the items to be packaged within the jointly replenished group. If the packaging set-up costs are very high, it may be more economical to package certain "slow moving" items less often than the "fast moving items. " Specifically, one could package a "slow moving" item once every other time or every third time a <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> product is made. An analytical model has been developed to provide a set of criteria which one can use as a basis for applying "skipping rules" to the slow moving item within a jointly replenished group. ...|$|R
