5|$|An {{anonymous}} chronicler at Bury St Edmunds, {{working in}} the second quarter of the 12th century, produced a compilation now known as The Annals of St Neots. He used material from a version of Asser's work which differs in some places from the Cotton manuscript and in some places appears to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate,</b> so it is possible that the copy used was not the Cotton manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate,</b> and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
5|$|Along with Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus is {{considered}} one of the most valuable manuscripts for establishing the original text (textual criticism) of the Greek New Testament, as well as the Septuagint. It is the only uncial manuscript with the complete text of the New Testament, and the only ancient manuscript of the New Testament written in four columns per page which has survived to the present day. With only 300 years separating the Codex Sinaiticus and the proposed lifetime of Jesus, it {{is considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> than most later New Testament copies in preserving superior readings where many later manuscripts are in error.|$|E

5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|During the Yayoi {{period from}} about 300BC to 300AD, iron tools and weapons such as knives, axes, swords or spears, were {{introduced}} to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula. Shortly after this event, Chinese, Korean, and eventually Japanese swordsmiths produced ironwork locally. Swords were forged to imitate Chinese blades: generally straight chokutō with faulty tempering. Worn slung from the waist, they were likely used as stabbing and slashing weapons. Although functionally it would generally <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> to define them as hacking rather than slashing weapons. Swordmaking centers developed in Yamato, San'in and Mutsu where various types of blades such as tsurugi, tōsu and tachi were produced. Flat double-edged (hira-zukuri) blades originated in the Kofun period, and around the mid-Kofun period swords evolved from thrusting to cutting weapons. Ancient swords were also religious objects according to the 8th century chronicles Nihon Shoki and Kojiki. In fact, one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan is a sword, and swords have been discovered in ancient tumuli or handed down as treasures of Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples. Few ancient blades (jokotō) exist because the iron has been corroded by humidity.|$|E
5|$|No formula could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> {{than the}} values put into it; the {{values for the}} cross {{sections}} were dubious, and {{had not yet been}} determined for plutonium. Measurement of these values would be a priority, but the laboratory possessed just 1 gram of uranium-235, and only a few micrograms of plutonium. This task fell to Bacher's P Division. Williams P-2 (Electrostatic Generator) Group carried out the first experiment in July 1943, when it used the larger of the two Van de Graaff generators to measure the ratio of the neutron per fission in plutonium against that of uranium-235. This involved some negotiation with the Metallurgical Laboratory to obtain 165 μg of plutonium, which was received at Los Alamos on 10 July 1943. Bacher was able to report that the number of neutrons per fission of plutonium-239 was 2.64 ± 0.2, about 1.2 times as much as uranium-235. Titterton and Boyce McDaniel of Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group attempted to measure the time it took for prompt neutrons to be emitted from a uranium-235 nucleus when it fissions. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too. Confirmation of the theorists' contention that the number of neutrons emitted per fission was the same for both fast and slow neutrons took longer, and was not completed until the autumn of 1944.|$|E

25|$|Digital {{electronics}} helped too. Former analogue-based instrumentation {{was replaced}} by digital equivalents which can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> and flexible, and offer greater scope for more sophisticated configuration, parametrization and operation. This was accompanied by the fieldbus revolution which provided a networked (i.e. a single cable) means of communicating between control systems and field level instrumentation, eliminating hard-wiring.|$|E
25|$|Fermi {{estimates}} generally {{work because}} the estimations {{of the individual}} terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help cancel each other out.

25|$|The words pedophile and pedophilia are {{commonly}} used informally to describe an adult's sexual interest in pubescent or post-pubescent teenagers. The terms hebephilia or ephebophilia may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> in these cases. This was especially seen {{in the case of}} Mark Foley during the congressional page incident. Most of the media labeled Foley a pedophile, which led David Tuller of Slate magazine to state that Foley was not a pedophile but rather an ephebophile.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{is often}} {{described}} as a characteristic of A-T. Whereas this is certainly the case for the mouse model of A-T, in humans it may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> to characterize the reproductive abnormality as gonadal atrophy or dysgenesis characterized by delayed pubertal development. Because programmed DSBs are generated to initiate genetic recombinations involved in the production of sperm and eggs in reproductive organs (a process known as meiosis), meiotic defects and arrest can occur when ATM is not present.|$|E
25|$|The {{two methods}} {{needed to be}} {{reconciled}} and {{at the start of}} his work Rocque relied too much on his ground surveys, only to find they were not in agreement with triangulation.

Triangulation tends to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> on the larger scale and in the City the dual approach was very successful but in rural areas there were too few prominent landmarks for triangulation to be effective.|$|E

25|$|Although {{his work}} is our most {{reliable}} source {{for the history of}} his era, its factual accuracy is occasionally questioned. The Annals are based in part on secondary sources, and there are some obvious mistakes, for instance the confusion of the two daughters of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor, who are both called Antonia. The Histories, however, are written from primary documents and intimate knowledge of the Flavian period, and are therefore thought to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kalman filtering, {{also known}} as linear {{quadratic}} estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>accurate</b> than those based on a single measurement alone, by using Bayesian inference and estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, {{one of the primary}} developers of its theory.|$|E
25|$|Objective tests assume {{personality}} is consciously accessible {{and that it}} can be measured by self-report questionnaires.

Issues with these tests include false reporting because {{there is no way to}} tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.|$|E
