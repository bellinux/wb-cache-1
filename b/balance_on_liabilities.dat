40|$|This paper reexamines Japanfs {{experience}} of the quantitative easing policy (QEP) {{in light of the}} policy responses against the recent financial and economic crisis. Central banks use various unconventional measures in the range of financial assets being purchased and in the scale of such purchases. As the scope of such unconventional measures expands, it is often emphasized that the U. S. Federal Reserve policy reactions focus more on the asset side of its balance sheet, the so- called credit easing. By contrast, the Bank of Japanfs QEP from 2001 to 2006 set a target for the current account <b>balances,</b> <b>on</b> the <b>liability</b> side of its balance sheet. It is crucial to understand that central banks combine the two elements of their balance sheets, size and composition, to enhance the overall effects of unconventional policy measures, given constraints on policy implementation.

40|$|Efforts {{to control}} {{environmental}} tobacco smoke (ETS) could be assisted if the tobacco control movement gave greater emphasis {{to the issue of}} individual rights. Benefits that may accrue from the promotion of a clear individual rights perspective in tobacco control include adding coherence to the tobacco control advocacy agenda and winning support from those who may have been concerned about loss of personal freedom, excessive governmental power, use of social coercion, or the rights of smokers. Risks also attend to such a policy. It might inadvertently assist the tobacco industry, stir resistance to ETS limitation efforts, or confuse tobacco control supporters. <b>On</b> <b>balance,</b> though, <b>liabilities</b> are outweighed by the ethical and operational merits in tobacco control of a heightened pro-individual rights stance...|$|R

40|$|Background Few studies {{examining}} the genetic architecture of cigarette smoking {{have focused on}} adolescents or examined developmental changes in additive genetic, shared environment and unique environmental influences <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to initiate cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked. The {{aim of this study}} is to add to the literature <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to initiate and use cigarettes during adolescence using a nationally representative sample. Method Data for this study came from adolescent and young adult twin pairs (ages 14 - 33) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We ran a series of developmental causal-contingent-common pathway models to examine whether additive genetic, shared and unique environmental influences <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to the initiation of cigarette use are shared with those on smoking quantity, and whether their contributions change across development. Results We found evidence for a developmental shift in genetic and shared environmental contributions to cigarette use. Early in adolescence genetic and environmental influences work independently <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> to cigarette smoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes smoked, but liability to these behaviors becomes correlated as individuals age into young adulthood. Conclusions These findings provide insight into the causal processes underlying the liability to smoke cigarettes. With age, there is greater overlap in the genetic and environmental factors that influence the initiation of cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the impact on}} management discretion {{about the use of}} present value for the purpose of fair value measurement <b>on</b> <b>liabilities.</b> <b>On</b> discussing above the subject, I focused on SFAS No. 143 : Asset Retirement Obligations, which is first statement about fair value measurement <b>on</b> <b>liability</b> when SFAC No. 7 : Using Cash Flow Information and Present Value in Accounting Measurements was published. As to fair value measurement <b>on</b> <b>liabilities,</b> the use of present value will be expected to facilitate decision usefulness because of improving reality on stock and avoid recognizing unrealized profit. In consideration of the characteristics of event that creates asset retirement obligations, there are conceptually two types of obligations, which are incurred upon acquisition, or any time during the operating life of an asset, either ratably of nonratably. As practical problem, however it is difficult to identify them separately. Therefore, it is necessary to management judgments. It has been seemed that fair value measurement eliminate management discretion. But, in the sense of recognition of liabilities reflected the incurrence situation, and thus, if the quality and transparency of financial reporting will be improved, it will be the space of management discretion in present value measurement as fair value...|$|R
