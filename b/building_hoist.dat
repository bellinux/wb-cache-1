40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{apartments in}} major Scandinavian cities. At the same time, there is a general opinion in media that the costs for housing {{production}} are too high. Studies indicate that waste, in the lean perspective, is in the range of 30 - 35 % of the project cost, excluding costs for land. Among initiatives for reducing waste are tools to prevent waste in material flows. This paper presents a case study in which a logistics company, a medium-sized contractor and a material supplier collaborated to develop tools for improving the material flow on the construction site. Initially, nine tools used for preventing waste in material flow is presented; logistic analysis, demand profile, process map, specifications for <b>building</b> <b>hoist,</b> delivery plan, responsibility during material handling, location in apartments, quantification of materials and control of deliveries. Then, each tool is evaluated concerning what kind of waste is reduced. Examples from a residential building project with 163 apartments are given. The costs associated with enhanced material logistics in this specific project were approximately SEK 130 per m 2, which is equal to RMB 115 per m 2. This covers the enhanced handling of 80 % of the materials. It’s expected within the case project that enhanced logistics with support by the nine tools has a potential of giving a 2 - 5 times return on the investment. The conclusion is that material logistics requires good planning and structure in order to be effective and succeed in minimizing waste...|$|E

50|$|Some {{members also}} {{have their own}} rules {{regarding}} the use of the flag alongside their national flag on domestic occasions, for example the obligatory use alongside national flags outside police stations or local government buildings.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the problem of geotechnics. The problems of the weak soil base are topical. Also there sometimes happen severe accidents of soil mass. A great number of such emergencies is of a progressive character, when a local crash leads to the crash of the whole construction. Tarring the soil with epoxy can ensure geotechnical safety of the basis. That’s why the improvement of this method is needed in order to reduce yielding of the base, create ground water cutoff or create <b>building</b> <b>hoisting.</b> In the article new structural solutions for reduction of settlement are presented. The authors suggest using the manufactured plane elements containing epoxy. Such elements have different sizes and lie underneath the foundation. Similar structural scheme can be used to reduce soil settlement. The authors carried out two series of plate-bearing model tests with manufactured plane epoxy elements. In the first series of tests the biggest element was closer to the foundation, the smallest element was closer to the biggest element. In the second series of tests the smallest element was closer to the foundation, the biggest element was closer to the smallest element. After the end of plate-bearing model tests the authors received values of the base settlement and the dependency diagrams “base settlement-soil pressure”. The new structural solution for reducing soil settlement proved to be effective. Settlement of base decreased sevenfold...|$|R

Because of the advent of these practices, modern roundhouses are frequently not round and are simply large buildings used for servicing locomotives.

The alternative term engine-house encompasses both semi-circular and rectangular structures and broadly describes all buildings intended for storage and servicing of locomotives. Shops or workshops are <b>buildings</b> containing <b>hoists</b> and heavy machinery capable of major repairs beyond routine servicing. Some roundhouses include shop facilities internally or in adjoining buildings.|$|R
