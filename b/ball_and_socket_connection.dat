5000|$|A trailer coupler is used {{to secure}} the trailer to the towing vehicle. The trailer coupler {{attaches}} to the trailer ball. This forms a <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>connection</b> to allow for relative movement between the towing vehicle and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. The trailer ball is mounted to the rear bumper or to a draw bar, which may be removable. The draw bar is secured to the trailer hitch by inserting it into the hitch receiver and pinning it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull hitches and draw bars can exert tremendous leverage on the tow vehicle making it harder to recover from a swerving situation.|$|E

Posey employs a <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>connection</b> that allows users to move the parts of an assembled model. Hubs and struts are optocoupled in the ball and socket joints using infrared LEDs and phototransistors. Wireless transmitters in the hubs send connection and geometry information to a host computer. The host computer assembles {{a representation of the}} physical model as the user creates and configures it. This representation can then be used by application programs to control models in particular domains. ACM Classification Keyword...|$|E
40|$|Lens {{tissue from}} a Morgagni {{cataract}} was examined by SEM and TEM. For SEM, after prefixation with glutaraldehyde and postfixation with the tannic acid/arginine/OsO 4 non-coating (TAO) technique, and for TEM, after prefixation with glutaraldehyde, postfixation with OsO 4 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 and poststaining with uranyl acetate/lead citrate. The TAO technique {{seems to be}} a particularly suitable postfixation method for the SEM investigation of cararact tissue {{because of the presence of}} the protein structures present. The cortical region showed areas of radially, instead of concentrically, arranged lens fibres, degenerated lens fibres with holes (vacuoles), broken <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>connections</b> between the lens fibres, and oval or spherical structures varying in size from 0. 5 - 20 mum, the largest resembling a golfball, arising from the cytoplasm of degenerating lens fibres.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{components}} subjected to contact stress as local compressive stress {{is important in}} engineering application especially in <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> Joining. Two kinds of contact stress are introduced in the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joint, the first is from normal contact while the other is from sliding contact. Although joining two long links (drive shaft in steering cars) will cause the effect of flexural and tensional buckling stress in hollow columns through the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> ends on the failure condition of the joining mechanism. In this paper the consideration of the combined effect of buckling Load and contact stress on the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> joints have been taken, epically on the stress distribution in the contact area. Different parameters have been taken {{in the design of}} joint. This is done by changing the angles for applied loads with the principle axis, the angle of contact between <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>and</b> using different applied loads. The problem has been solved using analytical solution for computing the critical loads and using these loads for calculating the stress distribution with finite element method using ANSYS 10. The numerical results have been compared with the experimental method using photo elasticity pattern which shows good agreement between experimental and simulation results...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} stress patterns generated within implant-supported mandibular overdentures retained by two different attachment types: <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>and</b> locator attachments. Materials and methods: Commercial CAD/CAM and {{finite element analysis}} software packages were utilized to construct two 3 D finite element models for the two attachment types. Unilateral masticatory compressive loads of 50, 100, and 150 Â N were applied vertically to the overdentures, parallel to the longitudinal axes of the implants. Loads were directed toward the central fossa in the molar region of each overdenture, that linear static analysis was carried out to find the generated stresses and deformation on {{each part of the}} studied model. Results: According to FEA results the ball attachment neck is highly stressed in comparison to the locator one. On the other hand mucosa and cortical bone received less stresses under <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> attachment. Conclusions: Locator <b>and</b> <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> attachments induce equivalent stresses on bone surrounding implants. Locator attachment performance was superior to that of the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> attachment in the implants, nylon caps, and overdenture. Locator attachments are highly recommended and can increase the interval between successive maintenance sessions...|$|R
