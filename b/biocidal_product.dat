50|$|A <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> is a {{substance}} intending to destroy, deter, render harmless, prevent the action of, or exert a controlling effect on any harmful organism {{by any means}} other than mere physical or mechanical action. These products are highly regulated because of health and performance concerns. They first have to be legally regulated, and all products or substances on the market {{also have to be}} tested and certified in order to ensure their compliance with current directives and regulations.|$|E
50|$|When {{discussing}} biocides {{a distinction}} {{should be made}} between the biocidal active substance and the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The biocidal active substances are mostly chemical compounds, but can also be microorganisms (e.g. bacteria). Biocidal products contain one or more biocidal active substances and may contain other non-active co-formulants that ensure the effectiveness {{as well as the}} desired pH, viscosity, colour, odour, etc. of the final product. Biocidal products are available on the market for use by professional and/or non-professional consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{most of the}} {{biocidal}} {{active substances}} have a relative high toxicity, there are also examples of active substances with low toxicity, such as , which exhibit their biocidal activity only under certain specific conditions such as in closed systems. In such cases, the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> is {{the combination of the}} active substance and the device that ensures the intended biocidal activity, i.e. suffocation of rodents by [...] in a closed system trap. Another example of biocidal products available to consumers are products impregnated with biocides (also called treated articles), such as clothes and wristbands impregnated with insecticides, socks impregnated with antibacterial substances etc.|$|E
50|$|The Biocides Work Area {{provided}} {{scientific and}} technical support for the approval of active substances in <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> as laid down in Directive 98/8/EC (<b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive, BPD) concerning the placing of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> on the market. Currently, these tasks are dealt with by the biocides group within the IHCP. From 2013, coinciding with the coming-into-force of a new <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR), the European Chemicals Agency ECHA will take over the biocides' program.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> such as wood {{preservatives}} and film preservatives in facade coatings, are submitted to a detailed environmental risk assessment under the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (EU) No 528 / 2012. Laboratory leaching tests for <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> that are based either on constant or intermittent water contact, as well as semi-field tests, are listed in a guidance document of the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA. These tests also apply to <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> that are included in construction products [33].|$|R
30|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can be {{sources of}} active {{substances}} in surface waters caused by weathering of treated articles. Marketing {{and use of}} <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can be limited according to the European <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation if unacceptable risks to the environment are expected. Leaching of active substances from treated articles was observed in field experiments to obtain information on leaching processes and investigate the suitability of a proposed test method.|$|R
5000|$|The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC or SmPC) is a {{specific}} document required within the European Commission before any medicinal product or <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> is authorized for marketing. This document is required under {{a number of different}} European Regulations, e.g. Regulations concerning medicines and Regulations concerning biocidal products. Depending on which Regulation this document is required under the fields contained in the summary may vary. However, in general this summary is the definitive description of the product both in terms of its properties, chemical, hazardardous properties, pharmacological and pharmaceutical etc. and the clinical use or industrial use to which it can put. The EU provide [...] on the use of this document for applicants.|$|E
30|$|CA and IA both {{link the}} {{toxicity}} of individual components (active ingredients, substances of concern, co-formulants) {{to the overall}} toxicity of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The major advantage of such methods is their easy adaptability to different exposure situations, e.g. when the chemical composition of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> changes. They substantially decrease the biotest demands of new biocidal products if they use known active ingredients and/or co-formulants. Similar to the direct testing of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> for its long-term effects, also the modeling of long-term effects in the environment depends on a sound and complete definition of the underlying exposure scenario.|$|E
30|$|Obviously, if toxic {{compounds}} are {{not considered}} in a component based assessment, the calculated risk will be an underestimation of the actual risk of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product,</b> see[25]. It is, however, impossible to provide a general estimate {{of the magnitude of}} such an underestimation, as this depends on the concentration and ecotoxicological potency of the compounds that are erroneously not included in the assessment. Therefore, special care has to be taken to ensure that all toxic ingredients are included in a component-based assessment of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
50|$|Humans may {{be exposed}} to <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> in {{different}} ways in both occupational and domestic settings. Many <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are intended for industrial sectors or professional uses only, whereas other <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are commonly available for private use by non-professional users. In addition, potential exposure of non-users of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> (i.e. the general public) may occur indirectly via the environment, for example through drinking water, the food chain, {{as well as through}} atmospheric and residential exposure. Particular attention should be paid to the exposure of vulnerable sub-populations, such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Also pets and other domestic animals can be exposed indirectly following the application of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, exposure to biocides may vary in terms of route (inhalation, dermal contact, and ingestion) and pathway (food, drinking water, residential, occupational) of exposure, level, frequency and duration.|$|R
30|$|Earlier in 2012 the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers {{adopted the}} new {{regulation}} (EU) No 528 / 2012 on the authorization of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> (BPR)[1]. It will apply from 1 September 2013 and will replace and repeal the BPD and will implement a new EU-wide, harmonized {{system for the}} authorization for <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> This system will be applied for low-risk <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> and products that have similar use conditions throughout the EU. All other <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are expected to still be subject to authorization by the individual member states. The BPR provisions will also apply to existing active substances being evaluated under the BPD review program.|$|R
30|$|Marketing {{and use of}} <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> can {{be limited}} {{according}} to the European <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR) [7] if unacceptable risks to the environment are expected. However, restrictions depend on reliable knowledge on the expected release into the environment.|$|R
30|$|Any {{component}} based {{approach requires}} that all “relevant” compounds {{are included in}} the assessment, i.e. biologically active chemicals that are present at sufficiently high concentrations. Within the framework of biocide legislation such compounds are termed “substances of concern”, i.e. constituents of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> other than the active ingredient that have “an inherent capacity to cause an adverse effect on humans, animals or the environment” ([1], Art 2 e). If no ecotoxicological information is at hand for such ingredients, the only risk assessment option is the direct biotesting of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> or the resulting environmental mixture, respectively.|$|E
3000|$|Biocidal {{products}} are usually multi-component mixtures {{of one or}} more active substances plus a range of co-formulants that serve different purposes, as stabilizers, coloring agents, emulsifiers, solvents, diluents, etc. Additionally, metabolites and degradation products might be formed during and after use of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> The overall ecotoxicity of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> might hence be significantly different from that of each individual ingredient(s) and therefore needs to be assessed during the product authorization phase. In fact, article 19 (2) of the BPR states that “the evaluation […] shall take into account the following factors: […] cumulative effects, synergistic effects.” [...] "Cumulative effects" [...] {{in the context of the}} BPR relate to effects from the same compound, emitted from different products, while [...] "synergistic effects" [...] relate to the joint action of different chemicals from one product. This is further elaborated in Annex VI (common principles for the evaluation of biocidal products) which states that the risks associated with the relevant individual components of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> shall be assessed, taking into account cumulative and synergistic effects.|$|E
30|$|However, {{only very}} limited {{details on how}} mixture effects should be {{considered}} during the authorization of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> are provided in the current Technical Note for Guidance on Product Evaluation[3]. In fact, there is currently no agreed guidance available among the European Member States on how to assess the mixture effects from the ingredients of biocidal products, hindering the mutual recognition of authorizations between member states.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> include, for example, insect repellents and {{disinfectants}} used in hospitals. The <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation (BPR) {{ensures that}} there is enough information about these products so that consumers can use them safely. ECHA is responsible for implementing the regulation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive (BPD) {{also known}} as the Biocides Directive is European Union Directive, (98/8/EC), which {{concerns}} biocides. It is officially known as Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> on the market.|$|R
50|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> {{and active}} {{substances}} fall into four categories and twenty-three product-types {{that are all}} regulated by the EU under the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive. The substances have to be authorized before being used or sold on the EU market. Also, all treated products shall only contain authorized active substances. To be authorized, manufacturers or importers need to submit technical documentation on the products. The European Commission created and regularly updates the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Directive to ensure {{a high level of}} protection of human and animal health, as well as environmental protection.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the here}} {{investigated}} dataset, the components that contribute more than 20 % {{to the overall}} joint toxicity as well as relevant a.s. from other <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> types are covered by these criteria. Using a set of criteria based on the REACH and CLP regulations for the identification of additives relevant for a CBA of a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> has the great advantage to improve consistency and harmonization with the existing regulatory guidance. In terms of workload, the number of additives to be considered would increase compared to the current set of criteria [13]. However, the aquatic toxicity data for the additives need to be compiled anyway {{in the course of}} classification and labelling, and therefore no extra effort would be implied for this step of the assessment. In the present data set, the number of additives that would need to be considered in addition to the active substances amounts to 48 in 21 products (i.e. about 2 per product), and is reduced to 21 (about 1 per product, equal to about 8 % of all additives) if ready biodegradability is considered additionally.|$|E
30|$|The {{transitional}} {{guidance document}} particularly explains two different generic approaches for the mixture toxicity assessment. One {{approach is to}} conduct ecotoxicity tests with the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> or, e.g. with the environmental mixture resulting {{from the use of}} the product (such as leachates from treated wood). The second, so-called component-based approach (CBA) is to calculate the ecotoxicity of the product or of the resulting environmental mixture using ecotoxicity data of the individual mixture components. The concept of concentration addition (CA) is recommended as default for this approach by the BPR {{as well as by the}} transitional guidance document, because CA is less data demanding and usually results in a more conservative assessment than the alternative concept of independent action (IA), demonstrated e.g. by Junghans et al. [24]. In comparison to the whole mixture testing approach, the CBA has the strong advantage that it allows assessing the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> and environmental mixtures resulting from its usage with little extra effort, assuming that predicted environmental concentrations are calculated anyway for all relevant product components. Ecotoxicological testing, particularly animal testing, is thereby reduced. The CBA is therefore preferred to the whole mixture testing approach wherever possible [12, 13].|$|E
30|$|Supported by {{theoretical}} {{calculations and}} experimental verifications, {{the present study}} developed criteria for the identification of CBA-relevant components in a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> These criteria are based on existing criteria stated in the regulation for classification, labelling and packaging of substances. The CBA was found sufficiently protective and reliable for the tested products when applying the here recommended criteria. The lack of available aquatic toxicity data {{for some of the}} identified relevant components was the main reason for underestimation of product toxicity.|$|E

By definition, these products are susceptible to have harmful effects on humans, animals and theenvironment as the main objective of European legislative regulations {{in this area is}} to ensure the highestlevel protection by restricting the placing on the market and use only those <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> which have anacceptable risk of danger to humans or the environment. The favourable opinion for the placing on the market is made after the evaluation of technicaldocumentation of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> completed by preparing a report of assessment with the formulation of theproposal to issue notice for placing on the market by the National Commission of <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products.</b> ICBMV is designated as an authority competent to assess technical documentations on efficacy,chemistry and toxicity data of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products,</b> product type 3 : Veterinary hygiene products...|$|R
30|$|In this context, the {{objective}} {{of the present study was}} to assess the reliability and protectiveness of the CBA by comparing the predicted with the experimentally determined aquatic ecotoxicity of selected <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Additionally, the results of this study aim to inform the debate on the identification of ‘relevant’ components for the mixture assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 10 years {{biocides}} {{have been used}} increasingly and {{questions have been raised}} about their contribution to the reported increase in biocide and antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. The EU <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Product</b> Regulation (BPR) now requires information on the risk of resistance development in organisms targeted by the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product.</b> There is no current protocol available to predict the likelihood of bacteria becoming resistant to a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> or biocides contained therein. This study aimed to identify useful markers of biocide resistance and develop a step-by- step protocol predictive of bacterial biocide resistance and antibiotic cross-resistance following biocide exposure. A range of experimental techniques with the potential to generate markers of biocide resistance were explored. These included minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) /minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) /antibiotic susceptibility determination, flow cytometry, efflux activity measurements, outer membrane protein changes, real-time PCR and microarrays. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains SL 1344 and 14028 S, and Burkholderia lata strain 383 were exposed to low concentrations of chlorhexidine gluconate and benzalkonium chloride as test biocides. Baseline and post-exposure data were then compared. Techniques used to understand any change in antimicrobial susceptibility were assessed in terms of practicality, cost and ease of use, and a step-by-step protocol was put together accounting for each of these factors. Increases in biocide MIC and MBC of up to 100 fold were observed in SL 1344 and 14028 S after exposure to both biocides. However these changes were not stable after subculture of surviving organisms in the absence of either biocide. No such dramatic changes were observed within B. lata. Up-regulation of efflux activity was observed as a result of CHG/BZC exposure and the efflux regulatory gene acrR underwent a > 100 fold down-regulation in both Salmonella strains after CHG exposure. Flow cytometry experiments performed using SL 1344 and 14028 S indicated that at low CHG/BZC concentrations (0. 0001 – 0. 0004...|$|E

40|$|In {{collaboration}} with Vitalfluid, TU Eindhoven, FloraHolland, Bactimm, Alewijnse and Medical faculty of UMC Radboud Wageningen UR Greenhouse Horticulture studied horticultural application {{for the use}} of plasma activated water. This research was funded by the GO programm Oost Nederland, the European Fund for Regional Development (EFRO) and Top sector Horticulture & Propagation materials. By using a specialized plasma reactor, an indirect air dielectric barrier discharge in close proximity to water can create an acidified, nitrogen-oxide containing solution called plasma-activated water (PAW). Plasma water is tested for properties as a <b>biocidal</b> <b>product,</b> plant protection treatment and as a fertilizer in horticultural applications. Mild plasma water with a short production time (15 min) can effectively control bacteria and meet the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> legislation. Strong plasma water with a longer production time (45 min) is necessary for controlling molds as Fusarium, Botrytis and powdery mildew. The tomato mosaic virus can be reduced with strong plasma up to 80 %. The crop treatments showed no damage on young gerbera plants, lettuce and tomato plants. Application of plasma water through the irrigation system to promote plant growth is not promising, because nitrogen supply is in general not limited. Application as seed disinfection is possible with low concentrations of plasma water...|$|E
3000|$|<b>Biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are {{preparations}} containing one or {{more active}} substances, {{with the intention of}} [...] "destroying, deterring, rendering harmless, preventing the action of, or otherwise exerting a controlling effect on, any organism by any means other than mere physical or mechanical” (<b>Biocidal</b> <b>Products</b> Regulation, (EU) No 528 / 2012, BPR)[1]. Biocides are hence closely related to agricultural pesticides and are – due to their high biological activity and potential exposure – of inherent environmental concern. In fact, <b>biocidal</b> <b>products</b> are only allowed to be put on the market of the European Union, if it can be convincingly demonstrated that no unacceptable risks for the environment result from their intended use.|$|R
30|$|The EU Council and Parliament {{recently}} {{agreed on}} a new regulation that will implement a new EU-wide, harmonized system for the authorization for <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> Such products are in most cases multi-component mixtures {{of one or more}} active substances plus a range of co-formulants that serve different purposes, e.g. as stabilizers or preservatives. They are only allowed on the European market if their intended use does not lead to unacceptable risks for the environment. Consequently, the assessment of possible combination effects is a critically important step during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b> However, no specific guidance is at hand on how combination effects should be accounted for during the regulatory environmental risk assessment of <b>biocidal</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

30|$|Biocides {{are active}} {{substances}} and products which {{are intended to}} destroy (…) any harmful organism by chemical or biological means. Typical applications are for instance wood preservatives, antifouling products or disinfectants. In the European Union the use of biocidal products is regulated since 1998 by the <b>Biocidal</b> <b>Product</b> Directive 98 / 8 /EG (BPD). The BPD was transposed into German law in 2001 by the “Biozid-Gesetz”.

How such a requirement will affect the marketing of articles treated with biocides is an interesting question that is discussed in the report. The study aims at giving an overview of different types of efficacy requirements in the biocidal rules but also and in other types of neighbouring regulations...|$|E
30|$|A risk {{quotient}} exceeding {{one might}} be caused by the overestimation that results from the application of CA to a mixture of not entirely similarly acting compounds. Details on how to estimate this possible overestimation are provided by Junghans and colleagues[29], Backhaus and colleagues[22] and Altenburger et al.[30]. The direct testing of the <b>biocidal</b> <b>product</b> might provide additional insight, given that a substantial risk overestimation by CA is possible, which depends {{on the number of}} involved compounds, their toxicity and ratio in the mixture.
