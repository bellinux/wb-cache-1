5|$|American {{football}} {{evolved from}} the sports of association football (soccer) and rugby football. Rugby football, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> {{through a set of}} goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points.|$|E
5|$|Nao is {{a first-year}} student at Hoshinoumi Academy {{and is also}} its student council president. She is a hardworking, intelligent, and shrewd girl, but is also narcissistic, self-righteous, and short-tempered. She {{has the ability to}} make herself invisible, but this is limited to one person of her {{choosing}} at a time. She uses this ability to her advantage to attack others she believes deserve to <b>be</b> <b>kicked,</b> but this causes her to be shunned and bullied by her peers. Although she initially shows no attraction towards Yuu, she eventually falls in love with him and stays by his side even after he loses all of his memories of her. She is a fan of Zhiend, influenced by her older brother , who once had the ability to control air movements and vibrations, which he used when playing the guitar.|$|E

50|$|In 2012 the Laws of the Game were amended FIFA Circular No 1302 {{such that}} if a dropped ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> {{directly}} into the opponents' goal, a goal <b>kick</b> <b>is</b> awarded, or if a dropped ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> directly into the team's own goal, a corner <b>kick</b> <b>is</b> awarded to the opposing team.|$|R

When the dentist departs on a cruise the two tramps then pose as dentists and occupy the office and pull teeth with pincers and tongs. When the rightful owners return they drive off again. The tramps continue in their venture and quickly make a large sum of money before they desire their old way of life. The two tramps then surrender the office to its rightful owners.|$|E
5|$|Quinn and Finn go {{together}} for her ultrasound appointment, and {{they learn that}} she is expecting a girl. Finn, trying to be supportive, suggests they name the baby Drizzle, but Quinn is adamant she is having it adopted and is annoyed at his lack of understanding. Will, tired of his wife Terri's (Jessalyn Gilsig) refusal to let him participate in the pregnancy, sets up an appointment with Terri's OB/GYN so he can see their own baby on the ultrasound. With {{the help of her}} sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri blackmails her doctor into faking the sonogram using Quinn's ultrasound DVD, in order to continue hiding the fact she isn't really pregnant. Meanwhile, Quinn angrily confronts Rachel about her relationship with Finn and threatens her. Rachel confronts Quinn about being a spy in the glee club for Sue and tells her that she will <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> of the Cheerios once Sue finds out about her pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is flattered by the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter means nothing to Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme.|$|E

50|$|Kick - A <b>kick</b> routine <b>is</b> {{all about}} legs. The {{majority}} of the routine <b>is</b> <b>kicking,</b> either in a kickline or alone. Scores {{are based on the}} number of kicks in the routine, how high the <b>kicks</b> <b>are,</b> how straight and pointed the legs and feet are, and if the entire team <b>is</b> <b>kicking</b> as one.|$|R
5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> at the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.|$|E
5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Full Metal Mayhem match {{followed}} pitting {{the team}} of Kurt Angle and Team 3D against A.J. Styles, Christian Cage, and Rhino. The duration of the contest was 15 minutes and 55 seconds. In this bout, {{the only way to}} win was by pinfall or submission, all weapons were legal and encouraged, and there were no disqualifications. Cage ascended the steel supports left behind from the Ultimate X match during the bout to jump off in an aerial splash onto both members of Team 3D and Angle. Each participant of the match was forced through a table during the bout except Angle. Rhino was the first by Team 3D, followed by Cage also by Team 3D. Each member of Team 3D were then forced through a table by Styles. After this, Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter on Team 3D's behalf by attempting to hit Styles with a kendo stick, only to <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> in the head by Styles. Later, Styles laid Angle on a table and ascended a ladder. At this time, Frank Trigg interfered by hitting Styles over the head with the kendo stick, allowing Angle to force Styles through the set-up table with his signature Olympic Slam maneuver for the pinfall victory.|$|E

25|$|The ball may not <b>be</b> <b>kicked,</b> nor {{be struck}} with the fist. For the offense, a {{violation}} of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of {{the ball out of}} bounds.|$|E
25|$|The quidditch {{pitch is}} marked with lines or {{a series of}} cones, {{but it is not}} binding to players, meaning players can {{continue}} play outside the boundaries, but not within the spectator zone (a rectangle of 44 x 77m around the pitch). Balls are not allowed to <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> off the pitch under penalty, nor is play allowed in the spectator zones. Players are asked to return to the pitch when play continues out of bounds.|$|E
25|$|Roly is {{the first}} to find Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) in Albert Square gardens when she'd been savaged by the Walford ripper. Pat later demands that he <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> out of The Vic when the Butchers moved in in 1988. Roly then runs away but is found by Junior Roberts (Aaron Carrington) who returns him to the Butchers. Fortunately for Roly, Diane (Sophie Lawrence) and Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) change Pat's mind and Mo (Edna Doré), who at first {{suggests}} they get a kennel for Roly, warms to him so much that he goes to live with her at her flat for a while.|$|E
2500|$|... 5. In {{case the}} ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> behind the goal, {{any one of}} the side behind whose goal it <b>is</b> <b>kicked,</b> may bring it twenty yards in front of any portion of the space between the [...] "kick-off" [...] posts, and shall kick it nearly as {{possible}} in line with the opposite goal.|$|R
2500|$|Attacking <b>kicks</b> <b>are</b> also employed, usually if the {{opposition}} is out of position or running at them is proving ineffective. Common attacking kicks include the [...] "up and under", box kick, [...] "grubber", crossfield kick and chip kick. The up and under, {{also known as a}} [...] "bomb" [...] or Garryowen, is a high punt. A well executed up and under will be high enough to give anyone chasing enough time to compete for the ball. Box <b>kicks</b> <b>are</b> similar, but <b>are</b> <b>kicked</b> by the scrum-half over their shoulder when a ruck, maul, scrum or line-out occurs near the touchline. The ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> high and parallel to the touchline with the wingers chasing. If the ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> along the ground it is called a grubber. It can catch the defenders unaware and because the ball is oval shaped it does not bounce consistently, making it hard for them to collect it. A cross field kick occurs when the ball <b>is</b> <b>kicked</b> from one touchline to a player waiting near the other one. Chip <b>kicks</b> <b>are</b> short <b>kicks</b> just behind the defensive line for attacking players to run onto. Like defensive <b>kicks</b> there <b>is</b> still a risk that {{the opposition}} will regain possession after an attacking kick.|$|R

25|$|When {{the referee}} is {{satisfied}} that the players are properly positioned, he/she blows the whistle {{to indicate that the}} kicker may kick. The kicker may make feinting (deceptive or distracting) moves during the run-up to the ball, but once the run-up is completed he/she may no longer feint and must kick the ball. The ball must be stationary before the kick, and it must <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> forward. The ball is in play once it is kicked and moves, and at that time other players may enter the penalty area. Once kicked, the kicker may not touch the ball again until it has been touched by another player of either team or goes out of play (including into the goal).|$|E
25|$|A fit adult {{creates a}} wake. Drag {{due to a}} wake is Newtonian drag, {{increasing}} with {{the square of the}} velocity. For example, if the relative speed between the water and the leg is twice as high on the thrust phase than on the recovery phase, the thrust is four times as high as the drag. Assuming the legs are recovered with a relative speed between leg and body which amounts to the same as the relative speed between water and body, the legs must <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> back with five times the mean velocity of the swimmer. This limits the top speed. Both effects together, velocity and frontal area, yield a thrust-to-drag ratio of 8 for the legs.|$|E
25|$|Man-made lakes, such as {{dams and}} flooded clay pits, gravel pits and {{quarries}}, often have low visibility. Disused and flooded quarries are popular in inland areas for diver training {{as well as}} recreational diving. Rock quarries may have reasonable underwater visibility - there is often little mud or silt to create mid-water particles that cause low visibility, {{and the lack of}} flow allows silt to settle on the bottom, where it may later <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> up by unskilled divers to temporarily reduce visibility locally. As they are not natural environments, and usually privately owned, quarries may contain objects intentionally placed for divers to explore, such as sunken boats, automobiles, aircraft, or structures like grain silos and gravel chutes.|$|E

25|$|Dribbled ball: A dribbled ball is {{one that}} has <b>been</b> <b>kicked</b> while not in {{possession}} of a player, for example, a loose ball following a fumble, a blocked kick, a kickoff, or a kick from scrimmage.

25|$|The ball can <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> in any {{direction}} and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of kicks used; the punt, drop kick and place kick. To punt the ball the player must kick the ball before it touches the ground. A drop kick occurs if the ball first bounces on the ground before being kicked. With a place kick the ball must {{be placed on the}} ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before being kicked. Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player kicks the ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player kicks the ball along the ground instead of diving on it or picking it up.|$|E
25|$|This {{screening}} {{process is not}} limited to the viewing of Web sites, however. It also blocks users from discussing these forbidden keywords on chat programs such as Internet Relay Chat. Once these keywords are mentioned or certain individuals identified as undesirable enter the chat room, the user will <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> off the discussion. When Tory Christman worked as an operative for OSA, other OSA operatives removed the program from her computer to allow her to analyze what critical material was being spread on the internet about Scientology. Some time after the software was removed, Christman encountered the Operation Clambake Web site and had online discussions with its operator Andreas Heldal-Lund, which eventually led to her leaving Scientology through a public announcement on Alt.religion.scientology.|$|E
25|$|If a minor {{infringement}} occurs a scrum or free kick {{is awarded}} to the non-offending team. For more serious misdemeanors the referee awards a penalty. If the non-offending team gains an advantage the referee can allow play to continue. The referee has wide discretion on whether any advantage has occurred; with penalty advantages needing a greater gain than scrum advantages. If no advantage is gained play is taken back to where the infringement occurred. The penalty or free kick is taken where the infringement occurred, or moved out five metres if it {{is close to the}} goal line. The ball can <b>be</b> <b>kicked</b> in any direction and played at again by the person kicking it. The rest of the team must stay behind the kicker until the ball has been kicked. The opposition must retire ten metres or to their goal-line.|$|E
