5000|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the university joining the Sun Belt Conference on September 1, 2015, Brooks Stadium will undergo construction to expand the stadium to 20,000 seats. The NCAA requires FBS programs to maintain an average attendance of at least 15,000 over a rolling two-year cycle. The expansion project received approval from the state in November 2015, however construction is not expected to begin until January 2017. Coastal Carolina University officials have set the project pricetag at $38 million. [...] The committee also announced in February the lead architects for the expansion will be Heery International, Inc. architectural firm and Stubbs Muldrow Herin architects. [...] Groundbreaking for the project took place on March 21, 2017. Construction will take place over two phases; the first phase will expand the stadium to the FBS-minimum 15,000 seats by expanding the sidelines and connecting them to the north end zone as well as expanding the press <b>box</b> <b>side</b> upper deck. It is expected to be completed in time for Coastal Carolina's season opener against UMass on September 2, 2017. The second phase will occur in 2018 during the off-season, and will further expand capacity to over 20,000 seats by adding premium seating and an upper deck to the west side.|$|E
