5|$|The {{operation}} {{to remove the}} train from the site began {{on the evening of}} 1 March 2007 with the first carriages moved from the embankment. This allowed passengers' property to be retrieved and gave investigators access to the train interior, which previously had not been possible <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unsafe. The last of the carriages were removed on 4 March 2007 and the A685 road was reopened.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the rest}} of the 1970s, other {{possible}} designs were looked at but never implemented, while preliminary work on the construction site resumed. On April 29, 1979, the foundations for the Auburn Dam were completed. However, debates continued over whether to build an arched or straight-axis gravity dam. Some favored the latter design <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E
3000|$|Manuel’s wife, from Riodeva, {{offers us}} a later {{version of this}} prayer, {{which could not be}} recounted <b>because,</b> otherwise, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lost its efficiency. It could only be transmitted, as he did with us, in writing: [...]...|$|R
50|$|In this case, K’s {{claim was}} bound to fail <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> met the first {{condition}} of the action. The alleged distinctiveness of the product consisted precisely {{of the process and}} techniques which were now common to the trade.|$|R
2500|$|McCartney further rebuffed {{the claims}} in a 1997 BBC Radio {{interview}} with Michael Parkinson by saying, [...] "It wasn't about LSD. <b>Because</b> otherwise <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been called 'LITSWD.'

5|$|From January to April 2009, the Scottish Government {{conducted}} a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost £25,000, {{was supported by}} the Scottish Homing Union, representing the country's 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> impinged on the birds' breeding season. It was criticised by the government's own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body Scottish Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been better had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|The British, Americans and Soviet Union {{discussed}} the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options. The British were convinced {{they were dealing}} with a Himmler trick, perhaps an attempt to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of Jews had been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive– to turn the Jews into human shields– <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.|$|E

50|$|In December 2013, {{perturbations}} of {{the orbital}} motions {{in the system}} were reported, suggesting a third body in the system. The period of this possible companion was a few months, suggesting an orbit {{around one of the}} brown dwarfs. Any companion would need to be below the brown-dwarf mass limit, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>have</b> been detected through direct imaging.|$|R
5000|$|Linda DeScenna, {{production}} {{designer of}} the film, {{was interested in the}} project <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> the same aesthetics than others 90s science fiction films, and [...] "it didn’t have to be real, hi-tech and vacuformed". The design of the Thermian station was influenced by the works of artist Roger Dean, particularly his cover art for the Yes live album Yessongs.|$|R
5|$|The {{bridge was}} built because the {{previous}} bridge, built in 1956, was {{nearing the end}} of its life span. The Nova Scotia Government had proposed minor repairs, but it was decided by the N.S. Government that an entirely new bridge would be more cost-effective. The new bridge was designed, unlike its predecessor, without large, overhead steel arches, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been twice as costly to build. The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907.|$|E
5|$|The {{light rail}} model {{would have used}} the same {{approach}} as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to accommodate overhead wires. The system {{would have the same}} frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.|$|E
5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game to keep its multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, Grant was {{urged by}} popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with {{military}} assistance {{and to give}} them U.S. diplomatic recognition. Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating. Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation. Fish, diligently and against popular pressure, {{was able to keep}} Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims. The Sickle's peace negotiations failed in Madrid, but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion. Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress, written by Fish and signed by Grant. The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt, calming national fears.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> required a vast car parking facility, {{and that would have}} put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E

50|$|Having {{ruled out}} the option of a bad bank Mariano Rajoy's {{government}} searched for a place where institutions could deposit real estate assets, {{many of which are}} covered by provisions, with the intention of selling them in the long term. This vehicle would not be a bad bank <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> a financial business. Real estate divisions were not suitable either, as they would be consolidated in balance sheets.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the Court {{also noted}} that the {{doctrine}} of [...] "impossibility" [...] could not be applied in this manner <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> technically been [...] "impossible" [...] for the lessee (the 'renter') to take possession of the flat on that prescribed day and do nothing but sit {{in front of the window}} and view the street in which the coronation parade was to have occurred.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} 1948 Master Plan {{included a}} Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial {{in its own}} right, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> disrupted the Maverick Square area of East Boston. It was never built.|$|E
25|$|Aquinas' {{argument}} from first cause {{started with the}} premise {{that it is impossible}} for a being to cause itself (<b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to exist before it caused itself) and that it is impossible for there to be an infinite chain of causes, which would result in infinite regress. Therefore, there must be a first cause, itself uncaused.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from playing}} tennis Rogers was an amateur boxer. He was trained by Don McCorkindale in Slough, {{with whom he}} had a {{scheduled}} sparring bout in Bedford although it was later cancelled <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a breach of amateur boxing rules. He also coached tennis to younger talents such as Alice Lavery, who reached the finals of the Cannes handicap tournament.|$|E
5000|$|Goldstone {{has since}} {{partially}} retracted the reports conclusions that Israel committed war crimes, as new evidence has shed light upon {{the decision making}} by Israeli commanders. He said, [...] "I regret that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining {{the circumstances in which}} we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes." ...|$|R
50|$|Special {{conditions}} are required, {{in order to}} preserve a footprint made in soft ground (such as an alluvial plain or a formative sedimentary deposit). A possible scenario is a sea or lake shore that became dried out to a firm mud in hot, dry conditions, received the footprints (<b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> only <b>have</b> been partially hardened and the animal <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been heavy) and then became silted over in a flash storm.|$|R
50|$|In October 2002 it was {{announced}} that the Haras Joter Ltda. (controlled by Jorge Gerdau) had been benefited from a loan of R$ 45.3 million (about US$ 15.1 million) granted by the Gerdau Group. The move caused controversy in the financial market, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been previously approved by the shareholders. In its defense, the Group reported that the loan was granted at market rates and repaid in full in August of the same year.|$|R
25|$|Meaning: Many Underlanders {{believe these}} lines {{refer to the}} death of Boots, because it would surely crush Gregor and make him useless to them as a warrior. Gregor and Nerissa, however, {{postulate}} that Gregor's hypothetical murder of the baby Bane would have been equally disastrous <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> destroyed his humanity. This could have made him emotionally unstable, and the Bane's death would have inflamed the rats and destroyed their fragile peace with the humans.|$|E
25|$|In December 2003, Boras {{was a part}} of {{the complex}} multi-party {{negotiations}} that would have resulted in Alex Rodriguez being traded from the Texas Rangers to the Boston Red Sox. Boras and Rodriguez offered to accept $12 million in reduced salaries in return for marketing rights and the right for Rodriguez to be a free agent after the 2005 season. The trade was eventually killed by the MLBPA <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> cost Rodriguez $30 million in previously guaranteed compensation, setting a bad precedent (from the union's perspective) regarding the renegotiation of guaranteed contracts.|$|E
25|$|Schwarzenegger {{was born}} with a {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets). Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available {{at the time of his}} surgery, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.|$|E

5000|$|Writing for the majority, Justice Matthews {{stated that}} the states {{should be free to}} {{construct}} their own laws without infringement and that the 14th Amendment was not intended to guarantee the right of a grand jury <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> then <b>have</b> been specifically referenced. His opinion also concluded that Hurtado's due process right was not violated, as an information is [...] "merely a preliminary proceeding and can result in no final judgment." [...] He further concluded that Hurtado still received a fair trial.|$|R
