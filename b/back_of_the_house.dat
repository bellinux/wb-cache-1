5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of}} the main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

25|$|Returning from Hampshire at {{the latter}} part of 1943, Bacon and Hall took the ground floor of 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington, John Everett Millais' old house and studio. High vaulted and north lit, its roof was {{recently}} bombed– Bacon was able to adapt a large old billiard room at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> as his studio. Nanny Lightfoot, lacking an alternative location, slept on the kitchen table. Illicit roulette parties were held there, organised by Bacon with the assistance of Hall, to the financial benefit of both.|$|E
25|$|The turnpike road to Hereford, now the B4361 (named Overton Road in Ludford), {{was built}} through the parkland of Ludford House in the 1820s and passes {{right by the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> Ludford House is no longer one {{residence}} and has been divided into separate dwellings. Park Road, no longer a through-road, was once the main thoroughfare leading southwards from the ford, and later the bridge, and was until 1836 the main route to Worcester, running via Steventon. Whitcliffe Road begins at the B4361 in the centre of Ludford, heads across Whitcliffe Common towards Mortimer Forest, and runs eventually to Wigmore.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} between January 20 and March 10, 1958, mostly at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, California, and on {{location}} in the French Quarter in New Orleans, Louisiana, while <b>the</b> scene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bayou was filmed at Lake Pontchartrain. During filming, Presley was constantly moved to avoid <b>the</b> crowds <b>of</b> fans who came to see him on location, which delayed the film-making.

25|$|Upon moving, Genie's father {{increasingly}} confined Genie to {{the second}} bedroom in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{while the rest of}} the family slept in the living room. During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a straitjacket. While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into a sleeping bag and placed her in a crib with a metal-screen cover, keeping her arms and legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|E
25|$|Demolition of Ungdomshuset {{began at}} 8 am on 5 March 2007. A {{demolition}} crane started its {{work at the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> with the top floor. The logos on the crane were covered and workers wore masks to conceal their identity. The union representing Ungdomshuset {{was on the ground}} trying to persuade the workers to stop working and reveal the company they were working for. At 10am the Danish Working Environment Authority (Arbejdstilsynet) had the demolition interrupted due to reported concerns about dust and the potential presence of asbestos. The demolition resumed at 11am. At 4pm, about one-third of the house had been removed. The demolition was broadcast live by webcam on TV2 News' website.|$|E
25|$|The dalem is an {{enclosed}} structure typically subdivided along a north-south axis into different domains. In {{the case of}} kampung and limasan models this is a simple distinction between {{the front and rear}} parts of the omah, but in joglo houses, a more complex division is used to divide the front, middle, and <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The dalem is often dark, lit only by light from the doorway. The eastern part of the front portion of the dalem is where family chores are performed and where {{all the members of the}} family sleep, on a large bamboo bed, prior to the puberty of the children. The middle section of the dalem in joglo houses is defined by the four principal house posts which forms the tumpang sari of the joglo roof. In modern day, the area has no specific usage, but traditionally, this area was where incense was burnt once a week to honor the rice goddess Sri. The space below the tumpang sari is also the place where the bride and bridegroom are seated during their marriage ceremony.|$|E

25|$|The {{garden was}} located behind the house, {{or on the}} {{southern}} side. The garden was grown above a man-made level platform where {{there used to be}} a hill, and was exactly one acre (about 4000sqm) in area. A gravel path runs from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to the southern edge, and was twelve feet (3.7m) wide during Mason's time period, the same width as the central passage in the house and the portico. Today, the path is narrower, crowded by boxwoods that are now about 250 years old. The path ends in an overlook extending out from the steep edge of the garden. From here, the Potomac river can be seen. The Gunston Hall museum website says that the view was more impressive during Mason's time, when the trees were cleared. The garden was most likely broken into four rectangles, with additional gravel paths running through and around it. To give the illusion from the house of all rectangles being the same size, the rectangles closer to the house were probably shorter than the rectangles farther away.|$|E
25|$|The Clarence Moore House is {{a classic}} example of the Beaux Arts {{architectural}} style and features a Louis XV-style exterior. The -story structure includes a basement and comprises brick walls, a concrete floor, and a steel roof. The building measures 79.5 feet (24.2m) in height and the walls are made of Roman brick. A limestone Tuscan entablature with a bracket cornice separate the third and fourth floors. The building's north entrance on Massachusetts Avenue has a 6x6foot (1.8x1.8m) stoop flanked by limestone balustrades. Above the entrance and ground floor windows are limestone corbels and guttae. The corbels support limestone second floor balconies and a vase balustrade. The third floor balconies are made of limestone and feature cast iron railings. The second, third, and fourth floor window and architraves are set in a quoined limestone ground. Six limestone chimneys, capped with Tusance entablature, are visible from the ground level. Two chimneys are located at the front and <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and a chimney is located on the eastern and western sides. The slate mansard roof has a limestone and metal ridge.|$|E
25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot air furnace and contains an Otis passenger elevator and freight elevator. The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the freight elevator measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located {{on the right side of}} the hallway and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near the end of the hall are service rooms, service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a breakfast room. A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At the end of the hall are two parlors and a large drawing room. The second floor contains three bedrooms, two baths, and a service area. One of the bedrooms, the master suite, contains a separate staircase that gives access to the upper floors. The third floor contains bedroom suites and a playroom in the southeast corner. The fourth floor contains additional bedrooms and servants' quarters.|$|E

25|$|The Street family {{considered}} Harrison a skyscraper architect, so {{his decision}} to both plan and supervise the construction of their house in Scarborough, a hamlet of the village of Briarcliff Manor, surprised them. By October 6, 1937, the house that Harrison constructed had one story of stone {{in the shape of}} an L, with a short stone wall extending from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and a ramp path with a serpentine wall running up along {{the front of the house}} to the entrance. By March 7, 1938, the two-story house was completed. The finished house was built of local fieldstone in the shape of an L, using steel beams on the roofs of the house and garage, with sixteen-inch walls, glass porthole windows, and large panes of glass and doors on the back of the house—it was related in design to other early Modernist houses constructed in the late 1930s by the Modernists Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Breuer was a proponent of the more modern International Style, and Gropius, as Director of the Bauhaus in Germany, applied the International Style when he designed the school's faculty housing and building around 1925-1926. Gropius and Breuer represented a new form of architectural design, one that did not look to the past, but rather to modern industry for inspiration.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a period}} of {{violence}} from 1978. In March 1979 the Olinga home was robbed though the temple was undisturbed and there was a suspicious accident where Olinga's car was rammed and forced down a hill by a troop transport vehicle, where he was robbed and left for dead, and Olinga's son George was disappeared for a week by soldiers of Amin. Death threats perhaps simply because of his prominence came to Olinga from his home town. Meanwhile, after President Amin fled in April the religion began to re-organize - there was the re-opening of the Bahá'í House of Worship again, and the beginning of reforming the national assembly in August. Neighbors and a garden servant boy bore witness mostly by hearing events of the execution of the Olinga family. On the evening of Sunday, September 16, 1979, the birthday of one of Olinga's daughters and planned as a day of a family reunion of which a few could not arrive in time, after 8pm local time five soldiers entered Olinga's home while one stood guard at the household gate and killed Olinga, his wife, and three of their five children. Trails of blood went from the kitchen to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and one of the children had been hurt and roughly bandaged before the family was executed. Enoch himself was killed out in the yard where he had been heard weeping after perhaps witnessing his dead family in the very same house he had joined the religion in. The news was conveyed initially by the garden servant to {{a member of the national}} committee that had been appointed and then to a 79-year-old pioneer, Claire Gung, who called internationally. Ultimately news reached the Universal House of Justice while it sat in session on the 17th. All the dead were buried in the Bahá'í cemetery on the temple grounds on the 25th while civil war and terrorism continued. The funeral included hundreds of Bahá'ís who could make the trip and several members of the government of Uganda.|$|E
