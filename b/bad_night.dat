500|$|In Kentucky's Governors, Brown biographer Mary K. Bonsteel Tachau {{said of his}} administration: [...] "There were no scandals. Neither he nor any of {{his people}} were accused of corruption." [...] Scandal did touch Brown personally, however, {{as well as some}} of his close associates. In 1981, he was {{investigated}} for withdrawing $1.3 million of personal cash from the All American Bank of Miami. The bank failed to report the transaction to the Internal Revenue Service as required by law. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation probed the matter in 1983, Brown claimed he withdrew the money to cover gambling debts he ran up during [...] "one <b>bad</b> <b>night</b> gambling" [...] in Las Vegas. Brown, who was not the focus of the FBI's investigation, later recanted that statement.|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{also agreed}} to {{introduce}} John to Warne. The meeting occurred at the casino near the team hotel. The trio chatted as Warne was playing roulette; he had a <b>bad</b> <b>night</b> and lost US$5,000. John introduced himself to Warne {{as a person who}} bet on cricket matches. The next day he invited Warne to his hotel room and, describing himself as a big fan, flattered Warne's leg spinning abilities. Warne accepted a US$5,000 gift, with [...] "no strings attached", which covered his gambling losses. Warne reported that he initially rejected the gift, but accepted the offer at the insistence of John, who said that he would be offended if the offer was declined. Warne later lost this money at the casino. Warne wrote in his autobiography that John told him that he was a wealthy man and that the payment was a token of his appreciation—he had made money by betting on Australian victories in the past.|$|E

2500|$|An {{effort was}} made to secure {{experienced}} pilots and observers from older squadrons, but this proved impractical. [...] New pilots with little night flying and observers with no night experience were received by the squadron. [...] These men had to be trained in night work before they could begin operations over the lines. [...] This obstacle in conjunction with <b>bad</b> <b>night</b> weather, was responsible for the slow start of the squadron. [...] The 9th was then assigned to the 1st Army Observation Group, Air Service, First Army, and transferred to the Headquarters, Night Reconnaissance Bombing Group at Amanty Airdrome in the Toul Sector.|$|E
2500|$|Hagrid {{was among}} the {{characters}} that Rowling says she created on [...] "the very first day". She has explained {{the source of his}} name as [...] "another old English word, meaning – if you were hagrid – it’s a dialect word – you’d had a <b>bad</b> <b>night.</b> Hagrid is a big drinker – {{he has a lot of}} bad nights." [...] His first name, Rubeus, was named after red in Latin to reflect alchemy and his paternal contrast to Albus Dumbledore: his [...] "passion" [...] to Dumbledore's [...] "asceticism". In her article [...] "Harry’s Fame", Rosemary Goring notes the Forest of Dean is an influence on Rowling’s work, and Hagrid is the only character that is [...] "directly drawn from the Forest of Dean". According to Goring, Hagrid’s [...] "dropped word-endings are a Chepstow speciality." [...] She also claims that Hagrid is physically [...] "modeled on the Welsh chapter of Hells Angels who’d swoop down on the town and hog the bar, 'huge mountains of leather and hair".|$|E
2500|$|The {{premiere of}} Broadchurch series two {{met with a}} highly {{positive}} critical reception. The Independent awarded the premiere episode four stars out of five and labelled it [...] "a brilliant demonstration of the risks a writer {{can get away with}} when there’s a proven cast to fall back on". When questioning whether the series would be able to retain the quality of the previous series, reviewer Ellen E. Jones stated, [...] "On the evidence of last night's twist-packed opener, perhaps even more so". Ben Lawrence in The Daily Telegraph also awarded the premiere episode 4/5, praising the performances of Tennant and Colman. They closed their review by stating [...] "Broadchurch continues to be a rich and complex tapestry which respects the viewer's intelligence and commands you to become an armchair detective". Kevin O'Sullivan, writing for the Daily Mirror, called the first episode [...] "tension-packed" [...] and [...] "an impressive opening salvo looks set to grip the nation all over again." [...] He also singled out the [...] "chilling Nordic noir-style music" [...] for praise. Awarding the episode a full 5/5, Andrew Billen of The Times labelled the first episode [...] "expansively told and imaginatively filmed". He also stated, [...] "With an extraordinary ensemble cast that churns the narrative like waves in a harbour, Broadchurch will this time free us with nothing but the truth". Mark Lawson in The Guardian called the premiere episode [...] "an ingeniously seamless reboot" [...] and went on to say, [...] "Chibnall has gathered enough old loose ends and intriguing new strands to suggest that Mondays may again become a <b>bad</b> <b>night</b> for the nation's pubs and restaurants". They also praised Tennant and Colman's performances, saying [...] "the pleasure comes from Tennant and Colman's scenes together, forcing them together, each on the edge of disintegration". Natalie Corner at the Daily Mirror singled out Olivia Colman's acting, calling it [...] "fantastic". The Independent Neela Debnath called the cinematography [...] "stunning".|$|E
