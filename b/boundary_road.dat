5|$|Before the 1760s, Westgate {{consisted}} {{of only a}} farm, a coastguard station (built 1791 and still standing in Old <b>Boundary</b> <b>Road)</b> and a few cottages for the crew that surrounded it. These were located beside the coast at St Mildred's Bay, named after Mildrith, Thanet's patron saint and a one-time Abbess of Minster. The town inherited {{its name from the}} Westgate Manor, which was located in the area in medieval times. In the early 20th century, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered in what is now Beach Road, where a stream once used to flow. Fresh water can still be seen rising from the sand at low tide.|$|E

500|$|The {{cooperation}} of the Canning Road District {{would be required to}} continue the Berwick Street bypass south-east beyond the city's boundary at <b>Boundary</b> <b>Road,</b> and ultimately through to Albany Road. The South Perth Road Board was also in favour of such a bypass, which would improve access for South Perth residents. A deputation from the Canning and South Perth Road Boards to the Acting Minister For Works, Mr E. H. Gray, in June 1940 complained about the congestion in Albany Road. The traffic delays were worsened by cars parked {{on both sides of the}} road and slow-moving trams. The deputation suggested extending Berwick Street to Albany Highway as the solution, as well as removing the trams. Gray contended that parking should be prohibited, and refused to scrap the trams, but said he would consider the resumption of land east of Berwick Street to enable a [...] extension to Albany Road. However, Berwick Street was diverted to the south-west to connect with Chapman Road, providing a longer continuous route west of Albany Highway.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} new method for {{automatic}} curved <b>road</b> <b>boundary</b> detection in images captured by traffic cameras. The proposed method combines data driven (edge segments) and model based (2 nd degree polynomial models for <b>road</b> <b>boundaries)</b> techniques to identify dominant <b>road</b> <b>boundary</b> in images exhibiting extreme weather conditions, low visibility and poor lighting. The proposed method constructs a ranked list of possible <b>road</b> <b>boundaries</b> through agglomerative hierarchical clustering of edge segments. Each node in the hierarchical clustering is a potential <b>road</b> <b>boundary.</b> Top ranked <b>road</b> <b>boundaries</b> are paired {{with each other to}} identify potential road regions. The road regions are then ranked using appearance and perspective cues and the top ranked road region is used to construct the dominant <b>road</b> <b>boundary</b> in the image. We evaluate our method on a realistic dataset captured by traffic cameras managed by Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation. ii Acknowledgements I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors, Dr. Ken Q.
