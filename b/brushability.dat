50|$|Acrylic {{varnishes}} {{are typically}} water-borne varnishes {{with the lowest}} refractive index of all finishes and high transparency. They resist yellowing. Acrylics {{have the advantage of}} water clean-up and lack of solvent fumes, but typically do not penetrate into wood as well as oils. They sometimes lack the <b>brushability</b> and self-leveling qualities of solvent-based varnishes. Generally they have good UV-resistance.|$|E
40|$|Wood {{preservation}} also {{comprises the}} surface treatment. It shall avoid that the wood is penetrated by moisture and destroyed by UV radiation. Furthermore, {{it serves as}} a creative element. Following requirements have to be fulfilled by a painting system used for the preservation of framework timber: The evaporation of water from the wood must be assured. The durability should be at least 3 to 5 years. The <b>brushability</b> on rough surfaces has to be excellent...|$|E
40|$|Appraisal of nail enamel entails {{examination}} and measurement of several properties. They include flow characteristics, ompatibility of constituents during drying, {{the rate of}} drying of films, and their resistance to soap and detergents. Nail lacquers should be carefully tested {{to make sure that}} they meet the performance specifications which have been set up by both marketing and technical executives. The judicious election of testing methods and the correct interpretation of data are vitally important o the development of improved nail coating formulations. The performance of a nail enamel and its components i of primary concern to the lacquer chemist, he must prescribe the tests, interpret and refine the data while recognizing their overall significance, and apply conclusions based on the information obtained in the tests. The following physical parameters of nail enamel compositions are examined and measured along with their respective performance characteristics: adhesion, <b>brushability,</b> color and colo...|$|E
30|$|Ready-mixed {{industrial}} and household paints were an {{invention of the}} late nineteenth-early twentieth century [17]. Significant advances in paint technology and experimentation with different types of raw or heat-processed oils, resins and curing agents, provided commercial painters with products that had good hiding and levelling properties, consistency and <b>brushability,</b> provided adequate protection to the surface, dried fast, and came ready-mixed in an easy-to-use can [44]. Similarly, the formulations of artists’ tube paints were expanded to include a variety of ingredients, with a drying oil (one rich in polyunsaturated triglycerides) or mixtures of oils as the main component, and additives such as wax, rosin or metal soaps. The tube paint was designed to dry through oxidative cross-linking of the oil binder upon exposure to air and {{in the presence of}} a catalyst, which could be one of the pigments themselves, in a process that could take months to achieve a dry-to-the-touch surface and decades to reach a fully cured status. The ability for the paint to retain brushstrokes was important, as well as its thixotropic properties. On the other hand, {{industrial and}} household oil-based enamel paints were applied in thin coatings and required to be dry to the touch in a few hours and cured within days. A brushless surface appearance was desired in most cases. In this context the term “enamel” describes the glossy, porcelain-like finish of the dried paint: a brushless surface appearance was desired in most cases.|$|E
