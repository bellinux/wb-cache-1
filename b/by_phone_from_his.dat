50|$|Ray and Jorge ask the New Jersey {{police to}} free Adriana, but they refuse; it would disrupt their {{strategy}} against the larger criminal organization the gang is part of.

He does not do that; instead Adriana on purpose goes in the washroom and comes back with blood on her hand and smears the bedsheet. The kidnapper comes in to check on them, and understands that in spite of the blood on the sheet they have not had sex. Adriana reminds him of what Veronica said before she died, and in his guilty conscience he cooperates and tells his female boss that the defilement did take place. As they leave, Jorge arrives and hits the man on the head with a tire iron, and the police, checking on the house after all, arrest the two kidnappers and free several children they find in the basement.

Jorge finds the leader of the kidnappers (Pasha D. Lychnikoff) and kills him, but then he is shocked to discover that the man had a young son.|$|E

After Sandra breaks the argument before [...] "one of them says something they can't take back," [...] the reception ends. While leaving the celebration, Edward's doctor, one of the guests, notices that Edward seems to be in pain and suggests that he come in for an examination.

50|$|Further {{investigation}} leads Cassel {{to discover}} that his brothers had been keeping a white cat {{just like the one}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> dreams, but that it's free now and has been following him around. He knows that although transformation workers are very rare, but wonders if it could in fact be Lila, who may be able to work dreams. The cat is captured again and taken to the pound, so he rescues it, certain that something strange is going on. Shortly after, he discovers that one of the rocks under his skin has broken, and that his second oldest brother Barron must be manipulating Cassel's memories. He also finds out that he is a worker after all; a transformation worker. He has been changing people into lifeless objects, effectively murdering them for hire, so his brothers have been altering his memory to protect both his conscience and his secret. With this discovery, Cassel changes the white cat back into Lila. The two plan to reunite her with her father and allow her to take back her place as heir by revealing a plan her cousin Anton has of killing her father and running the family himself. It succeeds, and things go mostly back to normal for Cassel despite his new-found ability. Lila still originally hates him for what he did, but when he arrives home from school a week later, she is waiting for him, having forgiven him. They kiss, as Cassel has always dreamed, but are interrupted <b>by</b> a <b>phone</b> call <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mother, who has gotten out of jail and wants to tell him of her surprise: that she met Lila in New York and used her ability to make her fall madly in love with Cassel. He demands she undo it, but his mother claims she cannot, and Cassel realizes that he was a mark himself, gullible enough to believe that Lila would forgive him and love him so easily.|$|R
