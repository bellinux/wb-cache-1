5|$|Ricordi {{sent his}} agent in Paris, Emanuele Muzio, to {{negotiate}} with Sardou, who preferred that his play be adapted <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> composer.

Nonetheless, Ricordi reached terms with Sardou and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Sandown Castle was a Device Fort {{built at}} Sandown on the Isle of Wight by Henry VIII in 1545 {{to protect against}} the threat of French attack. Constructed from stone with angular bastions, its design was a hybrid of Italian {{military}} architectural thinking with traditional English military design. The site was raided <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> force that summer while the fortification was still being constructed. The site suffered from coastal erosion and the castle was demolished in 1631.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Soult led a small force, some 150 musket-men, {{across the river}} Linth—the men held their muskets over their heads and waded across, through water to their chests—and {{protected}} the crossing site {{for the remainder of}} the force. Baron von Hotze, commander of the Austrian force there, advanced on the position near Richterswil to direct its defense, and was killed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> musket ball. His successor, Franz Petrasch, could not push the French back, and organized a retreat from the region, falling back to St. Gallen and losing another 8,000 men and some guns. By the time Suvorov arrived in St. Gallen in early October, the Austrians and the Russians had been pushed out and he was forced to lead his men over the Alps to the Vorarlberg, resulting in additional losses.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi was {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> {{law professor and}} politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, {{who is said to}} have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.|$|E
5|$|Collier's next {{ship was}} Captain Samuel Hood's 32-gun , which he joined in March 1791. He {{remained}} with the Juno {{until she was}} paid off. On being discharged he took passage aboard the East Indiaman Winchelsea, bound for the East India station. The Winchelsea ran onto a reef in the Mozambique Channel on 3 September 1792 and was wrecked. Collier and the other survivors were able to reach Madagascar, where they remained until being picked up a Portuguese brig in May the following year. Before they could reach friendly soil the Portuguese ship was captured <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> privateer and Collier and his fellow survivors were sent to Île de France as prisoners. He remained in captivity there until being released in late 1794, whereupon he sailed to the British-held port of Madras.|$|E

5|$|Eberhardt is {{captured}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> patrol after witnessing them execute an Arab prisoner. A French military officer, Comte (Richard Moire), imprisons and abuses her. Eberhardt befriends an Arab prisoner named Sayed, who is later executed. Slimene reveals that Comte executed Sayed {{in the hopes}} of provoking a war. Eberhardt writes to Barracund telling him everything; her story is printed as front page news. Shortly thereafter Eberhardt is viciously attacked and wounded by an Arab swordsman. Eberhardt believes that Comte is responsible for the attack. At the conclusion of the sentencing of her attacker to life imprisonment, the French authorities deport Eberhardt. She moves to Marseille, where she is accompanied by Slimene the following year. The two become married, which allows Eberhardt to return to Algiers.|$|E
5|$|Fears grew {{about the}} threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward. The {{citizens}} of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich {{and the experience of}} Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.|$|E
5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Charles Depéret {{described the}} first theropod remains from northwestern Madagascar in 1896. These included two teeth, a claw, and some vertebrae discovered along the Betsiboka River <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> army officer and {{deposited in the}} collection of what is now the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. Depéret referred these fossils to the genus Megalosaurus, which at the time was a wastebasket taxon containing any number of unrelated large theropods, as the new species M. crenatissimus. This name is derived from the Latin word crenatus ("notched") and the suffix -issimus ("most"), in reference to the numerous serrations on both front and rear edges of the teeth. Depéret later reassigned the species to the North American genus Dryptosaurus, another poorly known taxon.|$|E

5|$|In November HMS Eagle chased and {{captured}} the small French frigate Corcyre in a failed attempt <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> convoy to transport supplies to Corfu. A day later, {{the action of}} 29 November 1811 foiled the most significant French attempt to bring more forces to the Adriatic in 1811 when a British squadron under Captain Murray Maxwell in Alceste chased and engaged two frigates and an armed store ship. One frigate and the store ship were captured, the other reaching Ancona in a disabled state. This action had wide-ranging effects; Napoleon himself {{took an interest in}} the reports, and {{it has been suggested that}} it was this engagement that convinced him to change the direction of his plans for eastwards expansion from the Balkans to Russia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the action, Rotheram left Royal Sovereign to take command of HMS Bellerophon, whose captain, John Cooke had been killed <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> sniper. Cooke had been targeted due to the dress uniform he had worn during the battle. Bellerophon escorted Victory carrying Nelson's body back to Britain, and Rotheram carried the guidon behind the coffin at Nelson's funeral in London. Rotheram was presented with a gold medal and sword of honour in recognition of his services in the action, and continued in command of Bellerophon.|$|E

In late December, Zucchi was acquired <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> investment fund, Astrance Capital, which took control of Buffon's company GB Holding, under an agreement to restructure Zucchi Group's debt, while Buffon was allowed to retain a 15% share in the company.|$|E
