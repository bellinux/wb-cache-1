5|$|Nuthatches are monogamous. The female {{produces}} {{eggs that}} are white with red or yellow markings; the clutch size varies, tending {{to be larger}} for northern species. The eggs are incubated for 12 to 18 days by the female alone, or by <b>both</b> <b>parents,</b> depending on the species. The altricial (naked and helpless) chicks take between 21 and 27 days to fledge. <b>Both</b> <b>parents</b> feed the young, {{and in the case}} of two American species, brown-headed and pygmy, helper males from the previous brood may assist the parents in feeding.|$|E
5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, {{and defend}} territories. They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that is either {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. <b>Both</b> <b>parents</b> share the tasks of incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|Common loons eat a {{wide range}} of animal prey {{including}} fish,crustaceans, insect larvae,molluscs, and occasionally aquatic plant life. They swallow most of their prey underwater, where it is caught, but some larger items are first brought to the surface. They are a seasonallymonogamousbreeders. Both members of a pair build a large nest out of deadmarsh grassesand other plants formed into a mound along the vegetated shores of lakes. A singlebroodis raised each year from a clutch of one or two olive-brown ovaleggswith dark brown spots which are incubated for 24 to 25 days by <b>both</b> <b>parents.</b> Fed by <b>both</b> <b>parents,</b> the chicks fledge in 70 to 77 days. The chicks are capable of diving underwater and they fly to their wintering areas before ice forms in the fall.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} allele {{found only}} in the Bengal subspecies produces the white tiger, a colour variant first recorded in the early 19th century and found in an estimated one in 10,000 natural births. Genetically, whiteness is recessive: a cub is white only when <b>both</b> <b>parents</b> carry the allele for whiteness. It is not albinism, pigment being evident in the white tiger's stripes and in their blue eyes. The causative mutation changes a single amino acid in the transporter protein SLC45A2.|$|E
5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. <b>Both</b> <b>parents</b> participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. <b>Both</b> <b>parents</b> brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. <b>Both</b> <b>parents</b> feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to speed up the process of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|E
