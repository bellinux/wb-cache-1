The full length of the highway in the state is also a Pure Michigan Historic Byway. Outside of the various cities, most of US12 is a rural, two-lane state highway. One section runs concurrently with I-94 south of Ypsilanti. From there eastward, the US12 is a divided highway and then a boulevard into the Detroit area. The entire length of the highway east of Coldwater is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{medicine}} {{deals with}} medical research {{on issues of}} diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness.

In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} the county-maintained portion of NY441 near its west end {{was transferred to the}} state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and Monroe County. A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June20. The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August28. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November26, 2007. The entirety of NY441 is now maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E

5|$|NY31F {{originally}} {{ran through}} the center of Fairport, turning north at NY250 and sharing Main Street with NY250 on a short concurrency between Church Street and High Street. NY31F turned east at High Street and followed it to Turk Hill Road, where NY31F continued east on its current alignment. The route was realigned onto its current alignment through Fairport on April1, 1984, {{as a result of a}} highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of New York and the village of Fairport. In the swap, ownership and maintenance of High Street was transferred from the state to Fairport in exchange for control over the portion of East Church Street between NY250 and Turk Hill Road.|$|E
5|$|NY322 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to its current alignment. Originally, maintenance of the Cattaraugus County portion of the route was split between the village of South Dayton and the county, the latter of which co-designated the highway as County Route3 (CR3).

5|$|NY345 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it originally followed a different alignment south of the hamlet of Madrid. At the time, what is now NY345 between Madrid and Potsdam was part of NY56A. The NY56A designation was eliminated in 1980. NY345 was realigned two years later to follow old NY56A to Potsdam {{as a result of a}} highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of New York and St. Lawrence County.

5|$|New York State Route424 (NY424) was an east–west {{state highway}} in {{northern}} Chautauqua County, New York, in the United States. The route began at an intersection with NY380 (now County Route380 or CR380) {{in the town}} of Stockton and ended at a junction with NY60 in the village of Cassadaga. NY424 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and removed from the state highway system in 1980 as part of a highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of New York and Chautauqua County. The route's former alignment is now part of CR58.|$|E
5|$|On April10, 1980, the NY56A {{designation}} was deleted. The {{portion of}} former NY56A from Madrid to Potsdam, {{as well as}} the state-maintained Bridge Street connector, became part of a rerouted NY345 on September1, 1982, {{as a result of a}} highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of New York and St. Lawrence County. As part of the swap, the pre-1982 routing of NY345 between the Canton village line and Bridge Street in Madrid was turned over to the county while the portion of former NY345 within Canton was transferred to the village.|$|E

Maintenance of NY192's former routing between Gabriels and Bloomingdale was transferred to the counties it ran through—namely Franklin and Essex—in stages. The Franklin County portion was given to the county on April1, 1980, while the section in Essex County was transferred to county control on April1, 1985, as part of highway maintenance swaps <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of New York and Franklin and Essex counties.

5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner.

Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination or intentional systematic discrimination.
