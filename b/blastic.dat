5000|$|Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and blood, marrow, {{and skin}} {{involvement}} with dendritic-like blast and more mature appearing dendritic cells are characteristic findings. Such skin involvement usually presents as a violaceous papular rash. Bone marrow, lymph node and spleen enlargement from leukemic cell infiltration usually is present.

A few cases of therapy related <b>blastic</b> plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) have also been reported.|$|E
50|$|MCL, {{like most}} malignancies, {{results from the}} {{acquisition}} {{of a combination of}} (non-inherited) genetic mutations in somatic cells. This leads to a clonal expansion of malignant B lymphocytes. The factors that initiate the genetic alterations are typically not identifiable, and usually occur in people with no particular risk factors for lymphoma development. Because it is an acquired genetic disorder, MCL is neither communicable nor inheritable. A defining characteristic of MCL is mutation and overexpression of cyclin D1, a cell cycle gene, that contributes to the abnormal proliferation of the malignant cells. MCL cells may also be resistant to drug-induced apoptosis, making them harder to cure with chemotherapy or radiation. Cells affected by MCL proliferate in a nodular or diffuse pattern with two main cytologic variants, typical or <b>blastic.</b> Typical cases are small to intermediate-sized cells with irregular nuclei. <b>Blastic</b> (aka blastoid) variants have intermediate to large-sized cells with finely dispersed chromatin, and are more aggressive in nature. The tumor cells accumulate in the lymphoid system, including lymph nodes and the spleen, with non-useful cells eventually rendering the system dysfunctional. MCL may also replace normal cells in the bone marrow, which impairs normal blood cell production.|$|E
50|$|The spores are thick-walled, spherical or broadly elliptical, buff colored, with surface ornamentations, and {{dimensions}} of 13-16 or 12-13 by 16 µm. They germinate {{by means of}} a basidia that bears an apical cluster of elongate basidiospores. The sterile (non spore-producing) cells are pale, nearly colorless, ornamented, and frequently collapsed. The conidia are thin-walled, mostly Y-shaped, transclucent, and arranged in roughly like a loose ball. When the conidia germinate, they make hyphae that can form both <b>blastic</b> conidia and ballistospores.|$|E
50|$|Important {{characteristics}} of the anamorphs of the Ascomycota are conidiogenesis, which includes spore formation and dehiscence (separation from the parent structure). Conidiogenesis corresponds to Embryology in animals and plants and {{can be divided into}} two fundamental forms of development: <b>blastic</b> conidiogenesis, where the spore is already evident before it separates from the conidiogenic hypha, and thallic conidiogenesis, during which a cross-wall forms and the newly created cell develops into a spore. The spores {{may or may not be}} generated in a large-scale specialized structure that helps to spread them.|$|E
50|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} process in ascomycetes also involves the budding which we clearly observe in yeast. This is termed a “blastic process”. It involves the blowing out or blebbing of the hyphal tip wall. The <b>blastic</b> process can involve all wall layers, or {{there can be}} a new cell wall synthesized which is extruded from within the old wall.The initial events of budding {{can be seen as the}} development of a ring of chitin around the point where the bud is about to appear. This reinforces and stabilizes the cell wall. Enzymatic activity and turgor pressure act to weaken and extrude the cell wall. New cell wall material is incorporated during this phase. Cell contents are forced into the progeny cell, and as the final phase of mitosis ends a cell plate, the point at which a new cell wall will grow inwards from, forms.|$|E

Since <b>blastic</b> plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm cells express high levels of interleukin- 3 receptor α chain (IL 3 -Rα or CD 123), antitumor effects of the interleukin- 3 receptor-targeted drug SL- 401 against <b>blastic</b> plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The cytotoxicity of SL- 401 was assessed in patient-derived <b>blastic</b> plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm cell lines (CAL- 1 and GEN 2. 2) and in primary <b>blastic</b> plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm cells isolated from 12 patients using flow cytometry and an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxic effects of SL- 401 were compared to those of several relevant cytotoxic agents. SL- 401 exhibited a robust cytotoxicity against <b>blastic</b> plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the cytotoxic effects of SL- 401 were observed at substantially lower concentrations than those achieved in clinical trials to date.

40|$|Bony metastases from {{prostate}} cancer {{are a significant}} cause of morbidity and mortality. These metastases are predominantly <b>blastic</b> (bone-forming) and com-monly cause increased serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) as calcium ions are transferred from serum into <b>blastic</b> bone. The epidemiologic and clinical significance of secondary hyperparathy-roidism in advanced {{prostate cancer}} have not been widely appreciated.

40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} indomethacin on cell cycle and apoptosis of CD 34 + cells in <b>blastic</b> phase chronic myeloid leukemia, and explore the role of Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway in the molecular mechanism. Methods 　CD 34 + cells were sorted from bone marrow samples of <b>blastic</b> phase chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia and normal cord blood by immune magnetic bead separation. The purity of CD 34 + cells was detected by flow cytometry, and cellular morphology was observed by Wright's staining. The protein expression and location of β-catenin and BCR/ABL in CD 34 + cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. The changes of β-catenin protein expression in CD 34 + cells treated with indomethacin and imatinib were detected by immunofluorescence, the cell apoptosis and cell cycle were observed by Wright's staining and flow cytometry, the mRNA level of c-myc and cyclin D 1 was detected by real-time PCR, and the protein expression of BCR/ABL was detected by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assay. Results 　CD 34 + cells were successfully acquired with purity over 90 %. β-catenin and BCR/ABL highly expressed in those CD 34 + cells isolated from <b>blastic</b> phase chronic myeloid leukemia and mainly located in cytoplasm. Indomethacin combined with imatinib significantly suppressed the expression of β-catenin, increased the apoptotic rate and arrested the cell cycle in G 0 /G 1 phase of <b>blastic</b> phase CD 34 + cells (P< 0. 05), decreased the mRNA level of c-myc and cyclin D 1 and the expression of BCR/ABL in <b>blastic</b> phase CD 34 + cells (P< 0. 05), but threw no significant effect on normal CD 34 + cells. Conclusions 　Indomethacin may significantly arrest the cell cycle and increase the apoptosis rate of CD 34 + cells isolated from <b>blastic</b> phase chronic myeloid leukemia. It enhances the sensitivity of leukemia CD 34 + cells to imatinib by inhibiting β-catenin expression, suppressing the transcription of c-myc and cyclin D 1 and decreasing the expression of BCR/ABL protein.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} a computer-aided detection (CADe) system for lytic and <b>blastic</b> spinal metastases on computed tomography (CT). Methods We retrospectively evaluated the CADe system on 20 consecutive patients with 42 lytic and on 30 consecutive patients with 172 <b>blastic</b> metastases. The CADe system was trained using CT images of 114 subjects with 102 lytic and 308 <b>blastic</b> spinal metastases. Lesions were annotated by experienced radiologists. Detected benign lesions were con-sidered false-positive findings. Detector sensitivity {{and the number}} of false-positive findings were calculated as the criteria for detector performance, and free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis was conducted. Detailed analysis of false-positive and false-negative find-ings was performed. Results Algorithm runtime is 3 ± 0. 5 min per patient. The system achieves a sensitivity of 83 % at 3. 5 false positives per patient on average for <b>blastic</b> metastases and a sensitiv-ity of 88 % at 3. 7 false positives for lytic metastases. False positives appeared predominantly in the area of degenera-tive changes {{in the case of the}} <b>blastic</b> metastasis detector and in osteoporotic areas in the case of the lytic metastasis detector.
