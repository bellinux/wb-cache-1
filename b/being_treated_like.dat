5|$|In 1992, Raël {{appeared}} on Ciel mon Mardi, a French talk show hosted by journalist Christophe Dechavanne. Toward {{the end of}} the show, Raël's liberal views on sex were critiqued by a priest, a social worker, and a psychologist. A former Raëlian named Jean Parraga believed that his wife and children were being held as prisoners and that Raël attempted to break up his family. He thought they were <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> criminals in activities such as orgies and sacrifice involving children at the Sensual Meditation camp. Parraga also had a criminal record as a drug dealer and car thief, and in August 1992, he attempted to shoot Raël.|$|E
5|$|Frankie adores {{the world}} and goes to visit it every day, <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> royalty by the voice. But one day, when she goes to leave, the friend refuses to allow her and locks every exit in the castle they are abiding in. Bloo, Mac, Coco, Eduardo, and Wilt become curious with her sudden disappearance. They {{go up to the}} attic and enter the toy box, {{discovering}} for themselves the vast world that resides in it. They ask around a small town if anyone has seen a woman of Frankie's description but nobody responds. A group of weeble policemen discover they have entered {{the world and}} chase after them, but the gang are saved by a heroic man. He tries to warn them that their pursuit of Frankie will lead through extremely dangerous environments, but they are determined to rescue her. Mr. Herriman, in the meantime, is outraged by Frankie's disappearance and attempts to find a replacement for her, but to no avail.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{received}} no {{support from the}} Lakers front office, aside from a single call {{the day after the}} fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son {{at the time of the}} punch. His wife recalls her and the children <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to his home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.|$|E

25|$|Historians have {{emphasized}} that the sense of honor was a central concern of upper-class white Southerners. The idea of <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> a second-class citizen was anathema {{and could not be}} tolerated by an honorable southerner. The abolitionist position held that slavery was a negative or evil phenomenon that damaged the rights of white men and the prospects of republicanism. To the white South this rhetoric made Southerners second-class citizens because it trampled what they believed was their Constitutional right to take their chattel property anywhere.|$|E
25|$|Instead of <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> a queen, Caroline {{found that}} her estranged husband's {{accession}} paradoxically made her position worse. On visiting Rome, the pope refused her an audience, and the pope's minister Cardinal Consalvi {{insisted that she}} be greeted only as a duchess of Brunswick, {{and not as a}} queen. In an attempt to assert her rights, she made plans to return to Britain. The King demanded that his ministers get rid of her. He successfully persuaded them to remove her name from the liturgy of the Church of England, but they would not agree to a divorce because they feared the effect of a public trial. The government was weak and unpopular, and a trial detailing salacious details of both Caroline's and George's separate love lives was certain to destabilise it further. Rather than run the risk, the government entered into negotiations with Caroline, and offered her an increased annuity of £50,000 if she stayed abroad.|$|E
25|$|While Duke University’s {{reputation}} grew as {{a national}} educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke’s status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities. Despite Duke University’s reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the professional society, the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse’s maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> a servant: “When I was a nurse’s maid, our second head nurse, Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere—uptown to get the immunizations and {{to put them in}} my refrigerator. She had me run to the library to return her books for her on time.” It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially as a result of unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers.|$|E
5000|$|A family meal {{or staff}} meal {{is a group}} meal that a {{restaurant}} serves its staff outside of peak business hours.

Kerslake, the chairman, offered to resign, while Rose considered similar, but ultimately both continued in their roles. The Somerset players, who {{felt like they were}} <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> criminals by the press, were concerned about what sort of reception they would get at their next match; a home fixture against Hampshire.

500|$|Research on {{acquisition}} of pronouns in ASL {{has shown that}} children do not always {{take advantage of the}} iconic properties of signs when interpreting their meaning. It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun [...] "you", the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused, <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> more <b>like</b> a name. This is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition. It has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall; less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly iconic signs.|$|R

5000|$|The Tao can {{be roughly}} {{thought of as}} the flow of the Universe, or as some essence or pattern behind the natural world that keeps the Universe {{balanced}} and ordered. It is related to the idea of qi, the essential energy of action and existence. The Tao is a non-dualistic principle - it is the greater whole from which all the individual elements of the Universe derive. Keller considers it similar to the negative theology of Western scholars, but the Tao is rarely an object of direct worship, <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> more <b>like</b> the Hindu concepts of karma or dharma than as a divine object. [...] The Tao is more commonly expressed in the relationship between wu (void or emptiness, in the sense of wuji) and yinyang (the natural dynamic balance between opposites), leading to its central principle of wu wei (non-action, or action without force).|$|R

Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> more <b>like</b> an enemy.

40|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of {{countries}} in which a dominant church receives state aid {{and other forms of}} preferential treatment has increased. Dominant religions and their supporters in the former Soviet bloc and elsewhere often argue that special benefits and protection are warranted based upon the unique history and contribution of the dominant church to the identity, history, and culture of the country, and the interests of the state and its citizens. Because of the distinctive status of religion and its importance to national and cultural identity, special protection, especially against foreign and other outside influence, is deemed necessary. Although the spiritual realm is putatively <b>treated</b> as <b>being</b> a special situation requiring special protection, the arguments in favor of religious protection bear a curious resemblance to arguments in favor of protection made by monopolists and other protected industries in the economic sphere. This article compares the arguments in favor of protection made by dominant religious groups with arguments in favor of protection by monopolists and protected industries, and concludes that in their pleas for special treatment, religious monopolists make arguments that closely parallel the arguments made by their economic counterparts. Rather than resulting in religion <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> as unique and different, protectionist arguments result in religion <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> much <b>like</b> any other market commodity. We conclude that because religious freedom is a fundamental human right, arguments promoting state protection of dominant religions should be viewed with suspicion...|$|R

2500|$|The word vagina is {{commonly}} avoided in conversation, {{and many people}} are confused about its anatomy, {{including the fact that}} the vagina is not used for urination. This is exacerbated by phrases such as [...] "boys have a penis, girls have a vagina", which causes children to think that girls have one orifice in the pelvic area. Author Hilda Hutcherson stated, [...] "Because many [...] have been conditioned since childhood through verbal and nonverbal cues to think of [...] genitals as ugly, smelly and unclean, [...] aren't able to fully enjoy intimate encounters" [...] because of fear that their partner will dislike the sight, smell, or taste of their genitals. She argued that women, unlike men, did not have locker room experiences in school where they compared each other's genitals, which is one reason so many women wonder if their genitals are normal. Scholar Catherine Blackledge stated that having a vagina meant she would typically be treated less well than her vagina-less counterparts and subject to inequalities (such as job inequality), which she categorized as <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> <b>like</b> a second-class citizen.|$|E

5000|$|For example, if a song is in C Major, and the {{songwriter}} aims {{to get to}} {{a chorus}} that focuses on the dominant chord (G Major) <b>being</b> tonicized (<b>treated</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "home key" [...] for a short period), he could use a chord progression for the pre-chorus that gets the listener ready to hear the chorus' chord (G Major) as an arrival key. One widely used way to accomplish this is to precede the G Major chord with its own ii-V7 chords. In the key given, ii of G Major would be an A minor chord. V7 of G Major would be D7. As such, with the example song, this could be done by having a pre-chorus that consists of one bar of a minor and one bar of D7. This would lead the listener to expect a resolution from ii-V to I, which in this case is the temporary tonic of G Major. The chord a minor would not be unusual to the listener, as it is a shared chord that exists in both G Major and C Major. A minor is the ii chord in G Major, and it is the vi chord in C Major. The chord that would alert the listener that a change was taking place is the D7 chord. There is no D7 chord in C Major. A listener experienced with popular and traditional music would hear that this is a secondary dominant. Harmonic theorists and arrangers would call it V7/V or [...] "five of five", as the D7 chord is the dominant (or fifth) chord of G Major.|$|R
