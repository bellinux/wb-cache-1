After the social instability and sharp economic depression {{that emerged in the}} wake of World War I, many Americans in the 1920s saw business and city growth as foundations for stability. The civic boosters and self-made men of the middle-class represented particularly American depictions of success, {{at a time when the}} promotion of the American identity was crucial in the face of rising fears of Communism. At the same time, growing Midwestern cities, usually associated with mass production and the emergence of a consumer society, were also celebrated emblems of American progress. George F. Babbitt, the novels main character, is described by the 1930 Nobel Prize committee as [...] "the ideal of an American popular hero of the middle-class. The relativity of <b>business</b> <b>morals</b> as well as private rules of conduct is for him an accepted article of faith, and without hesitation he considers it Gods purpose that man should work, increase his income, and enjoy modern improvements." ...|$|E

In this condition, the uniformity of values is required by human to create a well-ordered life. It is religion, as the highest authority of truth that could launch a uniformity of values.

40|$|Morals {{are shared}} {{understandings}} in which humans ’ highest aspirations and dreams come to fulfillment, and the underpinnings of many, if not all, collective human pursuits. Whether in everyday settings or at critical life junctures, morals {{allow us to}} distinguish right from wrong and good from bad. They guide and justify thought and action in all arenas of social life. But are there any such things as corporate morals? Put otherwise, do members of corporations (particularly those leading them) have a shared understanding of their world, and the world more broadly? And if so, what might this shared understanding look like? What are corporate morals? Before corporations gained the prominence they have today, Emile Durkheim dismissed the notion of corporate morals. He viewed what he called, at the time, <b>business</b> <b>morals,</b> like {{any other kind of}} morals—family morals, say, or civic morals—as shared meanings that emanate from a given social structure and the communal life of its members (Durkheim, 1973).

40|$|Moral {{hypocrisy}} is {{motivation to}} appear moral yet, if possible, avoid {{the cost of}} actually being <b>moral.</b> In <b>business,</b> <b>moral</b> hypocrisy allows one to engender trust, solve the commitment problem, and still relentlessly pursue personal gain. Indicating {{the power of this}} motive, research has provided clear and consistent evidence that, given the opportunity, many people act to appear fair (e. g., they flip a coin to distribute resources between themselves and another person) without actually being fair (they accept the flip only if it favors themselves). New evidence also indicates the power of moral hypocrisy in a situation more obviously relevant to business, resource allocation when one party has information about relative resource value that the other does not. Characteristics of modern business situations likely to encourage moral hypocrisy are outlined. We conclude that moral hypocrisy is not only a pragmatic virtue in modern business but is also fast becoming a prescriptive one.

40|$|Education for Sustainability (EfS) is {{variously}} recognised by universities as part {{of becoming}} a sustaining organisation; central to institutions' moral obligations in terms of graduate capabilities; and essential to curriculum innovation, reinvention and renewal. However, its implementation into curricula on a global basis is variable, with some countries being more advanced than others. At the discipline level, sustainability may be embedded as core content, or given only tokenistic support through elective offerings. This paper examines EfS as both a <b>business</b> and <b>moral</b> driver of curriculum change in universities and the associated barriers that may be encountered during implementation. The results from desktop research and semi-structured interviews with employees responsible for sustainability programs from four universities in the metropolitan region of Sydney, Australia, are presented.

In this paper the following inputs are being given in order to get a clear picture if Macedonian companies are keen on to learning and stimulating the individual and collective learning as to improve the results in general. According to the given results in the research, it is stated that Macedonian companies do not care about the quality, insufficiently pay attention to the continuous education, make small investments in the innovations and over all, the quality system is built in a very small number of companies. In this paper the following model for a successful designing and implementing of the educational system as a subsystem of the house of quality is suggested. This methodology is integral and universal meaning it is applicable to all companies and institutions. Without a given training about TQM (Total Quality Management) philosophy and a continued education provided firstly to the managers and further on to all the employees, the TQM strategy could not be implemented as well as the benefits that come with the quality system.
