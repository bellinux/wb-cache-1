Since the high-gain antennas are equipped by the RS, a higher data transmission speed can be achieved for the transmission from BS to RS with the limited bandwidth and transmission power, {{as compared to the}} BS-MS link. Also, when the MS is close to the BS, the high speed transmission from the MS to the BS can also be achieved without taking any additional licensed frequency band by using a low transmission power. As a result, as compared with the BS-MS link, assisted by the EH RS, multiple MSs may be served simultaneously with the bandwidth and transmission power used for a single BS-MS link, achieving higher downlink transmission speed, i.e., improve the service quality without taking the additional resources of the BS.|$|E

To avoid limited lifetime issues, we assume each sensor is capable of harvesting all the energy it needs for the communication from the environment.

For networks with replenishment, conservative energy expenditure may lead to missed recharging opportunities due to battery capacity limitations, while aggressive usage of energy may result in reduced coverage or connectivity for certain time periods.

40|$|Energy {{harvesters}} {{are widely}} used to power wireless sensor systems, but the produced power is generally low, and can vary abruptly due {{to changes in the}} environment or the device's location. Energy <b>buffers</b> (<b>batteries</b> or supercapacitors) are normally incorporated into systems to smooth out these variations. However, they have a limited lifetime and increase system size and cost. Transient computing aims to address these issues by removing the energy buffer, and powering the system directly from the energy harvester. Approaches such as Hibernus++ deal with the resultant power intermittency by `hibernating', i. e. saving a snapshot of the system state to non-volatile memory before a power failure, and restoring it after the power recovers. The overheads of this can be particularly costly with a low-current harvester, as the system may wake up and hibernate at a high frequency, doing little useful work in each power cycle. 	 This paper proposes an enhancement to these approaches, providing an efficient method to avoid repeated hibernation. The introduction of a `sleep' state, which is entered when the power supply is detected to be failing, allows the system's supply voltage to recover without taking a snapshot. Thus, the application can spend more time on useful work rather than checkpointing. If the supply voltage continues to decline, a snapshot will then be taken. The approach has been simulated and experimentally validated, with results demonstrating that the proposed scheme provides up to a 65 % improvement in system active run-time with low-current harvesters vs. conventional Hibernus++...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Environmental Resources Engineering Option, 2009 This thesis {{reports on}} the {{long-term}} performance and compares two system arrangements of the Schatz Solar Hydrogen Project (SSHP), an off-grid solar hydrogen research project with twenty years of history. The SSHP is designed to continuously power a 500 W load and includes a 7 kW mono-Si photovoltaic (PV) array, a 6 kW alkaline electrolyzer, a 1 kW PEM fuel cell, and 3. 8 kg of H 2 storage in tanks with a volume of 5. 7 cubic meters. For the PV array, I observed array-level performance degradation of 1. 3 %/year. For the electrolyzer, I observed an unexpected improvement in the voltage efficiency over time (0. 8 %/year) and identified a source of measurement error that may be endemic to alkaline electrolyzers in research applications. In 2006 my colleagues and I redesigned the power-handling and control system, shifting from a "direct connect'' arrangement (utilizing relays for equipment connections) to a "decoupled'' arrangement (utilizing DC/DC converters for connections). After correcting for long-term performance trends, I made comparisons between the "control efficiency" of the arrangements, a measure of system control effectiveness compared to the ideal case. The decoupled system {{is more effective than}} the original SSHP direct-connect system based on control efficiency (78 % vs. 74 %). The counter-intuitive trend I found in electrolyzer performance decreased the effectiveness of the direct connect system, which would have performed better with a correct prediction of the trend in the design phase.

40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicles {{are characterized by}} {{the existence of an}} electric energy buffer in the powertrain. Compared to a conventional vehicle the existence of the buffer means an extra degree of freedom in the powertrain. The driver's request for a specific power demand can thus be met by a combination of power from the primary power unit (internal combustion engines or fuel cells) and power from the electric <b>buffer</b> (<b>batteries</b> or ultracapacitors). The subject of this thesis is the control of the load distribution between the power sources in the hybrid electric powertrain. The control problem is to choose the distribution of power from the electric buffer and primary power unit that minimizes the fuel consumption in the long run. To solve this problem the efficiency characteristics of the components in the powertrain must be considered. It is the advantage of hybrids to have the extra degree of freedom because of the buffer so that the primary power unit can be driven independent of the transient traction demand of the vehicle powertrain. The improvement in the fuel consumption is obtained by the operation of the engine in a more efficient region. Furthermore, when the vehicle is braking, the electric energy generated by the traction system can be stored back in the buffer. In conventional vehicles this braking energy is dissipated into the atmosphere. The problem is complicated {{due to the fact that}} the future driving demands are largely unknown. This uncertainty of the future driving makes it difficult, from a fuel efficiency viewpoint, to compare the cost of supplying the energy demand from the buffer or the fuel tank. In this thesis this problem is handled by using a prediction based information perspective. It allows utilization of a policy derived by Dynamic Programming. Using a simple model of the power flows, energy levels and a regression model of the future driving, the resulting policy minimizes the expected fuel consumption with respect to the prediction model of the future driving conditions. Additional information from GPS and digital maps or cooperation with the traffic infrastructure further enhances the optimization in terms of improved predictions and constraints and can be used to better schedule the use of the buffer so that further fuel consumption reductions are achieved...|$|R

30|$|The {{probabilistic}} routing schemes {{are based}} on the heuristic that if a node has interacted with a group of nodes in the past, it will do so again in the future. On the other hand, social routing assumes that the mobility of node is due to the mobility of its carrier (social beings, mostly humans). Therefore, movement of node follows a pattern known as social-based movement pattern. In such movement model, contacts established between nodes are not random; rather, they {{are based on}} the interest of social beings. Both probabilistic and social routing have two basic limitations. Firstly, the two approaches exploit only opportunistic contact wherein a message is forwarded by a node, say A, to the first node, say B, encountered with higher delivery probability than A. This is true, even if a node, say C, with higher message delivery probability than B is available in the neighbour of A. Secondly, their performance in terms of message delivery ratio heavily depends upon the function chosen to compute the message delivery probability of nodes. In some of the routing approaches [8, 11, 12], delivery probability of node is computed using multiple attributes of node such as <b>buffer</b> space, <b>battery</b> level, colocation of nodes etc. Values to these multiple attributes is provided by context awareness of nodes.|$|R
