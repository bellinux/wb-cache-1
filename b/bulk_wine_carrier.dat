40|$|Wine brokers are {{wholesale}} intermediaries. They {{belong to}} the category of the matchmaker intermediaries. These middlemen are not well known.

40|$|AbstractThe biologically active stilbenoids-resveratrol and its glucosides were {{identified}} in the dry <b>bulk</b> <b>wines</b> of different types made with red-grape vintage variety of Saperavi (Vitis vinifera L.) : cis-resveratrol, trans-resveratrol, cis-piceid and trans-piceid. Red and pink wines were made by different technology: I – dry, pink, of a European type; alcoholic fermentation with natural microflora; II – dry, pink, of a European type; alcoholic fermentation with dry yeast “B 2000 ”. III – red, dry; alcoholic fermentation with no-stem pomace and aging on it for 5 months; IV – dry, red, of a Kakhetian type; alcoholic fermentation with stem pomace with natural microflora and aging on it for 5 months; V – dry, red, of a Kakhetian type, with preliminary fermentation of cluster stems, then, alcoholic fermentation with natural microflora and aging on it for 5 months. The impact of the wine-making technology on the variability of the concentrations of these substances is proved. Kakhetian <b>bulk</b> <b>wines</b> (IV and V) also differ from one another. Bulk wine-V made by the fermentation of grappa fermented in advance contains little concentration of study stilbenoids {{as a result of}} the oxidation transformations caused by the preliminary treatment.

40|$|French wine brokers are {{independent}} matchmaker intermediaries. They help {{buyers and sellers}} of <b>bulk</b> <b>wine</b> to meet and transact. This paper aims to identify the determinants of the wine brokers' use. We use a transaction cost approach and we hypothesize that buyers and sellers use brokers because they may reduce costs associated with transactions on <b>bulk</b> <b>wine.</b> A database of contracts on bulk vins de table and vins de pays is used to estimate a logistic regression of the probability of “broker intervention. ” We show that if the sellers {{do not belong to}} a cooperative production structure and if the buyers do not belong to the productive sphere it increases the recourse to brokers. Also, the extent of the production area and the potential quality variance among wine growers {{and the size of the}} contract positively influence the use of brokers.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to understand}} why French wine producers venture into direct sale to customers instead of selling <b>bulk</b> <b>wine</b> to wine companies. The empirical tests on the French Farm Census confirm the value of both Resource-Based Perspective and Transaction Cost Economics in understanding organizational choices in agriculture and food markets. Because asset specificity in wine trade is low on average, large wine producers have an advantage over smaller ones and so {{are more likely to}} venture into direct sale of generic wines. By contrast smaller wine producers are more likely to rely on the <b>bulk</b> <b>wine</b> market, which is less risky for them. In addition our model helps us to understand the effect of the State-sponsored certification of grape and wine quality, the Protected Designation of Origin system. All other things being equal, producers with vineyards of high reputation (PDO) {{are also more likely to}} bottle and sell their wines; we guess this is because they wish to capture the value of the PDO reputation, the collective brand name capital owned by the farmers. Finally, saving on transaction cost is only one side of the coin: the most educated wine producers can profitably reinvest their knowledge and capabilities into new activities. These choices have important consequence on the French Wine Supply Chain governance...|$|R

50|$|Vineyard {{planting}} and production remained modest {{until the middle}} of the 1990s when the industry began to expand rapidly. In 1996 there were just 11 wineries in the Central Otago region, according to New Zealand Winegrowers, accounting for just 4.6% of the national total. By 2004 this had risen to 75 wineries and 16.2%. Over the same period, the area planted with vines rose from 92 hectares (1.4% of the national total) to 1,062 hectares (5.1%). Reflecting this rapid expansion, the long lead-time for planting to come into production, and the focus in Central Otago on quality <b>wines</b> rather than <b>bulk</b> <b>wines,</b> actual wine production accounted for only 0.5% (376 tonnes) of the New Zealand total in 1996, increasing to 0.9% (1,439 tonnes) in 2004.|$|R
