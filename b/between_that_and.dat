As of 2008, Haiti had not participated at a Winter Olympics. The delegation that Haiti sent to Beijing included seven athletes across three sports. With four female athletes, more women participated for Haiti in Beijing than at any single Olympic games before. Prior to Beijing, athletes from Haiti had won one silver medal (by Silvio Cator in 1928) and one bronze medal (by five athletes in 1924). Between then and including the 2008 Olympics, Haitian athletes had not won medals in any event. Moise Joseph, an athlete of the University of Florida, was destined to participate for Haiti in Beijing, but did not compete.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both Marge and Mr. Burns want Homer {{to go on}} {{the same}} rafting trip. Homer starts with being on his family's raft, and then swims back and forth <b>between</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Burns's raft. Marge discovers that he has double booked the weekend while both rafts float near a waterfall, and is upset that he chose to do work on a family outing. Homer can only save one raft, and he saves the one {{containing}} his family. As Mr. Burns and the executives are about to go over the waterfall, Marlowe rides up on a motorboat and carries Mr. Burns to safety, while the executives fall over the edge. Homer goes over the waterfall by himself, but is completely unharmed and finds gold. Later, at their house, Homer tells Marge that he is a safety inspector again. Fireworks go off outside, and it is revealed that they were caused by a fire at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, presumably because Homer failed at his job.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} {{office for}} the construction was established in 1923 and was until 1935 located at Voss. In that period, construction was led by Peter Bernhard Kristian Lahlum, who was also responsible for the Hardanger Line. After the Hardanger Line was completed, Lahlum retired, and the office was moved to Flåm where responsibility {{was taken over by}} Adolph M. B. Kielland. To start with, there were 120 men working on the construction, although this quickly increased to 220. The numbers fluctuated <b>between</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> as low as 80, although hit an all-time high of 280 people in 1937. To house the employees, eight barracks were built. Among the first things built were housing and station buildings, which could then be used by people working on the construction. The local economy was stimulated by farmers being paid for transport. Using horses, they would transport tourists by day and building materials by night. The competition was fierce, resulting in fights for customers, although it calmed down after traffic police were introduced.|$|E

At the next show, Round Robin Challenge III, the title {{switched}} three times among the teams in the round robin challenge, the Second City Saints (Punk and Cabana), the Briscoe Brothers, and the Prophecy team of Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer. The Briscoes defeated Maff and Whitmer in the fourth match of the night to win the title for a second time, and then lost it back to Punk and Cabana in the main event. The Brothers both participated in ROH's inaugural Survival of the Fittest tournament, with Mark going over Alex Shelley in his qualifier and Jay falling to Homicide. Mark did not, however, win the elimination final. After losing a two out of three falls tag team title match to Punk and Cabana at Death Before Dishonor II Part 1, ending that feud, they lost in separate singles matches to members of The Rottweilers the next night. <b>Between</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> their victory in tag team action at Testing the Limit, it is likely that a feud was planned between the Briscoes and the Rottweilers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} months before Zimbabwe's central bank reforms of 30 April 2008, {{virtually}} all popular currency conversion resources relied upon the official rate of 30,000 ZWD to 1 USD for published figures, {{in spite of}} the vast differences <b>between</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> free market rates. By 23 May 2008, Bloomberg and Oanda began publishing floating rates based on Zimbabwe's formally regulated domestic bank market, while Yahoo Finance started using the updated official rate in July, albeit with a decimal point shift of 6 places. Those reported rates generally reflected the Official Rate as shown in the above table. They soon began to differ, in overvaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar, increasingly substantially in comparison to less regulated markets such as offshore markets or paper cash freely traded on the streets of Harare, reflected above as Parallel Rates.|$|E

In his view, the book [...] "has the indisputable merit of showing that the existence of complex societies is a biological phenomenon. By emphasizing the relationships between animal behavior and population genetics, Wilson compels us to recognize the evolutionary significance of events which social scientists often treat without reference to Darwinian biology." [...] But there was [...] "a large gap" [...] <b>between</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> the work of most political scientists, and it was too early to attempt to apply sociobiology directly to human social issues in practice.

Alike Stewart, Melissa Maerz for Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jump" [...] was one of her top recommendations to listen to along with [...] "Diamonds". Stacey-Ann Ellis for Vibe thought that [...] "Jump" [...] could be [...] "mosh-inducing" [...] if played in a nightclub.

Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars <b>between</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar.

[...] Conservative leader Edward Michener attacked the government's speech from the throne for failing to commit itself on railway policy and attacked Sifton for failing to call a general election or seek the confidence of the legislature during his first half year in office. [...] In the meantime, Sifton was facing a breach in his own party on the railway question. [...] Many Liberals from the south of the province, including Sifton himself, felt inclined to abandon the construction of [...] "pioneer" [...] railways (such as the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) designed to hasten the settlement of the province's emptier areas, and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres. [...] Members from the north of the province, who comprised most of the Liberal caucus, disagreed, and were vehement in their insistence that the A be built. [...] Even among this latter group there were divisions: some Liberals agreed with the Conservatives that the railway should be directly built by the government, while others, including Cross, favoured a partnership with a [...] "responsible company". [...] These divisions were not calmed by the release of the commission's report, whose majority condemned Rutherford and Cross for poor judgment even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour.|$|E
