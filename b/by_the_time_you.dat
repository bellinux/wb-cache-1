[...] But the best {{performance}} of the album is definitely 'Like a Prayer'. The talented voices of the Glee cast, backed by a full choir, masterfully carry the lyrics to greater heights." [...] Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly gave it an [...] "A" [...] rating, explaining [...] "Sue hilariously revises the spoken-word bit on 'Vogue', and the Glee guys give a surprisingly tender reading of 'What It Feels Like for a Girl'. Go ahead— open your heart." [...] David Hiltbrand from Star Tribune gave a negative review of the EP saying that [...] "things go downhill as soon as Jane Lynch starts camping up the spoken portion of 'Vogue'. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> get to 'Like a Virgin' and '4 Minutes', the songs sound overproduced and melodramatic, more show tune than disco." ...|$|E
500|$|Of the European shows, {{critical}} reaction was generally quite favorable.

[...] The Independent echoed the sentiment in reviewing the Hyde Park show, writing that he showed [...] "the vigour of a frontman {{a third of his}} age" [...] and that [...] "Springsteen's intensity was staggering from first powerful vocal to final thrashed-out chord." [...] The Bath Chronicle saluted Springsteen's performance at Glastonbury, saying [...] "As all the tickets were sold before Springsteen was even confirmed on the bill, he must have known he was facing something very rare for him – the musical equivalent of a sporting 'away match' where not everyone was necessarily a worshipper at the altar of Bruce." [...] They concluded that Springsteen gave [...] "a performance of passion, exuberance, exhilaration and musical majesty" [...] while sticking with his standard tour set list and not resorting to playing many of his better-known hits.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell [...] "there {{was never a}} decent studio in Seattle and now there's one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it". Bad Animals' resident engineer Adam Kasper, {{who went on to}} produce Soundgarden's following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, [...] "Michael Beinhorn was so into sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss out of us a lot of the time... <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> get the sounds that you want to record the song, you're sick and tired of playing it." [...] Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band's sound, in what Billboard described as [...] "weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power". For instance, prior to recording the vocals of [...] "Black Hole Sun", Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.|$|E
