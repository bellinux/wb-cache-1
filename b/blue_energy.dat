500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the other two}} species, Protoss units and buildings display smooth and elegant designs, usually emphasising gold and blue colors on armor and vehicles/ships and feature <b>blue</b> <b>energy</b> highlights. The dark templar units tend to display silver rather than gold and have green energy highlights. In Starcraft II Protoss are also featured in dark shades with green energy highlights. These Protoss were corrupted by the Hybrids. The Protoss Tal'Darim faction sports black/grey with red colors and also features red energy highlights. Last but not least the Purifiers sport generally white with black accents and feature orange energy highlights. Protoss units are generally more expensive [...] and slower to produce in-game compared to Zerg or Terran units, but are conversely also more powerful and efficient in combat. All Protoss units and buildings are covered by a regenerating energy shield, further increasing the amount of damage that they can endure, although the Protoss previously had no way of healing or repairing their units. By 2505 in the StarCraft timeline, specifically in the Legacy of the Void expansion to StarCraft II, the Protoss develop a new method to restore their energy shields, by using one of their [...] "spellcaster" [...] units, Sentries.|$|E
2500|$|The Blue Beetle scarab is grafted onto Jaime's {{spine and}} can {{manifest}} {{a number of}} powers of its own volition, an act usually accompanied by <b>blue</b> <b>energy</b> emitted by the scarab's [...] "antennae". Over {{the course of the}} first year of his ongoing series, Jaime had little, if any, control over those powers, but slowly asserts himself. When Jaime is in danger, the scarab activates, crawling out on to Jaime's back and generating a high-tech suit of powered armor around his body. The armor is resilient enough that it can protect him against re-entry from Earth's orbit. When the danger passes, the scarab deactivates, dissolving the costume and retracting back onto Jaime's spine, causing intense pain.|$|E

Goku is depicted as carefree, cheerful and friendly when at ease, but quickly serious and strategic-minded when in battle. He is able to concentrate his Ki and use it for devastatingly powerful energy-based attacks; the most prominent being his signature , in which Goku launches a <b>blue</b> <b>energy</b> blast from his palms. Also pure of heart, Goku has frequently granted mercy to his enemies, which has often earned him additional allies in the process (though has also resulted in others taking advantage of his kindness), and he is one of the few who can ride the magic cloud called which was another element adapted from Journey to the West.|$|E

50|$|Against the {{background}} of its long experience with ocean engineering {{and the development of}} renewable energy sources, DEME established a fully owned new company in early 2010 which is called DEME <b>Blue</b> <b>Energy.</b> DBE focuses on wave energy and tidal energy, including the development of appropriate technology and prototype equipment {{that could be used to}} generate electricity. In 2010 a consortium of industrial partners, named Flanders Electricity from the Sea (FlanSea), submitted a research project for developing a wave energy converter (WEC) which will undergo an instrumented test in the summer of 2012. DEME <b>Blue</b> <b>Energy</b> is a member of the FlanSea consortium, together with Ghent University, the port of Oostende, and others. If successful, the new technology could be installed in between the offshore wind turbines of the Thorntonbank Wind Farm, creating a synergy between two different sources of renewable energy. In September 2010 the Flemish Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT) granted a €2.4 million subsidy for the FlanSea project. The FlanSea wave energy converter will be a so-called point absorber, modelled after the B1-device off Southeast Norway which was developed under the European funded SEEWEC project, co-ordinated by Prof. dr. ir. Julien De Rouck of the Department of Coastal Engineering at Ghent University, Belgium. Besides the FlanSea project, DEME <b>Blue</b> <b>Energy</b> is also involved in other initiatives. DEME <b>Blue</b> <b>Energy</b> is a founding member of Friends of the Supergrid, established in London on 8 March 2010 with the objective to help develop a pan-European offshore super grid for renewable energy. DEME <b>Blue</b> <b>Energy</b> is also a partner and shareholder in Renewable Energy Base Oostende (REBO), founded on 28 October 2010 for servicing offshore wind farms in Northwest Europe.|$|E
