40|$|The millimeter-wave {{frequency}} band spectrum represents {{a great opportunity}} for ultrahigh-speed, short-range wireless communications and a wealth of new applications such as target positioning or tracking. However, a number of challenges remain for this spectrum to be a viable solution for high-volume consumer applications. One challenge is the determination of the electromagnetic properties of dielectric substrate packaging materials and metamorphic structures. This is vital for the optimal and robust design of beamforming mm-wave systems. In this thesis we present "The Covered Transmission Line Method", a new method to determine the complex permittivity of printed circuit and packaging materials at the mm-wave frequencies. This method is relevant in that it allows for testing of a variety of materials without changes on the setup and with minimal sample processing. Some applications however, require more advanced materials, called metamorphic materials, which are able to change their response to electromagnetic waves. We present in here a unique electromagnetically metamorphic material that can undergo four distinct electromagnetic states (Perfect Electric Conductor, Perfect Magnetic Conductor, Perfect Amplification and Perfect Absorption). Fundamental mathematical and electromagnetic analysis has been used to obtain a full wave analytical model of the scattering properties of this novel composite material. For the first time, a truly metamorphic surface that can precisely be tuned to any electromagnetic state has been fabricated and tested. This is achieved by loading the basic elements (printed circular rings) of the surface with active devices (tunnel diodes) that can sweep their terminal resistance from a high negative to a high positive value. The combination of small wavelength and large available bandwidth make mm-wave target positioning systems a viable option to achieve the desired accuracy. However, such systems require the use of beamforming mm-wave antenna systems to mitigate the high path losses (there are 21 dB more path losses at 60 GHz than at 5 GHz). In this work, we present a novel high-gain beam selection 60 GHz <b>band</b> <b>Grid</b> Array antenna that fulfills the requirements of beamforming, low-cost and small size for integration with mobile devices. Regarding target positioning applications, we study the impact of using beamforming mm-wave antenna systems on the location precision of multiple targets in a realistic indoor environment. The positioning error is assessed when omnidirectional antennas are used at the receiving sensors and when they are substituted by beamforming antennas...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to {{magnitude}} levels below 4. 0 {{will require}} use of regional seismic data recorded at distances {{of less than}} 2000 km. To improve regional discriminant performance we tested three different methods of correcting for path effects, and the third method includes a correction for source-scaling. We used regional recordings of broadband from stations in and near China. Our first method removes trends between phase ratios and physical parameters associated with each event-station path. This approach requires knowledge of the physical parameters along an event-station path, such as topography, basin thickness, and crustal thickness. Our second approach is somewhat more empirical. We examine spatial distributions of phase amplitudes after subtracting event magnitude and correcting for path distance. For a given station, phase, and frequency <b>band,</b> we <b>grid</b> and then smooth the magnitude-corrected and distance-corrected amplitudes to create a map representing a correction surface. We reference these maps to correct phase amplitudes prior to forming discrimination ratios. Our third approach is the most complicated, but also the most rigorous. For a given station and phase, we invert the spectra {{of a number of}} well-recorded earthquakes for source and path parameters. We then use the values obtained from the inversion to correct phase amplitudes for the effects of source size, distance, and attenuation. Finally,the amplitude residuals are gridded and smoothed to create a correction surface representing secondary path effects. We find that simple ratio- parameter corrections can improve discrimination performance along some paths (such as Kazakh Test Site (KTS) to WMQ), but for other paths (such as Lop Nor to AAK) the corrections are not beneficial. Our second method, the empirical path correction surfaces, improves discrimination performance for Lop Nor to AAK paths. Our third method, combined source and path corrections, has only been tested at WMQ (primarily using KTS explosions and northwest China earthquakes), but the method successfully corrects for source-scaling and propagation effects. We favor this combined source and path correction technique over the other correction methods, and we plan to test this method at other Asian stations. 11 refs., 7 figs...|$|R

The computation itself alternates between two steps: first, an explicit time step is performed using standard finite difference techniques on a narrow <b>band</b> of <b>grid</b> points surrounding the surface embedded in a higher dimension; second, a closest point extension is used to maintain consistency with the original surface PDE. The Closest Point Method {{is applied to the}} important problem of interface motion on surfaces by using level set equations posed on surfaces. New weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) interpolation schemes are derived to perform the necessary closest point extensions. This approach, in combination with standard Hamilton [...] Jacobi WENO finite difference schemes and explicit time stepping, gives high-order results (up to fifth-order) on a variety of test problems. Example computations are performed on a sphere, torus, triangulated human hand and Klein bottle to demonstrate the flexibility of the method. A new implicit Closest Point Method is presented for surface PDEs which are stiff, for example, because of diffusion terms. The method uses implicit time-stepping schemes to allow large steps but retains the flexibility with respect to surface geometry of the original explicit Closest Point Method. Numerical convergence studies on the heat equation and a fourth-order biharmonic problem demonstrate the accuracy of the method and a variety of example computations demonstrate its effectiveness. These include an image processing example of blurring on triangulated surfaces, heat diffusion on a surface consisting of multiple components connected by a thin filament and Turing pattern formation on surfaces using implicit [...] explicit (IMEX) time stepping.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 The {{scattering}} of electromagnetic waves by lossy dielectric random rough surfaces with large permittivity has broad applications in natural media. Because many of natural medium are lossy and with surface roughness. In {{the application of}} the Method of Moment to the lossy dielectric rough surfaces with high permittivity, there can be rapid spatial variations of the dielectric medium Green's function and surface fields. A dense discretization of the surface may be required. Therefore there is a large increase in CPU and required memory. To circumvent the problem, the physics-based two-grid (PBTG) method was developed in this dissertation. In PBTG, two grids are used: a dense grid and a sparse grid. The sparse grid is that of the usual 8 to 10 points per wavelength. The dense grid ranges from 16 or higher number of points per wavelength depending on the relative permittivity of the lossy dielectric medium. The PBTG is based on two observations: (1) the Green's function of the lossy dielectric is attenuative and therefore is space-limited, and (2) the Green's function of free-space is slowly varying on the dense grid compared with the medium Green's function and therefore is spatial frequency-limited. The first observation results in a banded matrix for 1 -dimensional rough surface and a sparse matrix for 2 -dimensional rough surface for the Green's function of the lossy dielectric. The second observation allows us, when using the free-space Green's function to act on the surface fields of dense grid, to first average the values of surface unknowns on the dense grid and then place them on the coarse grid. Thus the PBTG speeds up the computation and yet preserves the accuracy of the solution. The surface fields are calculated on the dense grid. The PBTG can be applied to both 1 -dimensional and 2 -dimensional rough surfaces and can be easily used in conjunction with the other fast methods. The PBTG is combined with the <b>banded</b> matrix-iterative approach/canonical <b>grid</b> (BMIA/CAG) and the multilevel steepest descent fast multipole method (MLSDFMM) for 1 -dimensional random rough surfaces and with sparse matrix canonical grid method (SMCG) for 2 -dimensional random rough surfaces in this dissertation...|$|R
