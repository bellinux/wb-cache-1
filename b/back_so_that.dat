5|$|Royal Tunbridge Wells is policed by Kent Police, and in May 2000 {{the main}} police station {{for the area}} moved from Royal Tunbridge Wells to a new {{building}} in Tonbridge and operations at the Royal Tunbridge Wells station, in Crescent Road, were scaled <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it now operates as an administrative centre. Fire services are carried out by Kent Fire and Rescue Service, which operates one station in Grove Hill Road that is manned 24 hours a day by both full-time and retained firefighters.|$|E
5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} rectangular, the width {{at the front}} is still smaller than the width at the back. There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid nearly to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width at the front is virtually equal to the width at the <b>back,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the tooth is about rectangular. The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one at the back.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed {{a variant of the}} gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross-bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his <b>back,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|E
50|$|A kakemono ("hanging thing"), more {{commonly}} referred to as a kakejiku ("hung scroll"), is a Japanese scroll painting or calligraphy mounted usually with silk fabric edges on a flexible <b>backing,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it can be rolled for storage.|$|R

5|$|Mimi had {{relatives}} in Eketahuna, New Zealand, because her maternal aunt, Harriet Millward, had married and moved there. Mimi had exchanged letters with her relatives over the years, so Lennon {{arranged for a}} tour of New Zealand in 1964. The success of The Beatles caused problems for {{her and she was}} constantly pestered by fans at 'Mendips', so she sold the house for £6,000 in 1965; Lennon bought her a £25,000 bungalow by the beach called Harbour's Edge in Sandbanks, at 126 Panorama Road, Poole, Dorset, which was her home {{for the rest of her}} life. The Lennons and their son visited her there in the summer of 1965, which was the last time all three of them visited the house together. Lennon later gave his aunt his MBE medal, but later asked for it <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he could return it in protest.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{grew from}} {{strength}} to strength and by 1907 the congregation numbered 150, with school attendance at 60. In time plans {{were made for}} a larger, more permanent church. This {{was the brainchild of}} Father Thomas Moloney, who bought the current presbytery and acquired the land that stood at the <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> a church could be built. The foundation stone was eventually laid on Low Sunday 1931 by Archbishop Alban Goodier, an English Jesuit who had been Archbishop of Bombay between 1919 and 1926. The new church, in Oxford Road, was designed by the diocesan architect, T. H. B. Scott. It was built of brick in the Romanesque style, seating 350. The church was built quickly and opened by Cardinal Bourne on 29 September 1931. It was officially consecrated on 14 May 1936, after its debts were cleared.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day, Liz {{goes to her}} dentist {{appointment}} and tells the receptionist {{that she did not}} sign the waiver. After her surgery, Liz reassures the dental staff that the anesthesia is having no effect on her and can take herself home. In the lobby, Liz sees her former boyfriends Drew Baird (Jon Hamm), Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), and Floyd DeBarber (Jason Sudeikis), and is moved that they came <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> she not be alone on Valentine's Day. Liz is hallucinating, however, and the people she sees as Drew, Dennis, and Floyd are actually the three Jamaican women who are dental assistants at the oral surgeon's office. One of them calls Jack, Liz's boss, asking if he could come pick up Liz and take her home. Jack had just spent the night with Avery, who thinks that the phone call was made up by Jack as an excuse to end the date, but when he invites her to come along, she is impressed by his kindness to Liz.|$|E

50|$|The tintype's {{immediate}} predecessor, the ambrotype, {{was done}} by the same process of using a sheet of glass as the support. The glass was either of a dark color or provided with a black <b>backing</b> <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> as with a tintype, the underexposed negative image in the emulsion appeared as a positive. Tintypes were sturdy and did not require mounting in a protective hard case like ambrotypes and daguerreotypes.|$|R

5|$|The round ribbontail ray has nocturnal {{habits and}} rests {{motionless}} {{for much of}} the day, often near vertical structures, in caves, or under ledges. It may be solitary, or form small to large groups. This ray is frequently shadowed by one or more jacks or cobia (Rachycentron canadum); these smaller fishes may feed on food stirred up by the ray's activities, or use the ray's body as cover for approaching their own prey. The round ribbontail ray hunts for bivalves, crabs, shrimps, and small bony fishes on the bottom. When feeding, it adopts a characteristic posture in which it presses the margin of its disc against the bottom and takes in water through its spiracles, which it blows through its mouth to uncover prey buried in the sediment. This species may fall prey to larger fishes such as sharks, and marine mammals. When threatened, it raises its tail over its <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the spine faces forward, and waves it back and forth. Known parasites of this species include the monogenean Dasybatotrema spinosum, Dendromonocotyle pipinna, Neoentobdella garneri and N. taiwanensis, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti.|$|E
25|$|The pan is then primed with powder, and the pan cover pulled shut. Finally the dog {{is pulled}} <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the pyrite in its jaws is resting {{on the top of}} the pan cover, under some {{pressure}} from the spring at the toe of its arm.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} {{transition}} between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the acoustic center of each driver {{is in the same}} vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.|$|E

25|$|DeStefano {{would give}} his loan shark victims presents, {{such as a}} gold watch with his name {{engraved}} on the <b>back,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> {{if he had to}} kill his victim and the police accused him he could use the watch as proof of how close he was to the victim and why he could never have killed him. He wore thick black rimmed glasses, making people believe he couldn't see without them, when in truth he could see everything that was going on and would take mental notes on how people operated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} incident, on 27 July 2006, {{while on a}} routine patrol, Budd's section {{identified}} and engaged two enemy gunmen {{on the roof of}} a building in the centre of Sangin. During the ensuing fierce fire-fight, two of Budd's section were hit. One was seriously injured and collapsed in the open ground, where he remained exposed to enemy fire, with rounds striking the ground around him. Budd realised that he needed to regain the initiative and that the enemy needed to be driven <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the casualty could be evacuated.|$|E
25|$|The other apical {{series is}} the retroflex, rt, rn, rl (or rd, rn, rl). Here {{the place is}} further back in the mouth, in the postalveolar or prepalatal region. The {{articulation}} is actually most commonly subapical; that is, the tongue curls <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> {{the underside of the}} tip makes contact. That is, they are true retroflex consonants. It has been suggested that subapical pronunciation is characteristic of more careful speech, while these sounds tend to be apical in rapid speech. Kalaw Lagaw Ya and many other languages in North Queensland differ from most other Australian languages in not having a retroflexive series.|$|E

25|$|The 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment made a {{reconnaissance}} {{in force}} {{in front of the}} 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment positions, and came along a strong enemy position, with about 18–20 pillboxes, astride the East–West Trail near the east fork of the Piva River. An attack was launched against the roadblock and managed to pass through the first line of bunkers after heavy fighting at close range, but could make no further headway. Company E—attempting to flank the enemy positions to relieve the intense fire directed at Company G—was knocked back by the Japanese defenders. As the Japanese position was set out in depth, the American battalion commander, de Zayas, ordered his men to pull <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> an artillery barrage could be brought down to reduce the Japanese defenses.|$|E
500|$|William of Malmesbury {{works to}} defend Athelstan from any charges of {{negligence}} by noting the defensive delays as a deliberate martial tactic and [...] "the king 'purposefully held <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> he might defeat an already insolent foe {{in a more}} glorious manner." [...] Historians postulate that the campaign of 934 made the Anglo-Saxon monarch confident in his military advances and Athelstan, if he had prior knowledge of the movements of Anlaf, probably thought that he could only mount minor winter raids in the areas surrounding York.|$|E
500|$|In July 2016 it was {{revealed}} that Fichtner would not be reprising his role as Mahone in the upcoming fifth season. Robert Knepper told Digital Spy that [...] " [...] Paul Scheuring loves Bill Fichtner and I love Bill Fichtner. He's a brilliant actor – but Paul honestly said to me, 'I don't {{know what to do with}} that character'. He didn't want to just bring everybody <b>back,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> the audience go, 'Oh, look, it's Bill Fichtner again!' – he honestly thought, 'I'm not sure where to do that in the plot.' So if someday there's another chapter of this, maybe then Bill will be back. But I think the characters that are there, each of our moments that we have, are key to the storytelling, which is how it should be." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{singular}} {{thing about the}} dragon's appearance at this time {{was the fact that}} he had a row of seats attached to his back, one seat for each member of the party. These seats were double, with curved <b>backs,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> two could sit in them, and there were twelve of these double seats, all strapped firmly around the dragon's thick body and placed one behind the other, in a row that extended from his shoulders nearly to his tail.|$|R

500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane, {{which is sort of}} a synthetic rubber... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [...] <b>back,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E
500|$|The second leg of {{the tour}} {{featured}} more variation {{in the first part}} of the setlist. [...] "Breathe" [...] opened most concerts, though its place was occasionally taken by [...] "Magnificent". [...] "No Line on the Horizon" [...] continued to follow [...] "Breathe" [...] in early setlists, but was later moved <b>back</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> it followed [...] "Beautiful Day" [...] instead. [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] and [...] "Elevation" [...] were performed more frequently, as was [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". [...] "Your Blue Room", a track from Original Soundtracks 1, made its live debut on the tour (with recorded guest vocals by Sinéad O'Connor), while [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] was dropped. [...] "Unknown Caller" [...] was dropped for a period of several weeks before being revived towards the end of the leg, and [...] "In a Little While" [...] also returned to the setlist.|$|E
500|$|As {{with several}} other {{characters}} from Tekken 6, Lars was given an alternate outfit designed by a manga artist, with Lars' being done by Masashi Kishimoto, author of the manga Naruto. In redesigning Lars, Kishimoto removed his Tekken Force outfit and gave him one made of a soft rubber material, marked with a lion figure on his right arm. He also made multiple cuts for the belt on the <b>back,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> Lars' kicking techniques would be possible. Also, on the outfit's back are the numbers for Sweden's telephone country code: [...] "46". In the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Lars has an extra costume based on Link from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. For Tekken 7, Lars was given another look by Ninnin. After multiple drafts that gave Lars different colors and accessories, Ninnin made one which retains elements from the Tekken Force design, while adding a torn red cape. For Street Fighter X Tekken, Lars retains his Tekken 6 outfit, but is also given an alternate ninja outfit.|$|E
