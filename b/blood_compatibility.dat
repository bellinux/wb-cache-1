5000|$|Adsorption of {{polyelectrolytes}} {{on solid}} substrates is a surface phenomenon where long-chained polymer molecules with charged groups (dubbed polyelectrolytes) bind to a surface that is {{charged in the}} opposite polarity. On the molecular level, the polymers do not actually bond to the surface, but tend to [...] "stick" [...] to the surface via intermolecular forces and the charges created by the dissociation of various side groups of the polymer. Because the polymer molecules are so long, they have {{a large amount of}} surface area with which to contact the surface and thus do not desorb as small molecules are likely to do. This means that adsorbed layers of polyelectrolytes form a very durable coating. Due to this important characteristic of polyelectrolyte layers they are used extensively in industry as flocculants, for solubilization, as supersorbers, antistatic agents, as oil recovery aids, as gelling aids in nutrition, additives in concrete, or for <b>blood</b> <b>compatibility</b> enhancement to name a few.|$|E

The stability of ALA under typical hemodialysis conditions was improved by immobilization, and the greatest enhancement was achieved when it was sandwiched between two polyethyleneimine (PEI) layers. In vitro antioxidant activity measurements showed that ALA coated membranes are not only capable of reducing ROS levels in blood, protein adsorption and platelet activation on the membranes, but, can also prolong coagulation time. All membranes prepared were noncytotoxic to peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In addition, the high permeation rates of solutes through PSF membrane were not affected by ALA immobilization...|$|R
50|$|Bioceramics' {{properties}} of being anticorrosive, biocompatible, and aesthetic make them quite suitable for medical usage. Zirconia ceramic has bioinertness and noncytotoxicity. Carbon is another alternative with similar mechanical properties to bone, {{and it also}} features <b>blood</b> <b>compatibility,</b> no tissue reaction, and non-toxicity to cells. None of the three bioinert ceramics exhibit bonding with the bone. However, bioactivity of bioinert ceramics {{can be achieved by}} forming composites with bioactive ceramics. Bioglass and glass ceramics are nontoxic and chemically bond to bone. Glass ceramics elicit osteoinductive properties, while calcium phosphate ceramics also exhibit non-toxicity to tissues and bioresorption. The ceramic particulate reinforcement has led to the choice of more materials for implant applications that include ceramic/ceramic, ceramic/polymer, and ceramic/metal composites. Among these composites ceramic/polymer composites have been found to release toxic elements into the surrounding tissues. Metals face corrosion related problems, and ceramic coatings on metallic implants degrade over time during lengthy applications. Ceramic/ceramic composites enjoy superiority due to similarity to bone minerals, exhibiting biocompatibility and a readiness to be shaped. The biological activity of bioceramics has to be considered under various in vitro and in vivo studies. Performance needs must be considered in accordance with the particular site of implantation.|$|E

These two points paved the way for blood transfusion to become a standard part of medical treatment. Complexity of <b>blood</b> <b>compatibility,</b> lack of suitable anticoagulants and insufficient storage methods combined with a disproportion between demand and availability implicated just in early phase of transfusion medicine needs to find one universal blood substitute. The term [...] "blood substitute" [...] is a misnomer. Under the term blood substitute, we understand in first line the substitution of a) facility of red blood cells e.g. haemoglobin as oxygen carriers and b) volume substitution.

In this work, an efficient bridged organic group-determined growth strategy has been proposed for the facile synthesis of highly dispersed and uniform MONs with multifarious Janus morphologies, nanostructures, organic-inorganic hybrid compositions, and particle sizes, which can be easily controlled simply by varying the bridged organic groups and the concentration of bis-silylated organosilica precursors used in the synthesis. In addition, the formation mechanism of Janus MONs determined by the bridged organic group has been discussed. Based on the specific structures, compositions, and asymmetric morphologies, all the synthesized Janus MONs with hollow structures (JHMONs) demonstrate excellent performances in nanomedicine as desirable drug carriers with high drug-loading efficiencies/capacities, pH-responsive drug releasing, and enhanced therapeutic efficiencies, as attractive contrastenhanced contrast agents for ultrasound imaging, and as excellent bilirubin adsorbents with noticeably high adsorption capacities and high <b>blood</b> <b>compatibilities.</b> The developed versatile synthetic strategy and the obtained JHMONs are extremely important {{in the development and}} applications of MONs, particularly in the areas of nanoscience and nanotechnology...|$|R

One policy, called double-crossmatching, tests the same unit of <b>blood</b> for <b>compatibility</b> with two potential recipients (so {{that it is}} available for use by either) and also insures that blood is available for both. Another policy involves using Rh-negative blood for Rh-positive patients under certain blood-age conditions, when medically feasible. The simultaneous use of both policies is also investigated. The performance of these policies is measured by wastage-cost effectiveness over a range of demand levels and by blood type.

To improve the biocompatibility of blood-contacting devices, a biomimetic approach to release/generate NO at polymer/blood interfaces has been pursued recently (with NO donors or NO generating catalysts doped within polymeric coatings) and this concept {{has been shown to}} be effective in preventing platelet adhesion/activation via several in vivo animal studies. However, there are no reports to date describing any quantitative in vitro assay to evaluate the <b>blood</b> <b>compatibilities</b> of such NO release/generating polymers with controlled NO fluxes. Such a methodology is desired to provide a preliminary assessment of any new NO-releasing material, in terms of the effectiveness of given NO fluxes and NO donor amounts on platelet activity before the more complex and costly in vivo testing is carried out. In this article, we report the use of a lactate dehydrogenase assay to study in vitro platelet adhesion on such NO-releasing polymer surfaces with varying NO fluxes. Reduced platelet adhesion was found to correlate with increasing NO fluxes. The highest NO flux tested, 7. 05 (± 0. 25) × 10 − 10 mol cm − 2 min − 1, effectively reduced platelet adhesion to nearly 20 % of its original level (from 14. 0 (± 2. 1) × 10 5 cells cm − 2 to 2. 96 (± 0. 18) × 10 5 cells cm − 2) compared to the control polymer coating without NO release capability. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
