25|$|The p-value was devised as an informal, but objective, index {{meant to}} help a {{researcher}} determine (based on other knowledge) whether to modify future experiments or strengthen one's faith in the null hypothesis. Hypothesis testing (and Type I/II errors) was devised by Neyman and Pearson as a more objective alternative to Fisher's p-value, also meant to determine researcher behaviour, but without requiring any inductive inference <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>researcher.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methodologically, social {{complexity}} is theory-neutral, {{meaning that}} it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research. The very idea of social complexity arises out of the historical-comparative methods of early sociologists; obviously, this method is important in developing, defining, and refining the theoretical construct of social complexity. As complex social systems have many parts {{and there are many}} possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis differentiated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding the effects of linguistic profiling relates to housing. A study at the University of Pennsylvania found that discrepancies existed not only between white speakers of Standard American English and black speakers of African American Vernacular English, but in addition in between females and males and speakers of Black Accented English and African American Vernacular English when applying for housing. African Americans as a whole {{were also more likely}} to be told about the problems of creditworthiness when applying for a lease. An explanation offered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> suggests the linkage between low socio-economic backgrounds and African American Vernacular English, while Black Accented English was associated with higher middle class status. Speech closer to the standard form yielded greater acceptance.|$|E

[...] In 1939, at Oxford University, seeking an alternative to sulfa drugs, Howard Florey developed Fleming's penicillin into the first systemic antibiotic drug, penicillin G. (Gramicidin, developed by René Dubos at Rockefeller Institute in 1939, was the first antibiotic, yet its toxicity restricted it to topical use.) [...] After World War II, Cornelius P.
