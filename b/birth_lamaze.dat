40|$|In this {{position}} paper—one of six care practice papers published by Lamaze International and reprinted here with permission—the benefit of no routine interventions during birth is discussed and presented as an evidence-based practice that helps promote, protect, and support normal birth. The paper is written for childbearing {{women and their}} families. It presents evidence related to restrictions on eating and drinking, use of intravenous fluids, continuous electronic fetal monitoring, artificial rupture of the membranes, augmentation of labor, and epidural analgesia. The accompanying commentary—written by an award-winning medical writer—supports and expands {{on the benefits of}} no routine interventions during <b>birth.</b> <b>Lamaze</b> International recommends that laboring women avoid restrictions on eating and drinking. The organization also recommends avoidance of IVs, continuous electronic fetal monitoring, epidurals, and efforts to speed up labor, unless a clear indication for their use is evident...|$|E
40|$|Lamaze International {{identifies}} six care practices used to promote, protect, {{and support}} the normal physiologic process of <b>birth</b> (<b>Lamaze,</b> 2007; Lamaze, 2014). These practices include: allowing labor to begin on its own; allowing freedom of movement throughout labor; providing continuous labor support; avoiding routine interventions; promoting spontaneous pushing in upright or gravity-neutral positions; and not separating mother and baby with unlimited breastfeeding opportunities. These care practices were adopted for nurses (Romano & Lothian, 2008) to support the normal physiologic birth (NPB.) The disparity between this recognized standard of care {{and the reality of}} nursing student education in the maternity clinical setting is explored through a survey of 59 nursing students. The survey elicited responses regarding: 1) educational experiences with NPB in the maternity clinical practicum; 2) experiences with each of the care practices in the maternity clinical practicum; and 3) beliefs about NBP in the clinical setting. The findings indicated a gap betwee...|$|E
40|$|In this {{position}} paper—one of six care practice papers published by Lamaze International and reprinted here with permission—the value of keeping {{mothers and their}} babies together {{from the moment of}} birth is discussed and presented as an evidenced-based practice that helps promote, protect, and support normal birth. The paper is written for childbearing women and their families. Babies held skin-to-skin with their mothers cry less often, breathe easier, and stay warmer than babies who are separated from their mothers. They also instinctively attach to the breast and begin breastfeeding, usually within one hour of birth. The advantages of rooming-in for mother and baby are also discussed.

40|$|The author, a <b>birth</b> doula and <b>Lamaze</b> Certified Childbirth Educator, {{agreed to}} attend {{the birth of a}} second child to a mother whose {{military}} husband was serving overseas. Because labor seemed to be progressing slowly, they waited at a hotel near the birth center. A very quick labor progression led to a rapid birth in the hotel, with the midwife still on her way. The author shares how learning to trust the power of natural childbirth helped her to remain calm and present for the mother for a once-in-a-lifetime moment...|$|R

General anesthesia is rare in modern obstetrics; aspiration is rare in modern anesthesia; no period of fast-ing guarantees an empty stomach; and clear liquids leave the stomach almost immediately. For these reason, many health-care providers no longer restrict eating and drink-ing during a normal labor...|$|E
