50|$|Niederstaufenbach’s old village core {{lies on the}} Reichenbach’s {{left bank}} on a small side brook known in old border {{descriptions}} as the Limbach, {{but it is not}} to be confused with another stream by that name near Oberstaufenbach. The Limbach at Niederstaufenbach rises near Föckelberg on the slope of the Potzberg. In this part of the village stand Einﬁrsthäuser (“single-roof-ridge houses”), a kind of farmhouse found throughout the Westrich, an historic region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France. An extensive new <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> stretches out on the brook’s right bank next to the road going towards Bosenbach. The Niederstaufenbacher Mühle (mill) stands down the dale, likewise on the right bank at the old millrace. Towards the end of the 20th century, the municipality opened a <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> on the way to Friedelhausen. A further new <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> was laid out up from the graveyard.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, a new <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> was opened up in stages with 25 plots, of which more than 80% have been sold; most now have {{buildings}} on them.|$|E

50|$|The local {{government}} reform of 1975 allowed Westerstetten {{to retain its}} independence. The designation of new <b>building</b> <b>zones</b> and its vicinity to Ulm helped it to grow to over 2,000 inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|A blower door is {{a machine}} {{used to measure}} the {{airtightness}} of buildings. It {{can also be used to}} measure airflow between <b>building</b> <b>zones,</b> to test ductwork airtightness and to help physically locate air leakage sites in the building envelope.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, {{a further}} <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> was laid out, and {{attention}} {{was directed at}} building a bypass road, which was finished in the early 1990s, affording Riesweiler some relief from through traffic, especially heavy vehicles.|$|E
50|$|It borders Monument Valley Park {{and has a}} view of Pikes Peak. It is {{near the}} city’s {{business}} district, in a combined residential and office <b>building</b> <b>zone,</b> in the Colorado College campus. Its well-preserved state, reflects the initial building construction with maintenance and restoration.|$|E
50|$|The Town Council {{comprises}} six voting members, elected from a councilmanic district. Their {{primary function}} is to adopt the annual budget, adopting and amending the town code and the <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> ordinances, adopting all traffic regulations, and hearing applications for changes of zone and special exceptions to zoning codes.|$|E
50|$|The village {{itself has}} 12 streets, a {{community}} centre, a fire station, a kindergarten and a gymnasium. Four new <b>building</b> <b>zones</b> {{have been laid}} out over the years: “In der Au” (1962),“Gartenstrasse” (1973), “Im Gieren” (1979) and “Am Külzer Pfad” (1996, in three sections).|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War came reconstruction. Municipal councils at {{the time}} quickly {{recognized}} the importance of a “growing” village. As early as the 1960s, new <b>building</b> <b>zones</b> were being laid out. At the same time, efforts were brought to bear on modernizing the village centre and building a multipurpose hall, the Soonblickhalle, which was dedicated in 1979.|$|R

The causes of this phenomenon were explained...|$|R
50|$|The public exhibition's {{main focus}} is to invite LEGO fans {{of all ages}} {{of the general public}} to view {{hundreds}} of hobbyist-built creations and meet their creators. Visitors may watch the Mindstorms robot battles or Brickfilm (a LEGO-themed film), browse and shop at various LEGO vendors, or have their kids build something in the <b>building</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the war, Rheinböllen’s skyline changed lastingly {{owing to}} steady growth. In rapid succession, one <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> after another sprang up, and the {{population}} rose sharply. In 1946, the year when Rheinböllen {{became part of the}} then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate, there were 1,283 inhabitants. By 1985, this had risen threefold (3,661). The figure is now just under 4,000.|$|E
50|$|General {{members of}} SCOPE Maastricht attain {{reductions}} on all admittance fees of events {{organized by the}} SCOPE associations, {{as well as a}} discount on study material prices in the SCOPE Bookstore, which is located in the faculty <b>building</b> (<b>Zone</b> F0) and operated in cooperation with Studystore. The majority of students at SBE becomes member of SCOPE, most of them during the Faculty Introduction Days {{at the beginning of the}} year. Online registration is however possible any time.|$|E
50|$|The Universal Grid {{consists}} of three 10’-6” building modules that create a 31’-6” X 31’-6” structural grid—in conjunction with an 18’ floor-to-floor height. The Universal Grid's open plan is easily adaptable to changing equipment and service offerings. This approach facilities the installation of new technologies and conversion of <b>building</b> <b>zones,</b> as future needs determine, to entirely different functions without the modification of core infrastructure systems (mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems).|$|R
50|$|The village, {{which was}} once {{characterized}} mainly by agriculture, has changed its outlook considerably {{over the last few}} decades. Agricultural businesses, both fulltime operations and those worked as sidelines, have been disappearing, and farm buildings have been either converted or torn down. New <b>building</b> <b>zones</b> have been opened. Even the building of the Autobahn A 61 helped see to it that farmers became employees, commuting to jobs in Rheinböllen, Simmern, Koblenz or the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region.|$|R
50|$|On 23 October 2006, {{the first}} phase of {{teaching}} <b>buildings</b> (B <b>Zone</b> and C Zone) were completed {{at the beginning of the}} semester.|$|R
50|$|A team {{of architects}} {{composed}} of Messrs Branch Bonvalet Dutruel and Marchant, an economist and Dr. Rouille {{were responsible for}} drawing up plans for a large <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> in La Reblais, {{not far from the}} pass, under the mountain of Ouzon. Two forest roads were envisaged, one to Mount Ouzon and the other to Mount Drouzin.The Le Biot school closed in June 1971 because there were only nine children (10 were needed for a class). This led to the mayor Fernand Renevier's resignation; he was replaced by Georges Premat. The school reopened in September 1972.|$|E
50|$|A centre named Rintzweiler or Rindsweiler (both {{pronounced}} the same way) once lay south of Hüfﬂer. In 1439, {{it had its}} ﬁrst documentary mention as Runtzwiler, relayed {{to the present day}} as a copy in a 17th-century Veldenz cartulary. In 1609, Rintzweiler had 83 inhabitants. The name Rintzweiler appears likewise in original documents from the 14th and 16th centuries, but by the 17th century, it appears no more. Quite likely, the village was wiped out in the Thirty Years' War. Today, a new <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> bears the name Am Rindschweiler Berg to commemorate this vanished village.|$|E
50|$|The early 1960s were {{a time of}} progress. In 1962 and 1963, Dienstweiler {{became the}} first village in the Amt of Birkenfeld to build its own sewer system and central sewage {{treatment}} plant. In 1960, a new <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> was laid out; 49 houses were built there, which made necessary a further development to the north (hence the reference to the “old new” building development). Although the inhabitants once drew their livelihoods mainly from agriculture, most now commute to jobs elsewhere in the area. Of the 26 agricultural operations that were once found here, only 4 are left.|$|E
5000|$|A {{naming rights}} deal with Nashville-based Louisiana-Pacific was inked on June 6, 2006. Louisiana-Pacific, which markets itself as [...] "LP Building Products", paid $30 million over 10 years for naming rights. LP's {{influence}} inside the stadium {{led to the}} creation of the LP <b>Building</b> <b>Zones</b> in 2007, located beneath the giant scoreboards from Daktronics at the north and south ends of the stadium. The concession stands and restrooms in these two areas were decorated to look like suburban homes using LP products.|$|R
50|$|A few newer {{houses have}} also {{sprung up in}} the lower village {{as a result of}} a small <b>building</b> {{development}} <b>zone</b> that was opened up.|$|R

50|$|Beginning {{no later}} than the 12th century, Bockenau belonged to the County of Sponheim and was thereby one of its oldest landholds, and {{therefore}} lies today on the Sponheimer Weg, an historically thematized hiking trail. Nevertheless, the village’s origins actually go much further back. When the new <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> “In der Bein” was opened, foundations of a Roman villa rustica from the 3rd century AD were found. This was proved by the coins that were also unearthed. On the lands of the campground called Bockenauer Schweiz, lying within municipal limits, and the settlement of Daubacher Brücke (between Winterburg and Bockenau) once lay, in the Middle Ages, Nunkirchen, a homestead with a church that was owned by Jutta von Sponheim.|$|E
50|$|Zone 1 and zone 2 {{are located}} within the {{property}} of NRAO. The entire NRAO property is designed as zone 1 except small portions (such as housing, visitor and laboratory areas) that are designed as zone 2. Zone 1, also called Radio Astronomy Instrument Zone, restricts intentional radiators to only those are deemed essential. All unintentional radiators must be operated within the ITU-R RA.769 recommendations on protection criteria used for radio astronomical measurements. Gasoline-powered motor vehicles are forbidden within zone 1 as the ignition system on spark-ignited engines generates noticeable radio interference, resulting in all vehicles and equipment needing to be diesel-powered. Zone 2, also called Observatory <b>Building</b> <b>Zone,</b> allows intentional radiators licensed by National Radio Quiet Zone, but not other radiators such as WIFI, cordless phones and wireless equipment. Certain types of unintentional radiators are allowed.|$|E
5000|$|When {{building}} the residential homes, Reichow dispensed with a rigid linear plan. Instead, {{he placed the}} houses in a [...] "dynamic motion and decentralisation". They are also deliberately different in terms of height and structural shape, {{in order to create}} a dynamic <b>building</b> <b>zone.</b> The design of the homes was supposed to do justice to that era's new rhythm of life, increased freedom and the residents' habitability requirements. Most homes in Sennestadt are arranged in such a way that the main living room, the balcony and at least one children's bedroom gets the afternoon sun so that the residents can enjoy the sun during their free time. According to Reichow, the rooms [...] "meander between due South and due West, i.e. within a 90-degree angle." [...] Double balconies were avoided, in line with the human need for distance and privacy.|$|E
50|$|As {{can be seen}} on the 1850 village map, the {{built-up}} part of Rutsweiler am Glan {{was once}} concentrated loosely around the village well {{in the middle of the}} village. Until the late 1950s, the village’s expansion thrust mainly to the north and south along Hauptstraße (“Main Street”). Only when new <b>building</b> <b>zones</b> were opened did the village begin spreading towards the Potzberg. All together, 65 new buildings arose after the Second World War. Out of what was originally a workers’ village with farming as a secondary occupation has today grown into almost exclusively a residential community for commuters.|$|R

40|$|The hygrothermal {{performances}} of <b>building</b> <b>zones,</b> <b>building</b> components and building occupants are strongly rela-ted {{to the interior}} humidity, and this is in turn related to the moisture buffering by the interior enclosure. This pa-per presents a methodology for the characterisation of the moisture buffer potential of a single interior element, by introduction of the production-adapted MBV*. It is shown that this weighted-average of a long- and a short-term value allows dependably characterising the moisture buffer potential for a multitude of moisture production schemes. As such, the introduced MBV * yields a dependable characterisation of single-element moisture buffer potential, which allows direct qualitative comparison of different elements and which can be measured by simple and fast measurement techniques and equipment. It extension towards the room enclosure level, and its ensuing use for quantification, is {{the topic of the}} companion paper (Roels and Janssen, 2008). 1...|$|R
50|$|Efforts {{to bring}} about a {{reorientation}} of Urbar’s municipal administration towards Oberwesel rather than Sankt Goar led on 21 December 1973 to a written endorsement by the regulatory body. The resolution from the government of the now defunct Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz set forth the amalgamation of Urbar with the town of Oberwesel. This decision provoked controversy among the inhabitants, and sometimes even within families. This centred on worries that the town might assume a paternalistic attitude towards the village, that funds might not be fairly apportioned under such an arrangement, and that as an outlying centre, the decision-making powers might not take Urbar’s needs into due consideration. Against this, however, the small municipality’s financial weakness had to be acknowledged. What those who backed the proposed amalgamation feared was that roadbuilding work and <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> developments would otherwise be hindered. In the amalgamation agreement of 13/14 December 1973, all municipal facilities and institutions in Urbar were transferred to the town of Oberwesel.|$|E
50|$|Ruthweiler was {{originally}} a linear village (or by some deﬁnitions, a “thorpe”) with the built-up {{area on the}} brook’s right bank. As early as the 19th century, sidestreets and bulges in the otherwise linear built-up area began to appear. A new <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> arose on the mountain slope over on the left bank. Of the two former estate mills, one is found at the village’s upper end and the other at the lower end. In {{the middle of the}} village stands the former schoolhouse, now the village community centre. The graveyard lies down the valley at a junction on the road to Kusel. The Krankenhaus Kusel (hospital) on the east slope of the Heibelberg (Westpfalzklinikum II) stands east of the village, but still within its limits, despite its name. Further new building zones are to be opened. Alongside the road once ran the Kusel-Türkismühle railway line, which was built in 1936 and closed in 1969, and whose right-of-way is now used as a hiking and cycling trail.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{the village}} lay along the Zweibrücken-Meisenheim {{cross-country}} road as a linear village (by some deﬁnitions, a “thorpe”). Rathsweiler’s original characterization as a thorpe, however, was later {{lost in the}} expansion that the village underwent in the 19th and 20th centuries. These expansions lie on the road known today as Bundesstraße 420 and in a new <b>building</b> <b>zone</b> in the village’s southwest. A row of old Einﬁrsthäuser (“houses with a single roof ridge”) or Quereinhäuser (combination residential and commercial houses divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street) along the former village street {{is said to be}} a special cultural monument featuring preserved farmhouses that were typical of the Westrich, an historic region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France. The Christoffelsmühle, an old watermill, lies roughly 1 km from the village core in the village’s north end on the Steinalb, and can be reached only along a farm lane and forest path, or an indirect road from the neighbouring village of Niederalben. The waterwheel is still running even today.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a simulation tool based on the Matlab computational environment for building temperature performance analysis with automatic control. The simulation tool contains mathematical models for buildings, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems, sensors, weather data and control algorithms. The building mathematical model is described in terms of statespace variables, with a lumped approach for the room air governing equations – energy and mass balances. In this context, the simulation tool structure and components are explained. Five control strategies applied to HVAC systems, integrated to <b>building</b> <b>zones,</b> are discussed as well. A simulation example illustrates the use of the software presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the file exchange compatibility of BIM based building energy simulation tools, especially focusing on various irregular building geometry shapes. As a base building modeling software, AUTOCAD Revit was selected and various building geometry shapes were created using Revit, such as curved and pitched walls, roofs, slabs with various air-conditioning zones. And these various shaped <b>building</b> <b>zones</b> were imported to ECOTECT, IES/VE and Openstudio for EnergyPlus, which are professional building energy simulation tools. Through this create-import process, the deformation of building shapes, change of zone volume, and compatibility to each simulation engine were investigated and analyzed...|$|R
