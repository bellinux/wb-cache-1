Usually, these episodes air with a disclaimer from the announcer added in post-production {{that one of the}} contestants was found ineligible (not specifying which one). Standards and Practices guidelines for game shows state that if an ineligible contestant wins a One-Bid and the other contestants on Contestants' Row at the time do not win a subsequent One-Bid, they are not considered to have made an appearance on the show and are immediately eligible again once the error has been discovered.|$|E

Although submissions to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> were initially few and far between, with Holmes doing work on small botched jobs early on in the series, the number of submissions quickly ballooned by the show's fourth season.

Officially McFadden had chosen to leave as she didn't like her character development, the same reason given for Crosby departing during the first season. However, she had actually been fired by Hurley. It had been intended for Pulaski to bring more of a Doctor Leonard McCoy vibe to the series. Meanwhile, Academy Award winner Goldberg had been actively pursuing a role on the show as Nichelle Nichols' portrayal of Uhura in The Original Series had inspired her to become an actress. Her agent was initially ignored by the producers as {{they did not believe}} that she wanted to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> until Goldberg called them herself.

It was not Poehler who arranged for him to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> but rather Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur, who is a good friend of Arnett and felt he would be a good fit for the character. Their date scenes marked the second on-screen pairing between a Parks and Recreation actor and their real-life spouse; Megan Mullally, the wife of actor Nick Offerman, guest starred as Ron Swanson's ex-wife Tammy in the episode, [...] "Ron and Tammy".

I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I love being part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have.

[...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
