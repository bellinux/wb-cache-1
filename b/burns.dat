5|$|<b>Burns</b> are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial <b>burns</b> may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major <b>burns</b> may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness <b>burns</b> may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness <b>burns</b> usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive <b>burns</b> often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of <b>burns</b> involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
