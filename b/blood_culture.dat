(2) To determine what proportion of <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> taken in the emergency department impact on patient management. (3) To develop guidelines for the appropriate ordering of <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> from patients in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Retrospective review of all <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> taken in the ED of a metropolitan teaching hospital between 26 September 1995 and 30 June 1996. RESULTS: One thousand and sixty two <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> were taken from patients in the ED during the study period. Ninety two (9 %) returned a positive microbiological culture. Of these, 52 (5 %) were "true" positives and 18 (1. 6 %) resulted in changes in management. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Blood</b> <b>cultures</b> taken in the ED rarely yield positive cultures.

2500|$|Laboratory {{identification}} of B. pseudomallei can be difficult, especially in Western countries {{where it is}} rarely seen. [...] The large, wrinkled colonies look like environmental contaminants, so are often discarded as being of no clinical significance. [...] Colony morphology is very variable and a single strain may display [...] multiple colony types, so inexperienced laboratory staff may mistakenly believe the growth is not pure. The organism grows more slowly than other bacteria that may be present in clinical specimens, and in specimens from nonsterile sites, is easily overgrown. [...] Nonsterile specimens should, therefore, be cultured in selective media (e.g., Ashdown's or B. cepacia medium). For heavily contaminated samples, such as faeces, {{a modified version of}} Ashdown's that includes norfloxacin, amoxicillin, and polymyxin B has been proposed. In <b>blood</b> <b>culture,</b> the [...] BacT/ALERT MB system (normally used for culturing mycobacteria) by bioMérieux has been shown to have superior yields compared to conventional <b>blood</b> <b>culture</b> media.|$|E

2500|$|A {{complete}} screen (<b>blood</b> <b>culture,</b> sputum culture, urine culture, throat swab, {{and culture}} of any aspirated pus) should be performed on all patients with suspected melioidosis (culture on blood agar as well as Ashdown's medium). A definitive diagnosis is made by growing B. pseudomallei from any site. [...] A throat swab is not sensitive, but is 100% specific if positive, and compares favourably with sputum culture. [...] The sensitivity of urine culture is increased if a centrifuged specimen is cultured, and any bacterial growth should be reported (not just growth above 104 organisms/ml which is the usual cutoff). [...] Very occasionally, bone marrow culture may be positive in patients who have negative blood cultures for B.pseudomallei, {{but these are not}} usually recommended. [...] A common error made by clinicians unfamiliar with melioidosis is to send a specimen from only the affected site (which is the usual procedure for most other infections) instead of sending a full screen.|$|E

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate factors associated with positive <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> in outpatients presenting to an outpatient clinic and emergency room. This was a case-control study of all outpatients with positive <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> from January 1, 2006 to October 31, 2007 and matched control patients with negative <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> in the same time period.

Potential contaminants were recovered from 495 of 1, 040 positive <b>blood</b> <b>cultures.</b> If one or more additional <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> were obtained within ± 48 h and all were negative, the isolate was considered a contaminant. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of these probable contaminants was not performed unless requested. If no additional <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> were submitted or there were additional positive <b>blood</b> <b>cultures</b> (within ± 48 h), a pathology resident gathered patient clinical information and made a judgment regarding the isolate's significance.
