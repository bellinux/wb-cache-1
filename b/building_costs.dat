5|$|Luton Town's {{first ground}} was at Dallow Lane, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground {{was next to}} the Dunstable to Luton train line, and players {{regularly}} claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896–97 forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 <b>building</b> <b>costs.</b> When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present Kenilworth Road site, {{in time for the}} start of the 1905–06 season.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, <b>building</b> <b>costs</b> had {{increased}} from NOK 88 to 131 million. The municipalities had co-signed {{for a foreign}} loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, {{in addition to the}} operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated. In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic. On 1January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put {{under the control of the}} Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor). Following the closure of Geilo Airport, Dagali in 2003, Fagernes experienced an increase in charter traffic.|$|E

5|$|By this time, the tollhouse was proving {{inadequate}} as {{the seat}} of local government and between 1407 and 1413 it was demolished, along with an adjoining site which had housed a vegetable market, {{and was replaced by}} a new Guildhall. In keeping with Norwich's status, {{it was one of the}} largest civic buildings in England outside London and housed all aspects of local government and justice for the new council. The Guildhall cost between £400–£500 to build. (As it was built primarily using pressed labour, modern equivalents of the <b>building</b> <b>costs</b> are virtually meaningless. The annual income of the city council at the time the Guildhall was built was around £120.) The eastern face of the Guildhall was built in a distinctive black and white checked design, representing the exchequer. The undercroft of the tollhouse was retained for use as a dungeon, while a new basement served as a lock-up from the opening of the Guildhall until the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Evanton has {{a number}} of public {{facilities}} including the Diamond Jubilee Hall, Chapel Road, building work started in December 1897, Major Randle Jackson of Swordale House gave 50% of the <b>building</b> <b>costs</b> and the people of Evanton (Parish of Kiltearn) raised the rest. The hall opened on 5 November 1898 with a grand concert over 500 people from the village attending. Diamond Jubilee Hall transferred from Highland Council to the Community on Thursday 29 September 2011. Evanton Sports Centre (opposite Kiltearn Primary School) is the other public facilies in the village which cateres for various sporting activities badminton, basketball, football and tennis. Evanton also has a good sized park at Teandallon. In recent years a local group of parents and young people has worked with Highland Council and various funding bodies to install a multisport area, a BMX track and a Half-Pipe ramp, a new playpark for toddlers was added in 2007 by EYE. In 2008 Highland Council upgraded the original park which was installed in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} near Woolwich was under {{construction}} by 1921, as it ran on open {{land that was}} easy to purchase, but plans {{for the remainder of}} the route had not yet been decided and there were delays due to compulsory purchasing of properties. In 1925, The Times announced a replacement bridge for the Woolwich Ferry was planned as part of the South Circular project to tie in with the East Ham and Barking Bypass (now the A13). A significant amount of new housing had been built along the route of the South Circular since the original 1903 plans, and <b>building</b> <b>costs</b> had risen because of labour and because of further demolition required. In 1927, the Governors of Dulwich College formally objected to the road as it would put the Memorial Library right next to a main road and remove part of the college green.|$|E

5|$|The win was not {{followed}} with more {{success and the}} team performed badly in the following seasons. At the AGM in October 1982, {{it was revealed that}} the club were in £1.6million of debt, mainly due to escalating wages and <b>building</b> <b>costs,</b> including the construction of the North Stand. At the end of November Ron and Donald Bendall resigned from the board to be replaced by Doug Ellis, who bought Ron Bendall's 42% shareholding. In January 1983, Villa beat Barcelona 31 on aggregate to win the 1982 UEFA Super Cup. Barton remained in charge for two seasons after the European Cup triumph, but was sacked {{at the end of the}} 198384 season despite Villa finishing tenth in the First Division and reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup. Shrewsbury Town manager Graham Turner was brought in as his successor. Turner was unable to reverse the decline, and in 1986 Villa narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division. A lacklustre start to the following season saw Turner sacked halfway through September. Billy McNeill was hired in his place, but was unable to save Villa from relegation. They were relegated to the Second Division just five years after winning the European Cup. McNeill handed in his notice and moved to Celtic when the season ended. Chairman Ellis persuaded Watford manager Graham Taylor to take over the reins and set about rebuilding the team.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recently the {{potential}} development of green architecture {{in our country}} is huge, but inaccurate control of green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost</b> is the key reason for restricting its development. After analyzing influencing factors of green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost,</b> four influencing factors are put forward:technical measures, project regions,fixed position and time to research feasibility. On basis of the factors, the ways are proposed to reduce green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost,</b> which provides theoretical basis {{for the development of}} green architecture. introduction China has promoted green building thoroughly,but people still have misunderstanding about green <b>building’s</b> <b>cost</b> at present: <b>cost</b> of <b>building</b> will increase much when connecting with “green”. Green <b>building</b> signifies high <b>cost.</b> Professionals in architecture and real estate also overestimate green <b>building’s</b> <b>cost</b> that even reaches up to 300 %. The reason that causes misunderstanding is the choice of pilot projects with relatively high price in previous green real estate; the theory of high technological mansion is propagated greatly. Although the primary investment <b>cost</b> of green <b>building</b> is higher than normal building, we should also notice the profit brought by green <b>building</b> except incremental <b>cost.</b> （ 1 ）direct benefit-energy conservation and expense-saving produced by incrementa...|$|R
