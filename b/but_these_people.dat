500|$|If Philip {{had been}} a Christian during his {{military}} service, he would have not been a particularly unusual figure for his eraalthough membership in the army was prohibited by certain churchmen, and would have required participation in rites some Christians found sacrilegious, {{it was not uncommon}} among the Christian laity. The position of an emperor, however, was more explicitly paganâ€”emperors were expected to officiate over public rites and lead the religious ceremonies of the army. Christian scripture contains explicit prohibitions on this sort of behavior, such as the First Commandment: [...] "You shall have no other gods before me". Whatever the prohibitions, people raised on the [...] "more tolerant Christianity of the camp" [...] {{would have been able to}} justify participation in pagan ritual to themselves. We know that these people exist: the historical record includes Christian army officers, who would have been regularly guilty of idolatry, and the military martyrs of the late 3rd century. Their ritual sacrifice excluded them from certain parts of the Christian community (ecclesiastical writers tended to ignore them, for example) <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> nonetheless believed themselves to be Christian and were recognized by others as Christians.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Elle Magazine on March 27, 2009, Ruth Halimi stated that [...] "The police were completely off the mark. They thought {{they were dealing with}} classic bandits, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were beyond the norm." [...] Halimi stated that she wrote the book to [...] "alert public opinion to the danger of anti-semitism which has returned in other forms, so that a story like this can never happen again".|$|E
2500|$|In September 1965, the 474th Wing was {{stripped}} of its personnel and equipment and became a [...] "paper organization" [...] for the next year. [...] In anticipation of converting the wing to fly the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, it began to receive a few personnel {{in the fall of}} 1966, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were withdrawn in June 1967 and the 474th remained unmanned until January 1968, when it moved to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada and was reassigned.|$|E

6000|$|Lee was firm. [...] "That's {{one side}} of it. <b>But</b> <b>these</b> young <b>people</b> should not start in wrong. Haney's past {{is said to be}} criminal, and Mrs. Haney is called low--" ...|$|R

2500|$|The South African Communist Party, {{which is}} in an {{alliance}} with the ruling ANC and COSATU, to which NUM is affiliated, called for the leaders of AMCU to be arrested. AMCU blamed the NUM and the police and insisted that, contrary to various rumours, the union was not affiliated to any political party. Frans Baleni, the {{general secretary of the}} National Union of Mineworkers, defended the police action to the Kaya FM radio station in saying: [...] "The police were patient, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were extremely armed with dangerous weapons." ...|$|E

60|$|Again that soul-compelling grin. 'What {{occupation}} {{would be}} to me between crop and crop? It is better than scaring bears. <b>But</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> do not understand.' He picked the masks from the floor, and looked in my face as simply as a child.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm certain. I don't {{understand}}--just as I don't understand Shoesmith, <b>but</b> she does. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> walk {{on solid}} ground which is just thin air to us. They've got something we haven't got. Assurances? I wonder."...|$|R
60|$|After a time I {{went into}} the parlor, which room was then {{occupied}} by {{the young men and}} young women. It was ever so much pleasanter out-of-doors than in this somewhat gloomy and decidedly stuffy parlor; <b>but</b> as <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were guests at a quilting party, they knew it was proper to enjoy themselves within the house to which they had been invited.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw Miss Oliver, I suppose," [...] said Alan briefly. [...] "At least I met a {{young lady}} on the shore. <b>But</b> where did <b>these</b> <b>people</b> come from? Surely more is known of them than this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My royal master, {{he will be}} much annoyed, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are onlee {{common people}} and grossly ignorant. If your honours will kindly {{overlook}} unfortunate affair, I shall be much pleased. In a little while rain will stop and we can then proceed. You have been shooting, eh? That is fine performance!' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are some}} people who state that the exterior, sex, or {{physique}} of another person is indifferent to them, that they care only for the communion of mind with mind; <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> need not detain us. There are some statements that no one ever thinks of believing, however often they are made.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know, I know," [...] sighed my wife; [...] "it was terrible. <b>But</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are so very unworldly that don't {{you think}} they could be deluded into the belief that they were seeing society if we took a little trouble? You {{used to be so}} inventive! You could think up {{something}} now if you tried." ...|$|E
40|$|What have we here? Miles Standish, Priscilla {{and a pair}} of Quakers, keeping {{company with}} a lovely Dresden dancing lady and a small, brown postman. <b>But</b> <b>these</b> unique <b>people</b> {{do not have to be}} fed, even though their {{mistress}} is Mabel Anderson, manager of the Memorial Union food service, for they are only a few of her large doll collection...|$|R
60|$|No, {{not so far}} as that; <b>but</b> <b>these</b> kind <b>people,</b> {{when they}} came into the harbour last night, offered to take us up the coast to a town, where we will sleep, and start comfortably home to-morrow morning. So now {{you will have a}} chance of seeing {{something}} of the great sea outside, and of seeing, perhaps, the whale himself.|$|R
60|$|He {{expected}} dire punishments, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> blind <b>people</b> {{were capable}} of toleration. They regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his general idiocy and inferiority, and after they had whipped him they appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone to do, and he, seeing no other way of living, did submissively what he was told.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Berbers use long, smooth-bore, muzzle-loading guns; {{beautiful}} guns, with inlaid stocks, {{probably made}} long since in Persia and India. I don't {{know how they}} get them, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> are not savages. They {{have a pretty good}} trading system and caravan roads. This bullet was fired from a modern rifle; a Mauser, I think. Do you want it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Everyone's {{movements}} seemed graceful. Graham {{remarked to}} Lincoln {{that he saw}} men as Raphael's cartoons walking, and Lincoln {{told him that the}} attainment of an appropriate set of gestures was part of every rich person's education. The Master's entry was greeted with a sort of tittering applause, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> showed their distinguished manners by not crowding upon him nor annoying him by any persistent scrutiny, as he descended the steps towards the floor of the aisle.|$|E
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. The {{people and}} their rights bore me. I am sick of both. In these modern days to be vulgar, illiterate, common and vicious, seems to give a man a marvellous {{infinity}} of rights that his honest fathers never dreamed of. Believe me, Prince, in good democracy every man should be an aristocrat; <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> in Russia who seek to thrust us out are {{no better than the}} animals in one's preserves, and made to be shot at, most of them.|$|E
60|$|The wind roared {{outside in}} the bare maples, and the fire boomed in its pent place within, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> young <b>people</b> had {{forgotten}} time and place. The girl sank into a chair almost unconsciously as they talked of Madison--a great city to them--of the Capitol building, of the splendid campus, of the lakes, and the gay sailing there in summer and ice-boating in winter.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> did <b>these</b> <b>people</b> (savages perhaps) live {{when the}} country was icy cold? Look at the bits of bone. They have been split, you see, lengthways; that, I suppose, was to suck the marrow out of them, as savages do still. But to what animal do the bones belong? That is the question, and one which I could not have {{answered}} you, if wiser men than I am could not have told me.|$|R
3000|$|... [I]f the {{question}} is whether our labour market needs <b>these</b> <b>people</b> or not, well no. <b>But</b> occupation of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> is a type of social policy. Turkey has facilities. Well, when you look into our state traditions, from the beginning in situations as such the state has always striven to maintain its social state role and now it tries to do the same.|$|R
60|$|Indescribable was the want of {{hospitality}} which characterised the Hispano-Englishmen of Las Palmas. I have called twice upon a fellow-countryman without his dreaming of asking me upstairs. Such shyness may {{be understood in}} foreigners, who often entertain wild ideas concerning what an Englishman expects. <b>But</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were wealthy; nor were they wholly expatriated. Finally, {{it was with the}} utmost difficulty that I obtained from one of them a pound of home-grown arrowroot for the sick child of a friend.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> here {{should not}} have the {{gratuitous}} spectacle of a man enduring the torments of disappointment and of baffled revenge. Whatever Chauvelin was suffering now would for ever remain the secret of his own soul. Anon, when the Leridans' rasping voices died away {{in one of the}} more distant portions {{of the house and the}} men of the Surete were busy accepting refreshment and gratuity from the two terrified wretches, he had put down the candle with a steady hand and then walked with a firm step out of the house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens! why don't they {{do or say}} {{something}} new and interesting, and not keep twaddling on about art, and music, and poetry, and cosmos? The papers are full of appeals for help for the poor, reforms of all sorts, and splendid work that others are doing; <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> seem to think it isn't genteel enough to be spoken of here. I suppose it is all very elegant to go on like a set of trained canaries, but it's very dull fun to watch them, and Hepsey's stories are a deal more interesting to me." ...|$|E
50|$|This runestone is {{also raised}} {{in memory of}} Varangians who died somewhere in the east, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> are {{different}} <b>people</b> {{from those in the}} previous runestone and in the following one. U 154 is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3.|$|R
50|$|The masjid {{attendance}} population comprises mainly {{young boys}} and children. Expatriates comprise at least 50% of population, {{where most of}} the income comes from.

6000|$|... 'It is not merely, my pet,' said I, 'that we {{lose money}} and comfort, and even temper sometimes, by not {{learning}} to be more careful; but that we incur the serious responsibility of spoiling everyone who comes into our service, or has any dealings with us. I begin to be afraid that the fault is not entirely on one side, <b>but</b> that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> all turn out ill because we don't turn out very well ourselves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{immediately}} {{the danger of}} the case. We were a small community, and could not afford to be split up by feuds. So I stepped up to the girls, and whispered to them: 'Polly,' said I, 'those lockets are powerful fine, and become you amazingly; but you don't consider that the country is not advanced enough in these parts for such things. You and I understand these matters, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> don't. Fine things like these may do very well in the old settlements, but they won't answer at the Pigeon Roost Fork of the Muddy. You had better lay them aside for the present, or we shall have no peace.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is to him," [...] the Well-beloved Louis, [...] "that {{you must}} address yourself, or to his Amboise in Petticoats [his Pompadour, acting the Cardinal-Premier on this occasion]. <b>But</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> have their heads filled with ambitious projects: {{these people are}} the difficulty; they wish to be the {{sovereign}} arbiters of sovereigns;--and that is what persons of {{my way of thinking}} will by no means put up with. I love Peace quite as much as you could wish; but I want it good, solid and honorable. Socrates or Plato would have thought as I do on this subject, had they found themselves placed in the accursed position which is now mine in the world.|$|E
6000|$|We tried {{everything}} in the great campaign that we made, and [...] for ever so long it didn't seem to work. We had processions, [...] just as we did at home in America, with great banners [...] carried round bearing the inscription: [...] "Do {{you want to save}} [...] the boy?" [...] <b>But</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> looked on and said, [...] "Boy? Boy? [...] What boy?" [...] Our workers were almost disheartened. [...] "Oh, sir," [...] said one of them, an ex-barkeeper from Oklahoma, [...] "it does [...] seem so hard that we have total prohibition in the States [...] and here they can get all the drink they want." [...] And the good [...] fellow broke down and sobbed.|$|E
50|$|Kazakh {{clothing}} is {{a style of}} clothing worn by the Kazakh people, often made up of materials suited to the region's extreme climate and the people's nomadic lifestyle. In most cases, they are decorated with elaborate ornaments, such as those made with bird beaks, animal horns, hooves and feet. Contemporary Kazakhs usually wear modern, Western clothing, <b>but</b> <b>these</b> Turkic <b>people</b> are also seen wearing more traditional clothing for holidays and special occasions.|$|R
60|$|It is in {{communities}} {{like this that}} Jesuit humbuggery flourishes. We visited a Jesuit cathedral nearly two hundred years old and found in it {{a piece of the}} veritable cross upon which our Saviour was crucified. It was polished and hard, and in as excellent a state of preservation as if the dread tragedy on Calvary had occurred yesterday instead of eighteen centuries ago. <b>But</b> <b>these</b> confiding <b>people</b> believe in that piece of wood unhesitatingly.|$|R
6000|$|His {{writings}} are {{one long}} tirade against ignorance. He told his age it was ignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do. Nowadays a man may {{tell the world}} it is as silly as it is solemn, that all its methods are still infantile and clumsy and its dogmas childish assumptions, without much physical danger; <b>but</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> {{of the middle ages}} when they were not actually being massacred or starving or dying of pestilence, were passionately convinced of the wisdom, the completeness and finality of their beliefs, and disposed to resent any reflections upon them very bitterly. Roger Bacon's writings were like a flash of light in a profound darkness. He combined his attack upon the ignorance of his times with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of knowledge. In his passionate insistence upon the need of experiment and of collecting knowledge, the spirit of Aristotle lives again in him. [...] "Experiment, experiment," [...] that is the burthen of Roger Bacon.|$|R
