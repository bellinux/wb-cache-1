5|$|Due to the FCC's {{limits on}} station {{ownership}} {{at the time}} (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing agreements in radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire airtime to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s. These alliances gave larger <b>broadcasters</b> a way to expand their reach, and smaller <b>broadcasters</b> a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue. In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing agreements largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for <b>broadcasters</b> to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it – consequentially triggering a wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry. However, <b>broadcasters</b> still used local marketing agreements to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.|$|E
