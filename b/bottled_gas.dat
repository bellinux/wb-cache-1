25|$|Houses {{designed}} {{to cope with}} interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a wood stove, or heat and power from diesel fuel or <b>bottled</b> <b>gas,</b> regardless of their other heating mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|With {{turbocharged}} engines, the oil seals on the turbocharger may fail, allowing {{lubricating oil}} into the combustion chamber, where it is burned like regular diesel fuel. In vehicles or installations that use diesel engines and also <b>bottled</b> <b>gas,</b> a gas leak into the engine room could also provide fuel for a runaway, via the engine air intake.|$|E
50|$|The Compressed Gas Association {{publishes a}} number of {{booklets}} and pamphlets on safe handling and use of <b>bottled</b> <b>gases.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to increase the gas volume of the accumulator by coupling a <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> to the <b>gas</b> side of the accumulator. This is mainly done since a <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> normally is cheaper to produce than an accumulator.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{contents}} are under high pressure and are sometimes hazardous, there are special safety regulations for handling <b>bottled</b> <b>gases.</b> These include chaining bottles to prevent falling and breaking, proper ventilation to prevent {{injury or death}} in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards.|$|R
25|$|McConville's Hotel/Public House on Mandeville/West Street {{dates back}} to 1865 but moved in 1900 to its current corner location. The pub is fully {{preserved}} with original wooden snugs inside, etched glass windows at ground floor level, original gas light fittings which now run on <b>bottled</b> <b>gas</b> and an iron door canopy and lantern. Local {{legend has it that}} some of the Russian Oak fittings in the bar were made to the same design as those used on the Titanic.|$|E
25|$|Most {{technically}} advanced Stirling engines, {{like those}} developed for United States government labs, use helium as the working gas, because it functions {{close to the}} efficiency and power density of hydrogen with fewer of the material containment issues. Helium is inert, and hence not flammable. Helium is relatively expensive, and must be supplied as <b>bottled</b> <b>gas.</b> One test showed hydrogen to be 5% (absolute) more efficient than helium (24% relatively) in the GPU-3 Stirling engine. The researcher Allan Organ demonstrated that a well-designed air engine is theoretically just as efficient as a helium or hydrogen engine, but helium and hydrogen engines are several times more powerful per unit volume.|$|E
25|$|As {{the mass}} shootings {{continued}} in Russia, the Germans began {{to search for}} new methods of mass murder. This was driven by a {{need to have a}} more efficient method than simply shooting millions of victims. Himmler also feared that the mass shootings were causing psychological problems in the SS. His concerns were shared by his subordinates in the field. In December 1939 and January 1940, another method besides shooting was tried. Experimental gas vans equipped with gas cylinders and a sealed compartment were used to kill the disabled and mentally-ill in occupied Poland. Similar vans, but using the exhaust fumes rather than <b>bottled</b> <b>gas,</b> were introduced to the Chełmno extermination camp in December 1941, and some were used by in the occupied Soviet Union, for example in smaller clearing actions in the Minsk ghetto. They also were used for murder in Yugoslavia.|$|E
50|$|The {{regulators}} {{and the associated}} SPGs for the pony <b>bottle</b> and primary <b>gas</b> cylinder should be unmistakably different to avoid possible confusion in difficult circumstances (poor visibility or high stress) as mixing up these regulators or gauges {{can lead to a}} false ”out of air” emergency. The pony bottle is not generally considered part of the normal gas supply for a dive or to extend a dive by using the pony <b>bottle</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|R
40|$|Transgrow bottles with medium {{containing}} ammonium bicarbonate and Transgrow <b>bottles</b> <b>gassed</b> with 10 % {{carbon dioxide}} performed equally well in detecting Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 434 clinical specimens. It appears that incorporation of ammonium bicarbonate into the medium increased {{the efficiency of}} the manufacturing process while maintaining the effectiveness of the medium...|$|R
50|$|Modern ovens are {{typically}} fueled by either natural gas or electricity, with <b>bottle</b> <b>gas</b> models available but not common. When an oven {{is contained in}} a complete stove, the fuel used for the oven may {{be the same as}} or different from the fuel used for the burners on top of the stove.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{authorities}} advocate replacing <b>bottled</b> <b>gas</b> {{or natural}} gas with biogas. However, {{this is usually}} impractical unless live-stock are on-site. [...] The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough methane for anything more than small amounts of cooking.|$|E
2500|$|Oxy-gasoline, {{also known}} as oxy-petrol, torches {{have been found to}} perform very well, {{especially}} where <b>bottled</b> <b>gas</b> fuel is not available or difficult to transport to the worksite. Tests showed that an oxy-gasoline torch can cut steel plate up to [...] thick {{at the same rate as}} oxy-acetylene. In plate thicknesses greater than [...] the cutting rate was better than oxy-acetylene; at [...] it was three times faster.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrogen is used under high {{pressure}} when dispensing dry stouts (such as Guinness) and other creamy beers because it displaces CO2 to (artificially) form a rich tight {{head and a}} less carbonated taste. This makes the beer feel smooth on the palate and gives a foamy appearance. [...] Premixed <b>bottled</b> <b>gas</b> for creamy beers is usually 75% nitrogen and 25% CO2. [...] This premixed gas which only works well with creamy beers {{is often referred to}} as Guinness Gas, Beer Gas, or Aligal. [...] Using [...] "Beer Gas" [...] with other beer styles can cause the last 5% to 10% of the beer in each keg to taste very flat and lifeless. [...] In the UK, the term keg beer would imply the beer is pasteurised, in contrast to unpasteurised cask ale. Some of the newer microbreweries may offer a nitro keg stout which is filtered but not pasteurized.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) sells {{a number}} of {{booklets}} and pamphlets on safe handling and use of <b>bottled</b> <b>gases.</b> (Members of the CGA can get the pamphlets for free.) The European Industrial Gases Association and the British Compressed Gases Association provide similar facilities in Europe and the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Moored at {{the supply}} center from 10 August to 24 August, Warrick loaded {{balanced}} dry provisions sufficient for 20,000 men for 90 days; ships' store stock; clothing and small stores; general stores material; and a deck load of <b>bottled</b> <b>gases.</b> When {{the task was}} complete, she sailed for the Far East, leaving San Francisco behind on 24 August.|$|R
50|$|In September 1956, Kleenheat Gas {{became the}} first company to {{distribute}} <b>bottled</b> LPG and <b>gas</b> appliances to regional Western Australia. Demand {{for the convenience of}} gas was so great that 1500 appliances were sold before the first <b>gas</b> <b>bottles</b> were available.|$|R
50|$|Schultz <b>Bottled</b> <b>Gas</b> is {{the oldest}} {{continuously}} family-owned retail business in Milan and has been family owned and operated 1939-2015. The families that own Schultz Motors and Schultz <b>Bottled</b> <b>Gas</b> are entirely different and not related to each other.|$|E

50|$|Many items used {{in daily}} life are {{imported}} with high transportation cost involved. Monopoly in some business sectors further raising the prices of common commodities. Electricity prices are about US$0.33 per unit. A domestic <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> (or <b>gas</b> cylinder) is over US$20. Rent for a two bedroom apartment is about US$175 to US$200 per month in safe city center locations.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{the attacks}} continued. On 6 October, a <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> {{exploded}} in station Maison Blanche of the Paris Métro, wounding 13. On 17 October, a <b>gas</b> <b>bottle</b> exploded between the Musée d'Orsay and Saint-Michel - Notre-Dame stations of RER Line C, wounding 29.|$|R
50|$|Oftentimes, a {{different}} profession {{will replace the}} milkman in various jokes. For instance, in Spain, 'milkman' jokes are told about butaneros: persons who deliver butane, <b>bottled</b> fuel <b>gas.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, the {{convenience}} and low cost of <b>bottled</b> <b>gas</b> burners {{led to a}} revival of hot air ballooning for sport and leisure.|$|E
50|$|The {{making of}} Canakkale {{ceramics}} {{was often a}} very time consuming process. Canakkale ceramics were often painted with over with creamy glazes (usually clear). They were, however, very diverse in appearance, including plates, open and closed bowls, long necked <b>bottles,</b> <b>gas</b> lamps, vases, and even animal figurines, (mostly the 19th and 20th centuries), among many others. The ceramics would be coated with either red earthenware or engobe, then {{left out in the}} sun to dry, after which they would be painted. The technique of cross-hatching was used to design the patterns on the ceramics.|$|R
500|$|According to Inter-Services Public Relations, {{weapons were}} {{recovered}} from the bullet-riddled Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa complexes, including RPG rockets, anti-tank and anti-personnel landmines, suicide bombing belts, three to five [...]22-caliber rifles, RPD, RPK and RPK-74 light machine guns, Dragunov Sniper Rifles, SKS rifles, AK-47s, pistols, night vision equipment, and more than 50,000 rounds of various calibre ammunition. Lesser sophisticated items and weaponry {{recovered from the}} complex included three crates of gasoline bombs prepared in green soft drink <b>bottles,</b> <b>gas</b> masks, recoilless rifles, two-way radios, large plastic buckets containing homemade bombs the size of tennis balls, as well as knives.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{contents}} {{are under pressure}} and are sometimes hazardous materials, handling <b>bottled</b> <b>gases</b> are regulated. Regulations may include chaining bottles to prevent falling and damaging the valve, proper ventilation to prevent injury or death in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards If a compressed gas cylinder tips over, causing the valve block to be sheared off, the rapid release of high-pressure gas may cause the cylinder to be violently accelerated, potentially causing property damage, injury, or death. To prevent this, cylinders are normally secured to a fixed object or transport cart with a strap or chain.|$|R
