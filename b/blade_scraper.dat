5000|$|North of {{the village}} Rein was in the Neolithic Age (Neolithic) in Lasinja-Culture, a mining site for silex (siliceous rock as chert, quartz, etc.). From there, tools (hand axes, <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> etc.) were won. Workpieces of this mining site were spread to a {{distance}} of [...] away.|$|R
50|$|A {{residential}} complex {{consisting of}} rooms around small patios {{was built on}} this set of platforms. Elements found {{in the interior of}} the rooms include pots, a spoon fragment, <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> and a furnace, used in domestic activities, depicting some aspects {{of the life of the}} inhabitants of this site.|$|R
50|$|Paleoindians in Florida used a large {{variety of}} stone tools besides {{projectile}} points. These tools include <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> of various kinds, spokeshaves, gravers, gouges, and bola stones. Some of the tools, {{such as the}} Hendrix scraper of the early Paleoindian period, and the Edgefield scraper of the late Paleoindian period, are distinctive enough to aid in dating deposits.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, North-Western and Northern Transylvania {{with the}} {{settlements}} at Boineşti (Satu Mare County) and Remetea (Maramureş County) have revealed several typically Mousterian tools (flake <b>scrapers,</b> <b>blade</b> <b>scrapers,</b> target points etc.), {{some of which}} have been associated with a later stage of the Mousterian, or even with a transition stage to the Upper Paleolithic, {{at the onset of the}} Aurignacian culture of the Upper Paleolithic.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{applications}} for alloy K-500 are: pump shafts and impellers, doctor <b>blades</b> and <b>scrapers,</b> oil-well drill collars and instruments and electronic components.|$|R
50|$|It is a grey soiled site next to two {{springs and}} the Litani River. Materials {{recovered}} include flints such as tanged arrowheads, sickle <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> and an axe. Pottery included flat bottomed jars, globe shaped jars and bowls. These were burnished, painted and red washed with some incised decorations. These finds {{were similar to}} those from Tell Ain Nfaikh and other Beqaa Valley sites with a later neolithic dating and settlements extending into the Bronze Age and classical periods.|$|R
50|$|Paleolithic and Neolithic flint <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> and arrowheads, some made in Levallois {{technique}} were discovered. In {{the subsequent}} layers lithic figurines and bone sculptures have been found, that suggest relations {{to the nearby}} Hacılar culture. The attention of researchers was especially drawn to the carving of a human face, stylistically similar to {{the products of the}} Natufian culture which flourished in the Levant during the Mesolithic period. This discovery may corroborate a commercial relationship of the population of southern Asia Minor and Palestine.|$|R
50|$|Waters began {{excavations}} in the Buttermilk Creek Complex at the Debra L. Friedkin Paleo-Indian site in Texas in 2006. Over 15,528 artifacts {{have been}} found pointing to human occupation that pre-dates Clovis. The artifacts were dated using luminescence technology that placed the artifacts between 13,200 and 15,500 years ago. The artifacts include chipping debris and a mobile tool kit with 56 pieces such as <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> and choppers. The artifacts were found in floodplain deposits 25 cm below the Clovis horizon.|$|R
50|$|During the 1994 {{excavations}} of mastodon B, archaeologists identified 34 {{stone tools}} {{in association with}} the disarticulated faunal remains. These tools included prismatic <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> gravers, and resharpening flakes. Subsequent examination of the bones from mastodon B revealed the presence of cut marks on a thoracic vertebra, which was recovered in direct contact with several flakes. The distinctive, linear, v-shaped profile of the cuts and their location along the thoracic spinous process indicated they were the result of butchering, and specifically, efforts to remove dorsal muscles along the backbone.|$|R
5000|$|A Heavy Neolithic {{archaeological site}} of the Qaraoun culture was {{discovered}} by Paul Bovier-Lapierre west north west of Yaroun and south of Ain Ebel; Lorraine Copeland remarked that [...] "the surface of this valley is literally covered in (worked flint) flakes". Bovier-Lapierre recovered several unpolished and polished axes with one exceptional elongated piece. All sorts of <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> discs and other tools {{were found on the}} site and were stored with the Saint Joseph University (now the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory). Henri Fleisch determined the collection also included some later Neolithic pieces.|$|R
50|$|Stone {{artefact}} scatters {{are among}} the most common site types and provide evidence of tool use and manufacture. These are often extensive surface scatters and deep stratified deposits of flaked finegrained stone, of lithic flakes. Much of this material is waste flakes, discarded during the manufacture process. Specific types of artefacts such as <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> or burins may indicate what the area was used for, for example processing animal skins. Stone artefact material is usually rine grained silcrete, chert, and quartz. Hornfels is an unusual and rare material, but is highly distinctive.|$|R
50|$|The La Chora Cave {{is located}} in San Pantaleon de Aras and {{includes}} a number of chert items as well as flint <b>blades</b> and <b>scraper</b> backs and Magdalenian bone harpoons.|$|R
50|$|Dukhan {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} Paleolithic sites in the peninsula. One of the largest bifaces in Qatar, measuring 35 cm in length and 12 cm in width, was previously recovered from Dukhan. In 1960, the largest Paleolithic flint chipping site at that time was discovered 5 km south of Dukhan, around 500 ft from the shore. It covered 2.5 acres and contained an assortment of Stone Age implements such as arrowheads, <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> and hand axes. In Ras Uwainat Ali, 10 km north of Dukhan, camping grounds and flint tools were discovered. The archaeological sites of Ras Abrouq, Zekreet and Al Da'asa are also in the vicinity of Dukhan.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{artifacts}} {{were found}} during excavation of 35-Ti-1 in the 1950s. Some {{of the bone}} and antler objects found include: wedges, adzes, awls, needles, bi-pointed pins, blades, harpoon barbs, chisels, digging stick handles, and bone carvings with faces, perhaps from clubs or wand handles. One house pit included whalebone objects including a 1.5m x 0.3m (~5 ft x 1 ft) seat and a possible whale vertebrae seat surrounded by fire pits. Numerous stone artifacts were also found at the site, including: projectile points, <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> gravers, core choppers, modified flakes, double pitted cobbles, hammerstones, and whetstones. The most recent occupation layer also contained trade goods including: rusted iron (perhaps knife blades), a copper pendant, and many sherds of Chinese porcelain.|$|R
50|$|The {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} recovered included a stone assemblage of tools, obsidian blades, basalt bowls and hammers, clay sling ammunition, finely denticulated flint <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> borers and a few axes. Pottery included Halafian painted shards both pattern and plain burnished with incised decoration including horizontal or vertical lines with dots, waves, zig-zags and cross-hatched designs. some with an application of red wash. These finds were significant as they represented the most southerly Halaf type painted pottery yet found. Red, orange, brown and black burnished bowls and jars were found in upper levels, with lower levels showing more coarse shards smoothed by hand or with straw. This little farming village shares the material culture of Byblos and southern Syrian and Halaf sites to the north.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{different}} species of bivalves {{have been used as}} <b>scrapers,</b> <b>blades,</b> clasps, and other such tools, due to their shape.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effects of processing conditions, i. e. cooling medium temperature (- 6, - 12 and - 18 C) and <b>scraper</b> <b>blade</b> rotational speed (50, 100 and 150 rpm) on the freeze concentration of lime juice. The initial soluble solid content of lime juice was 7. 6  Brix. Results showed that soluble solid content of lime juice increased as cooling medium temperature decreased while <b>scraper</b> <b>blade</b> rotational speed increased. It was also found that the processing condition with - 18 ˚C cooling medium temperature and 150 rpm rotational speed of the <b>scraper</b> <b>blade</b> was the best among all studied conditions, although the loss of the soluble solids with ice crystals during ice separation was relatively high at 35 %...|$|R
50|$|Two {{periods of}} inhabitation were found, {{the first period}} between 12000-10200 cal. BC was Natufian or perhaps preceramic neolithic where a {{skeleton}} was found covered with red ochre. Tools with agricultural purpose included mortars, grinders and stoneware basalt pestles. Other brown flint lithics recovered include a triangle, <b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers</b> and picks, tools suggested pre-natufian occupation. A late neolithic period was also detected at around 5000-4500 cal BC (Ubaid period) similar to late neolithic Byblos. Ceramics found included some Chalcolithic sherds and lithics included Canaanite blades, axes and adzes, a long, polished plano-convex flint hatchet; many large flakes and blades and sickle elements. A fragment of a stalked arrow is the only trace of occupation between the periods, Chalcolithic occupation followed the older occupation {{at the edge of}} the marsh at Mallaha.|$|R
5000|$|The {{onset of}} the Aurignacian culture seems to have paralleled the late Mousterian facies in the Carpathian caves, if we accept as valid the C14 dating of level IIb in the cave of Gura Cheii - Râşnov. Northwestern Transylvania is the site where layers of the Middle Aurignacian culture have been identified, as {{signaled}} {{by the presence of}} <b>blade</b> <b>scrapers,</b> refitted core, [...] burins. In Banat, the settlements of Tincova, Coşova and Româneşti-Dumbrăviţa, have produced flint tools demonstrating that the Aurignacian in this area evolved closely with that in Central Europe (the Krems-Dufour group). Aurignician items were also found in the caves in the Western Carpathians, the most famous of which is the Cioclovina cave (Hunedoara County) - the site, around the start of the 20th century, of the first Paleolithic discoveries in Transylvania.|$|R
50|$|Finds of {{predominantly}} blue-grey Upper Jurassic flints {{included an}} emphasized Upper Paleolithic element with finds of two Emireh points by Lorraine Copeland and R. Khawam in 1965. Artefacts included numerous burins, end <b>scrapers,</b> thick <b>blades,</b> steep <b>scrapers,</b> bladelet cores, tortoise cores, discoid cores, point cores and miniature flake cores. Collections {{from the site}} have been dispersed but a large number have been retained by Saint Joseph University.|$|R
50|$|The Magdalenian I {{was mainly}} {{composed}} of draw knives but showed hardly any real knife blades. The Magdalenian II was very rich in knife <b>blades,</b> followed by <b>scrapers</b> and burins in equal proportion. The Magdalenian III is clearly dominated by burins.|$|R
50|$|Qesem Cave {{stone tools}} {{are made of}} ﬂint. They are mainly <b>blades</b> end <b>scrapers,</b> burins, and {{naturally}} backed knives. There are also flakes and hammerstones. Some of the horizons contain many blades and related blade-tools but they are absent in others. However thick side-scrapers are found throughout them. Acheulian type hand-axes are found {{at the top and}} {{at the bottom of the}} archeological sequence. All stages of stone tool manufacture have been found. Many of the cores have sufficient of the surface cortex to allow reconstruction of the original stone’s shape.|$|R
50|$|Brinly-Hardy Company is an American {{corporation}} {{located in}} Jeffersonville, Indiana. Brinly-Hardy designs, manufactures and sells lawn care products including aerators, carts, lawn vac systems, dethatchers, sweepers, broadcast spreaders, sprayers, and rollers; gardening {{equipment such as}} plows, disc harrows, and cultivators and landscaping products such as rear <b>blades</b> and box <b>scrapers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lorraine Copeland made a {{collection}} of mostly Heavy Neolithic flints from the site in 1966. Amongst the finds were massive trapezoidal axes, chisels, a chopper, points, a pick, rough <b>scrapers,</b> <b>blades,</b> cores and hammerstones. The finds led Andrew Moore to suggest that Bezez cave was a factory site for such tools.|$|R
50|$|Tell Khardane is a Heavy Neolithic {{archaeological site}} of the Qaraoun culture north {{northeast}} of Amuq (Lebanon), Lebanon {{on the road to}} Chtaura. Several Heavy Neolithic flints including picks, <b>scrapers,</b> <b>blades</b> and flakes were found in fields that surround the tell mound. Many had been produced using the Levallois technique.|$|R
5000|$|Radiolarite is a {{very hard}} rock and {{therefore}} was extensively used by stone-age man for tools and weapons. Radiolarite has therefore been called the [...] "iron of the Paleolithic". Axes, <b>blades,</b> drills and <b>scrapers</b> were manufactured from it. The cutting edges of these tools, however, are somewhat less sharp than flint.|$|R
50|$|Gravettian finds {{originate}} in layer VII. In addition to 52 tools made of animal bones, reindeer antler and mammoth ivory, more than 1000 stone tools were unearthed, including <b>blades,</b> gouges and <b>scrapers.</b> More than 80 artifacts {{were identified as}} jewelry, including numerous ivory beads, beaded bones, perforated animal teeth and notched bone rods.|$|R
50|$|There was a copious {{amount of}} stone tools, {{including}} a trapezoidal axe of Hessian slate, 17 triangular arrowheads of flint and slate, 16 flint and 7 slate <b>blades,</b> 2 flint <b>scrapers,</b> 1 chalcedony core, plus another 40 pieces of worked stone (mainly flint). At {{least some of}} the flint appears to be imported.|$|R
50|$|The Clovis culture (about 13,300 - 12,900 {{calendar}} {{years before}} present) used projectile points in hunting. Previous {{to the use}} of projectile points, indigenous people used a tool-kit like that used in Asia, which included large axe cutting tools, <b>scrapers,</b> <b>blades</b> and flake tools. The Clovis point was the first use of large, symmetrical and fluted projectile points.|$|R
50|$|Fadous Sud {{proved to}} be an {{enormous}} Heavy Neolithic flint factory site with finds forming a wide-ranging assemblage in grey flint and cream chert that included large cores and flakes as well as <b>scrapers,</b> rabots, long <b>blades,</b> end <b>scrapers,</b> racloirs and a group of triangular flakes. Material from the beach had a whiter patina than that found nearer the road. The assemblage showed distinct similarities to that of the Heavy Neolithic type site at Qaraoun II and was classed as Neolithic. The finds were stored with the Saint Joseph University. A new study of this lithic site south of Tell Kfarabida was carried out in 2005 by Dörte Rokitta-Krumnow.|$|R
40|$|A human {{accident}} {{happened in}} one prison. While in a servitude work ”A” and ”B” quarreled and suddenly ”A” gave ”B” a blow by a scraper. At the moment, ”B” parried {{it with his}} left wrist, but the scraper haft broke and its blade stuck in ”C” while in a servitude work in front of ”B” at a distance about 1. 3 meters, and as the result ”C” died. We made scientific research in following dynamical analysis about this matter. 1) Before ”B” stopped the scraper with his left wrist, how did the <b>scraper</b> <b>blade</b> stick in ”C” to come out by centrifugal force? 2) The value of the scraper kinetic energy when the <b>scraper</b> <b>blade</b> would not come out. 3) The value of energy expended upon the wrist when ”B” stopped the scraper with his left wrist. 4) The value of energy when the scraper haft broke. 5) The value of kinetic energy when the scraper broke and its blade came out...|$|R
50|$|The basic scraper {{works well}} when the cakes are {{relatively}} thick and non-sticky. The final cakes are discharged by <b>blade</b> or wire <b>scrapers</b> {{on either side}} of the discs However, other types of agitators should be considered and installed if the cake is sticky or thin. An air blow-back system is often employed to aid cake removal where wetter cakes are discharged from disc filter.|$|R
50|$|As {{is common}} knowledge, the Neolithic Revolution saw {{the birth of}} civilization and Zuffenhausen was no different. As the longhouses on the various {{farmsteads}} that would soon become small farming villages began to stand at a length of about 40 ft, man began to keep domesticated sheep, pigs, and goats. The remains of several of these early sites have been discovered in the Zuffenhausen area from many different phases of the Early Neolithic period. The largest of these sites, located in Rot, yielded many individual finds of flint tools (<b>blades,</b> <b>scrapers,</b> axes, Quern-stones) and even inkstones and ceramics. The large amount of flint tools, blades in particular, suggests that {{the production of the}} tools using techniques such as stone grinding had become traditional. Such findings are spread across the region between Neuwirtshaus, Friedrichswahl, Zazenhausen and Rot and even beyond the Feuerbach river valley. The site of the old town center was an unsuitable location for the longhouses of the Linear Pottery culture (usually about 20 to 40 m long, typically held up to 60 persons and their cattle) as it was a swampy floodplain (the average temperatures of the climate were about 2 to 3 degrees higher than they are now), so they built their villages (typically a cluster of 10 or so buildings) at more elevated locations that still had a decent amount of loess. Another notable series of local discoveries are the about 200 tombs belonging to the Bandkeramik peoples in the 6th millennium BC have been unearthed. These findings, when combined with the roughly 4000 traces of prehistoric settlement like Hallstatt houses would indicate that this area was a favorite haunt of early civilization.|$|R
