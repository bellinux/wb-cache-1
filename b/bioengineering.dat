5|$|Industrialist John Hammond and his <b>bioengineering</b> company, InGen, {{have created}} a theme park called Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, a Costa Rican island, {{populated}} with cloned dinosaurs. After one of the dinosaur handlers is killed by a Velociraptor, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. Gennaro invites mathematician and chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is stunned to see a live Brachiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} has played an influential role in Asian agriculture and biotechnology {{due to its}} pioneering efforts in plant breeding and <b>bioengineering,</b> particularly {{in the development of}} high-yielding and pest-resistant crops. In recognition of its work, it was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding in 1977. Nine research centers are recognized as Centers of Excellence by presidential decree. UPLB hosts a number of local and international research centers, including the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, World Agroforestry Centre, and the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA).|$|E
5|$|Unlike other {{mushrooms}} {{known to}} release spores {{in response to}} a circadian rhythm, spore release in M.rotula is dependent upon sufficient moisture. Dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores for up to three weeks—a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other typical agarics. There are several species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them. Although M.rotula mushrooms are not generally considered edible, they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in <b>bioengineering</b> applications.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added {{programs}} and staff that continued {{the transformation of}} the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from MIT and started the first pathogen-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956. Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and <b>bioengineering</b> programs. In 1962, Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr. donated $15million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the Association of American Universities, an organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest of}} those {{research}} institutes {{is a nonprofit}} research organization {{referred to as the}} Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). GTRI provides sponsored research in a variety of technical specialties including radar, electro-optics, and materials engineering. Around forty percent (by award value) of Georgia Tech's research, especially government-funded classified work, is conducted through this counterpart organization. GTRI employs over 1,700 people and had $305 million in revenue in fiscal year 2014. The other institutes include: the Parker H. Petit Institute for <b>Bioengineering</b> & Bioscience, the Georgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology, the Georgia Tech Strategic Energy Institute, the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems, the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute, the Institute of Paper Science and Technology, Institute for Materials and the Institute for People and Technology.|$|E

Hawk is part of the team that goes to Cybertron and is captured by the Decepticons. In the final battle, Hawk uses the Matrix and becomes connected to it.|$|E
25|$|The nearly 30-acre {{park has}} been {{open to the}} public since the early 1970s. In 2011, a master plan was {{developed}} with help from the planning and design firm, Cecil Group of Boston and <b>Bioengineering</b> Group of Salem. The City of Salem paid $45,000 in federal money. In the long term, the projected cost to rehabilitate just the barracks was $1.5 million. But in the short term, there are multiple lower-cost items, like a proposed $15,000 kayak dock or $50,000 to relocate and improve the bathhouse. This is a very important project since Fort Pickering guarded Salem Harbor {{as far back as the}} 17th century.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} the future of {{osteoarthritis}} treatment is <b>bioengineering,</b> targeting the growth and/or repair of the damaged, arthritic joint. Centeno et al. have reported on the partial regeneration of an arthritic human hip joint using mesenchymal stem cells in one patient. It is yet to be shown that this result will apply to a larger group of patients and result in significant benefits. The FDA has stated that this procedure is being practiced without conforming to regulations, but Centeno claims that it is exempt from FDA regulation. It has not been shown in controlled clinical trials to be effective, and costs over $7,000.|$|E
25|$|Penn State College of Medicine {{students}} {{have gone on}} to become productive physicians and scientists. As of May 2011, the College of Medicine has granted 3,904 medical degrees and 1,004 graduate degrees. The College of Medicine offers degree programs in anatomy, biochemistry and molecular biology, <b>bioengineering,</b> cell and molecular biology, genetics, integrative biosciences, microbiology and immunology, neuroscience, pharmacology, and physiology, and two postdoctoral programs leading to an M.S. degree in Laboratory Animal Medicine, the only such program in the Commonwealth, and a M.S. in Public Health Sciences and a newly inaugurating M.P.H.

25|$|BCA's {{strengths}} are in its academics, extracurricular activities, and notable faculty, {{many of whom}} hold doctorates {{in their}} respective fields. While offering some 16 AP courses, BCA does not focus on them. Led by a faculty of which 20% hold PhDs, students at BCA enjoy courses that often surpass AP courses in technical rigor and creativity, such as Series Hybrids & Electric Vehicles, Civil Engineering & Architecture, Cybersecurity, Digital Electronics, Optics & Lasers, Arduino Microcontroller, Modern Optical Physics, Advanced Problems in Music Theory & Technology, Comparative Asian Cultures, Microscopy, Forensic Science, Biopsychology, Foundations of Nanotechnology, Interactive Design, Robotics, Stagecraft, Medical Microbiology, <b>BioEngineering,</b> Markets & Trading, Zoology, Acting Methods, Bioethics, Java, Python, Anatomy & Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Macroeconomics & International Economics, Advanced Business Topics, Entrepreneurship, and Culinology.|$|E
25|$|Under Richard C. Atkinson's {{leadership}} as chancellor from 1980 to 1995, the university strengthened its {{ties with the}} city of San Diego by encouraging technology transfer with developing companies, transforming San Diego into a world leader in technology-based industries. He oversaw a rapid expansion of the School of Engineering, later renamed after Qualcomm founder Irwin M. Jacobs, with the construction of the San Diego Supercomputer Center and establishment of the computer science, electrical engineering, and <b>bioengineering</b> departments. Private donations increased from $15 million to nearly $50 million annually, faculty expanded by nearly 50%, and enrollment doubled to about 18,000 students during his administration. By the end of his chancellorship, the quality of UC San Diego graduate programs was ranked 10th in the nation by the National Research Council.|$|E
25|$|While {{offering}} some 16 AP courses, BCA {{does not}} focus on them. This often hurts its placement in rankings with methodologies that place great weight on the test-driven, college level courses. BCA has traditionally given teachers great freedom in curriculum design to adequately engage the intellectual capacity of the student body. Courses thus often surpass AP courses in technical rigor and creativity, such as Series Hybrids & Electric Vehicles, Civil Engineering & Architecture, Cybersecurity, Digital Electronics, Optics & Lasers, Arduino Microcontroller, Modern Optical Physics, Advanced Problems in Music Theory & Technology, Comparative Asian Cultures, Microscopy, Forensic Science, Biopsychology, Foundations of Nanotechnology, Interactive Design, Robotics, Stagecraft, Medical Microbiology, <b>BioEngineering,</b> Markets & Trading, Zoology, Acting Methods, Bioethics, Java, Python, Anatomy & Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Macroeconomics & International Economics, Advanced Business Topics, Entrepreneurship, and Culinology.|$|E
25|$|The {{framework}} is formed by large collections of anatomical, physiological, and pathological data stored in digital format, typically by predictive simulations developed from these collections and by services intended to support {{researchers in the}} creation and maintenance of these models, {{as well as in}} the creation of end-user technologies to be used in the clinical practice. VPH models aim to integrate physiological processes across different length and time scales (multi-scale modelling). These models make possible the combination of patient-specific data with population-based representations. The objective is to develop a systemic approach which avoids a reductionist approach and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, tissue, cells, molecules), by scientific discipline (biology, physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, <b>bioengineering)</b> or anatomical sub-system (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In 1962, {{the fledgling}} {{university}} began {{searching for a}} dean to head its planned medical school, {{which would be the}} first such institution in San Diego County. The concept was based on the successful models of public medical education and practice in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The man eventually chosen was Joseph Stokes III, an expert in the fields of preventive medicine and cardiovascular epidemiology. Stokes {{played a key role in}} aggressively recruiting leading physician scientists of its era and rapidly building the institute's reputation as an elite medical school. Faculty members recruited to the university by Stokes included Y.C. Fung, who would later be considered the father of <b>bioengineering.</b> His efforts were aided by the campus's existing strengths in the biological sciences and close proximity to the famed Salk Institute.|$|E
25|$|Transhumanist themes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} prominent in various literary forms during {{the period in which}} the movement itself has emerged. Contemporary science fiction often contains positive renditions of technologically enhanced human life set in utopian (especially techno-utopian) societies. However, science fiction's depictions of enhanced humans or other posthuman beings frequently come with a cautionary twist. The more pessimistic scenarios include many horrific or dystopian tales of human <b>bioengineering</b> gone wrong. In the decades immediately before transhumanism emerged as an explicit movement, many transhumanist concepts and themes began appearing in the speculative fiction of authors of the Golden Age of Science Fiction such as Robert A. Heinlein (Lazarus Long series, 1941–87), A. E. van Vogt (Slan, 1946), Isaac Asimov (I, Robot, 1950), Arthur C. Clarke (Childhood's End, 1953) and Stanisław Lem (Cyberiad, 1967). C. S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength (1945) contains an early critique of transhumanism.|$|E
25|$|Wirtz is the PI of a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) {{site in the}} Nanotechnology for Biology and <b>Bioengineering</b> program. Wirtz also {{founded the}} Johns Hopkins Center for Digital Pathology that brings {{together}} pathologists, surgeons, oncologists, and engineers to develop new single-cell technology for improved diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic approaches for human diseases, including cancer, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and frailty in aging. He co-directs the Cancer Nanotechnology Training Center, another National Cancer Institute-funded entity. From 2005-2012, he also directed a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) funded interdisciplinary graduate research training program in nanotechnology for biology and medicine. The program aimed to produce researchers able to create new particles and materials {{to be used in}} the detection, treatment, prevention, and cure of human disease. It recruited students from biochemistry, chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering, while making a special effort to include minorities under-represented in science.|$|E
25|$|The UC San Diego School of Medicine {{is ranked}} tied for 18th for {{research}} and 12th for primary care in the 2018 U.S. News & World Report rankings. The Rady School of Management at UC San Diego is ranked 17th {{in the world for}} faculty research and 8th for alumni entrepreneurship in the 2014 Financial Times’ Global MBA. In 2014 the Rady School ranked 1st in the nation in intellectual capital by Bloomberg Businessweek, which measured faculty research published in the top 20 business journals from 2009-2013. UC San Diego was named 8th in the nation among doctoral institutions for {{the number of students who}} study abroad for a full academic year, according to the Institute of International Education Open Doors report. Three doctoral programs at UC San Diego—biological sciences, <b>bioengineering</b> and Scripps Institution of Oceanography—are 1st in the nation in the National Research Council’s Data-Based Assessment of Research-Doctorate Programs report.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{merging of}} the school's two {{engineering}} departments into a single School of Engineering in 1982, new buildings have been continually added as the division expands. Major additions include: the San Diego Supercomputer Center, completed in 1986; Powell-Focht <b>Bioengineering</b> Hall, completed in 2003; and the Structural and Materials Engineering building, completed in 2012. Significant construction work on the previously undeveloped northern part of campus also took place during this time. Two graduate professional schools, the School of Global Policy and Strategy and Rady School of Management, were constructed in the area adjacent to and near the Supercomputer Center, as well as Roosevelt College, a transfer student apartment complex called The Village at Torrey Pines, and the RIMAC athletic facilities. Additionally, the Conrad Prebys Music Center was completed in 2009 {{as part of an}} expanding arts district to house UC San Diego's music department, renowned for its programs in experimental music.|$|E
25|$|The Leipzig area, which until {{recently}} {{was among the}} regions with the highest unemployment rate, could benefit greatly from investments by Porsche and BMW. With the VW Phaeton factory in Dresden, and many part suppliers, the automobile industry has again {{become one of the}} pillars of Saxon industry, {{as it was in the}} early 20th century. Zwickau is another major Volkswagen location. Freiberg, a former mining town, has emerged as a foremost location for solar technology. Dresden and some other regions of Saxony play a leading role in some areas of international biotechnology, such as electronic <b>bioengineering.</b> While these high-technology sectors do not yet offer a large number of jobs, they have stopped or even reversed the brain drain that was occurring until the early 2000s in many parts of Saxony. Regional universities have strengthened their positions by partnering with local industries. Unlike smaller towns, Dresden and Leipzig in the past experienced significant population growth.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Radulovacki {{started a}} long and {{fruitful}} collaboration with David W. Carley, a Professor of Medicine, <b>Bioengineering</b> and Pharmacology at the UIC. Their research efforts focused on developing pharmacological approaches {{for the treatment of}} sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, an involuntary cessation of breathing that occurs during sleep, affects at least 3% to 5% of the adult population in the United States. In addition, the prevalence of sleep-related apnea is dramatically elevated in the elderly, ranging from 28% to 67% of that population. Sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, memory problems, weight gain, headaches and death. Since there were no medicines to alleviate this condition, Radulovacki and Carley set out to develop a drug treatment. Their initial work focussed on an experimental model of sleep apnea in rats, initially testing the effects of adenosine compounds. Eventually, they obtained positive results using serotonin and other compounds. As a result, the UIC patented their discoveries, obtaining numerous US and international patents.|$|E
