5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the <b>base</b> <b>block</b> to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results of}} tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the <b>base</b> <b>block</b> was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E

In all, Blaha spent four months with the Mir-22 Cosmonaut crew conducting material science, fluid science, and life science research, before returning to Earth the next year aboard Atlantis on STS-81.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA planned {{to launch a}} modular space station called Freedom as a {{counterpart}} to Mir, while the Soviets were planning to construct Mir-2 in the 1990s {{as a replacement for}} the station. Because of budget and design constraints, Freedom never progressed past mock-ups and minor component tests and, with the fall of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Space Race, the project was nearly cancelled entirely by the United States House of Representatives. The post-Soviet economic chaos in Russia also led to the cancellation of Mir-2, though only after its <b>base</b> <b>block,</b> DOS-8, had been constructed. Similar budgetary difficulties were faced by other nations with space station projects, which prompted the US government to negotiate with European states, Russia, Japan, and Canada in the early 1990s to begin a collaborative project. In June 1992, American president George H. W. Bush and Russian president Boris Yeltsin agreed to cooperate on space exploration. The resulting Agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation Concerning Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes called for a short joint space programme with one American astronaut deployed to the Russian space station Mir and two Russian cosmonauts deployed to a Space Shuttle.|$|E

5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high <b>base</b> <b>block</b> decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have a striking resemblance to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the Salyut programme, Mir {{represented}} the next stage in the Soviet Union's space station programme. The first module of the station, known as the core module or <b>base</b> <b>block,</b> was launched in 1986 and followed by six further modules. Proton rockets were used to launch all of its components except for the docking module, which was installed by a US Space Shuttle mission STS-74 in 1995. When complete, the station consisted of seven pressurised modules and several unpressurised components. Power was provided by several photovoltaic arrays attached directly to the modules. The station was maintained at an orbit between [...] and [...] altitude and travelled at an average speed of 27,700km/h (17,200mph), completing 15.7 orbits per day.|$|E

40|$|Coconut {{shell is}} often {{considered}} as solid waste {{though it has}} high strength, hardness and bond capacity. After using coconut fruit, outer shell is released to the environment as a waste material. Recently, several research studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate a possibility of utilize this waste as building material. The block manufactured using Crushed Coconut Shell (CCS) has shown acceptable structural properties and thermal performances at 28 days. Since the coconut shell is a biodegradable material it is important to investigate long term behaviour of CCS <b>based</b> masonry <b>block.</b> As masonry blocks are used as wall, an investigation on the behaviour of a wall panel is useful. In this study, long term behaviour of CCS <b>based</b> <b>block</b> and panel were investigated. Compressive strength, water absorption and thermal performances of the individual block, which was manufactured twelve months ago, were determined. These solid masonry blocks having the size of 360 mm× 100 mm× 170 mm were cast with a mix proportion of 1 : 5 cement-sand by using local block manufacturing machine. Crushed coconut shell was used as replacement for coarse aggregates (chips) with 25 % (volume basis). Internal surface and external surface temperatures of the block were measured by using thermocouples. In addition, load-displacement curve of the wall panel subjected to vertical static loading was investigated. As a further development of the block, cost analysis was carried out. From the experimental study, it was found that in long term also, the CCS <b>based</b> <b>blocks</b> exhibit the similar thermal performances as in the short term. Compressive strength and water absorption found in the current study were compared with the same properties at 28 days found in a previous study.

40|$|Recently, Wang et al. {{presented}} an efficient logistic map <b>based</b> <b>block</b> encryption system.

The network comprises a set of inexpensive camera sensors to capture the images, a sink node equipped with sufficient computation and storage capabilities and a data processing server. The transmission security between the sink node and the server is gained by utilizing the improved cipher. Both theoretical analysis and simulation {{results indicate that the}} improved algorithm can overcome the flaws and maintain all the merits of the original cryptosystem.
