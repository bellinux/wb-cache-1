50|$|Vine scrub {{along the}} trail hosts many animals. Green catbirds, paradise riflebirds and noisy pitta are species of {{significance}} locally. Patches of grass adjacent to rainforest are visited at night by red-necked pademelons. Rufous bettongs also emerge from their grassy nests to feed on tubers and fungi at night. Dense vine scrub and thickets of lantana make some sections of the trail an important habitat for the shy and vulnerable black-breasted button-quail. Dish-shaped scrapes in the dirt are tell-tale signs that these secretive birds have been searching for food on the forest floor. Ducks, darters and other waterbirds may visit the Brisbane River that runs adjacent to the trail between Moore and Linville. There are often sightings of wedge tail eagles and <b>brown</b> <b>goshawks</b> gliding on the wind searching for their prey in the rural landscapes below. Glossy black cockatoos, brush, regent bowerbirds and the sulphur-crested cockatoos. On the hills adjacent to Blackbutt Creek and in the Benarkin State Forest, you may see the ancestors of deer given to the region in 1873 by Queen Victoria as a gift after Queensland was named in her honour. Pretty faced or whip tail wallabies are often seen at dusk in and around Blackbutt and Benarkin.Numerous frogs, skinks and lizards live in the area, including the vulnerable and secretive collared delma (a small legless lizard). There are often, sightings of yellow face whip snakes, spotted pythons, goannas and water dragons near Benarkin and Blackbutt Creek.|$|R

50|$|Not {{infrequently}} taken is {{the black}} (Pteropus alecto) and grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus), the largest of Australian bats, although smaller bats have also been killed. Introduced mammals, namely rats (Rattus ssp.), European hare (Lepus europaeus) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), especially the abundant young of the latter after their litters disperse, are also hunted. Opportunistic as are most predators and owls, given the chance powerful owl will also prey on nocturnal birds such as the tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides). Roosting diurnal birds are also taken such as various cockatoos and parrots (around a dozen species thus far recorded), Australian brushturkey (Alectura latham), <b>brown</b> <b>goshawks</b> (Accipiter fasciatus), dusky moorhen (Gallinula tenebrosa), white-faced herons (Egretta novaehollandiae), crested pigeon (Ocyphaps lophotes), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia picata), kookaburras (Dacelo ssp.), superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae), olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), Australian magpie (Cracticus tibicen), currawongs (Strepera ssp.), honeyeaters and crows and ravens (Corvus ssp.). In one study, the most frequently killed bird prey species were pied currawong (Strepera graculina) and crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) and avian prey {{taken as a whole}} was estimated to average 350 g. Insects may supplement the diet and are typically taken on the wing. Rarely, lizards and snakes are also captured. The vast majority of prey is taken from tree, often in or near the tree canopy, including unlikely items such as rock-wallabies (Petrogale ssp.) that sometimes take refuge in trees. Powerful owls frequently take apart prey and consume piecemeal. At daytime perches, it occasionally wakes to consume food until leaving the roost in the evening. It is the only owl in the world known to exhibit the behaviour of mantling over food while it roosts during the day. One theory is that it is the male which regularly holds onto the prey during the day and thus can control distribution of food to the family in keeping with his dominant size, whereas in most owls females are larger and more dominant thus the males could not display such behaviour as keeping food from his larger mate. Caching of part-eaten prey remains has been recorded, although caching of prey is far more common of a behaviour in barking owls. In a study comparing their diets against those of co-existing Greater sooty owls (Tyto tenebricosa) and Australian masked owls (Tyto novaehollandiae), these two smaller owls focused on smaller prey on average and ate more small terrestrial mammalian prey rather than the arboreal mammalian prey favored most exclusively by the powerful owl. However, some overlap in the diet was recorded between all 3 species and a certain level of competition was predicted, in which the powerful owl would presumably be dominant.|$|R

50|$|Young bell miners {{leave the}} nest about 12 days post hatching, but {{continue}} to be fed by parents and helpers for a further 10 weeks. Bell miners will start helping nests when less than 2 months old, but the transition is gradual where recently fledged birds will {{continue to be}}g from other helpers and then either consume the offered food or give it to younger birds. Females tend to disperse from the colony at 8 months and they reach breeding age at 8.3 months. It is likely that as they reach maturity the mothers become intolerant of their mature daughters prompting their dispersal. The mortality of bell miners prior to breeding age is very high at 93%. The greatest risk is soon after young bell miners leave the nest when many are preyed upon. Known predators include grey currawong, Australian raven, laughing kookaburra, <b>brown</b> <b>goshawk,</b> copperhead snake, and eastern brown snake. By the time they reach breeding age the sex ratio is skewed with more surviving males, probably due to higher mortality of the dispersing females.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{season of the}} Uvea parakeet is from August to January. The nests are located in natural cavities in native trees, with Syzygium and Mimusops accounting for 90% of nesting trees. Three (occasionally two) eggs are laid in these cavities and incubated for 21 days. The nestling period is around 43 days, {{with an average of}} around 1.5 chicks being fledged per nesting attempt. Fledging survival is lower, however, with around 0.75 chicks surviving a month after fledging. The main causes of chick mortality are starvation (most common in the smallest, weakest chick), <b>brown</b> <b>goshawk</b> predation and human collecting (for the pet trade). It once ranged across the other Loyalty Islands; attempts to reintroduce it to Lifou in 1925 and 1963 failed. One source reports that the reintroduced birds simply flew back to Uvea. Studies of potential nesting success on the two islands showed that future reintroductions to Lifou would fail unless the ship rat population is controlled. It is threatened by habitat loss and the pet trade. Around 30-50% of its habitat has been lost in the last thirty years. Collection for the pet trade not only reduces the number of birds but the collection method, which involves cutting trees open to get at the chicks, renders the nesting sites useless for future breeding attempts and lack of breeding cavities may be limiting the population. In the event that ship rats were to reach Uvea it would be at greater risk of extinction. The parakeet is listed in Appendix I of CITES and the IUCN considers the conservation status as endangered. This species is threatened because of low numbers, a limited home range and habitat loss. However, in recent years, community involvement in saving the species have contributed to significant gains in increasing the Ouvea parakeet population from an estimated 617 in 1993 to 2,090 in 2009.|$|E

40|$|Two {{medium-sized}} woodland hawks, the Grey Goshawk Accipiter novaehollandiae and the <b>Brown</b> <b>Goshawk</b> Accipiter fasciatus, are sympatric in the Australian wet tropics. Because {{females are}} considerably larger than males, {{the two species}} and sexes form a four-member guild. Typically, when similar raptor species occur together they partition resources. Radio-tracking was used to study habitat use and composition, and interactions between the Australian goshawks. Sample sizes were small and there was considerable individual variation. Nevertheless, there was evidence of niche partitioning according to home range size and overlap, habitat composition and habitat use. In general, both species frequented forests or woodlands and adjacent open country. Consistent with morphological, dietary and hunting differences, Grey Goshawks, especially the males, frequented closed forest types and Brown Goshawks more open habitats of woodlands, crops and edges. In the non-breeding season, females ranged widely and their ranges overlapped both inter- and intra-specifically, whereas those of males of each species tended not to overlap with males and females of either species. In the breeding season, home range overlap declined markedly between neighbouring pairs of the two species, {{and there was no}} overlap between the females. The two species have relatively small home ranges, attributable to their rich habitat. In turn, this may facilitate co-existence of two such similar-sized accipiters. Nevertheless, there was evidence of competition between the two most similar-sized members of the guild, the male Grey Goshawk and the female <b>Brown</b> <b>Goshawk...</b>|$|E
40|$|The coding {{of sound}} {{frequency}} and {{location in the}} avian auditory midbrain nucleus (nMLD) was examined in three diurnal raptors: the brown falcon (Falco berigora), the swamp harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and the <b>brown</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Accipiter fasciatus). Previously this nucleus has been studied with free field stimuli in only one other species, the barn owl (Tyto alba). We found some parallels between the organisation of nMLD in the diurnal raptors and that reported in the barn owl in that the central region of nMLD was tonotopically organised and contained cells that did not encode location, and the lateral region (nMLDl) contained cells which were sensitive to stimulus position. However, unlike the barn owl, which has units with circumscribed receptive fields, cells sensitive to stimulus location had large receptive fields which were restricted in azimuth but not in elevation (hemifield units). Such cells could not provide an acoustic space map in which both azimuthal and elevational dimensions were represented, {{but there was a}} tendency for units with contralateral borders to be found superficially, and those with ipsilateral borders to be found deep, in nMLDl. Hemifield units displayed receptive field properties consistent with the directional properties of the tympana in the presence of sound transmission through the interaural canal, if there is a central mechanism which is sensitive to interaural intensity differences...|$|E
40|$|As a {{compromise}} between forestry and wildlife needs, it has been recommended that a mix of native forest and plantation {{in various stages of}} succession be integrated to form a mosaic of different forest types. However, lack of detailed biological data on species dependent upon native forest has hampered the development of such an approach. Between 1987 and 1990, we monitored breeding and foraging activity of the Grey Goshawk Accipiter novaehollandiae and <b>Brown</b> <b>Goshawk</b> A. Jasciatus in a North Queensland State Forest converted to exotic softwood Pinus caribaea production. Fifty per cent of the area was planted with pine aged between 1 and 9 years old, intermixed with native forest and woodland. The area supported several pairs of goshawks that bred only in large mature trees within native forest or woodland, but often used plantations for hunting where these formed ecotones with other habitats. Based on {{the results of this study}} we make the following preliminary recommendations for the conservation of goshawks in areas of managed plantation: (1) forest maintenance should be avoided, particularly around active goshawk nests, during the breeding season, from August to December; (2) an area of 20 ha of native forest should be retained as a buffer zone around any active goshawk nest; (3) woodland and forest along watercourses is particularly important goshawk habitat and a minimum width for riparian buffer zones is considered to be 200 m from the watercourse to the edge of P. caribaea plantations; (4) the ecotone between tall open forest and tall woodland that occurs adjacent to riparian closed forest is an important habitat for breeding goshawks and should be conserved wherever possible; and (5) the 50 - 50 mix of native woodland/forest and plantation, as at Abergowrie, appears able to sustain viable populations of goshawks, at least in the short-term...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} general {{ecology of the}} Raptor Community living in the Canberra Region. In particular, we were {{interested}} in the productivity, reproductive success, food habits and trophic structure. We located 12 species of breeding raptors in the area, similar to previous surveys. Although we located most nests on fannland and non·urban nature reserves, there were II species were breeding inside the city limits, with the only exception being the White-bellied Sea Eagle Haliaeetus lellcogaster. a species that is mainly coastal but is also a breeding resident in this inland region, nesting in rivers and dams. The productivity and reproductive success of the community was high overall, with five species showing higher productivity than average, while four more had average productivity. Only two species had low breeding success and productivity. The Collared Sparrowhawk Accipiter cirrocephalus - who made breeding attempts but failed in most of them - and the Black-shouldered Kite Elanus axilaris - whose tenitories were inactive the first 18 months of survey. and only started breeding late in 2003. The diet of the raptors was similar to previous records, though there were exceptions. This study provided the first account of the food habits of inland Whitebellied Sea eagles. This species captured prey of aquatic origin, like the Australian Wood Duck Chenonettajubatta (23. 3 % of items and 26. 1 % biomass); fish (23. 3 and 26. 1 %) and reptiles (13. 3 and 13. 2 %). The diet of the <b>Brown</b> <b>Goshawk</b> Accipiter gentilis showed an unusually high number of insects (54. 4 %), but birds and mammals provided most of the biomass. The dietary overlap (based on the Pianka index) of the species was low compared to other studies. The trophic structure produced by the UPGMA cluster analysis revealed 3 main feeding guilds: a) Vertebrate-feeders: Wedge-tailed Eagle Aquila audax, Little Eagles Hieraaetus morphnoides and Whistling Kite Haliastur sphenurus, which based their diet on mammals and large birds; b) Insect-small vertebrates guild: formed by the Brown Falcon Falco berigora and the Brown Goshawk; and c) Insect-feeders; Composed by the Nankeen Kestrel F. cenchroides and the Southern Boobok Ninox novaeseelandiae. The other five raptors were not grouped on any guild. Two of them were very specialized predators, the bird-catcher Peregrine Falcon F. peregrinus and the rodent-catcher Black-shouldered Kite. Finally, we explored some case studies on the topic of trophic dynamics. Two were comparisons of the diet of the same species living in the same area at different times. They provided contrasting examples ofprey-switching. Peregrines and Hobbies adjusted to a decrease in the abundance of their main prey, the Starling Sturnus vulgaris, by consuming small numbers of several native bird species. Interestingly, it seems that the Starling decline is related to an increase of Common Myna Acridotheres Iris/is, a species that neither falcon seems able to capture. On the other case Wedge-tailed Eagles changed from a diet dominated by rabbit to a diet dominated mainly by other species: Eastern Grey Kangaroos (Birds as a group were also important), thus switching one prey species with another, unlike the falcons. On the final example, we used an original approach to evaluate the dietary overlap of two species (Wedge-tails and Sea Eagles) by clustering neighbouring pairs, which are more likely to show interspecific interactions. The neighbouring pairs showed low overlap in their diets despite their close proximity...|$|E
