Metzen's work with 2004's massively multiplayer online role-playing game World of Warcraft was not as extensive as his earlier work, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> contributed with script writing, artwork and voice work.|$|E
5|$|One of Vick's {{favorite}} {{targets in}} the limited Tech passing attack was wide receiver André Davis, who caught 24 passes for 318 yards and two touchdowns. Davis was limited {{by the fact that}} he played in only nine of Tech's 11 games, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> finished as the Hokies' No. 2 receiver in terms of yardage. Tech's No. 1 receiver was Emmett Johnson, who caught 34 passes for 574 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|The estate {{started to}} {{deteriorate}} {{after it was}} inherited by the Governor's illegitimate son George Ferguson, known as the Admiral because of his naval career. He was already heavily in debt when he became the fifth laird in 1821, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and undertook much extravagant construction on the estate, including the erection of follies. To cover his substantial gambling debts, he began to sell parcels of estate land, and upon inheriting Pitfour he began selling furniture, books, farm equipment and other items, realising more than £9,000.|$|E
5|$|Weinke's {{favorite}} {{target was}} wide receiver Peter Warrick, who led all Seminole receivers with 71receptions and 931yards in just nine games {{during the regular}} season. Five times, Warrick earned more than 100receiving yards in a game. Warrick's season was shortened by a two-game suspension following his arrest for underpaying for clothes, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> was named an All-America selection at wide receiver, signifying his status {{as one of the}} best players in the country at the position.|$|E
5|$|When Clark {{finally left}} Fort Pitt in August 1781, he was {{accompanied}} by only 400 men, although he expected to meet Lochry and his Pennsylvanians at Fort Henry (present Wheeling, West Virginia). Clark was angry {{about the lack of}} support given his campaign, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> hoped that the Kentucky militia, who were to rendezvous with him at Fort Nelson (Louisville, Kentucky), would provide additional men. He intended to at least carry out an expedition against enemy Indians if he did not have enough men to attack Detroit.|$|E

5|$|During the 1999–2000 season, Sakic reached several career milestones. Injuries limited him to only 60 games, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> {{managed to}} lead the team in scoring with 81 points. On December 27, 1999, against the St. Louis Blues, Sakic earned an assist to become the 56th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points.

It also gave him 1,049 points with the Quebec/Colorado franchise, passing Peter Šťastný as the all-time leader on the team.|$|E
5|$|Eddie Barlow, {{one of the}} South African {{members of}} the Rest of the World team, {{suggested}} to Sobers {{towards the end of}} the English series that the West Indian might like to take part in a friendly double-wicket competition in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury on 12 September, the local Pioneers' Day holiday. Barlow was one of several prominent South African cricketers already booked to play. Sobers was initially noncommittal, but decided to go following assurances that Rhodesia did not practise apartheid and there would be no racial discrimination regarding team selection. Sobers' intended participation became public on 7 September when a London newspaper reported on it; widespread condemnation of the West Indian captain followed, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> travelled, landing in Salisbury early on the day of the event.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years he would serve on the always-virulent {{south-eastern}} border, where he made his home in the city of Illńce. In 1644 under Koniecpolski he took part in the battle of Ochmatów where Commonwealth forces dealt a crushing defeat to Toğay bey's (Tuhaj Bej) Tatars. He served as one of seven pułkowniks in Koniecpolski's army, and once again his cavalry unit charge proved to be a decisive moment of the battle, bringing him much fame. That year he also became a regimentarz in his own light cavalry unit, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> held the rank of a porucznik of hussars.|$|E

50|$|Bobby {{finds the}} bunny form embarrassing. Furthermore {{the longer he}} stays in that form, the more {{difficult}} it is to form the essential mental image of his original form to change back.

5|$|From then on, Kouao kept Climbié {{away from}} hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao {{said to the}} pastors {{that she was the}} mother and that demons were inside Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her {{injuries}} were due to demonic possession. On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> believed that a person could be possessed.|$|E
5|$|In 1095, at the Council of Piacenza, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos {{requested}} {{military aid}} from Pope Urban II, {{probably in the}} form of a small body of mercenary reinforcements he could direct and control. Alexios had restored the Empire's finances and authority, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> faced a number of foreign enemies, particularly the migrating Turks who had colonised the sparsely populated areas of Anatolia. At the Council of Clermont later that year, Urban raised the issue again and preached for a Crusade. Many historians consider that Urban also hoped that aiding the Eastern Church would lead to its reunion with the Western under his leadership.|$|E
5|$|Injuries reduced Mullen to 49 {{games with}} the Blues in 1982–83, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> scored 47 points. His 41 goals in 1983–84 set a record as the most scored by an American-born player in NHL history (broken by Bobby Carpenter the {{following}} season). He again reached the 40-goal plateau in 1984–85, and had 92 points total. He missed {{the first three days}} of the Blues' training camp prior to the 1985–86 season in a contract dispute before agreeing to a one-year deal. On February 1, 1986, the Blues dealt him to the Calgary Flames as part of a six player trade. Mullen went to Calgary, along with Terry Johnson and Rik Wilson, for Eddy Beers, Charlie Bourgeois and Gino Cavallini.|$|E

He won the Dick Howser Trophy and the National Pitcher of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} negotiator Jean Sainteny flew to Saigon {{to consult}} Leclerc, who was acting as high commissioner {{in the absence}} of d'Argenlieu. Leclerc approved Sainteny's proposal to negotiate with Ho because he preferred a diplomatic solution to a larger conflict, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> dispatched a flotilla with shiploads of French soldiers to northern Vietnam ready to attack if the talks failed. At that time, Ho felt that negotiations with the French constituted his best option because the Soviet Union had not yet endorsed the Vietminh or the Vietnamese nationalist party (VNQDD), and the French Communist Party chose to support French rule in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Thompson ran for Congress {{several more}} times. In 1900, he ran in Ohio's 3rd congressional {{district}} as the nominee of the Union Reform Party, {{which was made}} up of Prohibition Party members who split from the main party. He received just 0.32% of the vote, and Republican Robert M. Nevin won the election. In 1908, he ran for the same seat for the re-united Prohibition Party, but won just 0.4% of the vote, losing the election to Democrat James M. Cox. In 1910, Thompson ran for governor of Ohio. Despite the growing popularity of the idea of prohibition, the Prohibition Party candidate got just 0.77% of the vote as Democrat Judson Harmon carried the state. His final attempt at election came in Indiana's 4th congressional district, just over the Ohio border. With 2.24% of the vote, it was Thompson's best performance, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> fell far short of victory.|$|E

5|$|With pessimism for Citadel {{increasing}} {{with each}} delay, in June, Alfred Jodl, the Chief of Staff at the OKW, instructed {{the armed forces}} propaganda office to portray the upcoming operation as a limited counteroffensive. Due to concerns of an Allied landing {{in the south of}} France or in Italy and delays in deliveries of the new tanks, Hitler postponed again, this time to 20 June. Zeitzler was profoundly concerned with the delays, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> supported the offensive. On 17–18 June, following a discussion in which the OKW Operations Staff suggested abandoning the offensive, Hitler further postponed the operation until 3 July. Finally, on 1 July, Hitler announced 5 July as the launch date of the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Zersenay {{failed to}} make the podium for a second time at the 2006 World Cross Country Championships, but his fourth-place finish headed the Eritrean team towards silver medal in the team competition. The {{following}} month, Zersenay overcame both Fabiano Joseph and Boniface Kiprop to win the Great Manchester Run. He sprinted to the line with a finishing time of 27:36; an Eritrean record and the second fastest that year. In August that year, he significantly improved his 10,000m best at Memorial Van Damme; his time of 26:37.25 knocked almost thirty seconds off his previous mark, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> finished behind the emerging Micah Kogo who ran the tenth fastest ever time. A new best of 59:16 by Zersenay at the Rotterdam Half Marathon equalled Samuel Wanjiru's course record and boded well for the upcoming championship race.|$|E
