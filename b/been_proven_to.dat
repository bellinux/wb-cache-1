40|$|Abstract — Fuzzy {{objective}} function–based clustering methods <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fast {{tools for}} classification and segmentation purposes. Unfortunately, {{most of the}} available fuzzy clustering methods are using the spherical or ellipsoidal distances, which <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> result in spurious clusters, when working on color data. In this paper, a general case of clustering is discussed and a general method is proposed and its convergence <b>is</b> <b>proved.</b> Also, it <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> that the FCM and the FCV methods are special cases of the proposed method. Based on the general method, a special case for color image processing is proposed.

Based on the proposed color clustering method, a new fast fuzzy segmentation method is proposed and <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly efficient.

5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources of inequality, SIGI is able to penalize high levels of inequality {{in each of the}} applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by the gaps between the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has <b>been</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has <b>been</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> produce at least one digestive enzyme and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E

5|$|Untreated DPB {{leads to}} bronchiectasis, {{respiratory}} failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%. With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB {{now have a}} much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like P.aeruginosa. The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment {{has been allowed to}} end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has <b>been</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.|$|E
5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not <b>been</b> <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E
