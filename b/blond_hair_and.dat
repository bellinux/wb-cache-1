5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, <b>blond</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> a small moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance {{are supported by}} Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> blue eyes—changed radically {{over the}} course of time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> {{sits on a}} white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, at {{the side}} of the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E

5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{reluctant}} {{to follow up on}} the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode, who was run over by a car. The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander question him, believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E

25|$|By the 1880s {{a number}} of {{linguists}} and anthropologists argued that the Aryans themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. Theodor Poesche proposed that the Aryans originated in the vast Rokitno, or Pinsk Marshes, then in the Russian Empire, now covering much of {{the southern part of}} Belarus and the north-west of the Ukraine, but it was Karl Penka who popularised the idea that the Aryans had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> blue eyes.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Henley's [...] "maimed strength," [...] his impeded vigour, {{even his}} <b>blond</b> {{upstanding}} <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> [...] "beard all tangled," [...] his uncomplaining fortitude {{under the most}} cruel trials, and the candid freshness of his conversation on men and books, won Stevenson's heart.|$|R
25|$|Turtledove depicts his {{nations as}} being {{analogous}} to real European nations, including {{as far as}} possible actual linguistic relationships. For example, the Derlavaian analogs of the Germanic nations are the Algarvic nations of Algarve, Sibiu, and Lagoas, but to confuse things somewhat, each uses names drawn from a different Romance language. In addition, {{the vast majority of the}} individuals belonging to each language group share the same hair and eye color; Algarvic peoples have red hair and green eyes, Kaunian peoples have <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> blue eyes, and the Unkerlantic peoples and most others have dark hair and eyes.|$|E
25|$|Featherstone {{was born}} on West 43rd St., one of nine children. His mother helped with the Veterans of Foreign Wars and {{his father was a}} customs officer. He had <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> was often said to be baby-faced. He served in the Vietnam War as member of the Green Berets aged just 17 after lying about his age. He served as a stock clerk. To his disappointment, he did not see combat, {{although}} he was circumcised by his friends in a drunken prank. He received a medical discharge in 1967 after just a year, claiming to have hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 17th {{century to the}} middle 18th century, European colonists {{reported}} encounters with gray-eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists (although at least one, {{a story of a}} Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language, {{is likely to be a}} hoax). Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras with <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> blue eyes not long after their arrival. As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement, and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora, the likelihood that the origin of those fair-skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high.|$|E

25|$|Gabriel has <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> multicoloured wings. His {{right hand}} is raised {{and in his}} left he holds lilies, {{traditionally}} found in paintings of the annunciation as symbols of Mary's virginity. His words to Mary are written alongside him in Latin: AVE GRACIA PLENA D(OMI)N(U)S TECU(M) ("Hail who art full of grace, the Lord is with you"). The horizontal inscription extends out the panel and halfway across the neighbouring image. As in van Eyck's Washington Annunciation of c. 1434–6, the letters of Mary's reply are inscribed in reverse and upside-down; as if for God to read from heaven, or for the holy spirit, as represented by the dove, to read as he hovers directly above her. She answers ECCE ANCILLAM D(OMI)NI ("Behold the handmaiden of the Lord").|$|E
25|$|Schneerson was {{described}} as a slim boy with <b>blond</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> was gifted with extraordinary intelligence and empathy. During his youth, he received a private education and was tutored by Zalman Vilenkin from 1909 through 1913. When Schneerson was eleven years old, Vilenkin informed his father that he had nothing more to teach his son. At that point, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak began teaching his son Talmud and rabbinic literature, as well as Kabbalah. Schneerson proved gifted in both Talmudic and Kabalistic study and also took exams as an external student of the local Soviet school. He was considered an Illui and genius, {{and by the time he}} was seventeen, he had mastered the entire Talmud, some 5,894 pages, as well as all its early commentaries.|$|E
25|$|His last {{hiding place}} {{was in an}} {{apartment}} with his university friend Lion Nordheim, his wife Jeanne, and her sister Trusha van Amerongen. In {{the course of his}} hiding he kept in touch with the scientific community through visits at his hiding place by Hendrik Anthony Kramers and Lambertus Broer. Jeanne and Trusha had <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> blue eyes and ventured out in public as non-Jews, while Lion and Pais hid in the apartment. In March 1945, however, they were betrayed and all four were arrested. The same week the Americans had crossed the Rhine and cut the rail lines, making impossible their transfer to a concentration camp. The women were soon released. After a month of interrogation by the Gestapo, Pais was released several days {{before the end of the}} war. Nordheim was executed ten days before the end of the war.|$|E
50|$|Parian dolls {{usually have}} molded <b>blond</b> <b>hair.</b> Brown <b>and</b> black haired parians are less common.

The hair was arranged in interesting and elaborate ways. The eyes were painted or glass. The glass-eyed dolls are sought after by collectors.|$|R

500|$|After joining Jim Crockett Promotions in {{the early}} 1960s, Rip Hawk met Swede Hanson, who was {{competing}} as a singles wrestler.

Both had <b>blond</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> were powerful wrestlers, so they called themselves the Blond Bombers. [...] They were managed by Gary Hart and later by Homer O'Dell. Hawk spoke for the team during interviews while Hanson stood silently beside him.|$|E
