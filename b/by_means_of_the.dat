5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained <b>by</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attitude control system. Towards {{the end of the}} coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sodium-potassium pump, living {{human cells}} pump three sodium ions {{out of the}} cell in {{exchange}} for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, potassium measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In nerve cells, the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse—an action potential—when the charge is dissipated; sodium {{plays a key role}} in that activity.|$|E
