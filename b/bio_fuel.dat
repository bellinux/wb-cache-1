CCS has lately been discussed for plants using <b>bio</b> <b>fuels</b> since it is one of few possibilities to actively decrease the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The most common process for carbon capture, absorption in MEA, was assumed. Transportation of the captured carbon dioxide to Norway for injection in natural gas fields was the considered storage option. The impacts from transportation of the captured carbon dioxide indicate that alternatives should be investigated, e. g. possibilities for local storage or other types of utilization of the captured carbon. The comparatively high energy use for the MEA capturing process indicates that CCS for <b>bio</b> <b>fueled</b> plants must be carefully considered. Alternative technologies for carbon capture should be further investigated - e. g. if biological methods might give better performance over chemical absorption – as should the consequences of alternative handling of the captured carbon dioxide...|$|R

30|$|It is {{probable}} that these incentives {{are part of the}} explanation for the rapid increase in green car sales in Sweden. This increase has also increased demand for <b>bio</b> <b>fuels.</b> Sweden is dependent on imports of these <b>bio</b> <b>fuels</b> because it is not cost-effective to produce the amount required to meet demand in Sweden. About 80  % of ethanol supply in Sweden is imported, mostly from Brazil [9]. Hence, ethanol prices in Sweden are affected by import tolls on ethanol. On April 3, 2009, the EU agreed to Sweden’s application for lower tolls on ethanol imports from Brazil. Ethanol is produced in Europe but at a higher cost than the imported ethanol from Brazil. A low ethanol price is probably critical to keeping consumers from using fossil fuel alternatives.|$|R

40|$|Biofuels are {{essential}} {{for the future of}} aviation. The airline industry is a worldwide operating business to transport passengers and freight in an economical and fast manner. Jet engines consume kerosene to power the aircraft. However, kerosene is a distillate of crude oil and airlines are entirely dependent on this energy source. As a result, airlines are facing two problems. Firstly, the energy security is at stake when the conventional oil resources are depleted. Secondly, green house gases are produced by burning fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is one of them and it is regarded by scientists as contributor to climate change (IPCC fourth assessment report group I, 2007). Biofuels solve these two issues, as they are renewable and they emit less carbon dioxide. Several airlines have already conducted test flights with biofuels, such as Virgin Atlantic, Air New Zeeland, Japan Air Lines and KLM. Feedstocks for these biofuels were camelina, jatropha and micro algae. Macro algae are also a feedstock for biofuels. This report is dedicated to the feasibility of <b>bio</b> jet <b>fuel</b> from macro algae from an end-to-end chain perspective. The main research fields were on the technical side, sustainability side and economical side of the <b>bio</b> jet <b>fuel.</b> Technically, it is possible to produce <b>bio</b> jet <b>fuel</b> from macro algae. Several macro algae cultivation methods and conversion methods exists to produce <b>bio</b> jet <b>fuel.</b> It is also better for the environment. The carbon dioxide emissions are reduced at least with 75 % compare to fossil fuels. Besides this, the energy balance is also positive. More energy is produced in the form of biofuel than the energy is needed to produce it. An issue so far is the economical side of <b>bio</b> jet <b>fuel.</b> <b>Bio</b> jet <b>fuel</b> is substantially more expensive than fossil fuels. The price will decline when the production of macro algae increase. The transition from fossil fuels to biofuels will take decades and large investments {{are essential}}.

There has however been concern that the partnerships with big private sector players may distract from the role other large Corporations sometimes have in aggravating hunger, by manipulating global markets to their advantage, and in some cases by purchasing large areas of land in African countries and then driving small holders from their farms. George Monbiot says the summit may distract from the West's role in worsening hunger by setting targets that cause arable lands to be used to produce <b>bio</b> <b>fuel</b> instead of food.

50|$|Biodiesel is {{now being}} {{produced}} locally in India for use in stationary engines and large or slow engines like those in trains, trucks and tractors. Efforts are also on to use ethanol {{as a substitute for}} petrol. Biodiesel is rapidly replacing both kerosene (which was used illegally and inefficiently) and diesel as a more efficient, cheap, and clean alternative for large engines. Today plans are being chalked out to cultivate non-edible seed oil trees such as Pongamia on barren land to use their oil for biodiesel production. The Southern Railways have been very supportive of the program and various state governments recommend planting these plants in unused areas through aid from the government sectors. Biodiesel-blends are being used to run state transport corporation buses in Karnataka. The University of Agriculture Sciences at Bangalore has identified many elite lines of Jatropha curcas and Millettia pinnata (Pongamia tree). Castor is already a well established crop in India with several very high yielding varieties in the market. Large-scale activities have been initiated quite recently. For example, the government of Karnataka has distributed several million saplings of Pongamia to farmers for planting along borders of farmland and in waste lands.

Our results show that the incorporation target of 7 % of bio fuels in transport fuels would lead to a considerable increase in the rapeseed area. In the main producing regions, the rapeseed area would reach approximately a third of the total farmed area. It would not be possible to reach a 10 % incorporation target without imports. Furthermore, we analyse the impacts of reaching these production levels on the rapeseed opportunity costs, and show that reaching the incorporation targets will need an increase in rapeseed prices paid to farmers. We calculate the impacts of this opportunity cost increase on the competitiveness of bio fuels with respect to fossil oil, for different levels of oil prices.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The world {{consumption}} of fuels is undoubtedly unstable causing world economic crisis, the worst {{compared to other}} economic recession that took place at different era. By using biodiesel, the problem could be tackled. <b>Bio</b> <b>fuels,</b> fuels derived from biomass have been gaining the attention as of highly renewable, biodegradable and locally available. Biodiesel, obtained from vegetable oil or animal fats and Bio crude, synthetic oil. <b>Bio</b> <b>fuels</b> are carbon-neutral, nontoxic and reduce emission of volatile organic compounds.
