In railways, mechanical brakes, the wheel–rail contact, current collectors, ballast, sleepers, and masonry structures yield particulate matter. Field tests examined a Swedish track using a train instrumented with particle measurement devices, brake pad temperature sensors, and speed and brake sensors. The main {{objective of this}} field test was to study the characteristics of particles generated from disc brakes on a running train with an on-board measuring set-up. Two airborne particle sampling points were designated, one near a pad–rotor disc <b>brake</b> <b>contact</b> and a second under the frame, not near a mechanical brake or the wheel–rail contact; the numbers and size distributions of the particles detected were registered and evaluated under various conditions (e. g. activating/deactivating electrical brakes or negotiating curves). During braking, three speed/temperature-dependent particle peaks were identified in the fine region, representing particles 280 nm, 350 nm, and 600 nm in diameter. In the coarse region, a peak was discerned for particles 3 – 6 μm in diameter. Effects of brake pad temperature on particle size distribution were also investigated. Results indicate that the 280 nm peak increased with increasing temperature, and that electrical braking significantly reduced airborne particle numbers. FESEM images captured particles sizing down to 50 nm. The ICP-MS results indicated that Fe, Cu, Zn, Al, Ca, and Mg were the main elements constituting the particles.   QC 20120226.

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a drum <b>brake's</b> {{friction}} <b>contact</b> area is at the circumference of the brake, a drum brake can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake. The increased friction contact area of drum brake shoes on the drum allows drum brake shoes to last longer than disc brake pads used in a brake system of similar dimensions and braking force. Drum brakes retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation of rear brakes, a drum brake's self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW of braking power).|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the determinants of}} the severity of the head kinematics of a pedestrian when struck by common sport utility vehicles (SUV) and work utility vehicles (WUVs) to assess how effective assessment protocols are in assessing injury risk for SUVs and work utilities. Methods: Three hundred twenty-four simulations of pedestrian collisions with SUVs, work utility vehicles, and sedans were performed using several vehicle geometries, pedestrian orientations, speeds, and <b>braking</b> levels. <b>Contact</b> stiffnesses in the models were based on impact test results with exemplar vehicle structures. A single contact characteristic was used for all head-to-hood contacts to allow the effects of other factors on head injury risk to be compared. Simulations of standard headform tests on the same hood characterized the structure from a subsystem test perspective. Results: Head injury criterion values were higher in SUV/WUV simulations than sedan simulations because of high neck tension rather than through higher contact forces with the hood. In fact, the severity of the impact between the head and hood was slightly less in SUV/WUV simulations. Sedan and SUV/WUV simulations produced lower head injury criterion (HIC) values than did the subsystem tests. Conclusions: High bonnet leading edges led to increased neck loads in these simulations of pedestrian collisions. Neck loads were influential on head injury risk in the SUV/work utility simulations but not in sedan simulations. Subsystem impact tests may overestimate head impact risk from the hood itself but fail to capture a potentially important injury mechanism in collisions with vehicles with high leading edges and thus fail to differentiate completely risks posed by such vehicles. These results may have implications for the interpretation of pedestrian subsystem test results: a given HIC value in an SUV/WUV test may represent a relatively higher risk of injury than the same results recorded in a sedan test.

40|$|In recent {{experimental}} work {{it has been}} observed that position of the centre of pressure (CoP) at the <b>brake</b> pad/disc <b>contact</b> area has influence on the onset of brake squeal. Also, preliminary studies have shown that variation of the brake disc top-hat geometry has some impact on the number or shift of unstable modes of vibration. In this paper, a reduced isothermal Abaqus finite element model of a four-piston opposed brake assembly is used to show how structural modifications of disc geometry influence the CoP position and whether some correlation between unstable modes of vibration and CoP position can be found. A number of disc model variants have been developed reflecting changes of a disc top-hat height parameter. For all model variants, the first step of the simulation includes determination of the pressure distribution at the pad/disc interface and evaluation of the CoP position, while in the following step, a complex eigenvalue analysis is performed to investigate possible unstable modes of vibration. To facilitate post-processing, the simulation results including the pressure distribution map at the brake pad/disc interface, CoP position and complex eigenvalues are imported to a new Matlab program CalBrakes. This technique of linking Matlab to Abaqus is explained in this paper to give suggestions how to effectively speed up the evaluation process for running a large number of finite element models. An initial analysis of pressure distribution has shown that a certain shift of the CoP position for different variants of the disc top-hat structure exists. It is interesting that the higher the top-hat height parameter, the more significant the difference between the inboard and outboard CoP position is established. A subsequent complex eigenvalue analysis has shown {{that there is not a}} noticeable change of number and frequency instability values for discs with different top-hat height parameters. Ongoing work is aimed at identifying other geometric features of the disc that may impact on both CoP and squeal propensity...|$|R

Pure material is considered for the <b>brake</b> pad. Coulomb <b>contact</b> friction is assumed as the heat source. It is divided into two equal parts between pad and brake disk which leads to thermal stresses. Mechanical response of FG disks are compared and verified with the known results from the literatures. The results show that the maximum value of radial displacement in mounted FG brake disk is not at outer surface. It is found that the all areas between pad and brake disk is in full-contact status when the ratio of pad thickness to brake disk thickness is 0. 66. It is observed that the total strain due to thermomechanical load is negative for some parts of the disks, whereas, the thermal strains are always positive.

40|$|Abstract:- Brake squeal is {{an example}} of noise caused by {{vibrations}} induced by <b>contact</b> forces. During <b>brake</b> operation, the <b>contact</b> between the pad and the disc can induce a dynamic instability in the system. The brake squeal which occurs in the frequency range of 1 - 20 kHz is investigated with the plate on disc as a new model that’s presented in this paper to study the instability of the system. The squeal events treated in this paper were identified to be dynamic instabilities of the brake system. The ANSYS product finite element software in 3 -D with Matrix 27 as a contact element was used to simulate the behavior of the plate-disc system. Coulomb’s friction was used at the contact surface with a constant coefficient value. The contact stiffness and the friction coefficient were changed during the simulation in order to analyze the occurrence of the squeal. For this application, temporal simulations showed that separation occurred between surfaces, confirmation of instabilities. It also showed that, the vibrations responsible for the instability were localized in the contact properties. The mode responsible for squealing was obtained by using the modal analysis of the plate–disc system and assuming that the interface was stuck. The result has shown that the maximum degree of instability appeared as a result of changing the contact stiffness effect rather than changing the friction coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Our {{interest}} {{was drawn to}} the I–II loop of CaV 3 channels for two reasons: (1) transfer of the I–II loop from a high voltage-activated channel (CaV 2. 2) to a low voltage-activated channel (CaV 3. 1) unexpectedly produced an ultra-low voltage activated channel; and (2) sequence variants of the I–II loop found in childhood absence epilepsy patients altered channel gating and increased surface expression of CaV 3. 2 channels. To determine the roles of this loop we have studied the structure of the loop and the biophysical consequences of altering its structure. Deletions localized the gating brake to the first 62 amino acids after IS 6 in all three CaV 3 channels, establishing the evolutionary conservation of this region and its function. Circular dichroism was performed on a purified fragment of the I–II loop from CaV 3. 2 to reveal a high α-helical content. De novo computer modeling predicted the gating brake formed a helix-loop-helix structure. This model was tested by replacing the helical regions with poly-proline-glycine (PGPGPG), which introduces kinks and flexibility. These mutations had profound effects on channel gating, shifting both steady-state activation and inactivation curves, as well as accelerating channel kinetics. Mutations designed to preserve the helical structure (poly-alanine, which forms α-helices) had more modest effects. Taken together, we conclude the second helix of the gating <b>brake</b> establishes important <b>contacts</b> with the gating machinery, thereby stabilizing a closed state of T-channels, and that this interaction is disrupted by depolarization, allowing the S 6 segments to spread open and Ca 2 + ions to flow through...|$|R

The research contribution accounted for in this thesisincludes, in addition to a literature review, refinement ofmethods applied to uniform wheel wear simulation by inclusionof braking and improvement of the contact model.

In particular theinfluence of disc braking and varying friction and lubricationconditions are investigated. Both environmental factors likemoist and contamination and deliberate lubrication need to beconsidered. As part of the associated contact analysis theinfluence of tangential elastic deformation of the contactingsurfaces on the sliding velocity has been separatelyinvestigated and found to be essential in case of partial slipcontact conditions. In the second part validation of the improvements related towheel wear simulation is addressed. Disc braking has beenincluded in the simulation set and a wear map for moist contactconditions based on recent tribometer tests has been draftedand tested. It has been shown that the previously used brakingfactor accounts for the combination of the contributions fromsurface elasticity and braking. Good agreement withmeasurements from the Stockholm commuter service is achieved.

40|$|Railway {{wheelset}} components {{exposed to}} <b>braking</b> loads and <b>contact</b> {{forces have been}} studied. The work has been performed in close cooperation with the Swedish wheelset manufacturer ABB SURA Traction AB, and it has resulted in one brake disc prototype and two different wheel prototypes. Theoretical and numerical investigations have been performed using analytical models and commercial FE-programs. The results are verified through full-scale laboratory and field experiments. An inertia dynamometer for testing of brake components (wheels, discs, pads) has been designed and constructed within the present project. A linear analytical model for calculating transient axisymmetric temperature distributions in finite hollow cylinders has been established. The model {{is used to calculate}} temperature histories during and after braking in a nonventilated solid steel disc and in a ventilated disc made of cast iron. The theoretical results agree reasonably well with the experimental results from dynamometer testing. The conclusion is that, under Swedish driving conditions, a forged solid steel disc may be a possible substitute for the more complicated and expensive ventilated disc. A railway wheel using flexible S-shaped steel spokes between hub and rim is suggested. The vertical dynamic behaviour of a two-axle freight car with such wheels is analyzed and compared to that of a freight car with standard solid wheels. Full-scale field experiments have been performed using wheels without and with wheelflats instrumented for measurement of transient vertical wheel/rail contact forces. Accelerations and strains in the track structure were measured in parallel. The location of the travelling instrumented wheelset in relation to the instrumented portion of the track was determined at each instant of time. Different train speeds and axle loads were tested. The flexible wheel was found to considerably reduce the impact loads {{in the presence of a}} wheelflat. In contrast to a standard solid wheel, no thermally induced residual stresses from block braking will occur in the rim of the flexible wheel. The wheel was also found to radiate less noise than a solid wheel. Calculated temperatures and deformations are verified through experiments on the inertia dynamometer. The performance of a so-called low stress wheel with hub-rim offset is investigated. By use of a two-level fractional factorial design, the influences of six selected geometrical variables (describing disc thickness, rim thickness, and hub-rim offset) are quantified. It is found that a low stress wheel offers high resistance to thermal and mechanical loads. Based on the present study, a first set of twelve forged rim-quenched low stress wheels has been produced.

40|$|Thermo-mechanical {{wheel tread}} damages {{are common in}} railway wheels. While the damage {{magnitude}} is limited this is a rather benign phenomenon. However under harsher operational conditions (winter conditions, poorly tuned damping/suspension, poorly matched wheel–rail contact profiles etc) {{the extent of the}} problem may increase dramatically and lead to epidemics of wheel damages. Since this calls for wheel re-profiling, the result may be extensive operational disturbances. The presentation deals with thermo-mechanical damage. In practice one of the failure modes, thermal cracking or rolling contact fatigue, usually dominates. However, it is most likely that the combined thermal and rolling contact loading will have an influence in increasing the resulting damage as compared to both phenomena acting separately. In the literature there are a multitude of studies on both thermal and rolling contact loading. analyses of the combined load case are however scarce. One major {{reason for this is that}} a combined loading makes a simplification to 2 D very cumbersome (not to say futile). Here, a numerical study of the impact of simultaneous thermal and mechanical loading on a railway wheel tread as imposed by <b>braking</b> and rolling <b>contact</b> is presented. 3 D finite element (FE) simulations of the thermo-mechanical problem featuring a material model which accounts for thermal expansion and plastic deformations are carried out. Both pure rolling and tractive rolling are considered. The results indicate a significant influence of the thermal loading on the resulting stress/strain response also in cases of relatively moderate temperature increases. In particular, a combination of thermal loading and high traction rolling is found to be very detrimental. The resulting damage of the wheel tread is manifested by the formation of small surface cracks. In cases of high thermal loading, these cracks will evolve to deep radial cracks that can, in a worst-case scenario, cause catastrophic wheel failures. Since this is a potential safety problem it is important to understand the driving mechanisms behind these cracks. To this end, a numerical study of thermal cracking of a wheel subjected to high thermal loading was carried out. The analysis features a computationally efficient approach where 2 D FE stress analysis owing to thermal loading during braking and subsequent cooling is combined with an analytical evaluation of resulting stress intensity factors of a radially oriented surface crack in the wheel tread. The analysis identifies critical sizes for when existing surface cracks are prone to propagate under thermal loading and resulting crack lengths after propagation. The results imply that fully functional brake systems are not likely to induce thermal crack propagation under normal stop braking, but that with pre-existing defects a severe drag braking due to malfunctioning brakes may cause very deep cracking. Further the analysis concludes the thermal cracking to be a (more or less) static phenomenon related to the most severe brake cycle. In other words: later brake cycles of similar or lower severity will not cause any significant propagation of existing cracks. To further validate the analysis of the semi-analytical analysis, preliminary 3 D FE-simulations have been performed...|$|R
