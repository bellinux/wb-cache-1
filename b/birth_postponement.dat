To examine its social desirability, we study how utilitarian criteria rank histories equal on all dimensions except {{the age at which}} individuals give birth to their children. We develop a T-period dynamic overlapping generations economy with a fixed living space, where individual welfare is increasing in the available space per head, and where agents have children in one out of two fertility periods. When comparing finite histories with an equal total number of life-periods, classical, average and critical-level utilitarian criteria select the same fertility timing, i. e. the one leading to the most smoothed population path. When comparing infinite histories with stationary population sizes, utilitarian criteria may select different birth timings, depending on individual utility functions. Those results are compared with the ones obtained when agents value coexistence time with their descendants.

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on fertility transition presumes that birth control is practiced either to limit family size or to space births. This article argues that women also use birth control to postpone pregnancy. Postponement is not synonymous with spacing. It arises when women delay their next birth for indefinite periods for reasons unrelated to the age of their youngest child, but without deciding not to have any more children. Postponement has a distinctive impact on the shape of birth-interval distributions that differs from the impacts of family size limitation, birth spacing, or a mixture of the two behaviors.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the light}} of the recent {{reversal}} of fertility trends in several highly developed countries, we investigate the impact of economic development and its components on fertility in OECD countries from 1960 to 2007. We find that the strong negative correlation between GDP per capita and fertility does no longer hold for high levels of per capita economic output; the relation instead seems to turn into positive from a certain threshold level of economic development on. Survival of an inverse J-shaped association between GDP per capita and fertility is found when controlling for <b>birth</b> <b>postponement,</b> omitted variable bias, non-stationarity and endogeneity. However, gaps between actual and predicted fertility rates show implicitly the importance of factors influencing fertility above and over per capita income. By decomposing GDP per capita into several components, we identify female employment as co-varying factor for the fertility rebound that can be observed in several highly developed countries. Pointing out to important differences with regard to the compatibility between childbearing and female employment, our results suggest that fertility increases are likely to be small if economic development is not accompanied by institutional changes that improve parents' opportunities to combine work and family life...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis aims at {{contributing to the}} literature on transition economies focusing on the Russian Federations and in particular on regional income convergence and fertility patterns. The first two chapter {{deal with the issue}} of income convergence across regions. Chapter 1 provides an historical-institutional analysis of the period between the late years of the Soviet Union and the last decade of economic growth and a presentation of the sample with a description of gross regional product composition, agrarian or industrial vocation, labor. Chapter 2 contributes to the literature on exploratory spatial data analysis with a application to a panel of 77 regions in the period 1994 - 2008. It provides an analysis of spatial patterns and it extends the theoretical framework of growth regressions controlling for spatial correlation and heterogeneity. Chapter 3 analyses the national demographic patterns since 1960 and provides a review of the policies on maternity leave and family benefits. Data sources are the Statistical Yearbooks of USSR, the Statistical Yearbooks of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Demographic Yearbooks of Russia. Chapter 4 analyses the demographic patterns in light of the theoretical framework of the Becker model, the Second Demographic Transition and an economic-crisis argument. With national data from 1960, the theoretically issue of the pro or countercyclical relation between income and fertility is graphically analyzed and discussed, together with female employment and education. With regional data after 1994 different panel data models are tested. Individual level data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey are employed using the logit model.

40|$|The ageing {{process of}} the {{population}} in developed countries including the Member States of the European Union (EU) is becoming very important at present; the ageing is of vital concern of each of us. The European year of 2012 “European year for Active ageing and Solidarity between generations ” indicates the importance of ageing process in Europe. The ageing can be explained by increased longevity that has been evident for several decades as life expectancy has risen and this development {{is often referred to as}} ageing at the top of the population pyramid. On the other hand the ageing is related also to the ageing at the bottom, because the levels of the total fertility rates (TFR) has declined and are very low in all of the EU Member States. The TFR in developed countries is far below its replacement level of 2. 1. Ageing from the bottom is typical for all of the EU Member States, because the TFR in some of the Member States fell below the threshold of the lowest-low fertility rate of 1. 3 live <b>births</b> per woman. <b>Postponement</b> of childbearing to later ages of mothers demonstrated a gradual change in the curve of age-specific fertility rates, which gradually changes its positive asymmetry in relation to the age of the mothers and at the same time the modal age of the childbearing increased.

The mean age of women at childbirth has increased rapidly, especially the mean age of women at first and second birth orders, which has an impact on declining number of children born to one woman during her reproductive period.

40|$|In 1989, {{the socialist}} regime in Romania {{collapsed}} and the state’s coercive pro-natalist policy ended. Since then, fertility {{has gone through}} major changes, namely, a massive reduction in fertility and important structural changes: <b>birth</b> <b>postponement,</b> an end to universal childbearing, {{and the emergence of}} non-marital births. Family formation has been postponed, but a pattern of early marriage still persists compared to other European countries. Although unmarried cohabitation is rising, it is rarely seen as an alternative to marriage. Modern contraceptive methods are being used increasingly, but traditional contraceptive methods continue to be widespread. Abortion, which was re-legalized in 1989 and made available after two decades of prohibition, has been practiced extensively ever since, especially after first birth. Romanians in 2004 continue to have a universal preference for parenting. However, the preference for the two-child family has declined and the desire for a larger family has become the exception. The transformation of the socialist regime into a democratic society with a market economy generated a socio-economic crisis, and the majority of social benefits have therefore been oriented towards alleviating poverty. Other social policies, including those affecting the family, were redefined. However, fewer funds were made available than for those geared to promote economic development or reduce poverty and, as a consequence, their impact on childbearing has been small. childbearing, Europe, fertility, Romania...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} far changes in {{fertility}} trends {{are related to}} ongoing economic development in OECD countries. In {{the light of the}} inverse J-shaped relationship between the human development index (HDI) and total fertility rates that was recently found by Myrskylä, Kohler and Billari (2009), we single out the impact of economic development on fertility. We empirically test the hypothesis of a convex impact of GDP per capita on fertility, using data from the OECD area that spans the years 1960 to 2007. We test the robustness of our findings by controlling for <b>birth</b> <b>postponement</b> and for different income distribution patterns. By designating a clear turning point in the relationship between economic development and fertility, we find that economic development is likely to induce a fertility rebound, but is not sufficient to lift fertility to a significantly higher level in all OECD countries. Country-specific factors explain why countries with similar GDP per capita levels achieve significantly lower or higher fertility rates than the estimated baseline, however. By decomposing GDP per capita into several variables, we identify female employment as the main factor impacting fertility, behind GDP variations. The positive association between the increase in female employment and fertility rates suggests a key role played by the changes in norms and institutions supporting the combination of work and family that go along with the process of economic development. demographic economics; fertility; economic development; female employment; economics of gender...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Never before {{have parents}} in most Western {{societies}} {{had their first}} children as late as in recent decades. What are the central reasons for postponement? What {{is known about the}} link between the delay of childbearing and social policy incentives to counter these trends? This review engages in a systematic analysis of existing evidence to extract the maximum amount of knowledge about the reasons for <b>birth</b> <b>postponement</b> and the effectiveness of social policy incentives. METHODS: The review followed the PRISMA procedure, with literature searches conducted in relevant demographic, social science and medical science databases (SocINDEX, Econlit, PopLine, Medline) and located via other sources. The search focused on subjects related to childbearing behaviour, postponement and family policies. National, international and individual-level data sources were also used to present summary statistics. RESULTS: There is clear empirical evidence of the postponement of the first child. Central reasons are the rise of effective contraception, increases in women's education and labour market participation, value changes, gender equity, partnership changes, housing conditions, economic uncertainty and the absence of supportive family policies. Evidence shows that some social policies can be effective in countering postponement. CONCLUSIONS: The postponement of first births has implications on the ability of women to conceive and parents to produce additional offspring. Massive postponement is attributed to the clash between the optimal biological period for women to have children with obtaining additional education and building a career. A growing body of literature shows that female employment and childrearing can be combined when the reduction in work-family conflict is facilitated by policy intervention...|$|E
40|$|Background : Researchers have {{examined}} how first-birth timing {{is related to}} motherhood wage penalties, but research that examines birth spacing is lacking. Furthermore, little research has examined the persistence of penalties across the life course. Objective : The objective is to estimate the effects of birth spacing on midlife labor market outcomes and assess {{the extent to which}} these effects vary by education and age at first birth. Methods : I use data from the United States from the 1979 - 2010 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and dynamic inverse probability of treatment weighting to estimate the effects of different birth intervals on mothers' midlife cumulative work hours, cumulative earnings, and hourly wages.
