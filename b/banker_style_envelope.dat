40|$|Simulations of loan {{applications}} {{were evaluated}} by senior bank executives {{in terms of their}} prospects for approval and risk to determine the influence of organizational culture and payback uncertainty on loan decisions. The influence of the participating <b>banker's</b> decision <b>style,</b> based on the Jungian typology, was also determined. Eight simulated loans were constructed that had four types of cultures and high or low uncertainty in pay back prospects. Evaluations of the ratings of these loans found that culture was a more important determinant of loan approval and risk assessment than either uncertainty or the <b>banker's</b> personal decision <b>style.</b> <b>Bankers</b> in an analytic culture were inclined to approve loans. In a consultative or speculative culture bankers were more apprehensive but would make these same loans. In a charismatic culture bankers were unsure about the advisability of making the same loans. The implications of these findings for improved practice in bank loan decision making are discussed. behavioral decision making uncertainty culture decision style...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{investigate}} how current state-of-the-art structural optimisation algorithms, {{with an emphasis}} on topology optimisation, can be used to rapidly develop lightweight body in white (BIW) concept designs, based on a computer aided design envelope. The optimisation models included in the paper will primarily focus on crashworthiness and roof crush scenarios as specified in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) 216 standard. This paper is a continuation of a previously published paper, which investigated the potential effects of recently proposed changes to FMVSS 216 upon BIW mass and architecture using topology optimisation. The paper will investigate the possibilities of including buckling considerations of roof members directly into current state-of-the-art topology optimisation algorithms. This paper will also demonstrate the potential for developing a detailed BIW design including cross-sectional properties based on a <b>styling</b> <b>envelope.</b> © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

50|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the pages}} is in the Gothic style, containing symbol-like floral ornamentation that does not directly reference flowers or plants found in nature. The figures are depicted in a more realistic manner than figures found in earlier historical periods, but also reference a more Byzantine <b>style</b> that <b>envelopes</b> the figures by utilizing a background usually created with gold leaf. The artists also inserted the Visconti family crest in multiple pages. The crest consists of a serpent devouring a child.|$|R

The correct <b>style</b> on an <b>envelope</b> for a baronet who has no other titles is [...] "Sir >, Bt." [...] or [...] "Sir >, Bart." [...] The letter would commence: [...] "Dear Sir [...] ".|$|R
5000|$|Ponton or pontoon styling {{refers to}} a 1930s-1960s design genre—ultimately the {{precursor}} of modern automotive styling. The trend emerged as bodywork began to enclose the full width and uninterrupted length of a car, incorporating previously distinct running boards and fully articulated fenders. The fenders of an automobile with ponton styling may also be called Pontoon fenders, and the overall trend may also be known as <b>envelope</b> <b>styling.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Simon Spurr {{was born}} and raised in Kent, England, the son of two <b>bankers.</b> His father's <b>style</b> shaped his design {{perspectives}} at an early age as Spurr discussed in a 2011 interview: [...] "I still look up to him... he's also very influential in my aesthetics. My dad had a lot of suits working in a bank, late '60s, early '70s. They still had the slim lapel, the narrow shoulder. And I guess it was subconsciously ingrained in me. That's the decade I always go back to." ...|$|R
5000|$|The fenders, or wings, of the 2/10 PS were {{integrated}} into the bodywork of the car, allowing the passenger space to be wider {{than it would have}} been with the traditional separate fenders and running board. [...] The compact drivetrain allowed the floor to be lower, making it possible to enter the car from the ground without a running board. The rounded appearance of the 2/10 PS, due to the <b>envelope</b> <b>styling,</b> earned it the nickname Kommissbrot after the inexpensive, flat-sided bread used by the military.|$|R

Envisioned as a {{personal}} luxury car, it had <b>envelope</b> <b>styling</b> with aluminium body panels, spats over the rear wheels, electro-hydraulically operated seats, windows, and top, onboard hydraulic jacks, electrically-operated hidden headlights, and a power radio aerial. The TR-X used the Standard Vanguard's frame and engine, the Triumph Renown's suspension, Laycock de Normanville electrically operated overdrive, and a 94 inch wheelbase. The top speed was estimated as 90 mph ...|$|R
50|$|For 1983, the Executive {{used the}} {{standard}} LeBaron grille (as {{shown on the}} 1982 prototype models as well), while 1984 and 1985 utilized a slightly more vertical waterfall grill (borrowed from the New Yorker) that featured a heavier cap and narrow chrome extensions running beneath the headlights. 1984 and 1985 models also received wrap-around tail lamps (from standard LeBaron models), versus the <b>envelope</b> <b>styling</b> on the 1983. For Executive's final year, the 1986 models used the re-designed LeBaron tail end, featuring new tail lamps and deck lid. Up front, Executive still utilized the New Yorker grille but the front fender-mounted cornering lamps were discontinued.|$|R

It {{was one of}} the first cars with <b>envelope</b> <b>styling.</b> It was affectionately referred to as the [...] "Kommissbrot" [...] or [...] "Loaf of Rye Bread" [...] due to its small squarish shape. The 2/10 PS (two taxable / ten brake horsepower) had a single-cylinder half litre engine at the rear. The rear axle was chain-driven, with no differential. With a fuel consumption of [...] it was the world's most fuel efficient mass-production car between the two World Wars due to the low-friction one-cylinder engine and its very light weight.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} the heat transfer {{performance of a}} new <b>style</b> of building <b>envelopes</b> integrated with close-contact parallel solar vacuum tubes (which is called integrated solar envelope later in this paper). The heat transfer performance of the integrated solar envelope was researched by numerical simulation and experimental testing. The heat losses were tested and simulated when {{the two sides of}} the integrated solar envelope were imposed different temperature at various conditions. The average heat transfer coefficient of the integrated solar envelope is 2. 4 W/(m 2 ·K) with the insulation materials filled in the gaps behind. The simulation results agree with the experimental testing results well. The result shows the integrated solar envelope has good thermal insulation performance, it can be used to reduce building heat loss while it is used to collect solar energy...|$|R

50|$|The Church of The Epiphany was {{designed}} by noted Philadelphia architect Thomas Ustick Walter in the Greek Revival <b>style.</b> While the <b>envelope</b> of the building was rather plain and lacking detail, the portico, elevated above street level, featured a Doric colonnade with associated triglyph/metope details and flat pediment. Perhaps the explanation for this curious entrance was that the original plans called for a tall wooden steeple. The interior, similar to many Protestant churches at the time, was plainly decorated, with white painted walls and clear glass. A deep gallery ran across the south end, with two small recessed galleries on {{the east and west}} sides. The chancel was square, with four Corinthian columns separating it from the nave. Half of it was occupied by the organ gallery, which was supported on pillars, the chancel running in under it and entered by a door at the rear, which communicated by a flight of stairs with the vestryroom in the basement. The chancel rail was continued around four sides of the chancel. The pulpit occupied the center, with reading desks on both sides, forming one continuous structure. A small oaken communion table, covered with crimson velvet, was placed in front of the pulpit. This table remained in use until the enlargement of the church in 1853. The ceiling was also minimally decorated and featured a large ventilator at its center. A large central oil chandelier lighted the church and smaller ones also hanging from the ceiling until 1841, when gas was introduced.|$|R
40|$|Skew {{estimation}} {{and page}} segmentation {{are the two}} closely related processing stages for document image analysis. Skew estimation needs proper page segmentation, especially for document images with multiple skews that are common in scanned images from thick bound publications in 2 -up <b>style</b> or postal <b>envelopes</b> with various printed labels. Even if only a single skew is concerned for a document image, the presence of minority regions of different skews or undefined skew such as noise may severely affect the estimation for the dominant skew. Page segmentation, on the other hand, may {{need to know the}} exact skew angle of a page in order to work properly. This paper presents a skew estimation method with built-in skew-independent segmentation functionality that is capable of handling document images with multiple regions of different skews. It is based on the convex hulls of the individual components (i. e. the smallest convex polygon that fully contains a component) and that of the component groups (i. e. the smallest convex polygon that fully contain all the components in a group) in a document image. The proposed method first extracts the convex hulls of the components, segments an image into groups of components according to both the spatial distances and size similarities among the convex hulls of the components. This process not only extracts the hints of the alignments of the text groups, but also separate noise or graphical components from that of the textual ones. To verify the proposed algorithms, the full sets of the real and the synthetic samples of the University of Washington English Document Image Database I (UW-I) are used. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with some existing methods are also provided...|$|R
