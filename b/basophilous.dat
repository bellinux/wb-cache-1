40|$|It is here {{presented}} {{the results of a}} study of the phytosociological and plant landscape of Mount Cofano Natural Reserve (Custonaci, Trapani) together with a cartographic representation to a scale of 1 : 10000 (reduced to a scale of 1 : 20000). The studied area is localised along the western side of Sicily island and it is spread out for 537, 5 ha, dominated by Mt. Cofano rocky promontory (659 mts.), {{regarded as one of the}} most interesting biotopes of the regional territory linked to its floristic, zoological and environmental features. From a geolithological point of view, the area is characterized by carbonathic substrata relative to Monte Sparacio-Monte Cofano and Monte Speziale-Monte Palatimone Units. Bioclastic calcarenites and conglomerates of arenitic type are present at the borders of the area. The most diffused pedological soil associations are lithosols (Lithic Xerorthents), rock outcrop (Rock Outcrop), "Terre rosse mediteranee" (Lithic Rhodoxeralfs) and "Suoli bruni" (Typic Xerochrepts). From a bioclimatic point of view, the whole territory is included in the (lower) thermomediterranean upper dry belt, but the northern part of Mt. Cofano, above 450 mts. altitude, is to be referred to the (lower) thermomediterranean upper suhumid belt. In order to give a good interpretation of sigmeta and microgeosigmeta of the natural landscape, the syndinamic relationships between several series of vegetation are discussed as well as the ecological, floristic and structural-physiognomic characters of the plant communities. The climatophilous series are the following: - coastal Sicilian, <b>basophilous,</b> of calcarenites, thermomediterranean dry series of kermes oak (Chamaeropo humilis-Querco calliprini sigmetum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, <b>basophilous</b> and umbrophilous, of detrital slopes, thermomediterranean dry series of holm oak and termophilous deciduous species (Rhamno alaterni-Querco ilicis pistacietoso terebinthi sigmetosum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, <b>basophilous</b> and heliophilous, of limestone, thermomediterranean dry-subhumid series of holm oak and Pistacia lentiscus (Pistado lentisci-Querco ilicis sigmetum); - hilly Sicilian, neutroacidophilous, of leached calcareous soils, mesomediterranean subhumid series of holm oak and strawberry tree (Pistacio lentisci-Querco ilicis arbutetoso unedonis sigmetosum). The edaphophilous series are the following: - coastal Tyrrhenian, <b>basophilous,</b> of limestone, thermomediterranean dry series of dwarf palm (Pistacio-Chamaeropo humilis sigmetum); - coastal-hilly Sicilian, <b>basophilous,</b> of limestone, thermomediterranean dry series of wild olive (Rhamno-Euphorbio dendroidis euphorbietoso bivonae sigmetosum). The microgeosigmeta of maritime cliffs, rocky slopes, detrital slopes and temporary ponds are also presented. Some new syntaxa referred to Crithmo-Limonietea (Limonietum bocconei subass. limonietosum bocconei and subass. helichrysetosum cophanensis), Crataego-Prunetea (Clematido cirrhosae-Rubetum ulmifolii subass. calystegietosum sylvaticae and subass. rhoetosum coriariae), Cisto-Micromerietea (Brachypodio ramosi-Cistetum cretici), Scrophulario-Helichrysetea italici (Sedo sediformis-Centranthetum rubri) and Quercetea ilicis (Pyro amygdaliformis- Calicotometum infestae, Pistacio lentisci-Quercetum ilicis subass. arbutetosum unedonis) classes are described. © Societè Italiana di Scienza della Vegatazione...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In the {{examined}} area, 165 taxa {{were found}} and identified: 139 taxa {{from the class}} Bryopsida and 26 taxa from the class Marchantiopsida. Nine species are red-listed in Serbia. Material was collected from 62 localities, which were analyzed for similarity of chorological and ecological features using the Jaccard similarity index. Analysis of floristic elements and phytogeographic distribution showed that {{the greatest number of}} taxa are temperate elements with Holarctic distribution. Results of ecological analysis showed that in regard to the substratum aspect, terricolous, <b>basophilous,</b> and indifferent species were dominant. In relation to the ecological parameter humidity, most species were mesophilous. The majority of identified bryophytes were sciophilous taxa...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the study of Taeniathero-Aegilopion geniculatae subnitrophilous {{communities}} found in the centre and south of Portugal, particularly in abandoned olive groves with vegetal cover. The edaphic and phytosociological study reveals that these pasturelands thrive on neutro-basic soils. In the corresponding dendrogram and in the co-location network, their peculiar floristic composition and, in particular, the co-existence of acidophilous and <b>basophilous</b> species {{give rise to a}} cluster of relevés distinctly separated from the rest. Consequently we propose the new Plantagini bellardii-Aegilopetum geniculatae association. It is different from the rest not only because of a number of differential species, but also for ecological reasons. In this respect, the edaphic analysis clearly reveals that all these samples correspond to soils with a pH value equal to or higher than 7, whereas the closest association, Trifolio cherleri-Taenitheretum capitis-medusae, presents a pH record below 7. There are also differences as far as the biogeographical unit and the vegetation series are concerned...|$|E
40|$|The {{vegetation}} {{composition and}} landscape {{analysis of the}} Taormina region (Messina, Sicily) in relation to anthropogenic influences was investigated. A total of 183 phytosociological relevés were performed in the period 2009 - 2012. Despite strong human influence, the area studied {{is characterized by the}} occurrence of several plant-communities, mainly represented by woods and shrubs vegetation (Quercion ilicis, Oleo sylvestris-Ceratonion siliquae), riparian woods and shrubs (Platanion orientalis, Rhamno-Prunetea), dry grasslands (Lygeo-Stipetea), hygrophilous communities (Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, Nasturtio-Glycerietalia and Isoeto-Nanojuncetea), rupicolous communities (Asplenietea trichomanis, Parietarietea judaicae), rocky coast communities (Crithmo-Limonietea), pasture coenosis (Poetea bulbosae), spring-flowering meadows (Tuberarietea guttatae and Stipo-Trachynietea distachyae) and nitrophilous communities (Onopordetea acanthii). The vegetation analysis allowed the identification of 34 vegetation types, with 8 new associations and 3 new sub-associations, and also allowed the reconstruction of the vegetation series and landscape units (geosynphytosociology). The synphytosociological analysis of the plant communities allowed the identification of the main vegetation series: climatophilous acidophilous series of metamorphic substrates (Erico arboreae-Querco virgilianae sigmetum); climatophilous <b>basophilous</b> series of sedimentary substrates (Oleo-Querco virgilianae sigmetum); edaphomesophilous series of the cliffs (Bupleuro fruticosi-Querco ilicis sigmetum); edapho-xerophilous series of the semirupestrian maquis (Euphorbieto dendroidis sigmetum); edafo-hygrophylous geoseries of the riparian wood (Platano-Salico gussonei sigmetum); and chasmophilous permaseries of the cliffs (Erucastro virgati sigmetum, Limonio ionici sigmetum). Overall, this territory should be considered an area of remarkable geobotanical significance, which still shows interesting vestiges of natural vegetations and deserving of preservation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarex sect. Spirostachyae {{comprises}} 25 species {{displaying the}} centre of diversity in Eurasia. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS nrDNA region of 20 species of sect. Spirostachyae, six species of sect. Ceratocystis, five species of sect. Elatae, and eight outgroup species reveals that neither sect. Spirostachyae nor sect. Elatae is monophyletic. With the exclusion of Carex cretica, the 19 species of sect. Spirostachyae studied form a clade with the five species of tropical-subtropical sect. Elatae. Taxonomy of the core Spirostachyae is not only mostly in agreement with our phylogenetic hypothesis, but also with ecological and new cytogenetic results. Two main groups with different chromosome numbers and edaphic preferences are identified in the core Spirostachyae. One includes primarily acidophilous species with high chromosome numbers (2 n=(64) 68 – 84), whereas the other one includes mainly <b>basophilous</b> species with lower chromosome numbers (2 n= 60 – 74 (75)). Chromosome-number variation is extremely different in the core Spirostachyae, showing great stability in some widespread species (e. g. Carex extensa) but an active chromosome evolution – faster chromosomal rearrangements, fusion and fission events than ITS nucleotide substitutions – in more restricted species (e. g. Carex troodi). Biogeography of the two amphiatlantic pairs of species reveals two independent colonizations of South America from the European continent. The geographical barrier of the Strait of Gibraltar has played different roles {{in the course of}} evolution of this section, acting as an effective barrier to gene flow in one case (Carex helodes) but as a limited barrier or recent separation in two others (Carex distans, Carex punctata) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} {{of the interaction between}} management practices and road effects on forest biodiversity is of critical interest for sustainable practices and the conservation of forest communities. Forest road improvement and easier access to stand interiors via skid trails, are integral components of management. We tested whether skid trails and the use of limestone gravel for road improvement extended the road effect on plant communities further into forest habitats in a nutrient-poor environment. We analyzed how road distance and skid trail presence affect stand plant communities by examining species composition, distribution of biological and ecological traits, individual species responses and environmental plant indicator values. All results showed that the road effect extended deeper into forest on skid trails, i. e. up to 20 m and even 60 m, than off skid trails, i. e. up to 10 m. Skid trails served as penetration conduits for open-habitat species probably due to forest machinery traffic. The road effect was more damaging to forest species and less-competitive species on skid trails. Additionally, limestone gravel modified the acidity of adjacent poor soils, leading to a shift in species composition and to a colonization of the stand interior by <b>basophilous</b> species. We advocate minimizing skid trail density and using endogenous materials for roads to keep sections of forest large enough to conserve disturbance-sensitive forest species. The interaction found between road effects and management practices underlines the need to adopt a landscape-scale view and to consider multiple anthropogenic impacts in order to effectively preserve forest plant communities...|$|E
40|$|Pseudo-steppe with {{grasses and}} annuals {{includes}} {{a variety of}} xeric, termophilic and mostly open Mediterranean perennial and annual grasslands growing on usually eutrophic, but also oligotrophic, soils. Three major sub-types should be considered: one of perennial basophile rather hard short-grass communities, included in Lygeo-Stipetalia; another one of very dense and short but highly productive perennial summer drying swards, created by intense and continuous livestock activity, included in Poetalia bulbosae; and a last one of pioneer and ephemeral <b>basophilous</b> annual grasslands, included in Brachypodietalia (Trachynietalia) distachyae. The diversity of plant, invertebrate and vertebrate communities is usually high. Pseudo-steppe with grasses and annuals has a typical Mediterranean distribution, with a significant area located in the Iberian Peninsula (mostly in Spain), followed by Italy, France, Greece, Cyprus and Malta. The habitat has been favoured by traditional management schemes and contributes to the so-called cultural landscapes. It usually occurs in a mosaic pattern {{with a wide variety}} of related habitats, many of them also included in the 92 / 43 EEC Directive. As a consequence, a high number of animal species protected by that Directive depend, to a higher or lesser degree, on this habitat type. That is why a holistic perspective is needed when considering conservation management models. Too low a grazing intensity will result in scrub encroachment, a reduction in biodiversity and an increased risk of wild fires. For Poetalia bulbosae communities, experience shows that this will lead to their disappearance due to rapid changes in floristic composition. Therefore, grazing (particularly sheep grazing) is essential for the long-term maintenance of this habitat. Regular scrub clearing on small to medium-size irregular plots and silvicultural treatments on related forests and coppices are advisable as complementary measures, as well as the conservation or restoration of traditional infrastructures (water points, hedges, stone walls) and nearby small agricultural plots. A light phosphoric fertilization is recommended for Poetalia bulbosae communities; however, fertilization with other nutrients or on other 6220 habitat type communities should be banned. Restoration of 6220 habitat type communities from overgrown sites will require scrub clearing and intense grazing for many years. Other relevant measures are reducing or banning the use of pesticides and herbicides, protecting the habitat from urbanization processes, control of tourism activity when necessary, promoting livestock quality labels, improving living conditions for shepherds and implementing new land management strategies...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} of vegetation typologies that characterise the plant landscape in Nurra - according to phytosociological and sinphytosociological interpretations - is presented. Plant associations found out are here presented from areas {{closer to the}} sea towards the inner ones, grouped according to environmental and structural characteristics. The following new associations are described. Crithmo maritimi-Limonietum nymphaei, Evaco pygmaeae-Bellietum bellidioidis, Senecioni leucanthemifolii-Nanantheetum perpusillae, Spergulario salinae-Hordeetum marini, Limonietum laeti-glomerati, Brassico insularis-Seselictum praecocis, Anthyllido vulnerariae-Kundmannietum siculae, Loto cytisoidis-Dactyletum hispanicae, Dactylo hispanicae-Camphorosmetum monspeliacae, Scillo obtusifoliae-Bellidetum sylvestris, Scillo autumnalis-Bellidetum sylvestris, Hypecoo procumbentis-Silenetum nummicae, Bupleuro fontanesii-Scorpiuretum muricati, Rosmarino officinalis-Thymelaeetum tartonrairae, Dorycnio pentaphylli-Cistetum eriocephali, Pyro amygdaliformis-Quercetum ilicis, Euphorbio characiae-Juniperetum turbinatae, Pistacio lentisci-Calicotometum villosae, Crataego monogynae-Pistacietum lentisci. Furthermore, phytosociological and syntaxonomical study of the subnitrophilous hemicryptophyte communities allowed their attribution to the Artemisietea vulgaris c 1 ass. Within this class the new Brachypodio ramosi-Dactyletalia hispanicae order is described, together with two new alliances, Reichardio maritimae-Dactylion hispanicae and Leontodo tuberosi-Bellidion sylvestris. The order includes the perennial, hemicryptophyte and geophyte, subnitrophilous vegetation of the secondary formations, finding their optimum in the sub-humid and humid mesomediterranean macroclimate, and can also penetrate into the thermomediterranean one for edaphic compensation. Moreover, this study suggests {{to include in the}} new Brachypodio ramosi-Dactyletalia hispanicae order, the Bromo-Oryzopsion and the Thero-Brachypodion ramosi alliances. The study of associations and their dynamic relationships also allowed to reconstruct the vegetation series which integration produces the main plant landscape units present in Nurra. The coastal Tyrrhenian, <b>basophilous,</b> calcicole, thermomediterranean and edaphon-xerophilous series of Juniperus turbinata (Chamaeropo humilis-Junipereto turbinatae sigmetum) was reconstructed on Mesozoic limestone. Different plant associations of comophytic and chasmophytic communities integrating the coastallimestone landscape are connected to this pattern by chain relationships. Between the landscape units of the Mesozoic limestone sector and the Paleozoic metamorphic one, the coastal Tyrrhenian, neutroacidophilous, of sandstone, thermomediterranean and edaphon-xerophilous series of Juniperus turbinata with Arbutus unedo (Chamaeropo humilis-Junipereto turbinatae arbutetosum unedonis sigmetum), representing an edaphic variant of the previous one, linked to the violet quartzose sandstone on which a more clayey soil is generated, was reconstructed. The geosigmetum of Mesozoic limestone is completed by the Tyrrhenian, neutroacidophilous, calcicole, thermomediterranean c 1 imatophilous series of Quercus ilex (Pistacio-Querceto i 1 icis sigmetum). It is present on the inner hills and, of its series-head, only a few examples of Quercus ilex grove remain, which assume a particular characterisation for the presence of Chamaerops humilis. The Sardinian coastal, neutroacidophilous, of Paleozoic schist, thermomediterranean, climatophilous and edaphon-xerophilous series of Juniperetus turbinata (Euphorbio characiae-Junipereto turbinatae sigmetum) was reconstructed in the metamorphic area. The prevalently chain contact with the subhalophile garigue and the microgeosigmeta of the therophytic and chamaephytic halophile communities occurs in the coastal girdle close to the c 1 iff. The landscape unit of the coastal metamorphic section is completed by the Tyrrhenian, neutroacidophilous, mesomediterranean, of schist, climatophilous series of Quercus ilex (Erico arboreae-Querceto ilicis sigmetum). In the alluvial plain of Nurra, on strong clayey substrata with a mixed calcicole-silicic matrix, always in thermomediterranean climate but under a marked edaphic compensation, the Sardinian, neutroacidophilous, of plain, edaphon-mesophilous series of Quercus ilex and Quercus suber (Pyro amygdaliformis-Querceto i 1 icis sigmetum) is found. The geosigmetum of the alluvial plain is completed by the edaphon-hydric series of the alluvial soils in the north-western Sardinia (Allio triquetri-Ulmeto minoris sigmetum). Finally, some indications about land management are given {{in order to maintain the}} high biodiversity that currently is still present...|$|E
40|$|Sopotski slap smješten je oko 3 km sjeveroistočno od sela Sošice u Parku prirode Žumberak – Samoborsko gorje. Strmo se obrušava niz 40 metara kaskada uz stari mlin i sastavni je dio toka Kupčine. Područje Sopotskog slapa i gornjeg toka Kupčine do sada nisu bili floristički i vegetacijski sustavno istraživani. Terenska istraživanja vršena su tijekom 2009. i 2010. godine. Ovim preliminarnim istraživanjem zabilježene su ukupno 204 biljne svojte od kojih su, prema IUCN kategorizaciji, dvije kritično ugrožene vrste (CR) – Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. i Tofieldia calyculata (L.) Wahlenb., jedna ugrožena vrsta (EN) – Eriophorum latifolium, i pet osjetljivih svojti (VU) – Carex panicea L., Ophrys fuciflora Haller, O. insectifera L., Orchis purpurea Huds., Helleborus niger L. subsp. macranthus (Freyn) Schiffner i jedna gotovo ugrožena vrsta (NT) – Cephalanthera damasonium (Mill.) Druce. Na istraživanom području dokumentirana su i dva tipa ugroženih staništa: elementi vegetacije niskog, bazofilnog creta suhoperke (Eriophoro-Caricetum paniceae Horvat 1964), te (polu) suhi kontinentalni travnjaci razreda Festuco-Brometea Br. -Bl. et R. Tx. 1943 (as. Seslerietum kalnikensis Horvat 1942), stanište bogato različitim značajnim vrstama otvorenih staništa, naročito kaćunima. Oba staništa su ugrožena zaraštavanjem i nedostatkom ekstenzivne ispaše i u odmaklom su stadiju sukcesije prema šumskim zajednicama što vodi nestanku mnogih, a posebno navedenih ugroženih vrsta s ovog područja. The Sopot {{waterfall}} is {{the biggest}} waterfall in the Nature park Žumberak - Samoborsko gorje, situated about 3 km NW from the village Sošice. So far, there were no methodical investigations of flora or vegetation {{in the area around}} the Sopot waterfall and along the upper flow of the brook Kupčina. The initial research was carried out in the summer and autumn of the year 2009 and in the spring and early summer of the year 2010. Plant species found on the research area were recorded during every field trip and the herbarium samples were taken for later identification of some plant taxa. For better recommendations how to protect different habitats the study area was divided into 3 subareas; subarea 1 - the waterfall area, subarea 2 – the area of the brook Kupčina, which flows through small canyon and subarea 3 – the area of upper flow of the brook Kupcina, located in small dale, where few water streams appear and form more or less unitary stream of the brook Kupcina. In our preliminary study we recorded in total 204 plant species, out of which according to IUCN categorization, two critically endangered (CR) : Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. and Tofieldia calyculata (L.) Wahlenb., one endangered (EN) : Eriophorum latifolium Hoppe, one near threatened (NT) : Cephalanthera damasonium (Mill.) Druce and four vulnerable (VU) : Carex panicea L., Helleborus niger L. subsp. macranthus (Freyn) Schiffner, Ophrys fuciflora Haller and Ophrys insectifera L. In the researched area 44 species were protected and 15 strictly protected by the Croatian law. The research showed that subarea 1 has a different type of habitat than subareas 2 and 3. The subarea 1 is covered with beech and hop hornbeam forest (Ostryo-Fagetum M. Wraber ex Trinajstic 1972) and we assume that it should be left to spontaneous natural development, because it does not show any signs of endangerments. On the subareas 2 and 3 we recorded two endangered habitats: elements of flat, <b>basophilous,</b> rich fen with bog cotton (Eriophoro-Caricetum paniceae Horvat 1964) and (semi) dry continental grasslands from Festuco-Brometea Br. -Bl. et R. Tx. 1943 (as. Seslerietum kalnikensis Horvat 1942) class, which are the habitats rich with many significant species of open habitats, especially with orchids. Both habitats are endangered by overgrowing and lack of extensive pasture and they are in advanced stage of succession towards wood associations, why we consider {{that it is necessary to}} try to stop the succession in progress. At first it would be necessary to remove the woody vegetation which endangers the rich fen and grassland vegetation beside the brook, and later on, it is important to periodically organize mowing or intensive pasture in that area...|$|E
