The SoftCard was first demonstrated publicly at the West Coast Computer Faire in March 1980. It was an immediate success; 5,000 cards, a large number given the microcomputer market at the time, were purchased in the initial three months at $349 each and it was Microsoft's number one revenue source in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The <b>business</b> <b>software</b> {{publisher}} Scandinavian PC Systems {{found out}} about the game through Upp; they were expanding at the time and wanted to add a video game to their catalogue, so they contacted the game's developers. The Eriksson brothers and Johansson developed a version for home computers, but had problems with compiling it for the PC, as it was a much larger BASIC program than most compilers could handle. Due to copyright issues, a scene in the mainframe version of the game where the player guest stars in The Muppet Show had to be cut for the commercial release, but all other materials remained intact; additionally, some visuals and audio were created and added for this release. The game was published by Scandinavian PC Systems for IBM PCs in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and English in 1986. The developers negotiated with Scandinavian PC Systems, and were given 5 SEK per sold copy of the Swedish version and 2 SEK per sold foreign copy as royalties; 30,000 SEK of the royalties were pre-paid.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between measuring and improving software quality in an embedded system (with emphasis on risk management) and software quality in <b>business</b> <b>software</b> (with emphasis on cost and maintainability management) is becoming somewhat irrelevant. Embedded systems now often include a user interface and their designers are as much concerned with issues affecting usability and user productivity as their counterparts who focus on business applications. The latter are in turn looking at ERP or CRM system as a corporate nervous system whose uptime and performance are vital {{to the well-being of}} the enterprise. This convergence is most visible in mobile computing: a user who accesses an ERP application on their smartphone is depending on the quality of software across all types of software layers.|$|E

25|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} detriments towards the {{theoretical}} success of open source software, {{there are several}} {{factors that contribute to}} the lack of long-term success in open source projects. One of the most obvious drawback is that without pay or royalty licensing, there is little financial incentive for a programmer to become involved with a project in the first place, or to continue development and support once the initial product is released. This leads to innumerable examples of well-anticipated software being forever condemned to beta versions and unsupported early model products. With donations as the only source of income for a truly open source (and GPL licensed) project, there is almost no certainty in the future of the project simply because of developer abandonment, making it a poor choice for any sort of application in which future versions, support and a long-term plan would be essential, as is the case for most <b>business</b> <b>software.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sierra On-Line {{was founded}} by Roberta and Ken Williams in 1980. Roberta had also been {{inspired}} by Colossal Cave Adventure, and unable to find similar games of that type, wrote her own detective story based loosely on Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None and the board game Clue. Once she had completed its design, she had convinced Ken to stop work on a FORTRAN compiler he had been developing as to bring her game to light on the Apple II home computer. The game, initially titled Hi-Res Adventure, was ultimately released as Mystery House; Mystery House was the first adventure game to feature graphics, using vector graphics atop a simple two-word command parser. The Williamses initially sold the game on their own, achieving reasonable sales. Though Ken wanted to continue developing <b>business</b> <b>software,</b> they ultimately decided to continue to develop games, forming On-Line Systems in 1980, which they would eventually rename as Sierra On-Line.|$|E
25|$|The first Soviet {{programmable}} desktop calculator ISKRA 123, {{powered by}} the power grid, was released {{at the start of}} the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, Elektronika B3-21, was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the start of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and <b>business</b> <b>software,</b> which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal EEPROM memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for Soyuz TM-7 flight) as a backup of the board computer.|$|E

25|$|The company {{continued}} {{to develop new}} text adventure games, expanding in size to over 100 employees at its peak; by 1984, they had sold over $10 million in game software. Their success drew writer Douglas Adams, who had loved Zork, to help produce two games through them: the first based on Douglas Adams' popular Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and an original work called Bureaucracy. The company also attempted to expand into <b>business</b> <b>software,</b> writing the relational database program Cornerstone, released in 1985; though Cornerstone was well-received, its release was {{at a time of}} a slump in software sales, and the company lost a significant amount of money on the title, as well as divided the company internally on progress going forward. Struggling for funding, Infocom was bought by Activision in 1986 and returned to adventure game development, but following that, the increased power of home microcomputers and graphic-driven games saw the demand for Infocom titles decline. Infocom was late to add graphics to its games as to be able to compete with other titles until 1987. By 1989, the Infocom division at Activision had been reduced to 10 employees, and was ultimately shuttered; Activision would continue to develop some text adventure games inhouse using the Infocom brand but with no connection to the original team. The demise of Infocom is considered {{to be the end of}} the commercial age for interactive fiction, but its legacy would remain; the Z-machine remains a popular source for running non-commercial interactive fiction games developed in more modern tools such as Inform.|$|E
500|$|Delrina {{was founded}} in Toronto in 1988 by Zimbabwean {{expatriate}} Bert Amato, South African expatriates Mark Skapinker and Dennis Bennie and American Lou Ryan. Delrina was Bennie's third major entrepreneurial start up after co-founding Mission Electronics, a high-end home entertainment equipment producer, and Aviva Software, which became Ingram Micro Canada. Delrina's business strategy was to [...] "establish technical and market leadership in niche markets", which it accomplished with its electronic form and PC-based fax software. A year before the firm was incorporated, Amato and Skapinker had quit their jobs to start work on an electronic forms product which would eventually become PerForm. Both would later meet with Bennie, {{who was then the}} co-founder and CEO of Ingram Micro Canada before becoming CEO of Carolian Systems International, a firm that made <b>business</b> <b>software</b> for Hewlett-Packard. Bennie facilitated an initial seed investment of $1.5 million CAD to finance a new start-up company, [...] "Delrina", to develop this idea.

500|$|Apple is {{a member}} of the <b>Business</b> <b>Software</b> Alliance (BSA), whose {{principal}} activity is trying to stop copyright infringement of software produced by BSA members; Apple treats all its intellectual property as a business asset, engaging in litigation as one method among many to police its assets and to respond to claims by others against it. Apple's portfolio of intellectual property is broad enough, for trademarks alone, to encompass several pages of the company's web site and, in April 2012, it listed 176 general business trademarks, 79 service marks, 7 trademarks related to NeXT products and services, and 2 trademarks related to FileMaker. Apple claims copyright interests in multiple products and processes and owns and licenses patents of various types as well and, while it states it generally does not license its patent portfolio, it does work with third parties having an interest in product interoperability. Steve Jobs alone was a named inventor on over 300 design and utility patents. Between January 2008 and May 2010, Apple Inc. filed more than 350 cases with the U.S. Patent and Trademark office (USPTO) alone, most in opposition to or taking exception to others' use of the terms [...] "apple", [...] "pod", and [...] "safari"; those cases include sellers of apples (the fruit), as well as many others' less unassuming use of the term [...] "apple".|$|E
