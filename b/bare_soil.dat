5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in <b>bare</b> <b>soil,</b> at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice only do so when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on <b>bare</b> <b>soil</b> is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{magazines}} and books, Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas {{that have become}} commonplace today. He is most linked with introducing the herbaceous border, which he referred to by the older name of 'mixed border'—it included a mixture of shrubs, hardy and half-hardy herbaceous plants. He also advocated dense plantings that left no <b>bare</b> <b>soil,</b> with the spaces between taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants. Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses. Following {{a visit to the}} Alps, Robinson wrote Alpine Flowers for Gardens, which for the first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} nests in crevices and burrows, {{sometimes}} shared with other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on <b>bare</b> <b>soil.</b> The adults share the lengthy incubation and both feed the chick, {{which is not}} normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly migratory, spending the northern hemisphere winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid and zooplankton while pattering on the sea's surface, and can find oily edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird's stomach to an oily orange liquid which is regurgitated when the chick is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the storm petrel has a chattering call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight, and the male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.|$|E

The study focused on {{the two types of}} <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> (zipella) located in the north-center of Burkina Faso: a lixivied ferruginous soil and an eutrophic brown soil. The biologic activity was evaluated in relation to soil surface characteristics and soil depth. The impact of the «zaï» technique processing on {{the biological}} activity was also investigated. The physico-chemical characteristics of the ferruginous soils were globally lower than those of the brown soils. For the same type of soil these characteristics were lower in the bare surfaces compared to ones of surface covered by vegetal.

However, litter under the tree prevented water droplets from splashing the soil particles as well as the inoculum beneath the litter to the above pods. Further, it was also reported that pods near the ground showed greater infections compared to higher pods due to greater soil was splashed and stick on the lower pods, therefore causes more infections.|$|E

500|$|Lichens are a {{symbiotic}} relationship between fungi and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria. The photosynthetic partner in the relationship is referred to in lichen terminology as a [...] "photobiont". The fungal part of the relationship is composed mostly of various species of ascomycetes and a few basidiomycetes. Lichens occur in every ecosystem on all continents, {{play a key role}} in soil formation and the initiation of biological succession, and are prominent in some extreme environments, including polar, alpine, and semiarid desert regions. They are able to grow on inhospitable surfaces, including <b>bare</b> <b>soil,</b> rocks, tree bark, wood, shells, barnacles and leaves. As in mycorrhizas, the photobiont provides sugars and other carbohydrates via photosynthesis to the fungus, while the fungus provides minerals and water to the photobiont. The functions of both symbiotic organisms are so closely intertwined that they function almost as a single organism; in most cases the resulting organism differs greatly from the individual components. Lichenization is a common mode of nutrition for fungi; around 20% of fungi—between 17,500 and 20,000 described species—are lichenized. Characteristics common to most lichens include obtaining organic carbon by photosynthesis, slow growth, small size, long life, long-lasting (seasonal) vegetative reproductive structures, mineral nutrition obtained largely from airborne sources, and greater tolerance of desiccation than most other photosynthetic organisms in the same habitat.|$|E
40|$|An {{overstocked}} montane, mixed-conifer {{forest on}} the west shore of the Lake Tahoe Basin was thinned using a Fecon masticator, leaving woodchips and tree shreddings on-site as mulch. No significant differences in soil compaction were found in 13 of 15 comparisons of soil-profile resistance values at several distances from the machine track and varying depths. We then watered the mastication sites with a rainfall simulator, and measured runoff, infiltration and erosion. The treatments included woodchip-covered and bare-soil plots corresponding to mulched track, as well as native grass, <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> and relatively undisturbed soil plots.

40|$|Ecological {{restoration}} of degraded metal-rich habitats and <b>bare</b> metal-rich <b>soils</b> created by mining activities has nowadays {{become a major}} environmental issue to reduce mining impacts on the erosion of biodiversity and the degradation of landscape, soil and water. Studies based on species identification for restoration purposes without reference to plant trait are limited only to local pool of species which makes the interpretation and applications in various ecological contexts rather difficult. This study aims at trait analysis of metal-rich habitats {{in order to test}} the differences in plant traits in degraded primary habitat and along a successional gradient in secondary habitats. In this context, investigation of the existence of resilience or the need for ecological restoration is attempted. A second aim of this work is also the identification of traits candidates for appropriate species selection for revegetation of metal-rich <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> purposes. Results showed that the cover of xylopodia trait values decreases according to the intensity of degradation among habitats, and can be considered an indicator of habitat degradation. Differences of traits values among primary and old secondary habitats highlighted that the absence of resilience of degraded primary steppic savanna was not explained by 14 soil factors measured. The main plant traits for revegetation of metal-rich <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> are the following: annual life cycle, growth phenology in wet season, depth 0 - 10. cm of underground system. bud bank by seeds, dispersule size < 2. mm. ×. 2. mm and dispersal mode by adhesion.

40|$|Visible, {{near-infrared}} and short-wave infrared (VNIR/SWIR, 0. 4 - 2. 5 mu m) hyperspectral airborne imaging {{has been}} demonstrated to be a potential tool for topsoil property mapping (such as free iron, clay, and organic matter) over <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> of large areas. Nevertheless, one of the limiting factors of hyperspectral airborne data use for soil property mapping {{is the need for}} a set of soil spectra extracted from <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> pixels of the VNIR/SWIR airborne data and the corresponding soil property values measured over soil samples collected over the <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> pixels for which soil spectra are extracted. We propose to test a new approach which uses legacy soil data collected over and/or around the study site, instead of soil property values measured over soil samples collected over <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> pixels. As legacy soil samples can be inaccurately localized or can be located out of <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> of hyperspectral airborne data or out of the study area, these data could be unusable as calibration data for classical predictive models (such as the partial least-squares regression method). So the proposed approach first uses a spectral clay index to estimate clay contents (in relative values as it is done without calibration) and then transform these estimated clay contents thanks to a correction of the distribution and range of clay content estimations using legacy soil data. This procedure is compared to a linear model built from the spectral clay index and calibrated using a reference database. The spectral index was proposed by Levin et al. (2007) using spectral bands at 2205, 2. 13, 2. 224 mu m. This study employs the VNIR/SWIR AISA-DUAL hyperspectral airborne data acquired over an area of 300 km(2) in a Mediterranean region. Our results show that 1) this spectral index offers predictions with low accuracy in terms of the coefficient of determination, R- 2, which is associated with high bias and SEP; 2) the distribution and range correction made using legacy soil data allows for both an increase of accuracy (R- 2) and an improvement of bias and SEP; 3) it is better to have a small number of legacy ground measurements focused on the study area than a high number of legacy ground measurements dispersed on and far from the study area; 4) the correction of the prediction bias is highly dependent on the legacy soil data quality; and 5) regardless of which legacy soil database is used, the soil pattern is discriminated.

40|$|Basianshan National Forest Recreation Area was {{established}} in 1978. The recreation area was famous for its forestry history and plentiful forest resources. Basianshan Nature Center, built in 2008, provided ecotourism and education services for visitors. However, the recreation area was sometimes destroyed and thus closed due to earthquake and typhoons The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the landscape changes under the influences of natural disturbances in Basianshan National Forest Recreation Area. I used aerial ortho-photos in four periods, i. e., before 921 earthquake (1998), after 921 earthquake (2001), after Mindulle, Haitang and Matsa typhoons (2005), and after Sinlaku and Jangmi typhoons (2008). The forest, <b>bared</b> <b>soil,</b> watercourse, grass and building areas were classified in each period. I overlapped each landscape maps with FRAGSTATS to realize the landscape status and check the changing patterns with ArcGIS. The landscape status was discussed in two levels, patch class level and landscape level, and the landslide probability was predicted with Logistic regression. The results intended to provide landslide management implications for Dongshih Forest District Office. In the patch class level, the forest area (calculated by land percentage) and forest large patch index (LPI) were decreased after 921 earthquake. On the other hand, the forest edge density (ED) and landscape shape index (LSI) were increased. I also found that the area of <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> and its patch density (PD) were increased. The results indicated that forest area was destroyed from the earthquake and became fragile. The Mindulle, Haitang and Matsa typhoons had small effects on the areas of forest and <b>bared</b> <b>soil.</b> The results showed that the PD and watercourse and grass areas were increased, which meant the typhoons created dispersed landslides and extended the watercourse and grass areas. Since the forest areas were increased and <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> areas decreased in 2008, I concluded that to some extent the influences of Sinlaku and Jangmi typhoons were not serious, and the landslide management of Dongshih Forest District Office was effective. In the landscape level, the LPI decreased from 1998 to 2005 but increased in 2008. The PD, ED, LSI and landscape diversity index increased from 1998 to 2005 but decreased in 2008. Huge <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> areas were occurred in 921 earthquake, where used to cover with forest. There were areas of watercourse and grass increased in Mindulle, Haitang and Matsa typhoons, which made the landscape more complex. The <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> area was not recovered with forest until 2008. The Dongshih Forest District Office have some some landslide management and natural restoration, making the landscape more complete. The value of mean patch fractal dimension (MPFD) equaled to 1 and remained unchanged, which meant all landscape changes was created by natural disturbances. The results of landscape change analysis showed that there were 2, 010. 95 ha (85 %) forest areas that have never changed. There were 129. 99 ha (83 %) of <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> areas (156. 66 ha) changed from forest areas in 2001 because of 921 earthquake. There were 56. 24 ha (36 %) <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> areas changed to forest in 2005 and represented 88. 55 ha (57 %) forest in total in 2008. There were 73. 08 ha (50 %) of 147. 32 ha <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> areas changed from forest after Mindulle, Haitang and Matsa typhoons. There were 52. 66 ha (36 %) bared areas recovered to forest, but 20. 42 ha (14 %) still covered by <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> in 2008. The <b>bared</b> <b>soil</b> areas were decreased to 67. 10 ha in 2008, among which 44. 69 ha (66 %) bared areas have been existed, and 8. 65 ha (13 %) was created Sinlaku and Jangmi typhoons. A lot of bared areas closed to Shiwen River were not recovered to forest during 1998 – 2008. I suggested these areas should be managed carefully. Finally, I used Logistic regression to realize the relationship between landslide and environmental factors, including distance from the river, elevation, slope and aspect,. The results showed that the landslide often occurred in the areas where the distance of river within 100 m, lower 1, 000 m asl, slope over 50 ° in the south and southwest direction. I used those characteristics to build an equation, ln(p/(1 -p)) = - 0. 705 - 0. 115 R- 0. 184 E+ 0. 463 S+ 0. 047 A, where p represented landslide probability，R was the distance with river, E was elevation, S was slope and A was aspect, to predict landslide probability. The model explained 60 % of variance. There were 71. 38 % the landslide areas occurred in the high and extreme high potential areas. 八仙山國家森林遊樂區成立於 1978 年，由於其擁有豐富的森林資源以及林業歷史，因此成為臺灣中部地區著名的森林旅遊景點， 2008 年成立自然教育中心後，提供遊客在森林區域內從事生態旅遊活動，進一步發揮森林環境教育的功能。然而過去受到地震與颱風等自然干擾，曾造成遊樂區內多處崩塌、道路中斷，以至於面臨休園的狀況。 本研究欲探討地震與颱風等自然干擾對八仙山國家森林遊樂區地景變遷的影響，使用九二一地震前(1998 年) 、九二一地震後(2001 年) 、敏督利、海棠與馬莎颱風後(2005 年) 以及辛樂克與薔蜜颱風後(2008 年) 等四個時期的航空攝影正射影像進行地景判釋，將地景分成森林地、裸露地、河道、草生地以及人工用地等五項進行討論。同時以FRAGSTATS軟體進行地景結構與變遷分析，並利用GIS中的空間統計進行地景轉移量分析。最後，針對崩塌地進行環境因子(包含坡度、坡向、海拔高及河流環域) 分析，亦以Logistic迴歸計算出崩塌機率，並繪製崩塌潛感圖，期望提供經營管理單位在災害管理與防治上參考。 結果顯示，在嵌塊體類型層級上，地景受到九二一地震的影響，森林地的地景面積比(%Land) 、最大嵌塊體指標(LPI) 下降，邊界密度(ED) 以及地景形狀指標(LSI) 上升；而裸露地的面積、嵌塊體密度(PD) 上升，亦即表示森林面積受到崩塌的影響而減少且林相變破碎。受到敏督利、海棠與馬莎颱風的影響，森林地與裸露地面積皆稍微下降，但是裸露地PD、草生地以及河道面積上升，表示森林仍持續受到崩塌的影響，而且其崩塌之裸露地較為分散，草生地與河道則有明顯的擴張現象。 2008 年雖然受到辛樂克與薔蜜颱風的影響，但森林地面積上升、裸露地面積下降，顯示其影響不大，配合森林自然演替以及東勢林管處的崩塌地整治，森林逐漸回復。 在地景層級上，LPI從 1998 年至 2005 年呈現下降的趨勢， 2008 年才上升，PD、ED、LSI以及地景多樣性指標則呈現相反的趨勢。此結果顯示八仙山國家森林遊樂區地景在九二一地震之前以森林為主體(97. 13 %) ，故地景較完整且單純，受到九二一地震的影響，裸露地面積從 23. 22 ha增加至 156. 66 ha(6. 32 %) ，地景漸趨複雜。之後陸續受到敏督利、海棠與馬莎颱風的干擾，除了崩塌數量增加外，河道與草生地面積也隨之擴張，因此 2005 年地景最為複雜。 2008 年後由於森林的自然演替以及東勢林管處的崩塌地整治工程，導致森林回復至 93. 5 %，崩塌狀況也改善，故地景漸趨完整。從平均嵌塊體碎形維度(MPFD) 沒有明顯變化，且其值接近於 1 顯示八仙山國家森林遊樂區地景主要係受到自然干擾的影響。 地景轉移量分析結果顯示，八仙山國家森林遊樂區經歷四期的地景變遷，有 2, 101. 95 ha(85 %) 的森林地完全沒有改變，表示其並未受到自然干擾的影響。 2001 年的裸露地有 156. 66 ha，其中 129. 99 ha(83 %) 原來為森林，顯示九二一地震造成森林地大量崩塌。裸露地中有 56. 24 ha(36 %) 在 2005 年回復為森林地，到了 2008 年總共有 88. 55 ha(57 %) 回復為森林地。 2005 年的裸露地有 147. 32 ha，其中有 73. 08 ha(50 %) 來自於森林地，顯示這些森林是受到敏督利、海棠與馬莎颱風的影響而發生崩塌，其中到了 2008 年有 52. 66 ha(36 %) 回復為森林， 20. 42 ha(14 %) 仍維持為裸露地。 2008 年的裸露地有 67. 10 ha，其中有 44. 69 ha(66 %) 在之前就已經成為裸露地，另外有 8. 65 ha(13 %) 的森林地受到辛樂克與薔蜜颱風影響轉變為裸露地。研究結果也顯示，從 2001 年至 2008 年都是裸露地的地區多集中於十文溪河道沿岸，遠離河道邊的裸露地多半經過幾年後就會回復為森林，故應將十文溪沿岸列為崩塌地防治之重點地區。 最後分析八仙山國家森林遊樂區 2001 年崩塌地與環境因子間的關係，結果顯示八仙山國家森林遊樂區的崩塌地主要集中於坡度> 50 °，坡向為南向與西南向坡，海拔高位於 1, 000 m以下，以及河流環域 100 m以內。進一步利用Logistic迴歸分析得到方程式ln(p/(1 -p)) =- 0. 705 - 0. 115 R- 0. 184 E+ 0. 463 S+ 0. 047 A，p表示崩塌機率，R表示河流環域因子，E表示海拔因子，S表示坡度因子，A表示坡向因子，其整體預測率有 60 %，而實際崩塌地則有 71. 38 %位於崩塌潛感圖的高潛感以及極高潛感區域中。摘要 [...] . i Abstract [...] iii 目錄 [...] . v 表目次 [...] . vii 圖目次 [...] viii 第壹章 前言…………………………………………………………………………. 1 第貳章 前人研究……………………………………………………………………. 4 一、	土地利用型判釋…………………………………… [...] . ………………………… 4 二、	地景結構與變遷分析…………………………… [...] ……………………………. 8 三、	地景指標介紹 [...] . 12 四、	Logistic迴歸分析……………………………………… [...] . ………………… 17 第參章 材料與方法……………………… [...] ………………………………………. 19 一、	研究樣區……… [...] . …………………………………………………………… [...] 19 二、	多時期正射影像………………………………………………………………. 20 三、	地震與颱風資料收集…………………………………………………………. 24 四、	研究方法 [...] . 24 五、	FRAGSTATS地景結構與變遷分析 [...] . 26 (一) 一般性指標 [...] . 26 (二) 形狀性指標 [...] . 27 (三) 多樣性指標 [...] . 28 六、地景變遷檢定 [...] . 29 七、GIS空間統計分析 [...] 29 八、Logistic迴歸分析崩塌地與環境因子間之關係 [...] 30 九、研究流程圖 [...] . 31 第肆章 結果與討論…………………. ………… [...] …………………………………. 33 一、	土地利用型判釋…………………………. …………………………………… 33 二、	利用FRAGSTATS進行地景結構與變遷分析……… [...] . ………………. ……. 37 (一) 嵌塊體類型層級指標…………………………………………………… [...] . 37 1. 一般性指標(%Land、LPI、PD、ED) ………………. ………………… 37 2. 形狀性指標(LSI、MSI、MPFD) …. …. …………………. …………… [...] 41 (二) 地景層級指標……………………………………………. ……………… [...] 43 1. 一般性指標(LPI、PD、ED) …………………………………………… 44 2. 形狀性指標(LSI、MSI、MPFD) …. …………………………………… 44 3. 地景多樣性指標………………………………………………………… 44 三、	利用GIS空間統計進行地景轉移量分析……………………………………. 47 四、	利用Logistic迴歸進行崩塌地環境因子分析……………………………… [...] . 54 (一) 崩塌地分布特性………………………………………………………… [...] . 54 (二) 崩塌因子分析……………………………………………………… [...] ……. 59 第伍章 結論…. …………………………………………… [...] ………………………. 63 第陸章 建議 [...] 65 第柒章 參考文獻 [...] 66 附錄一 八仙山國家森林遊樂區四個時期地景轉移量 [...] 6...|$|R
40|$|Stock farming {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the agriculture of alpine regions although deleterious effects on the soils are most pronounced here. We investigated the effects of cattle trampling on soil physical, chemical and microbial properties in a Swiss sub-alpine pasture. About 10 % of the study site was bare of vegetation as a result of repeated cattle trampling and the bulk density of these bare steps was 20 % higher than of the soils unaffected by trampling. In the upper 25 cm, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations and total SOC stocks were 35 % and 20 % respectively lower than on the vegetated slope. As compared with the vegetated slope, topsoils of the bare steps featured narrower C:N-ratios and were more enriched in the 15 N isotope, with typical values of deeper soil layers. This indicates that <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> primarily evolved by erosion and not by a compaction, which might, together with the reduced litter input, explain the lower SOC contents. The abundances of soil microbes, estimated by the concentrations of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), were 30 % smaller in the <b>bare</b> <b>soils</b> than in the vegetated areas. This depletion was most pronounced for fungi as expressed in the lower concentrations of the fatty acid 18 : 2 � 6. 9 (45 %) and ergosterol (50 %). The lower fungal abundance very likely has negative consequences for the stability of the <b>bare</b> <b>soils,</b> since fungi play an important role in the formation of soil aggregates. In summary, our results show that cattle trampling decreases soil carbon storage and alters soil microbial community structure...|$|R
