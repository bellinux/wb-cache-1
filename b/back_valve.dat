5000|$|Three brand-new G3s Pacific {{locomotives}} {{were assigned}} to the train; numbers 831, 832 and 833. The CNJ totally refurbished sixteen cars for Blue Comet service, inside and out. The train and its engines were painted in Packard Blue to suggest the sea and the sky. The passenger cars all had a cream band running the length of the side at the windows to evoke the sand of the shore. The paint scheme was unusual, since the road name did not appear on each car; rather, only the name of the train, [...] "THE BLUE COMET", appeared in gold lettering on the letter board. Each car was named for a different comet. The name of each car was placed in gold lettering at the middle of each side below the windows. The underframes and trucks were painted royal blue and varnished. The locomotives' marker lights, headlights, handrails, coupler lifting rods, cylinder head covers, and <b>back</b> <b>valve</b> chambers were nickel-plated. Side rods were polished. The name of the train was painted in gold lettering on a blue nameboard that was mounted {{to the front of the}} smoke box just below the Elesco feedwater heater. The train was also known by its distinctive whistle. Mounted on the fireman's side of the steam dome, it was usually angled forward. While the manufacturer and cadence of the specific whistle has not been verified (none are known to exist), it is reported to have been a long-bell 3-chime steamboat whistle similar to a Hancock or Star Brass 6" [...] long-bell 3-chime.|$|E
50|$|A two {{evaporator}} {{single compressor}} with individual expansion valves for each evaporator after {{passing through the}} <b>back</b> pressure <b>valve</b> enters into the compressors and hence {{there is a significant}} rise in temperature is observed. This system helps in dropping the pressure from high pressure evaporators with the help of <b>back</b> pressure <b>valves.</b> The high pressure ratio is obtained which necessarily compresses the vapor to high extent from the higher temperature evaporators to condenser temperature. This kind of refrigerator has greater application in load varying purpose. Moreover, high value of COP and better operating economy is observed.|$|R

30|$|Air {{temperature}} will elevate during compressing, so an {{air cooler}} {{is needed to}} cool the air before it enters the stack.

On the cathode side of the stack, the electrochemical reaction occurs between oxygen and protons to form water, together with heat released. In {{order to keep the}} stack temperature, coolant must be pumped into the stack and take the heat out and then released into circumstance with a radiator. The water separator is used to recover the water in the exhaust air. The <b>back</b> pressure <b>valve</b> is used to keep a suitable air flow pressure in the stack.|$|R

The oil pump simply pumps constantly, and any excess pumped oil continuously escapes through a relief <b>valve</b> <b>back</b> into the sump.|$|R

50|$|A {{starting}} valve, {{consisting of}} a Corliss non-throttling rotating valve in combination with a butterfly valve (closed in flight), could divert individual engine output {{to the outside of}} the aircraft, permitting engine starting and ground running with the rotor stationary. Without the <b>valve,</b> <b>back</b> pressure in the duct and rotor system would prevent the starting of the engine.

25|$|In the Compensation system, each of {{the first}} two (or three) valves has an {{additional}} set of tubing extending from the <b>back</b> of the <b>valve.</b> When the third (or fourth) valve is depressed in combination with another one, the air is routed through both the usual set of tubing plus the extra one, so that the pitch is lowered by an appropriate amount. This allows compensating instruments to play with accurate intonation in the octave below their open second partial, which is critical for tubas and euphoniums in much of their repertoire.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{compares the}} heat transfer performance of four different {{shell and tube}} gas coolers implemented in a 5 kW, R 744 water/water heat pump controlled by a <b>back</b> pressure <b>valve</b> as expansion device. The tubes bundle consists of 10 tubes in a 30 ° arrangement for all the gas coolers with different tube geometries: smooth, corrugated, internally grooved, and corrugated and internally grooved, respectively. The results were carried out at fixed gas cooler inlet water temperature of around 25 °C and by imposing two inlet gas cooling pressures: 8 MPa and 10 MPa, and by varying the water flow rate from 340 to 786 l h- 1. A step-by-step procedure for the simulation of the heat transfer cooling process of the carbon dioxide in shell and tubes gas coolers is proposed and validated, allowing for a direct comparison of the heat transfer performance of the shell and tube gas coolers...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} substances as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) used {{as working}} fluids in the vapour compression plants {{have to be}} replaced by new substances because of their ozone depletion potential and their greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is non-toxic, non-flammable, has zero ozone depletion potential and negligible global warming potential as refrigerant. Referring to a transcritical CO 2 cycle working as a classical ‘‘splitsystem’’ to cool air in residential applications, the aim of this paper is the evaluation of the energy performances using an internal heat exchanger. The experimental plant employs a semi-hermetic compressor, plate-finned tube type heat exchangers, a <b>back</b> pressure <b>valve</b> electronically controlled and an expansion valve. Besides it is possible to control the flash gas produced in the liquid receiver thanks to another semi-hermetic compressor linked to an inverter. An increase of the coefficient of performance has been found using the internal heat exchanger. The comparison of the coefficients of performance of two cycles, working with and without the internal heat exchanger, is discussed...|$|R

The fluids exiting the core holder were received by the back pressure pump operated at constant pressure receive mode, so that a constant back pressure is maintained. Confining pressure was kept at 25  MPa for all the experiments. Steady-state method was used in relative permeability measurements in accordance with experimental standard reference GB/T 28912 - 2012 and details presented in Online Resource B. 2. Capillary end effect (CEE) was corrected using the Intercept Method as proposed by Gupta and Maloney (2016). Effective permeabilities at a predetermined pore pressure were normalized by absolute permeability to water, Ka (please refer to Table  5), measured at the same pore pressure, to obtain relative permeabilities.|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} carbon dioxide (R 744) as a valid alternative to classical substances such as HFCs used in vapour compression plants. However a transcritical refrigeration cycle is needed because the critical temperature {{of carbon dioxide}} is usually near the ambient temperature. Consequently the carbon dioxide refrigerator performances are significantly influenced by the heat rejection pressure. In this paper an experimental investigation on working optimization for a "split-system" to cool air in residential applications is presented: by varying the heat rejection pressure an optimum working condition has been found at different ambient temperatures. Furthermore a simplified model to predict the optimum heat rejection pressure is shown and a comparison with experimental results is carried out. Both the model validation and the experimental {{results suggest that the}} heat rejection pressure optimization is an convenient method to improve the performance of a carbon dioxide split system. Finally an algorithm based on the aforementioned model has been proposed in order to control an electronic <b>back</b> pressure <b>valve</b> by means of a PLC.
