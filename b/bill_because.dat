5|$|The Honolulu Advertiser {{reported}} that the Senate Democratic leadership reconsidered {{their support for the}} <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> of the large demonstration of opponents and their pressure on senators to oppose the bill. It found that some senators privately suggested the bill's delay in committee or a proposed amendment to the bill were ways to avoid taking a vote following the controversy.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Oregon Legislature passed House Bill 3643, {{making the}} {{possession}} of less than an ounce of marijuana a Class C misdemeanor, which added a possible jail sentence of up to 30 days. According to Eric Schlosser of Rolling Stone, John Kitzhaber, then Oregon's governor, signed the <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> {{he did not want}} to appear soft on crime. Activists opposing HB 3643 collected twice as many signatures as were required to force a referendum on the bill. John Sperling, Peter Lewis, and George Soros were the principal financial backers of the referendum signature drive. Measure 57, which would have upheld HB 3643, was turned down by a margin of 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Main {{supporters}} of the bill were the LDP and the Komeito (CGP), while the opposition included the Social Democratic Party (SDPJ) and Communist Party (CPJ), who cited the connotations both symbols had with the war era. The CPJ was further opposed for not allowing the issue {{to be decided by}} the public. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) could not develop party consensus on it. President of the DPJ, Naoto Kan stated that the DPJ must support the <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> the party already recognized both symbols as the symbols of Japan. Deputy Secretary General and future prime minister Yukio Hatoyama thought that this bill would cause further divisions among society and the public schools.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, poorer {{countries}} with weaker currencies, such as Argentina or Ukraine, often have low-valued <b>bills</b> <b>because</b> of inflation having eroded their value.|$|R
5000|$|For {{companies}} using infrastructure hosted in the cloud, autoscaling {{can mean}} lower <b>bills,</b> <b>because</b> most cloud providers charge based on total usage rather than maximum capacity.|$|R
5000|$|During the American Revolutionary War the Continental Congress {{frequently}} issued <b>bills.</b> <b>Because</b> {{of inflation}} they rapidly declined in value, {{leading to the}} unfavorable comparison that something was [...] "not worth a Continental".|$|R

5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating {{that he had}} opposed the Korea <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> it did not include aid to Taiwan, and had {{supported}} it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as {{a supporter of the}} Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no credibility. In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
50|$|CPT II {{codes are}} billed in the {{procedure}} code field, just as CPT Category I codes are <b>billed.</b> <b>Because</b> CPT II codes are {{not associated with}} any relative value, they are billed with a $0.00 billable charge amount.|$|R
50|$|During {{the last}} three years the three leading {{container}} trade groups (Aluminum Association, the Glass Packaging Institute, and the Association of Postconsumer Plastic Recyclers) have changed their position and now support bottle <b>bills</b> <b>because</b> of the success of existing bottle bills.|$|R
30|$|Speaker 1 : It {{was really}} hard to keep {{retraining}} staff. They didn’t want to work there, why would you? …you couldn’t manage your <b>bills,</b> monthly <b>bills,</b> <b>because</b> one week you might work 25  h. The next week, you might work 18. I mean., it was awful. I -.|$|R
5|$|Urey {{actively}} campaigned {{against the}} 1946 May-Johnson <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> {{he feared that}} {{it would lead to}} military control of nuclear energy, but supported and fought for the McMahon bill that replaced it, and ultimately created the Atomic Energy Commission. Urey's commitment to the ideal of world government dated from before the war, but the possibility of nuclear war made it only more urgent in his mind. He went on lecture tours against war, and became involved in Congressional debates regarding nuclear issues. He argued publicly on behalf of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and was even called before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
5|$|While Daniels {{supported}} the legislation, {{he believed the}} Republican lawmakers should drop the <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> it {{was not part of}} their election platform and deserved a period of public debate. Republicans subsequently dropped the bill, but the Democratic lawmakers still refused to return to the capital, demanding additional bills be tabled, including a bill to create a statewide school voucher program. Their refusal to return left the Indiana General Assembly unable to pass any legislation, until three of the twelve bills they objected to were dropped from the agenda on March 28. The minority subsequently returned to the statehouse to resume their duties.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{component}} of Árbenz's project of modernization was his agrarian reform bill. Árbenz drafted the bill {{himself with the}} help of advisers that included some leaders of the communist party as well as non-communist economists. He also sought advice from numerous economists from across Latin America. The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 17 June 1952, and the program went into effect immediately. The focus of the program was on transferring uncultivated land from large landowners to their poverty stricken laborers, who would then be able to begin a viable farm of their own. Árbenz was also motivated to pass the <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> he needed to generate capital for his public infrastructure projects within the country. At the behest of the United States, the World Bank had refused to grant Guatemala a loan in 1951, which made the shortage of capital more acute.|$|E
50|$|In a {{unanimous}} opinion delivered by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the Court held that federal law controlled {{the interpretation of}} both <b>bills,</b> <b>because</b> they were maritime contracts and the dispute was not inherently local. The Court also held that the 11th Circuit misinterpreted the bills as not protecting Norfolk.|$|R
5000|$|The 2009 {{induction}} {{ceremony was}} overwhelmingly pro-Buffalo <b>Bills</b> <b>because</b> former teammate Bruce Smith and owner Ralph Wilson were both inducted.

50|$|Telecommunications billing is a {{significant}} component of any commercial communications service provider regardless specialization: telephone, mobile wireless communication, VoIP companies, mobile virtual network operators, internet service providers, transit traffic companies, cable television and satellite TV companies could not operate without <b>billing,</b> <b>because</b> it creates an economic value of their business.|$|R
25|$|Though a Democrat himself, {{outgoing}} President James Buchanan {{favored the}} <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> {{of the interests}} of his home state, Pennsylvania. He signed the bill into law as one of his last acts in office.|$|E
25|$|Speaking for the National Republicans for Environmental Protection Association, President Martha Marks {{said that}} the {{organization}} was disappointed in the <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> it did not support conservation enough, and continued to subsidize the well-established oil and gas industries that didn't require subsidizing.|$|E
25|$|Doctor Bibiloni was {{commissioned}} {{the writing of}} the draft, which would serve as an orientation for debates. Bibiloni finished in six years, but while he was working different books with the same purpose were being published, similar to Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield's <b>bill.</b> <b>Because</b> of this, the committee had started to have debates since 1926 and not 1932.|$|E
50|$|When Gross was in Congress, {{a special}} {{exception}} {{was made to}} the practice that bills offered in the House were numbered consecutively. The number H.R. 144 was reserved each session for one of Representative Gross's <b>bills</b> (<b>because</b> 144 equals one gross, making its title the arithmetical equivalent to his name).|$|R
50|$|In 1846 President James K. Polk, {{an admirer}} and {{follower}} of Jackson, vetoed the Rivers and Harbors Bill on similar grounds. Henry Clay and his Whig Party, by contrast, supported both the 1830 and 1846 <b>bills</b> <b>because</b> {{they believed the}} national government had a responsibility to promote trade commerce and economic modernization.|$|R
40|$|Microcomputer {{programs}} {{have been developed for}} interactive display and data processing of the mental status exam, the past history, treatment plans, progress notes, real time psychological testing, biofeedback training and accounting and <b>billing.</b> <b>Because</b> of their low cost ($ 3, 000 - $ 8, 000) these instruments can be useful in the psychiatrist's office practice...|$|R
25|$|Ryun {{generally}} supported George W. Bush's legislative agenda, {{voting to}} support it 89% of the time, average for a House member who was from the same party as the sitting President. In 2003, he voted against the $373 billion end-of-session spending <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> he considered it to be too costly and had come to Congress to support fiscal restraint.|$|E
25|$|A tram system {{known as}} the Milwaukee Connector was {{proposed}} and passed by the Common Council, but Mayor Tom Barrett vetoed the <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> of problems of cost and availability. A modern streetcar system, the Milwaukee Streetcar, is now being constructed to connect the Milwaukee Intermodal Station, downtown Milwaukee, and Ogden Avenue, at a projected cost of$122million. The line is expected to open in mid-2018.|$|E
25|$|On {{foreign affairs}} and defence issues, Touche opposed the reform of {{government}} in India (his wife {{was the daughter of}} an Indian colonial administrator). In 1937 he joined with others including Admiral Roger Keyes and Brendan Bracken in urging rejection of the Finance <b>Bill</b> <b>because</b> of its proposal for a 'National Defence Contribution', a separate tax on the most profitable businesses to pay for rearmament. He backed Neville Chamberlain in the Norway Debate of 1940.|$|E
50|$|The {{team was}} nicknamed the Bickering <b>Bills</b> <b>because</b> of {{a rash of}} {{internal}} conflicts within the team. During a Monday Night loss to the Denver Broncos, Jim Kelly could be seen yelling at wide receiver Chris Burkett; it would be Burkett's last game with the team, as he was released shortly after the game.|$|R
50|$|The {{time value}} {{of money is}} {{reflected}} in the interest rate that a bank offers for deposit accounts, and also in the interest rate that a bank charges for a loan such as a home mortgage. The “risk-free” rate on US dollar investments is the rate on U.S. Treasury <b>bills,</b> <b>because</b> this is the highest rate available without risking capital.|$|R
50|$|During the House and Senate {{committee}} {{hearings on}} these bills, Committee Chairs and Ranking Members described a tight legislative {{schedule for the}} <b>bills</b> <b>because</b> of the election year's short Congressional schedule. Sponsors had delayed introduction of the bills as they vainly awaited agreement between the CFTC and SEC on how to regulate the single stock futures contemplated by the PWG Report. That issue dominated the hearings.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to this bill, the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, announced a community consultation process, which resulted in over 74,000 respondents participating, 64 percent of whom voted in favour of a trial, and 63 percent of whom were in favour of holding a referendum. The decision announced by the Premier on 7 June 2010 was that her Government would not support the <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> rural Queenslanders were overwhelmingly opposed to DST. The Bill was defeated in Queensland Parliament on 15 June 2011.|$|E
25|$|Connolly {{has voted}} for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, the {{supplemental}} appropriations bill that established Cash for Clunkers, and the Cash for Clunkers Extension. Additionally, he voted {{for all of the}} 2010 governmental appropriations bills, and he {{voted for the}} Continuing Appropriations Act for 2011. However, he has voted against some large spending bills, including opposing the release of $350billion in bank bailout funds and a $154billion spending <b>bill</b> <b>because</b> of concerns these would add to the federal deficit.|$|E
25|$|Vassar adopted {{coeducation}} in 1969. However, {{immediately following}} World War II, Vassar accepted {{a very small}} number of male students on the G.I. <b>Bill.</b> <b>Because</b> Vassar's charter prohibited male matriculants, the graduates were given diplomas via the University of the State of New York. These were reissued under the Vassar title after the school formally became co-educational. The formal decision to become co-ed came after its trustees declined an offer to merge with Yale University, its sibling institution, in the wave of mergers between the historically all-male colleges of the Ivy League and their Seven Sisters counterparts.|$|E

50|$|A {{software}} update was applied on 19 June 2012 to RBS's CA-7 software which controls its payment processing system. It later emerged that the update was corrupted by RBS technical staff. Customers' wages, payments and other transactions were disrupted. Some customers {{were unable to}} withdraw cash using ATMs or to see bank account details. Others faced fines for late payment of <b>bills</b> <b>because</b> the system could not process direct debits.|$|R
60|$|This dinner {{proved a}} turning point in the life of the poorhouse youth. Mr. Wadsworth had lost a son by death, and Dave {{reminded}} him strongly of his boy.
