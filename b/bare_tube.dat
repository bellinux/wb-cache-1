50|$|WR3A is a Fair Trade {{association}} (tradename Fair Trade Recycling reserved in 2013) {{established to}} improve the export markets for surplus electronics and e-waste. WR3A was conceived in 2006 following a visit to China by a group including a USA electronics recycler (American Retroworks Inc.), a University of California Davis recycling program director, and a Seattle recycler with a zero-export policy. The group visited three of China's semi knock down factories. Those factories purchased USA computer monitors which still have functional CRTs. The CRTs are knocked down to the <b>bare</b> <b>tube,</b> which is inserted into a new TV or monitor case, complete with new tuner board, etc. WR3A founders observed that the junk CRTs imported into China's Guiyu province were leftovers of functional CRTs purchased by the factories. While the Chinese government, which invested and owns new CRT manufacturing factories, shut many of these operations down as gray market activities in 2006, many of the assembly factories were relocated to other countries.|$|E

On initial stage of fouling formation it can be described by “threshold model” proposed for <b>bare</b> <b>tubes</b> and tubes with enhanced heat transfer by Yang and Crittenden.

Therefore the effect of using fins in this study {{as well as some}} operational parameters is considered. The motivation {{of this study is to}} design and construct a novel storage unit and to compare it with a finless heat exchanger. A series of experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of increasing the inlet temperature and flow rate on the charging and discharging processes of the phase change material. It is shown that, using fins in phase change process enhances melting and solidification procedures. The trend of this variation is different for the heat exchangers; increasing the inlet temperature for the <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchanger more effectively lowers melting time. Similarly, flow rate variation varies the solidification time more intensely for the <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchanger...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of orientation on heat transfer coefficients of single care and finned tubes in a fluidized bed. Bare and finned tubes were studied at five angles each: 0 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 90 ° with respect to the horizontal. Studies were made in a 12 -in. diameter plastic vessel using three sizes of glass beads as the bed:. 0185,. 0080, and. 0045 in. in diameter. Heat was supplied by the use of electrical heaters inserted inside the tubes. It was found that in the case of the finned tube, the heat transfer coefficients in the vertical position were approximately 15 to 2 O % lower than the coefficients in the horizontal position. Effectiveness factors of the finned tube were between 0. 1 and O. 4. <b>Bare</b> <b>tube</b> coefficients were found less sensitive to orientation. However, a minimum value was observed at 45 ° for each particle size.

By addition of n-dodecylthiol, the separation of oxidized tubes with Au NP (Au-ox-SWNT) from tubes devoid of Au NP (<b>bare</b> <b>tubes,</b> b-SWNT) was achieved.

40|$|Enhanced heat {{transfer}} tubes (EHTT) with segmented mesh-conical frustums are considered. Tube diameter and frustum apex angle are fixed as 20 mm and 60 o, respectively. The height ratio of frustum and sliced part are set as a golden ratio (1. 618). Laminar thermal-hydraulic performance {{and effects of}} some parameters, e. g., bottom frustum diameter and pitch, are numerically simulated. The equal equivalent diameter and total flow area criteria are adopted to simplify 3 D mesh pores to 2 D ones. Flow and temperature fields show large velocities and gradients close {{to the wall and}} smaller velocities in the bulk region. This enhances {{heat transfer}} with a limited pressure drop. EHTTs obtain 1. 4 - 3. 3 times higher heat transfer than <b>bare</b> <b>tubes</b> and the performance evaluation criterion (PEC) varies from 1. 3 to 1. 8.

50|$|Raster {{monitors}} {{are easier}} to service than vector monitors. Normally, unless the main tube is blown, a raster monitor will provide good display characteristics with perhaps a few minor color adjustments. Vector monitors, on the other hand, can be challenging or very costly to service, and some can't be repaired at all (they have dwindled in use since the 1980s and parts {{are hard to come}} by). Sometimes they will have to be replaced completely, but even finding replacement monitors is difficult since few, if any, are produced any longer. Bare new CRTs are still available from some suppliers (vector monitors use the same basic tube as a raster, just with different electronics), but as they are <b>bare</b> <b>tubes</b> they usually require the yoke to be removed from the old tube and fitted to the new tube and setting up, which isn't usually a job that can be undertaken by the amateur arcade collector. Retrofitting other monitor technologies to emulate vector graphics can also be done.|$|R
40|$|Maya {{crude oil}} fouling reveals a {{straightforward}} dependency of initial fouling rate on surface temperature but a rather complex dependency on velocity in bare tubes, the initial fouling rate showing a maximum and then decreasing significantly towards zero as the velocity is increased. Surface shear stress clearly {{is an important}} parameter. CFD simulation of fluid flow in a tube fitted with a hiTRAN insert reveals a complex distribution of surface shear stress. To compare the insert situation with the <b>bare</b> <b>tube,</b> an equivalent velocity concept is introduced {{on the basis that}} at a given average velocity the fluid flow results in the same average wall shear stress regardless of whether the tube is bare or is fitted with an insert. Using the equivalent velocity concept, the fouling data obtained using both a <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> and a tube fitted with inserts can be correlated using a single model. Moreover, the fouling threshold conditions below which fouling is negligible, can be predicted for both situations...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} heat transfer performance of a single horizontal <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> and a variety of finned tubes immersed in a shallow air fluidized bed. Results of experimental investigations with the <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> indicate that the tube position in the bed influences its performance narticularly where fine bed materials are used. In some cases the maximum heat transfer is obtained with the tube in the particle cloud just above the dense phase fluidized bed - a phenomenon that has not been previously observed. This was attributed to the unusual particle circulation in shallow beds. The data is also {{presented in}} dimensionless correlations which may be useful for design purposes. A close approximation to the <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> data can be obtained by using thetransient heating of a spherical robe and this provides a valuable way of accumulating a lot of data very rapidly. The experimental data on finned tubes shows that a fin spacing less than twenty times the average particle diameter can cause a significant reduction in heat transfer due to the interaction which takes place between the particles and the surface of the fins. Furthermore, evidence is provided to show that particle shape plays an important part in the interaction with spherical particles being superior to angular particles at low fin spacing/particle diameter ratio. The finned tube data is less sensitive to tube position in the bed than bare tubes and the best performance is when the tube is positioned at the distributor. A reduction in bed depth decreases the thermal performance of the finned tube but in many practical installations the reduction in pressure drop might more than comnensate for the reduced heat flux. Information is also provided on the theoretical uerformance of fins and the effect of the root contact area between the fins and the tube was investigated...|$|E

The crushing characteristics between the honeycomb-filled CFRP <b>tubes</b> and the <b>bare</b> CFRP <b>tubes</b> were compared. The influence of the cell width of aluminum honeycomb on the failure mechanism and crashworthiness characteristics of the filled CFRP tubes was further analyzed. Three distinct failure modes, classified as stable progressive end-crushing (I), unstable local buckling (II) and collapse in the mid-length (III), were observed during the crushing tests.

Compared with <b>bare</b> <b>tubes,</b> EA. hy 926 with rTf decreased the rate of thrombin formation, ITS accumulation, {{and the production of}} fibrinopeptide A. These phenomena occurred with increased rates of factor Va (fVa) inactivation by cleavages at R 506 and R 306. Thus, EA. hy 926 provides thrombin-dependent protein C activation and APC fVa inactivation. Comparisons of rTf with LPS-THP- 1 showed that the latter gave reduced rates for TAT formation but equivalent fibrinopeptide A, and fV activation/inactivation. In the presence of EA. hy 926, the reverse was obtained; with the surrogate endothelium and LPS-THP- 1 the rates of TAT generation, fibrinopeptide release, and fV activation were almost doubled, whereas cleavage at R 306 was equivalent. These observations suggest cooperativity between the 2 cell surrogates. These data suggest that the use of these 2 cell lines provides a reproducible quasi-endothelial quasi-inflammatory cytokine-stimulated monocyte system that provides a method to evaluate the variations in blood phenotype against the background of stable inflammatory cell activator and a stable vascular endothelial surrogate...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental demonstration {{of a chemical}} reactor design based on film boiling using aqueous mixtures of ethylene glycol. Termed a Film Boiling Reactor (FIBOR), the reactor volume is established around a horizontal heater tube (Nickel Alloy-Inconel 600) that is immersed in the aqueous bulk liquid. Chemical reactions are promoted within the vapor layer due to large temperature gradients inherent to film boiling. Product gas flow rates and chemical composition are analyzed to assess {{the extent that the}} FIBOR can promote chemical change of the reactant liquid mixture. Catalytic reaction and thermal decomposition (pyrolysis) in the FIBOR are investigated by using a catalyst coated tube and a <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> respectively. The heater tube surface temperature is the central operating parameter. Pure ethylene glycol is examined and compared to previously reported results to assess the role of the heater diameter. This work extends the FIBOR concept to aqueous mixtures of ethylene glycol to explore if the FIBOR is capable of promoting steam reforming chemistry. The results show that the FIBOR has the potential to support both catalytic and thermal decomposition of aqueous ethylene glycol mixtures. Diluting ethylene glycol with water decreases the reaction of ethylene glycol but it also reduces the effects of carbon deposition or "coking. " Peak product yields for thermal decomposition of pure ethylene glycol and aqueous mixtures of 90 % (vol) and 80 % (vol) ethylene glycol reached 4. 5, 1. 8 and 0. 8 LPM/min[MIDDLE DOT]m 2 respectively at an operating temperature of 1475 K. Results for platinum and nickel based coatings converting an 80 % (vol) ethylene glycol aqueous mixture achieved product yields approximately 3 - 4 times higher than the case for a <b>bare</b> <b>tube,</b> however platinum showed slightly better overall performance with respect to product yields and resistance to deactivation. Thermochemical and gas chromatography analysis revealed the FIBOR's capability to convert organic aqueous mixtures through steam reforming. An upward shift in the boiling curve for the catalyst coated tubes was determined to be due to the endothermic nature of the chemical mechanism. Conversion of aqueous mixtures with a <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> produced synthesis gas (syngas) with a lower ratio of H 2 :CO (1 : 1) compared to catalytic conversion which resulted in a significant enrichment of syngas products with hydrogen (H 2 :CO= 3).

40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental demonstration {{of a chemical}} reactor based on film boiling. Film boiling is established around a horizontal tube that is immersed in a bulk organic reactant pool of pure methanol and ethylene glycol. Chemical reactions are promoted within the vapor layer due to a high temperature inherent to film boiling. Product gases are measured and analyzed to illustrate {{the efficacy of the}} reactor. Catalytic reactions using a platinum catalyst coating and thermal decomposition for a <b>bare</b> <b>tube</b> are investigated. The heater tube surface temperature is the primary parameter and results at various sub-coolings are reported. Experimental results show the feasibility of film boiling to affect chemical change of methanol and ethylene glycol through catalytic and thermal decomposition. Catalytic conversion of methanol and ethylene glycol are observed below the heater temperature of approximately 1300 K to avoid possible catalyst sintering at a higher temperature. Thermal decomposition of methanol and ethylene glycol started at approximately 1250 K and 1050 K respectively. The primary product is synthesis gas and is near stoichiometric proportions for methanol with a small quantity of CH 4 produced. For ethylene glycol, condensable by-products are found as well as gaseous products of CH 4, C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 4 suggesting various secondary reactions. Boiling curves are also reported which show higher fluxes with a catalyst compared to a <b>bare</b> <b>tube.</b> Conversion efficiency is estimated by an energy rate balance on the control volume of the vapor film. The calculated efficiency resulted in the maximum conversion of 40 % for methanol and 27 % for ethylene glycol.

As part of this analysis, a new solar field model was derived, based on measurement results of an LS- 2 Collector and accounting for various conditions of receiver tubes, lost mirrors and measured reflectivity. A comparison {{was made of the}} model results to real plant conditions for a winter and summer day in order to test the accuracy of the model. The effects of <b>bare</b> <b>tubes,</b> different wind speeds, mirror reflectivity and other factors were studied showing, e. g., that heat losses due to wind are predicted to be very low. The comparison also shows that the model still lacks the capability to fully account for actual solar field conditions. The model was also compared to the SOLERGY model, showing differences between the assumptions used in both models. Finally different operating conditions of the plant were studied for a summer, fall, and winter day to provide {{a better understanding of how}} changing solar field outlet temperatures affect gross and net output of the plant. This clearly indicates that the lowest possible superheating temperature maximizes the gross electric output. On a net basis this conclusion is modified due to the high parasitics of the HTF (heat transfer fluid) pumps. It was found that the optimum operating strategy depends on the insolation conditions, e. g., different superheating temperatures should be chosen in summer, fall and winter. If the pressure drop in the solar field is reduced due to replacement of flex hoses with ball joints, increasing the HTF flow is more reasonable, so that at low isolation conditions the lowest possible superheating temperature also leads to the maximum net output...|$|R
