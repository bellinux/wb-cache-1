5|$|In 2011 An FDA panel voted {{unanimously}} to recommend approval of florbetapir, which is currently used in an investigational study. The imaging agent can help to detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made available commercially.|$|E
5|$|Members of the General Assembly {{are elected}} from districts that are realigned every ten years. Representatives serve terms {{of two years}} and {{senators}} serve terms of four years. Both houses can create bills, but bills must pass both houses <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> submitted to the governor and enacted into law.|$|E
5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5000|$|Equipment that {{requires}} laying <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used accurately includes: ...|$|R
50|$|It has a farinaceous {{smell and}} taste. Older {{specimens}} are often eaten by slugs, and the stem is recommended to <b>be</b> removed <b>before</b> cooking. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> pickled.|$|R
50|$|The {{generalized}} equation {{relies on}} a number of other variables which need to <b>be</b> calculated <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> itself <b>be</b> calculated. These equations have the solar-earth constants substituted with angular constants expressed in degrees.|$|R
5|$|After {{the first}} level, the rocket stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, the rocket resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling {{back to the first}} after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hugh LeMessurier and Brian Andrew Hills {{published}} their paper, A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggested that decompression following schedules based on conventional models results in asymptomatic bubble formation which must then be re-dissolved at the decompression stops <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> eliminated. This is slower than allowing the gas to be eliminated while it is still in solution, and indicates the importance of minimising bubble phase gas for efficient decompression.|$|E
5000|$|Entering October, Haynes finds new lodgings with Ella's help, {{and this}} leaves Rouse and Atwell as the caretakers {{of the house}} <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> legally <b>be</b> sold. (Gomes new {{neighbour}} and Mr. Rojas are taking over Rouse's declining cake business.) ...|$|R
30|$|Clearly, if the SBS {{receives}} ACKs {{from all}} SU-Rx <b>before</b> tout, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> considered {{as the best}} channel condition. On the other hand, the SBS may not transmit the common packet successfully to all SU-Rx due to the fading environment.|$|R
50|$|Sun is a kid's entertainer, {{but other}} than Hi-5, she seems to specialise in funk, rock, jazz and hip hop fusion. As she has {{performed}} and worked with the Rogue Traders <b>before,</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> assumed that she partakes in contemporary rock as well.|$|R
5|$|The game's storyline {{focuses on}} {{a young man named}} Wander who enters a {{forbidden}} land. Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi. Shadow of the Colossus {{has been described as a}} puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified and exploited <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> defeated.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty about which forms of psychosocial and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective. Psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self-harm {{and as a result}} self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems. Many people who self-harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used. There is tentative evidence for the medication flupentixol; however, greater study is required <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> recommended.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a mirror in creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
50|$|The Mi Note's one-handed mode is {{also found}} on the Mi Note Pro, and must be enabled in Settings <b>before</b> use. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{activated}} by swiping {{to the left or}} right from the home button, at which point the screen size <b>can</b> <b>be</b> configured to 3.5, 4 or 4.5 inches.|$|R
60|$|First, To {{be assured}} that nature, in the {{production}} of things, always designs them to partake of certain regulated established essences, which are to be the models of all things to be produced. This, in that crude sense it is usually proposed, would need some better explication, <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> fully <b>be</b> assented to.|$|R
5000|$|... (5.) To fix irrevocably on {{the people}} this oligarchy {{in the name of}} free {{institutions}} so that no future Legislature <b>can</b> reform <b>it</b> even by absolute majority. The Legislative Council has the hardihood to propose passing this unconstitutional and anti-British measure with only a few days notice, and <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> possibly <b>be</b> considered by the colonists at large.|$|R
25|$|Officers {{have access}} to a huge range of {{additional}} equipment for specialist operations, some of which requires training <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|E
25|$|The direct {{oxidation}} {{of primary}} alcohols to carboxylic acids normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an aldehyde hydrate (R-CH(OH)2) by reaction with water <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study found}} that two types of miRNA inhibit the E2F1 protein, which regulates cell proliferation. miRNA appears to bind to {{messenger}} RNA <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> translated to proteins that switch genes on and off.|$|E
50|$|Household water {{treatment}} {{a means to}} improve quality of water <b>before</b> consumption. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> implemented under a self-supply approach, but also under other approaches. The most ubiquitous method of household {{water treatment}} {{in the world is}} boiling. Other methods that have been advocated are point-of-use chlorination, SODIS, and various types of water filters.|$|R
5000|$|Aquadag {{consists}} of a dispersion of colloidal graphite in distilled water. [...] It is provided in concentrated paste form and is usually diluted with distilled water to a desired consistency <b>before</b> application. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> applied by brushing, swabbing, spraying, or dipping, after which the surface is dried, leaving a layer of pure graphite.|$|R
50|$|Walnut ink is an ink {{made from}} the green husk {{surrounding}} the nut of walnuts. The Black Walnut Juglans nigra is usually used. The ink may be liquid or made of crystals that are mixed with water <b>before</b> use. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to produce stains and darken paper {{to make it look}} older.|$|R
25|$|For {{many types}} of reuse {{applications}} wastewater must pass through numerous sewage treatment process steps <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used. Steps might include screening, primary settling, biological treatment, tertiary treatment (for example reverse osmosis), and disinfection.|$|E
25|$|In the US, contact lens {{manufacturers}} {{must prove}} to the FDA that a lens is safe <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sold to the public. Typically, the prescribing doctor instructs patients to follow the same limitations used during those studies. This included wear time and replacement schedule.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an urgent bill, the time that must have expired <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> deemed to have been {{approved}} by the Seanad may be abridged by the Government (cabinet) with the concurrence of the President (this does not apply to bills to amend the constitution).|$|E
50|$|Incremental lists {{typically}} have no structure and new items {{are added to}} the bottom of the list as they come up. If the list is compiled immediately <b>before</b> use, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> organized by store layout (e.g. frozen foods are grouped together on the list) to minimize time in the store. Preprinted lists <b>can</b> <b>be</b> similarly organized.|$|R
40|$|Parents of {{patients}} with Down's syndrome show dermatoglyphic features intermediate between the affected and the normal population. Dermatoglyphs were studied on the parents of 19 cases of trisomy 18, but no similar "intermediate" traits were discovered. The number of cases studied needs to <b>be</b> enlarged <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> definitely <b>be</b> stated that trisomies 18 and 21 differ in this respect...|$|R
5000|$|The Restlet {{framework}} {{is composed of}} two main parts. First, there is the [...] "Restlet API", a neutral API supporting the concepts of REST and facilitating the handling of calls for both client-side and server-side applications. This API must be supported by a Restlet implementation <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> effectively <b>be</b> used. Multiple implementations could be provided (open source projects or commercial products).|$|R
25|$|Because {{of these}} factors and more, fMRI {{evidence}} has been excluded from any form of legal system. The testing is too uncontrolled and unpredictable. Therefore, it has been stated that fMRI has much more testing to do <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> considered viable in the eyes the legal system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> decided which {{method of}} cost-finding {{may be used}} in any {{particular}} plant, the manufacturing departments of the plant must be classified. In some industries the order method of cost-finding might be applicable to certain departments, and the process method of cost-finding might be applicable to the remaining departments (see diagram IV).|$|E
25|$|Each {{motorway}} in England {{requires that}} a Statutory Instrument be published, detailing {{the route of}} the road, <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> built. The dates given on these Statutory Instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is an incomplete list of the Statutory Instruments relating to {{the route of the}} M60.|$|E
