5|$|As part of {{the third}} stage of General Sir Herbert Plumer's Passchendaele offensive, an attack against Broodseinde was {{scheduled}} for 4 October 1917. The 3rd Australian Division's 10th Australian Infantry Brigade {{was one of the}} assault formations charged with delivering the main <b>blow,</b> <b>and</b> ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge. To provide defence against low-flying German aircraft during the attack, a group of 24 men, including Peeler, from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade's 37th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Reubens {{decided to}} take a sabbatical from Pee-wee. In July 1991, Reubens was arrested for indecent {{exposure}} in an adult theater in Sarasota, Florida. The arrest set off a chain reaction of national media attention that changed the general public's view of Reubens and Pee-wee. The arrest postponed Reubens' involvement in major projects until 1999 when he appeared in several big-budget projects including Mystery Men and <b>Blow</b> <b>and</b> started giving interviews as himself rather than as Pee-wee.|$|E

5|$|A {{subject of}} {{on-going}} {{research is the}} formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya. A working hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing <b>blow,</b> <b>and</b> some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Around 2012, {{development}} of The Witness for the next-generation of consoles with improved hardware capabilities became a possibility, and <b>Blow</b> <b>and</b> his team {{started looking at}} this opportunity. They had discounted the Wii U, again citing low specs, and decided {{to choose between the}} PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One platform. At the time of this decision, Sony was able to provide hardware information and development kits. Sony has also sought out independent developers like Blow to learn about the upcoming PlayStation 4 in preparation for its launch, while Microsoft had not yet released firm specifications for their console. Blow opted to go with the PlayStation platform; this decision was also aided by representatives from Sony that were interested in bringing the game to their system, and a larger trend of Sony to bring more downloadable and independently-developed games to their next console in contrast to Microsoft's tighter controls. Blow affirmed that there was no monetary deal involved with this decision. Blow also later acknowledged that he has had difficulties working with Microsoft in the past, and had previously explained several of the issues he had to go through with Microsoft to release his earlier game, Braid. The Witness had been planned as a launch-window title for the PlayStation 4 in 2013, a time-limited console exclusive. The Windows and iOS versions, at this point, were planned to be released alongside the PlayStation 4 version, barring any development delays that <b>Blow</b> <b>and</b> his team encountered. Other console versions would come later, if they opted to develop for them.|$|E
5|$|Hardy next {{competed in}} the SmackDown! King of the Ring tournament, losing to {{eventual}} winner Booker T in the opening round thanks to a low <b>blow</b> <b>and</b> distraction from Sharmell. Hardy also became {{the first man to}} defeat Mr. Kennedy in singles' competition. On July 25, after the SmackDown! taping, Hardy was taken out of action after doctors found the remnants of the staph infection that had plagued him the previous year. He was sidelined until August 25 while he healed. Hardy made a surprise appearance backstage at Unforgiven after Jeff's match against Johnny Nitro. Lita joined the two in the segment, making this the first time the three had been seen together on WWE television since February 2003.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the opposition control method proposed by Choi et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 262, 75 (1994) ] has been studied using direct numerical simulations. In this study, {{the effects of the}} amplitude and the phase of wall <b>blowing</b> <b>and</b> suction control input were considered separately. It is found that the amplitude of wall <b>blowing</b> <b>and</b> suction as well as the detection plane location {{played an important role in}} active control for skin-friction drag reduction. By changing the amplitude, a substantial drag reduction was achieved for all detection plane locations considered, and the efficiency of the opposition control was also improved. When the control was effective, the drag reduction was proportional to the wall <b>blowing</b> <b>and</b> suction strength. There existed a maximum wall <b>blowing</b> <b>and</b> suction strength, beyond which the opposition control became less effective or even unstable. Turbulence characteristics affected by various wall <b>blowing</b> <b>and</b> suction parameters were analyzed to understand the underlying mechanisms for drag reduction. The wall-normal velocity and vorticity fluctuations showed a strong correlation with drag reduction. © 2011 American Institute of Physic...|$|R
5|$|In France, organ music {{developed}} during the Baroque era through the music of Jean Titelouze, François Couperin, and Nicolas de Grigny. Because the French organ of the 17th and early 18th centuries was very standardized, a conventional set of registrations developed for its repertoire. The music of French composers (and Italian composers such as Girolamo Frescobaldi) was written for use during the Mass. Very little secular organ music was composed in France and Italy during the Baroque period; the written repertoire is almost exclusively intended for liturgical use. In England, composers such as John <b>Blow</b> <b>and</b> John Stanley wrote multi-sectional free works for liturgical use called voluntaries through the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, the Kurdish irregulars confronted Aqil's irregulars and Bedouin allies at the Horns of Hattin, {{near the}} village of Hattin. For the most part, both sides were armed with swords and spears and to a lesser extent, rifles, rather than the modern {{weaponry}} at the Ottoman military's disposal. Initially, the battle was going in Shamdin's favor and a portion of Aqil's troops began to flee. However, Salih Agha, Aqil's brother, led his group in a surprise attack against the Kurds. As a result, Shamdin's forces were dealt a decisive <b>blow</b> <b>and</b> commander Hasan Agha was among the 150 fatalities of that battle.|$|E
5|$|The Witness {{uses its}} own engine {{developed}} by <b>Blow</b> <b>and</b> his team, which took {{a significant portion}} of the development time. Blow was insistent on using his own game engine instead of an existing solution such as Unity, as he would be able to fully control every element of a game engine that he created himself. As a compact game world compared to open-world games, the whole of the island of The Witness was treated as one zone, simplifying the gameplay and engine development. This presented a secondary challenge to the team as to concurrently work on the project, they needed to find a means to allow multiple developers to edit areas without resorting to using locking on their version control system as well as being able to work without being connected to a central server. <b>Blow</b> <b>and</b> his team developed an unconventional means of serializing the game world into text files that would have revision control while at the same time making it easy for individuals to discover conflicting edits. They also converted the 10,000-some entities in the game world into their own individual files for tracking to further reduce conflict between edits. Other features of this system including using defined control points for terrain elements to automatically recalculate seamless connections between them within the game's rendering engine, and a built-in world editor within the game engine to easily access existing serialized elements and create new ones.|$|E

5|$|Using the Blue Sphere to {{continue}} up the tower, the party {{comes to a}} world of clouds, dominated by Byak-ko and an army of thugs. They learn that Byak-ko recently wiped out an underground resistance movement, except for Millie and Jeanne, the two daughters of its leader. The party temporarily joins Byak-ko's gang to find the girls, and attempt to defend them until Millie betrays Jeanne and the party is captured. Breaking free, they confront the fiend, who tries to kill Millie; Jeanne takes the <b>blow</b> <b>and</b> the party engages the fiend. They defeat him, recover the White Sphere, and continue their journey.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1940, {{high-ranking}} German officials {{drafted a}} memorandum {{on the dangers}} of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They said Ukraine, Belorussia and the Baltic States would end up as only a further economic burden for Germany. It was argued that the Soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless and that the occupation would not benefit Germany. Hitler disagreed with economists about the risks and told his right-hand man Hermann Göring, the chief of the Luftwaffe, that he would no longer listen to misgivings about the economic dangers of a war with Russia. It is speculated that this was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for Germany {{in the event of an}} invasion of the Soviet Union unless its economy was captured intact and the Caucasus oilfields seized in the first <b>blow,</b> <b>and</b> he consequently revised his future report to fit Hitler's wishes. The Red Army's ineptitude in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–40 convinced Hitler of a quick victory within a few months. Neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter, and therefore adequate preparations, such as the distribution of warm clothing and winterization of vehicles and lubricants, were not made.|$|E
5|$|Raszagal was the matriarch of the Nerazim on Shakuras, {{and mother}} to Vorazun. The {{character}} appears in Brood War, {{where she is}} voiced by Debra DeLiso, and in the novel Shadow Hunters. Described {{as one of the}} oldest living Protoss and imbued with tremendous psychic powers, {{she is one of the}} few to clearly remember the Protoss homeworld from before the exile of the Nerazim. During her youth, Raszagal was important in ensuring the dark templar were only exiled, rather than exterminated. In Brood War, Raszagal directs Zeratul and Artanis to cleanse the Zerg from Shakuras and welcomes Sarah Kerrigan as an ally in their mission. This spurs Aldaris to rebellion; Raszagal consequently orders his death. Kerrigan and Samir Duran later kidnap Raszagal from Shakuras, using her to blackmail Zeratul into killing the second Overmind. It quickly becomes apparent that Kerrigan has mentally subverted Raszagal and has been using her to manipulate events from the beginning. Zeratul captures Raszagal, but is unable to hold off the Zerg forces long enough to escape. Realizing that the matriarch is beyond redemption from Kerrigan's influence, Zeratul kills Raszagal. Raszagal's mind is freed by the lethal <b>blow,</b> <b>and</b> she dies thanking Zeratul for releasing her, naming him as her successor as leader of the dark templar.|$|E

5|$|While Marlborough {{fought in}} the Low Countries a series of {{personal}} and party rivalries instigated a general reversal of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Godolphin. As a price for supporting {{the government in the}} next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading member of their Junto, the Earl of Sunderland (Marlborough's son-in-law), to the post of Secretary of State. The Queen, who loathed Sunderland and the Junto, and who refused to be dominated by any single party, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had little room for manoeuvre. With Sarah's tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig demands. In despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office; but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe <b>blow</b> <b>and</b> she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite – Sarah's cousin, Abigail Masham. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Harley, who, convinced that the duumvirate's policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.|$|E
5|$|With about 10seconds left in {{the tenth}} round, Judah hit Mayweather with a low <b>blow</b> <b>and</b> {{followed}} it with a right hand {{to the back of}} Mayweather's head. As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain, Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period. Mayweather's uncle and trainer, Roger Mayweather, climbed into the ring and approached Judah. Yoel Judah entered the ring and threw a punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued. More than a dozen security officers and police officers rushed into the ring and managed to control the situation. After the ring was cleared, Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight. Mayweather cruised through the last two rounds {{on his way to a}} unanimous decision victory by scores of 116–112, 117–111 and 119–109.|$|E
5|$|However, Purcell's music (and with it The Fairy-Queen) was resuscitated by {{two related}} movements: a growing {{interest}} in Baroque music {{and the rise of}} the countertenor, led by pioneers such as Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin. The former movement led to performances of long-neglected composers such as Purcell, John Dowland, John <b>Blow</b> <b>and</b> even George Frideric Handel, while the latter complemented it by providing a way of making such performances as authentic as possible as regards the original music and the composer's intentions (less true for Handel, where countertenors appear as castrati replacements). This has led to The Fairy-Queen's increased popularity, and numerous recordings have been made, often using period instruments. The format of the work presents problems to modern directors, who must decide whether or not to present Purcell's music as part of the original play, which uncut is rather lengthy. Savage calculated a length of four hours. The decision to curtail the play is usually taken together with the resolution to modernise to such an extent that the cohesion between music, text and action sketched above is entirely lost, a criticism levelled at the English National Opera's 1995 production directed by David Pountney. The production was released on video the same year, and revived by the company in 2002. A bold approach was taken at the Brazilian Opera Company's 2000 staging by Luiz Päetow, with the libretto becoming unstuck in time.|$|E

5|$|On June 12 at Slammiversary IX, Anderson {{defeated}} Sting after {{interference from}} Eric Bischoff, a low <b>blow,</b> <b>and</b> a Mic Check {{to win the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the second time, turning heel in the process once again. On June 18, Anderson represented TNA at Mexican promotion AAA's Triplemanía XIX pay-per-view, where he and Abyss unsuccessfully challenged Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans for the AAA World Tag Team Championship in a steel cage match. At the tapings of the July 7 edition of Impact Wrestling, Immortal forced Anderson to choose whether he was with them or against them. In the main event of the evening, Anderson turned on Kurt Angle and joined Immortal. On July 11 at the tapings of the July 14 edition of Impact Wrestling, Anderson lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship back to Sting. On the July 28 edition of Impact Wrestling, Anderson faced Kurt Angle in a steel cage match, but was defeated following a distraction from fellow Immortal member Bully Ray. The {{tension between the two}} stablemates eventually led to a match on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, where Ray defeated Anderson with a low blow. On the following edition of Impact Wrestling, the rest of Immortal turned on Anderson and kicked him out of the group. Anderson returned on the August 25 edition of Impact Wrestling, attacking his former stablemates. On the September 8 edition of Impact Wrestling, Anderson challenged Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but the match ended in a disqualification following interference from Immortal. On September 11 at No Surrender, Anderson again failed to capture the title in a three-way match, which also included Sting. Anderson and Bully Ray settled their grudge on October 16 at Bound for Glory, where Anderson won a Falls Count Anywhere match. On November 13 at Turning Point, Anderson and Abyss defeated Ray and Scott Steiner in a tag team match, ending his year long storyline with Immortal.|$|E
5|$|Street & Smith, one of {{the longest}} {{established}} and most respected publishers, shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, partially {{as a result of the}} success of paperbacks. Standard continued with Startling and Thrilling, but the end came only a few years later. In 1954, Fredric Wertham published Seduction of the Innocent, a book in which he asserted that comics were inciting children to violence. A subsequent Senate subcommittee hearing led to a backlash against comics, and the publishers dropped titles in response. The financial impact spread to pulp magazines, since often a publisher would publish both. A 1955 strike by American News Corporation, the main distributor in the U.S., meant that magazines remained in warehouses and never made it to the newsstands; the unsold copies represented a significant financial <b>blow</b> <b>and</b> contributed to publishers' decisions to cancel magazines. Startling was {{one of the}} casualties. The schedule had already returned from monthly to bimonthly in 1953, and it became a quarterly in early 1954. Thrilling Wonder published its last issue in early 1955, and was then merged with Startling, as was Fantastic Story Magazine, another companion publication, but the combined magazine lasted only three more issues. Mines left the magazine at the end of 1954; he was succeeded for two issues by Theron Raines, who was followed by Herbert D. Kastle for the last two. The final issue was dated Fall 1955.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his <b>blow</b> <b>and</b> so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E
