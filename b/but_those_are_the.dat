2500|$|In 1984, Zappa {{prepared}} a remix of Cruising with Ruben & the Jets for its compact disc reissue and the vinyl box set The Old Masters I. The remix featured new rhythm tracks recorded by bassist Arthur Barrow and drummer Chad Wackerman, {{much as the}} 1984 remix of We're Only in It for the Money had featured. Zappa stated [...] "The master tapes for Ruben and the Jets were in better shape, but since I liked the results on We're Only in it For the Money, I {{decided to do it}} on Ruben too. <b>But</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> only two albums on which the original performances were replaced. I thought the important thing was the material itself." ...|$|E

50|$|Two {{free throws}} by Nykesha Sales, who scored 17 points, made it 57-55 with 3:16 left. <b>But</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> last {{points for the}} Sun, who {{appeared}} to wilt down the stretch.|$|R
50|$|He played nine matches for Auckland from 1943-44 to 1947-48 without {{establishing}} {{himself in}} the side. Batting in the middle order, he scored 110 against Otago in 1945-46, and 123 against Wellington in 1946-47, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only innings in which he reached 30.|$|R
6000|$|I {{laughed at}} this cross-examination. [...] "I keep a bull pup," [...] I said, [...] "and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I {{get up at}} all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am {{extremely}} lazy. I have another set of vices when I'm well, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> principal ones at present." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I bar the man. But that isn't why I'm {{giving you}} the tip {{to steer clear of}} him. There are dozens of chaps I bar who haven't an ounce of vice in them.

There are some others as well, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> worst of the lot. By the way, I forgot to ask, {{have you ever been to}} school before?' ...|$|E

50|$|A lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman and a right-arm off-spin bowler, Scott {{played for}} Somerset in non-first-class matches from 1879, but appeared {{in only two}} first-class games when the county club gained first-class status in 1882. He took two Lancashire wickets for 49 runs in 45 (four-ball) overs in Somerset's first-ever first-class match, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only wickets of his first-class career.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{a curious}} thing," [...] remarked Holmes, [...] "that a {{typewriter}} has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in {{the tail of the}} 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> more obvious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But the {{question}} is, {{how far can}} I consider him? There are times," [...] said Matt, and he reddened, and laughed consciously, [...] "when {{it seems as if}} I couldn't consider him at all; the times when I have some faint hope that she will listen to me, or won't think me quite a brute to speak to her of such a thing at such a moment. Then there are other times when I think he ought to be considered to the extreme of giving her up altogether; <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> times when I know that I shall never have her to give up. Then it's an easy sacrifice." ...|$|E

[...] "The moths are few that fear the flame, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> moths which live. Also I {{think that you have}} {{scorched}} your wings before and learned that fire hurts. Indeed, now I remember that I have heard of three such fires of love through which you have flown, Allan, though all of them are dead ashes now, or shine elsewhere. Two burned in your youth when a certain lady died to save you, a great woman that, is it not so? And the third, ah! she was fire indeed, though of a copper hue. What was her name? I cannot remember, but I think {{it had something to do}} with the wind, yes, with the wind when it wails." ...|$|E

50|$|In spring {{training}} of 1968, Hughes was warming {{up in the}} bullpen when he felt pain in his throwing shoulder. Though undiagnosed at the time, <b>the</b> injury <b>was</b> later determined to be a torn rotator cuff. At <b>the</b> time, there <b>was</b> no surgery to fix such an injury. Despite <b>the</b> injury, Hughes <b>was</b> able to pitch 63.2 innings during <b>the</b> 1968 season, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> last he would throw as the injury ultimately ended his major league career.|$|R
50|$|Mäkinen {{left the}} team for Subaru for 2002, so François Delecour and Alister McRae were signed to replace him and Loix, who had moved to Hyundai. Both {{struggled}} with the car though, McRae managed a fifth-place finish on Rally Sweden, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only points the team would score all season. The team finished last in the manufacturers' points, behind Skoda and Hyundai. Mitsubishi would not compete during the 2003 season as Mitsubishi restructured their motorsports activities.|$|R
60|$|I {{have just}} arrived from New York-been there ever since Christmas {{staying at the}} house of Dan Slote my Quaker City room-mate, and having a splendid time. Charley Langdon, Jack Van Nostrand, Dan and I, (all Quaker City night-hawks,) had a {{blow-out}} at Dan's' house and a lively talk over old times. We went through the Holy Land together, and I just laughed till my sides ached, at some of our reminiscences. It was the unholiest gang that ever cavorted through Palestine, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> best boys in the world. We needed Moulton badly. I started to make calls, New Year's Day, but I anchored for the day at the first house I came to--Charlie Langdon's sister was there (beautiful girl,) and Miss Alice Hooker, another beautiful girl, a niece of Henry Ward Beecher's. We sent the old folks home early, with instructions not to send the carriage till midnight, and then I just staid there and worried the life out of those girls. I am going to spend a few days with the Langdon's in Elmira, New York, as soon as I get time, and a few days at Mrs. Hooker's in Hartford, Conn., shortly.|$|E
60|$|I hope I am {{not being}} severe upon the verger, {{for he is}} a very {{necessary}} evil, if evil at all, in a place of such manifold and recondite interest; and in my next-to-last visit I found him most intelligibly accessible to my curiosity concerning those waxen effigies of royalty which used to be carried in the funeral processions of the English kings and queens. He bade us wait till he had dismissed all his flock but ourselves, and then, for a very little gratuitous money, he took us into some upper places where, suddenly, we stood in the presence of Queen Elizabeth and of William and Mary, as they had looked and dressed in life, and very startlingly lifelike in the way they showed unconscious of us. Doubtless there were others, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> ones I recall, and with their identity I felt the power that glared from the fierce, vain, shrewd, masterful face of Elizabeth, and the obstinate good sense and ability that dwelt in William's. Possibly I read their natures into them, but I do not think so; and one could well wish that art had so preserved all the great embodiments of history.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{might seem}} so," [...] she answered. [...] "Sometimes I {{think that all}} the time we live two lives,--the life of which the world sees the outside, and the life inside of which no one save {{ourselves}} knows anything at all. Look, for instance, at all these people--these chorus girls and young men about town--the older ones, too--all hungry for pleasure, all drinking at the cup of life as though they had indeed but to-day and to-morrow in which to live and enjoy. Have they no shadows, too, no secrets? They seem so harmless, yet if the great white truth shone down, might one not find a murderer there, a dying man who knew his terrible secret, yonder a Croesus on the verge of bankruptcy, a strong man playing with dishonor? <b>But</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> things of the other world which we do not see. The men look at us to-night and they envy you because you are with me. The women envy me more because I have emeralds upon my neck and shoulders for which they would give their souls, and a fame throughout Europe which would turn their foolish heads in a very few minutes. But they do not know. There are the shadows across my path, and I think that there are the shadows across yours. What do you say, Mr. Laverick?" ...|$|E

6000|$|What boy has not sighed for {{the good}} old days of wars, revolutions, and riots; how I used to pore over the chronicles of those old days, those dear old days, when workmen went armed to their labors; when they fell upon one another with gun and bomb and dagger, and the streets ran red with blood!

5000|$|A {{reviewer}} of {{the book}} at Feminist Science Fiction, Fantasy, & Utopia said that as [...] "a fantasy written by a feminist", Angel Island is important, but felt that <b>the</b> women <b>were</b> too complicit in their own mistreatment. The novels stereotypic typecasting of men (aggressive with intellectual drive) and women (vain and coy) appear [...] "jarring and sexist to modern readers", <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> [...] "unstated assumptions of 19th century US", and the women on Angel Island confront and overcome them. The reviewer concluded {{that it is a}} worthwhile read because of its [...] "subtle liberal feminist insistence that regardless of our gender, we all have a right to fulfil our potential - to fly".|$|R
50|$|The work fuses {{elements}} of opera, oratorio and classical drama. Semele was presented during Lent, one of Handel's regular oratorio seasons. However {{it was not}} what London audiences were expecting of an oratorio during the solemn season of Lent- Semele has a secular text with a story involving an adulterous sexual relationship. It is distinguished from Handel's operas by {{the large number of}} polyphonic choruses. Semele was performed four times during its original run, and twice again later <b>the</b> same year, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only performances in Handel's lifetime. Today Semele is frequently fully staged and receives regular performances at many of the world's opera houses, as well as performances in concert form.|$|R
