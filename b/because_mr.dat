5|$|The {{narrative}} follows Lisa Wilson (Venetta Rogers), an African-American girl, as she visits {{her friend}} Tabitha Stephens (Erin Murphy), a white girl. Meanwhile, Tabitha's father Darrin Stephens (Dick Sargent), {{who works at}} an advertising agency, fails to land a million-dollar account with toy company owner Mr. Brockway (Parley Baer) <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Brockway is racist and incorrectly believes Darrin {{to be married to}} Lisa's mother Dorothy (Janee Michelle). In an attempt to convince Mr. Brockway to overcome his bigotry, Darrin's wife Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery), who is a witch, casts a spell on Mr. Brockway so he sees everyone, including himself, as having black skin.|$|E
25|$|Jack {{continues}} the charade when new building manager Ralph Furley {{takes over the}} apartment complex <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Furley insists that his hard-nosed brother Bart (the building's new owner) would also never tolerate such living situations.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{noted that}} <b>because</b> <b>Mr</b> Bramwell {{did not have}} {{a clear view of the}} {{incident}} the Coroner concluded that the punches described by Bramwell hit the abdomen or torso of the deceased rather than the head and this caused the death.|$|E
60|$|The captains hesitated, {{not from}} fear, but <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Dove's {{condition}} moved even their savage hearts to pity.|$|R

25|$|Premiering on February 19, 2012, Carolla {{was also}} one of the contestants in the 12th season of NBC's The Celebrity Apprentice. He was fired in Week 4, <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Trump {{perceived}} that Carolla did not utilize Andretti's car background during a Buick presentation, even though it was clear that Andretti did not like public speaking.|$|E
25|$|The first St David's Church at Mossman was {{a simple}} gable-roofed timber structure, {{dedicated}} on Trinity Sunday on 29 May 1899. It took {{the name of the}} Welsh patron saint, St David, reputedly <b>because</b> <b>Mr</b> RD Rex, a local farmer and parish secretary during construction had been christened in the new cathedral of St David's in Hobart in 1874. The Bishop of North Queensland agreed to the name. The link with the Tasmanian cathedral was again made in 1955 when a fragment of the stone cross at St David's Cathedral was presented to the Mossman church, where it was set in cement at the entry.|$|E
25|$|Billy {{decides to}} head to Molly Ferguson's ranch, believing {{she is the only}} one who will accept his innocence. As Ray tracks Billy to the ranch, he meets a group of Texas Rangers who tell him they are about to attack the ranch <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ferguson is a rustler. Ray helps them, chasing Billy into the fields, and {{shooting}} him. Billy falls from a mountain into a nearby river. However, at that moment, Ray hears screaming coming from the ranch. He returns to find the Rangers were in fact bandits, who have killed most of the occupants of the house and taken Molly captive. Ray races after them, but they reach the river before he can catch them. In despair, he breaks down, questioning if he has been right about anything, asking if God has abandoned him, and determining to try to redeem himself by saving Molly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. and Mrs. Norman Young {{are not at}} home," [...] I explained, pitying him. [...] "They went to Streatham {{this morning}} <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Young's sister is very ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the kind," [...] {{the editor}} said, after a pause. [...] "I should prefer <b>Mrs.</b> Oakley's nominee <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Oakley is a shrewd, {{practical}} woman who--er--who--who, in fact--" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{caricature}} {{was popular}} with the British public. A type of umbrella became known as a gamp <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Gamp always carries one, which she displays with [...] "particular ostentation".|$|R
25|$|Sato's {{next move}} {{is the one}} that got him the most media {{attention}} as he signed with the World Wrestling Federation {{for the first time in}} his career. In early 1990 Sato along with former rival Pat Tanaka were introduced to the WWF as The Orient Express by manager Mr. Fuji. During this run, Sato introduced the Sitout Powerbomb to mainstream American wrestling for the first time. The Orient Express kicked off a prolonged feud with The Rockers that started at WrestleMania VI and continued off and on for well over a year. The Orient Express got involved in the Legion of Doom / Demolition feud <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Fuji managed both teams. Demolition was being phased out and the Orient Express took on the Legion of Doom instead. The Legion of Doom / Orient Express feud was extremely onesided due to the Legion of Doom’s massive size advantage.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirement}} for reliance {{has not been}} pushed {{so far as to}} say that a misrepresentor is never liable when a misrepresentee could have found out the truth. In the leading case, Redgrave v Hurd Mr Hurd was told by the elderly Mr Redgrave that the solicitor practice earned £300 pa. Mr Redgrave told Mr Hurd he could check some documents in the office to prove it. Mr Hurd did not check, and subsequently signed a contract to join Mr Redgrave as a partner. Then Mr Hurd found out the practice only generated £200 pa, and the documents in the office had never said otherwise. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, <b>because</b> <b>Mr</b> Redgrave had still made a misrepresentation. Furthmore it would be inferred that Mr Hurd relied on the statement from the fact that it was untrue. Edgington v Fitzmaurice confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.|$|E
500|$|In 1844, Karl Ernst Claus, a Russian {{scientist}} of Baltic German descent, {{showed that}} the compounds prepared by Gottfried Osann contained small amounts of ruthenium, which Claus had discovered the same year. Claus isolated ruthenium from the platinum residues of rouble production while he was working in Kazan University, Kazan, the same way its heavier congener osmium had been discovered four decades earlier. Claus showed that ruthenium oxide contained a new metal and obtained 6grams of ruthenium from the part of crude platinum that is insoluble in aqua regia. Choosing the name for the new element, Claus stated: [...] "I named the new body, in honour of my Motherland, ruthenium. I {{had every right to}} call it by this name <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Osann relinquished his ruthenium and the word does not yet exist in chemistry." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mrs. Mullins' [...] "secret garden" [...] is {{off limits}} {{to most of the}} {{children}} in the neighborhood. The narrator feels privileged to be an exception, mainly <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Mullins and his mother are friends.|$|R
60|$|Of course Captain Hotspur {{accepted}} the terms on her advice. He had obeyed Lady Altringham, and {{had tried to}} obey Emily, and would now obey <b>Mrs.</b> Morton, <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Morton was the nearest to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{come over}} to the other parlor, Miss Shott!" [...] said she. [...] "There's no furnace heat here <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Cliff didn't want the old house altered, and we use this room so little that we haven't made a fire." ...|$|R
500|$|Philip Day of The Sunday Times noted [...] "How wincingly well Mr Fleming writes", {{while the}} {{reviewer}} for The Times, thought that [...] "his is an ingenious affair, full of recondite knowledge and horrific spills and thrills – of slightly sadistic excitements also – though without the simple and bold design of its predecessor". Elizabeth L Sturch, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, observed that Fleming was [...] "without doubt {{the most interesting}} recent recruit among thriller-writers" [...] and that Live and Let Die [...] "fully maintains the promise of... Casino Royale." [...] Tempering her praise of the book, Sturch thought that [...] "Mr Fleming works often {{on the edge of}} flippancy, rather in the spirit of a highbrow", although overall she felt that the novel [...] "contains passages which for sheer excitement have not been surpassed by any modern writer of this kind". The reviewer for The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "the book is continually exciting, whether it takes us into the heart of Harlem or describes an underwater swim in shark-infested waters; and it is more entertaining <b>because</b> <b>Mr</b> Fleming does not take it all too seriously himself". [...] George Malcolm Thompson, writing in The Evening Standard, believed Live and Let Die to be [...] "tense; ice-cold, sophisticated; Peter Cheyney for the carriage trade".|$|E
500|$|The UK {{announced}} {{a test of}} opinion in Rhodesia to be undertaken by a four-man commission headed by the veteran judge Lord Pearce. All four population groups—black, white, coloured (mixed) and Asian—would have to approve the terms for Britain to proceed. ZANU and ZAPU supporters quickly formed the African National Council (later the United African National Council, or UANC) to organise and co-ordinate black opposition to the deal. Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the first black man to have been ordained as such in Rhodesia, was installed as the movement's leader. The Pearce Commission finished its work on 12 March 1972 and published its report two months later—it described white, coloured and Asian Rhodesians as in favour of the terms by 98%, 97% and 96% respectively, and black citizens as against them by an unspecified large majority. This came as a great shock to the white community [...] "and a deep disappointment to those in Britain who hoped {{to get rid of}} this tiresome albatross", Blake records. Smith condemned the Pearce Commissioners as [...] "naive and inept". The UK withdrew from negotiations, but neither government abandoned the accord entirely. [...] "I would ask them [...] to look again very carefully at what they rejected," [...] Douglas-Home told the House of Commons; [...] "the proposals are still available <b>because</b> <b>Mr</b> Smith has not withdrawn or modified them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} charges against Wei were made public, Wei's {{attorneys}} released a statement proclaiming her innocence, and a former New Jersey federal prosecutor commented that, [...] "there's no evidence of Ms. Wei doing anything. I'm very curious {{as to why the}} prosecutor is holding her responsible in any way, shape, or form simply <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ravi was using her computer." ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Radar and Hawkeye {{have managed}} to pick up Mrs. Kwang, and are riding back to the camp. It's a little too late, however, <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Kwang goes into labor. Radar flips and panics, while Hawkeye gets ready to help deliver the baby.|$|R
50|$|September 1, 2007: The Areios Pagos {{refused to}} certify Fofi Gennimata as a {{candidate}} for the PASOK nationwide list, citing non-eligibility <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Gennimata is elected the superprefect of Athens and Piraeus. This was criticised angrily by PASOK as an attempt to politicise the courts.|$|R
50|$|Thorne isn't {{surprised}} {{there are}} no photographs in the apartment, <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Denovo could never be persuaded to have one taken, not even for professional purposes. But Thorne has one—two, actually, captured by accident and without her knowledge. He will give copies to Archie.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, in Page v Smith [...] AC 155, it {{was held}} that Mr Smith was liable for causing Mr Page {{psychiatric}} injury (chronic fatigue syndrome) after a car crash, <b>because</b> <b>Mr</b> Smith could have reasonably foreseen that Mr Page would suffer physical injury for the crash. So liability for causing psychiatric injury depends on the foreseeability of the physical injury, {{as long as the}} psychiatric illness is medically recognised.|$|E
2500|$|This {{notion is}} {{questioned}} in North and South. In Margaret Hale the separation is blurred {{and she is}} forced by circumstances to assume a masculine role, organising the family's departure from Helstone and assuming much {{of the responsibility for}} the family in Milton (including encouraging her father). She carries the load alone, behaving like a [...] "Roman girl" [...] <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hale is weak and irresolute. When Higgins slips away and her father trembles with horror at Boucher's death, Margaret goes to Mrs. Boucher, breaks the news of her husband's death and cares for the family with dedication and efficiency. She summons her brother Frederick, a naval officer who is crushed with grief at the death of his mother. To protect her brother, Margaret later lies about their presence at the train station on the day of his departure (Stoneman, 1987, p.127).|$|E
2500|$|Connick was {{an artist}} once {{on the staff of}} the Pittsburgh Press, and author of [...] Adventures in Light and Color, a work which he has {{modestly}} subtitled An Introduction to the Stained Glass Craft. Mr. Connick also has windows in the Cathedrals of St. Patrick and St. John the Divine in New York City, the Princeton University Chapel, the American Church in Paris, and in the Calvary Episcopal and East Liberty Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh. [...] Heinz Memorial Chapel has the distinction of having all its windows by Mr. Connick, a practice unusual in most churches which prefer to represent in their sanctuaries as many kinds of stained glass artistry as possible. [...] However, because in Heinz Chapel all the windows can be seen at once, and <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Connick began to work so closely with those planning the Chapel, and was so widely respected as a worker in stained glass, he was soon commissioned to design and make all of the windows in Heinz Chapel.|$|E
6000|$|Dan felt richly {{rewarded for}} his evening's work, {{not only that}} he was chosen from all the rest to go proudly up bearing the lamp, but <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Jo said heartily, [...] "Good-night, my boy! God bless you!" [...] as he left her at her door.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are children--five of them; {{the prettiest}} little dears one ever saw. The eldest {{is just about}} thirteen." [...] This was a fib, <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Carroll knew that the eldest boy was sixteen; but what did it signify? [...] "Amelia is so warmly {{attached}} to them." ...|$|R
50|$|Through {{the hardest}} and longest struggle, Farrel and Fitri's son was {{delivered}} safely. Farrel asks Mrs. Lia to name their son <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Lia is his most beloved and respected mother. Mrs. Lia was overwhelmed with the given honour, she named Farrel and Fitri's son, Raffa Emeraldi Hutama.|$|R
2500|$|If a {{claimant}} through conduct has subsequently affirmed {{a contract}} despite some prior misrepresentation, {{she will be}} estopped from changing her mind. For instance, in the slightly harsh case of Long v Lloyd Mr Long bought from Mr Lloyd a lorry advertised as being in ‘exceptional condition,’ said to do 40mph and 11 miles to the gallon. When it broke down after two days and was doing 5 miles to the gallon, Mr Long complained. Mr Lloyd said he would repair it for half {{the price of a}} reconstructed dynamo. <b>Because</b> <b>Mr</b> Long accepted this, when it broke down again, Pearce LJ held the contract had been affirmed. It was too late to escape for misrepresentation. A more lenient approach may now exist. As Slade LJ pointed out in Peyman v Lanjani, actual knowledge of the right to choose to affirm a contract or rescind is essential before one can be said to have [...] "affirmed" [...] a contract.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{carnival}} Charles Holloway triumphs over Mr. Dark, finds {{his son in}} the mirror maze, kills the Witch {{with a smile on}} a bullet, and destroys all the mirrors in a matter of minutes, all through the use of laughter and cheer. Then he and Will search for Jim. Mr. Cooger turns to dust and blows away before he can be saved by the carousel. Jim runs to the merry-go-round, and rides it forward. Will tries to stop him, and grabs onto his leg. [...] They both end up going for a ride before Will jumps off and rips Jim away from the machine. Jim falls into a stupor, close to death. A child comes begging them to help him, but Mr. Holloway recognizes the boy as Mr. Dark. He holds the boy tight and kills him with affection, <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dark cannot survive in such close contact with someone so happy. The carnival falls apart as Will tries to revive Jim. They save Jim by singing and dancing and laughing, their happiness bringing him back from the edge of death.|$|E
2500|$|The verdict angered the Asian American {{community}} in the Detroit area and around the country. [...] Journalist Helen Zia and lawyer Liza Chan (...) led the fight for federal charges, {{which resulted in the}} men's being accused of two counts of violating Chin's civil rights, under section 245 of title 18 of the United States Code. For these charges, it was not enough that Ebens had injured Chin, but that [...] "a substantial motivating factor for the defendant's actions was Mr. Chin's race, color, or national origin, and <b>because</b> <b>Mr.</b> Chin had been enjoying a place of entertainment which serves the public." [...] Because of possible mitigating factors that could lead to reasonable doubt, such as intoxication leading to the defendant's inability to form the specific intent, the prosecution's proving the evidence of uttered racial slurs was not self-sufficient for conviction. In addition, the defense found Racine Colwell, the witness who overheard the [...] "It's because of you motherfuckers we're out of work" [...] remark, to have received some clemency on a jail sentence for a prostitution charge, which suggested that the government might have tried to cut a deal for her testimony.|$|E
50|$|Half-term is less {{fun than}} expected, mainly <b>because</b> <b>Mrs</b> Marlow's mother is visiting. Nicola and Patrick manage to sneak {{off for a}} day to visit Wade Minster {{and look at the}} carved falcon and then enjoy a cold, dark ride back over the downs, while Patrick recites the Lyke-Wake Dirge.|$|R
50|$|In 1926, the {{building}} ceased operations as a dormitory, <b>because</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Welch sold {{the property to}} local real estate developer Judge Stewart and his sons.
