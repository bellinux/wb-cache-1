25|$|Dinitrogen tetroxide is a {{powerful}} oxidizer that is hypergolic (spontaneously reacts) upon contact with various forms of hydrazine, which makes the pair a popular <b>bipropellant</b> for rockets.|$|E
25|$|A more {{conventional}} <b>bipropellant</b> could {{more than double}} the specific impulse. However, although the exhaust gases from the peroxide-based engine are very hot, they are still significantly cooler than those generated by alternative propellants. Using a peroxide-based propellant greatly reduces the risk of a fire/explosion which would cause severe injury to the operator.|$|E
25|$|The Spectre was a <b>bipropellant</b> engine burning {{kerosene}} {{and hydrogen}} peroxide. The power {{could be controlled}} from 10-100% delivering 8,000 lbf (35.7kN) of thrust at full power. In the SR.53 it used the same fuel tanks as the turbojet engine and if run at full power was expected to consume the full load in about seven minutes.|$|E

50|$|The highest {{specific}} impulse chemical rockets use liquid propellants (liquid-propellant rockets). They can {{consist of a}} single chemical (a monopropellant) or a mix of two chemicals, called <b>bipropellants.</b> <b>Bipropellants</b> can further {{be divided into two}} categories; hypergolic propellants, which ignite when the fuel and oxidizer make contact, and non-hypergolic propellants which require an ignition source.|$|R
25|$|AUSROC II was {{a larger}} {{pressure}} fed kerosene-oxygen <b>bipropellant</b> rocket {{that was developed}} in the 1990s. It was designed to reach an altitude of 10km. The first attempt at launching an AUSROC II suffered a spectacular failure on the launch pad in 1992. The subsequent rocket, named AUSROC II-2 was successfully launched in 1995 from Woomera, although it did not reach its target apogee due to pressurisation problems with the LOX tank.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol was {{commonly}} used as fuel in early <b>bipropellant</b> rocket (liquid propelled) vehicles, {{in conjunction with}} an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen. The German V-2 rocket of World War II, credited with beginning the space age, used ethanol, mixed with 25% of water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature. The V-2's design team helped develop U.S. rockets following World War II, including the ethanol-fueled Redstone rocket which launched the first U.S. satellite. Alcohols fell into general disuse as more efficient rocket fuels were developed.|$|E
25|$|The body {{is built}} around the main {{propulsion}} system, which consists of a <b>bipropellant</b> 400 N main engine. The two 267-liter propellant tanks have a total capacity of 595kg. Approximately 370kg are needed for the nominal mission. Pressurized helium from a 35-liter tank is used to force fuel into the engine. Trajectory corrections will be made using a set of eight 10 N thrusters, one attached to each corner of the spacecraft bus. The spacecraft configuration is optimized for a Soyuz/Fregat, and was fully compatible with a Delta II launch vehicle.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} conducted to determine the improvements in vehicle performance possible by burning metals with conventional liquid <b>bipropellants.</b> These metallized propellants theoretically offer higher specific impulse, increased propellant density and improved vehicle performance compared with conventional liquid <b>bipropellants.</b> Metals considered were beryllium, lithium, aluminum and iron. Liquid <b>bipropellants</b> were H 2 /O 2, N 2 H 4 /N 2 O 4, RP- 1 /O 2 and H 2 /F 2. A mission with a delta V = 4267. 2 m/sec (14, 000 ft/sec) and vehicle with propellant volume fixed at 56. 63 cu m (2000 cu ft) and dry mass fixed at 2761. 6 kg (6000 lb) was used, roughly representing the transfer of a chemically propelled upper-stage vehicle from a low-Earth orbit to a geosynchronous orbit. The results of thermochemical calculations and mission analysis calculations for <b>bipropellants</b> metallized with beryllium, lithium, aluminum and iron are presented. Technology issues pertinent to metallized propellants are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|About 170 {{different}} propellants made {{of liquid}} fuel have been tested, excluding minor changes {{to a specific}} propellant such as propellant additives, corrosion inhibitors, or stabilizers. In the U.S. alone at least 25 different propellant combinations have been flown. No completely new propellant {{has been used for}} nearly 30 years. [...] Many factors go into choosing a propellant for a liquid propellant rocket engine. The primary factors include ease of operation, cost, hazards/environment and performance. They can consist of a single chemical, a monopropellant, or two, called <b>bipropellants</b> or other mixtures. <b>Bipropellants</b> can be either hypergolic propellant or nonhypergolic. A hypergolic combination of oxidizer and fuel will start to burn upon contact. A nonhypergolic needs an ignition source.|$|R
50|$|Hydrazine, {{ethylene}} oxide, {{hydrogen peroxide}} (especially in its German World War II form as T-Stoff), and nitromethane are common rocket monopropellants. As noted the specific impulse of monopropellants {{is lower than}} <b>bipropellants</b> {{and can be found}} with the Air Force Chemical Equilibrium Specific Impulse Code tool.|$|R
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, the Hellmuth Walter KG-conceived turbine used {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{for use in}} submarines while submerged; it {{was found to be}} too noisy and require too much maintenance compared to diesel-electric power systems. Some torpedoes used {{hydrogen peroxide}} as oxidizer or propellant. Operator error in the use of hydrogen-peroxide torpedoes was named as possible causes for the sinkings of HMS Sidon and the Russian submarine Kursk. SAAB Underwater Systems is manufacturing the Torpedo 2000. This torpedo, used by the Swedish Navy, is powered by a piston engine propelled by HTP as an oxidizer and kerosene as a fuel in a <b>bipropellant</b> system.|$|E
25|$|All current {{spacecraft}} use chemical rockets (<b>bipropellant</b> or solid-fuel) for launch, {{though some}} (such as the Pegasus rocket and SpaceShipOne) have used air-breathing engines {{on their first}} stage. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping and some use momentum wheels for attitude control. Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north-south stationkeeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used ion thrusters and Hall effect thrusters (two different types of electric propulsion) to great success.|$|E

50|$|Various {{pyrotechnic}} compositions can be used, {{depending on}} the desired burn rate and required amount of energy and volume of gas produced. Some materials, such as RDX, sublimate in vacuum, which limits their usefulness in aerospace applications. Composition with the character of <b>bipropellants</b> and flash powders are often used.|$|R
5000|$|Monopropellants such as {{hydrogen}} peroxide, hydrazine, and {{nitrous oxide}} are primarily used for attitude control and spacecraft station-keeping where their long-term storability, simplicity of use, {{and ability to}} provide the tiny impulses needed, outweighs their lower specific impulse as compared to <b>bipropellants.</b> Hydrogen peroxide {{is also used to}} drive the turbopumps on the first stage of the Soyuz launch vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Much {{work was}} done in the US in the 1950s and 1960s to attempt to find better and more {{energetic}} monopropellants. For the most part, researchers {{came to the conclusion that}} any single substance that contained enough energy to compete with <b>bipropellants</b> would be too unstable to handle safely under practical conditions. With new materials, control systems and requirements for high-performance thrusters, engineers are currently re-examining this assumption.|$|R
2500|$|The {{spacecraft}} used a <b>bipropellant</b> integrated {{propulsion system}} to reach lunar orbit {{as well as}} orbit and altitude maintenance while orbiting the Moon. The power plant consisted of one 440 N engine and eight 22 N thrusters. Fuel and oxidiser were stored in two tanks of [...] each.|$|E
2500|$|Main {{propulsion}} {{was provided}} by the 645N, 317 sec.Isp <b>bipropellant</b> (hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide) large velocity assist (LVA) thruster. The model used was the LEROS 1b, developed and manufactured at AMPAC‐ISP’s Westcott works, in the United Kingdom. The spacecraft was designed to carry [...] of propellant and helium pressurizer for the LVA.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{propulsion}} unit was mounted above the orbiter bus. Propulsion was furnished by a <b>bipropellant</b> (monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide) liquid-fueled rocket engine {{which could be}} gimballed up to 9 degrees. The engine was capable of [...] thrust, translating {{to a change in}} velocity of 1480 m/s. Attitude control was achieved by 12 small compressed-nitrogen jets.|$|E
40|$|The {{capability}} to replenish spacecraft, satellites, and laboratories on-orbit with consumable fluids provides {{significant increases in}} their cost and operational effectiveness. Tanker systems to perform on-orbit fluid resupply must be flexible enough to operate from the Space Transportation System (STS), Space Station, or the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV), and to accommodate launch from both the Shuttle and Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV's). Resupply systems for storable monopropellant hydrazine and <b>bipropellants,</b> and water have been developed. These studies have concluded that designing tankers capable of launch on both the Shuttle and ELV's was feasible and desirable. Design modifications and interfaces for an ELV launch of the tanker systems were identified. Additionally, {{it was determined that}} modularization of the tanker subsystems was necessary to provide the most versatile tanker and most efficient approach for use at the Space Station. The need to develop an automatic umbilical mating mechanism, capable of performing both docking and coupler mating functions was identified. Preliminary requirements for such a mechanism were defined. The study resulted in a modular tanker capable of resupplying monopropellants, <b>bipropellants,</b> and water with a single design...|$|R

The proposed fuels have delta V and energy density values greater than NTO/MMH <b>bipropellants...</b>|$|R
50|$|One newer {{monopropellant}} {{under development}} is nitrous oxide, both neat {{and in the}} form of nitrous oxide fuel blends. Nitrous oxide offers the advantages of being self-pressurizing and of being relatively non-toxic, with a specific impulse intermediate between hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine. Nitrous oxide generates oxygen upon decomposition, and it is possible to blend it with fuels to form a monopropellant mixture with a specific impulse up to 325 s, comparable to hypergolic <b>bipropellants.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The orbiter's {{dry mass}} is , and it carried [...] {{of fuel and}} oxidiser at launch. Its main engine, which is a {{derivative}} of the system used on India's communications satellites, uses the <b>bipropellant</b> combination monomethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from Earth. It was also used {{to slow down the}} probe for Mars orbit insertion and, subsequently, for orbit corrections.|$|E
2500|$|Main {{propulsion}} comprises 24 paired <b>bipropellant</b> 10N thrusters, {{with four}} pairs of thrusters {{being used for}} delta-v burns.

2500|$|As {{advanced}} Model 376 spacecraft, the MEASAT-1 and -2 satellites {{have three}} enhancements over the standard model. They {{were the first}} in the 376 series to be fitted with gallium arsenide solar cells, which deliver 40 percent more payload power as compared to their silicon predecessors. They were also the first Model 376s to use lightweight, high-gain shaped antenna. The satellites also used a more efficient <b>bipropellant</b> system for stationkeeping and attitude control maneuvers.|$|E
50|$|Hydroxylammonium nitrate or {{hydroxylamine}} nitrate (HAN) is an {{inorganic compound}} with the chemical formula NH3OHNO3. It is a salt derived from hydroxylamine and nitric acid. In its pure form, it is a colourless hygroscopic solid. It has {{potential to be}} used as a rocket propellant either as a solution in monopropellants or <b>bipropellants.</b> Hydroxylammonium Nitrate (HAN) based propellants are viable and effective solution for future green propellant based missions, as it offers 50% higher performance for a given propellant tank compared to commercially used Hydrazine.|$|R
5000|$|In Germany {{from the}} mid-1930s through World War II, rocket {{propellants}} were broadly classed as monergols, hypergols, non-hypergols and lithergols. The ending ergol {{is a combination}} of Greek ergon or work, and Latin oleum or oil, later influenced by the chemical suffix -ol from alcohol. [...] Monergols were monopropellants, while non-hypergols were <b>bipropellants</b> which required external ignition, and lithergols were solid/liquid hybrids. Hypergolic propellants (or at least hypergolic ignition) were far less prone to hard starts than electric or pyrotechnic ignition. The [...] "hypergole" [...] terminology was coined by Dr. Wolfgang Nöggerath, at the Technical University of Brunswick, Germany.|$|R
40|$|Propellant {{performance}} is usually assessed through {{the comparison of}} either the specific impulse Isp or the specific impulse density Isp,d of different propellants. However, each of these performance parameters {{could result in a}} different ranking of the propellants performances which makes it harder to make a suitable choice without having in mind an actual application. In order to overcome this problem, a unified performance assessment criterion based on both of these usual performance parameters is suggested in the present paper. The relevance of this unified performance assessment criterion has been shown over a wide range of propellants (mono and <b>bipropellants)</b> for several in-service spacecrafts...|$|R
2500|$|The Cassini {{spacecraft}} was [...] {{high and}} [...] wide. Spacecraft complexity was increased by its trajectory (flight path) to Saturn, {{and by the}} ambitious science at its destination. Cassini had 1,630 interconnected electronic components, 22,000 wire connections, and [...] of cabling. [...] The core control computer CPU was a redundant MIL-STD-1750A system. The main propulsion system consisted of one prime and one backup R-4D <b>bipropellant</b> rocket engine. The thrust of each engine was 490 newtons and the total spacecraft delta-v was about 2,040 meters per second. Smaller monopropellant rockets provided attitude control.|$|E
2500|$|Nitrous oxide {{also may}} be used in a {{monopropellant}} rocket. In the presence of a heated catalyst, [...] will decompose exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen, at a temperature of approximately [...] Because of the large heat release, the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary, as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant. In a vacuum thruster, this may provide a monopropellant specific impulse (Isp) of as much as 180 s. While noticeably less than the Isp available from hydrazine thrusters (monopropellant or <b>bipropellant</b> with dinitrogen tetroxide), the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide an option worth investigating.|$|E
2500|$|As a <b>bipropellant,</b> [...] is {{decomposed}} to burn a fuel as an oxidizer. Specific impulses {{as high as}} 350 s (3.5kN·s/kg) can be achieved, {{depending on}} the fuel. Peroxide used as an oxidizer gives a somewhat lower Isp than liquid oxygen, but is dense, storable, noncryogenic and can be more easily used to drive gas turbines to give high pressures using an efficient closed cycle. It {{can also be used}} for regenerative cooling of rocket engines. Peroxide was used very successfully as an oxidizer in World War II German rocket motors (e.g. T-Stoff, containing oxyquinoline stabilizer, for both the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe RATO externally podded monopropellant booster system, and for the Walter HWK 109-509 rocket motor series used for the Me 163B), most often used with C-Stoff in a self-igniting hypergolic combination, and for the low-cost British Black Knight and Black Arrow launchers.|$|E
40|$|Planetary orbit mission {{capabilities}} will {{be greatly}} improved by {{the advent of}} space-storable retro-propulsion systems with liquid fluorine/hydrazine as <b>bipropellants,</b> even when the Space Shuttle/Space Tug is used as launch vehicle. With a specific impulse as high as 375 sec, a multimission propulsion module designed for Pioneer or Mariner class spacecraft as payload and using space-storable propellants, can perform Mercury, Saturn and Uranus orbiter missions, and even some comet rendezvous missions. It also can reduce trip times to the outer planets significantly. The paper presents mission requirements, propulsion technology status, system design, performance, development schedules and cost data, based on results of a recent design and feasibility study...|$|R
5000|$|Mono{{propellants}} are propellants {{consisting of}} chemicals that release energy through exothermic chemical decomposition. The molecular bond {{energy of the}} monopropellant is released usually through use of a catalyst. This can be contrasted with <b>bipropellants</b> that release energy through the chemical reaction between an oxidizer and a fuel. While stable under defined storage conditions, monopropellants decompose very rapidly under certain other conditions to produce a large volume of energetic (hot) gases {{for the performance of}} mechanical work. Although solid s such as nitrocellulose, the most commonly used propellant in firearms, could be thought of as monopropellants, the term is usually reserved for liquids in engineering literature.|$|R
40|$|Gelled {{propellants}} {{combine the}} advantages of solid propellants which do not pour out on leakages with that of liquid propellants which are pumpable and burn well-defined in sprays. There exist only few investigations {{on the influence of}} gelling agents on the burning behavior of single burning droplets especially when the droplet is freely moving in a hot atmosphere. The paper describes high-speed spectroscopic and cinematographic investigations on ignited moving gelled droplets of monopropellants under ambient conditions and contacting droplets of <b>bipropellants</b> hovering above a hot plate driven by the Leidenfrost effect. The monopropellants were pure nitromethane and nitromethane/hydrogen peroxide (90 % purity) mixtures. <b>Bipropellants</b> consisted of a fuel component like nitromethane, aluminized JP-I, iso-octane and kerosene combined with an oxidizer like hydrogen peroxide, RFNA, high concentrated solutions of ammonium nitrate or ADN in water. Gelling agents were aerosol, guar gum and other mostly commercial chemical ingredients. The flame geometry was characterized using highspeed video and IR-camera techniques. To measure the distribution of temperature, gas components like water, CO 2, CO, NO and hydrocarbons of the moving droplets highspeed NIR- and IR-spectrometers with up to 1000 scans per second were applied. The spectra series of a droplet passing the focal point were analyzed by fitting calculated spectra using the data of "NASA-handbook of IR-Radiation" to the experimental data. Local profiles of temperature and of concentration × path length that qualitatively agree well with thermodynamic and chemical kinetic calculations could be achieved by this method. The experimental findings were compared to a simple transient mathematical model describing diffusion controlled combustion of single droplets...|$|R
