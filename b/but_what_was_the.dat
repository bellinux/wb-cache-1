When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of [...] "shoot him" [...] from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Balfour, remarked, [...] "He [...] was, I understand, in military phrase, in {{what is known as}} the zone of fire—he and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> right hon. Gentleman doing? That I neither understood at the time, nor do I understand now." [...] Jenkins suggests that he went simply because [...] "he could not resist going to see the fun himself".|$|E
2500|$|The 179th and 180th Brigades {{conducted}} steady advances {{until the}} leading troop were {{held up by}} fire, then building up to a strong firing line before launching an assault, while the field artillery lifted to the fortifications behind as the battalions captured the front trenches. A delay in the attack occurred, when the advancing infantry ran into uncut wire, and the 179th Brigade Stokes mortar barrage was called forward. [...] "This is where we do our stuff. I told the fellows to set the gun up, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> range. How to even guess in that murk? God forbid that I should lob shells into our own men." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early January 1911, Churchill made a {{controversial}} {{visit to the}} Siege of Sidney Street in London. There is some uncertainty {{as to whether he}} attempted to give operational commands, and his presence attracted much criticism. After an inquest, Arthur Balfour remarked, [...] "he [...] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> right honourable gentleman doing?" [...] Biographer Roy Jenkins suggests that he went simply because [...] "he could not resist going to see the fun himself" [...] and that he did not issue commands. A Metropolitan police history of the event, however, states that it was [...] "a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Robert McNamara wrote {{how that}} both side had missed opportunities. As he entered {{government}} in 1960, he freely admits he {{knew little about}} Vietnam, but his colleagues, ranging from the President and Vice President, to the Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were convinced that China and the Soviet Union saw Vietnam {{as the starting point}} for the Communist conquest of Southeast Asia. Postwar discussions between McNamara and North Vietnamese told him that the Hanoi leadership saw the U.S. as the main enemy, [...] "imperialists" [...] bent on crushing the North and occupying the entire country. His 1999 conclusion (his emphasis) was <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> reality? Hanoi was no domino! Washington was no imperialist!...In 1961 the North Vietnamese government and the Kennedy Administration saw each other through fifteen years of Cold War rhetoric.|$|E
2500|$|In early January 1911, Churchill {{arrived at}} the [...] "Siege of Sidney Street" [...] in London. He gave his own account of the {{incident}} in his book Thoughts and Adventures. There is some uncertainty as to whether Churchill attempted to give operational commands. Biographer Roy Jenkins comments that the reason he went was because [...] "he could not resist {{going to see the}} fun himself" [...] and that he did not issue commands. A famous photograph from the time shows Churchill at the scene, peering around a corner to view the gun battle between cornered anarchists and Scots Guards. His role and presence attracted much criticism. The building under siege caught fire, and Churchill supported the decision to deny the fire brigade access, forcing the criminals to choose surrender or death. After an inquest, Arthur Balfour remarked, [...] "He [...] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Right Honourable gentleman doing?" [...] The significance was that the whole highly publicised affair increased Churchill's already incipient reputation for being a frenetic and far-from-calm Home Secretary.|$|E
