5|$|Although Gascoigne {{had always}} {{intended}} to study mathematics at Cambridge, an event occurred that significantly shaped his career.

During his thesis studies at Bristol, Gascoigne developed a diffraction theory of the Foucault test that is used for evaluating the shape of large telescope mirrors.

Initially proposed as a British and Polish operation codenamed Operation Comet, the plan was soon expanded to involve most of the First Allied Airborne Army and a set piece ground advance into the Netherlands, codenamed Market Garden.|$|E
