5|$|The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded an extremophile {{sampling}} {{expedition to}} Lōʻihi in 1999. Microbial mats surrounded the 160°C vents, and included a novel jelly-like organism.

In 2001, PiscesV collected {{samples of the}} organisms and <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to the surface for study.|$|E
5|$|After {{falling asleep}} that night, Sam is visited {{in a dream}} by Azazel, who reveals that he has <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> all {{together}} {{so that they can}} fight to the death, with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons. Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he believed she was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
6000|$|Toby's {{freckled}} face reddened {{with pleasure}} {{as he heard}} these words, and he stammered out, with considerable difficulty, [...] "I didn't do anything; it was Mr. Stubbs that <b>brought</b> <b>'em</b> back." ...|$|R

5|$|Another common {{trick was}} to swallow 30 to 50 unshelled {{hazelnuts}} (although {{one of his}} posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali then <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> up one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience. In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members.|$|E
5|$|Around 2 pm, the British barges {{carrying}} artillery floated {{down the}} La Chute River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between {{an island in}} the La Chute and the shore.

5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers that <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere {{and several of}} its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having {{lost control of}} the vast territory of Brazil in South America, the Portuguese began to focus on expanding their African outposts. This <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> into direct conflict with the British. Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E

5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real genius in getting things done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> into contact with her.|$|E
5|$|NOI {{leaders were}} angry that Clarence13X freely taught {{portions}} of their doctrine that they only revealed to committed members; although one of their captains repeatedly asked him to stop, he refused. Clarence13X also experienced conflict within his family: his children did not revere him, and hostility quickly developed between core Five Percenters {{and some of his}} sons when Willeen Jowers <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> to visit him.|$|E

5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> {{to the edge of the}} pack ice on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|Sang Penari was {{directed}} by Ifa Isfansyah. Husband and wife team Wong Aksan and Titi Sjuman were chosen to do the scoring, which they spent {{a month and a}} half on; they later said that work on the film <b>brought</b> <b>them</b> closer together.

The screenplay went through twelve drafts and took two years of research.|$|E
