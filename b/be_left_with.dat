5|$|He was {{instrumental}} in the decision to purchase the de Havilland Comet, believing the efficiencies and benefits of jet powered military aircraft would be useful if replicated in a civilian environment, and recognising the outdated aircraft the airline would otherwise <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with.</b> The early operation of the de Havilland Comet was characterised by the series of fatal crashes which would result in the resignation of Miles Thomas as chairman in 1955. The root cause was eventually attributed to metal fatigue and no blame was attached to either Smallpeice or indeed to Thomas. Smallpeice would initially retain his position as financial comptroller under the incoming chairman, Gerard d'Erlanger, this would be a temporary arrangement and in 1956 Smallpeice was promoted to the role of chief executive, albeit with the title managing director.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{essential}} for {{life can be}} toxic if taken in excess; some have notably toxic forms. Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is carcinogenic in animals and, when inhaled, causes DNA damage. The purple permanganate ion MnO is a liver and kidney poison. Ingesting more than 0.5 grams of iron can induce cardiac collapse; such overdoses most commonly occur in children and may result in death within 24 hours. Nickel carbonyl (Ni2(CO)4), at 30 parts per million, can cause respiratory failure, brain damage and death. Imbibing a gram or more of copper sulfate (Cu(SO4)2) can be fatal; survivors may <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> major organ damage. More than five milligrams of selenium is highly toxic; this is roughly ten times the 0.45 milligram recommended maximum daily intake; long-term poisoning can have paralytic effects.|$|E

5|$|In roughly 5billion years, the Sun will {{cool and}} expand outward to many times its current {{diameter}} (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and {{leaving behind a}} stellar remnant known as a white dwarf.

5|$|Alex Tew, {{a student}} from Cricklade in Wiltshire, England, {{conceived}} The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He {{was about to begin}} a three-year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham, and was concerned that he would <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> a student loan that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $1 each; purchasers would add their own image, logo or advertisement, and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was strong against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were €50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.|$|E
5|$|Togusa tracks {{down one}} of the missing children, now {{assigned}} to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.|$|E

Moreover, the company would <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> only 1 gate at Midway, down from its previous total of 14, surrendering the balance to Southwest or the city.|$|E

Tenure reform in Michigan guaranteed students would not <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> an underperforming teacher or lose a teacher who is exceeding.

25|$|Bank of America possessed {{combined}} {{assets of}} $570billion, {{as well as}} 4,800 branches in 22 states.

(Branch divestitures are only required if the combined company will have a larger than 25% Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit market share in a particular state or 10% deposit market share overall.) In addition, the combined broker-dealer, created from the integration of BancAmerica Robertson Stephens and NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, was named Banc of America Securities in 1998.|$|E
25|$|As the {{recession}} deepened and {{the debt crisis}} worsened, the hotel's developers pleaded for yet more public funding. But in July 2008, city CFO Gandhi repeated his warning from June 2007 that the city would breach its debt cap by doing so. The city had already committed to public funding to redevelop the Southwest waterfront, the O Street Market mixed-use project, and the purchase of Skyland Shopping Center, and Gandhi warned that funding might need to be diverted from these and other projects or the city would <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> just $122 million to spend on development and infrastructure between 2008 and 2014.

25|$|There {{are several}} legends {{as to the}} origin of this custom. Two popular {{explanations}} for the South’s association with peas and good luck dates back to the American Civil War. The first is associated with General William T. Sherman’s march of the Union Army to the sea, during which they pillaged the Confederates' food supplies. Stories say peas and salted pork were said to have been left untouched, because of the belief that they were animal food unfit for human consumption. Southerners considered themselves lucky to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> some supplies to help them survive the winter, and black-eyed peas evolved into a representation of good luck. In another Southern tradition, black-eyed peas was a symbol of emancipation for African-Americans who had previously been enslaved, and who after the Civil War were officially freed on New Years Day. Other Southern American traditions point to Jews of Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestry in Southern cities and plantations.|$|E
25|$|From around 1920, {{the company}} favoured {{a union of}} Southern and Northern Rhodesia, {{followed}} by their inclusion in the Union of South Africa, {{and it was in}} discussion with South African leaders about this. South Africa offered favourable terms for buying out the BSAC’s interests, and the company would be relieved of any future administrative costs. The BSAC did not want to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> responsibility for the administration of Northern Rhodesia when Southern Rhodesia gained responsible government, but did want to preserve its commercial interests there, in particular its mining and land rights. To do this, it had to negotiate a settlement with the British government for both parts of Rhodesia. The two parties began negotiations in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion at the end of 1922, but nevertheless reached an agreement of 29 September 1923 to settle all the outstanding questions on Southern and Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
25|$|In July 2012 Ofcom {{consulted}} on {{a scheme}} proposed by Royal Mail to alter its delivery obligations to allow larger postal items to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> neighbours rather than returning {{them to a}} Royal Mail office to await collection. The scheme was presented as offering consumers greater choice for receiving mail when not at home, that is if Royal Mail deliver items as per their stated contractual obligations and was said to follow Royal Mail research from a 'delivery to neighbour' trial across six areas of the UK that showed widespread consumer satisfaction. In a statement dated 27 September 2012, Ofcom announced it would approve the scheme after noting that more goods were being purchased over the internet and that Royal Mail's competitors were permitted to leave undelivered items with neighbours. People who {{do not wish to}} have parcels left with neighbours, or to receive those of others, can opt out by displaying a free opt-out sticker near their letterbox. Royal Mail remains liable for undeliverable items until they are received by the addressee or returned to sender.|$|E
