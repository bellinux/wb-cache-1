5|$|<b>Batters</b> faced: Humber 27; Beavan 27; Luetge 3; Delabar 8.|$|E
5|$|Lieber threw three pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a changeup. The slider was {{the pitch}} Lieber {{often used to}} get outs and was most {{successful}} against right-handed <b>batters.</b> The changeup darted away from <b>batters.</b> Lieber was not a hard thrower (his fastball was in the low 90mph range); he relied on controlling his pitches to have success.|$|E
5|$|Protective helmets {{are also}} {{standard}} equipment for all <b>batters.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are two <b>batter's</b> boxes, one on {{each side}} of home plate. The <b>batter's</b> boxes are 4 feet wide (1.2 m) and 6 feet long (1.8 m). The <b>batter's</b> boxes are {{centered}} lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each <b>batter's</b> box 6 inches (15.24 cm) from the near edge of home plate. A right-handed <b>batter</b> would stand in the <b>batter's</b> box {{on the left side of}} home plate from the perspective of the catcher and umpire. A left-handed <b>batter</b> would stand in the <b>batter's</b> box to their right. A <b>batter</b> may only occupy one <b>batter's</b> box at a time and may not legally leave the <b>batter's</b> box after the pitcher has come set or has started his windup. Should the <b>batter</b> wish to leave the <b>batter's</b> box once the pitcher has engaged the rubber, he must first ask the umpire for time-out. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started his pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the <b>batter's</b> box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the Official Baseball Rules.|$|R
50|$|If the infraction is {{discovered}} during a plate appearance (that is, a pitch has been {{thrown to the}} current <b>batter),</b> then the umpire considers the current <b>batter</b> and the previous one. If the current <b>batter's</b> name does not follow the previous actual <b>batter's</b> name in the written order, the current <b>batter</b> is improper. There is no penalty, but the situation is rectified — the proper <b>batter</b> comes to bat and assumes the improper <b>batter's</b> current count. In this situation, if the proper <b>batter</b> is on base, then he is simply skipped in the order, and the next <b>batter</b> in the order is now the proper <b>batter.</b> In this situation under high school (NFHS) rules, the proper <b>batter</b> is brought in off the bases, assumes his proper at bat, and a courtesy runner (the last batted out) takes his place on the bases.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the fourth}} ball, {{it is called}} a walk, and the <b>batter</b> becomes a runner, and is {{entitled}} to advance to first base without risk of being put out, called a base on balls or a walk (abbreviated BB). If a pitch touches the <b>batter</b> (or the <b>batter's</b> clothes), the umpire declares a hit by pitch (abbreviated HBP) and the <b>batter</b> is awarded first base, unless the umpire determines that the ball was in the strike zone when it hit the <b>batter,</b> or that the <b>batter</b> {{did not attempt to}} avoid being hit. In practice, neither exception is ever called unless the <b>batter</b> obviously tries to get hit by the pitch; even standing still in the box will virtually always be overlooked, and the <b>batter</b> awarded first. In addition, if the <b>batter</b> swings at a pitch that hits him, it counts as a strike. If the catcher's mitt, catcher's mask, or any part of the catcher comes in contact with the <b>batter</b> and/or the <b>batter's</b> bat as the <b>batter</b> is attempting to hit a pitch, the <b>batter</b> is awarded first base, ruled [...] "catcher's interference".|$|R
5|$|Richard {{made his}} next start, after five days rest, against the Cincinnati Reds, {{who would later}} finish the NL West season in a tie for fourth place with the Astros. Richard gave up a lead-off home run to Pete Rose {{in the first inning}} and pitched five innings of the two-hit, one-run game. He struck out five <b>batters</b> but walked six. Richard {{struggled}} in his two following starts. In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place Atlanta Braves, Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine <b>batters</b> and even struck out the side in the first inning but also walked four <b>batters.</b> Furthermore, he threw two wild pitches in the first and fifth innings. In his final game of the season, against the Giants, Richard was replaced in the first inning after pitching to only four <b>batters.</b>|$|E
5|$|His career MLB {{batting average}} (.207) is tied with John Henry {{for the seventh}} lowest all-time among <b>batters</b> with at least 1,000 at bats.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{was born}} in Mission Viejo, California on June 24, 1986, and {{attended}} Foothill High School in Santa Ana, California, {{where he was a}} first-team High School All-American pitcher and had one perfect game. In his junior year (2003), he had a 12–0 record and posted an 0.78 earned run average (ERA) while striking out 85 <b>batters</b> in 72 innings. In his senior year (2004), he had an 0.69 ERA and a 9–1 record. In 61 innings, he gave up 41 hits and three walks while striking out 83 <b>batters.</b>|$|E
50|$|If the <b>batter</b> {{tips the}} ball and the catcher catches it then the next <b>batter</b> on that team is out in {{addition}} to the <b>batter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{facing an}} {{opposing}} <b>batter,</b> {{there is no}} way of telling if the <b>batter</b> is a switch hitter or not. For example, if a left-handed pitcher is brought in to pitch to a left-handed <b>batter,</b> the <b>batter</b> may simply switch to batting right-handed after the pitching change.|$|R
5000|$|In clutch situations, the {{opposing}} team will often walk a poor <b>batter</b> intentionally, then pitch to a better <b>batter</b> rather than attempting to get the poor <b>batter</b> out.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, López {{matched his}} career high with 77 appearances, setting new career-bests with a 1.60 ERA and 0.89 WHIP. He struck out 26 <b>batters</b> in 39 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|In 36 relief {{appearances}} in 2006, {{he had an}} ERA of 3.92. In games that were late and close, Feldman held the sixteen <b>batters</b> he faced hitless.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2009, Kershaw pitched seven innings, {{striking}} out 13 <b>batters</b> while allowing only one hit (a solo home run) against the rival San Francisco Giants. He {{was the youngest}} Dodger to ever strikeout 13 or more <b>batters</b> in a game since Sandy Koufax {{did it in the}} 1955 season. On May 17, 2009, Kershaw did not allow a hit against the Florida Marlins through 7 innings, then gave up a lead-off double to Florida's Cody Ross. In 2009, despite an 8–8 record, he led the major leagues in opposing batting average (.200), opposing slugging percentage (.282), and hits per nine innings (6.26). He also posted an ERA of 2.79 and 185 strikeouts. Kershaw also walked 91 <b>batters,</b> which was second most in the National League (NL).|$|E
50|$|Betty Botter {{bought some}} butter, But, she said, The butter's bitter; If I {{put it in}} my <b>batter</b> It will make my <b>batter</b> bitter. But, a bit of better butter Will make my <b>batter</b> better. So, she bought a bit of butter Better than her bitter butter, And she put it in her <b>batter</b> And the <b>batter</b> was not bitter. So, 'twas better Betty Botter Bought a bit of better butter.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>batter</b> is out if: {{three strikes}} are called (a [...] "strikeout"); a ball {{hit by the}} <b>batter</b> is caught before {{touching}} the ground (a [...] "flyout"); the <b>batter</b> goes to a base that is already tagged ("tagged" [...] or [...] "tag play"); a fielder holding the ball touches a base {{which is the only}} base towards which the <b>batter</b> may run before the <b>batter</b> arrives there (a [...] "force out" [...] or [...] "force play"); or in certain special circumstances. There is also a not so common occurrence when the <b>batter</b> has 2 strikes and swings at strike three. If the catcher doesn't catch the ball, the <b>batter</b> has the chance to run to first base and the catcher can throw the <b>batter</b> out at first base.|$|R
50|$|When a <b>batter</b> {{leaves the}} post, each runner on a base may {{run to the}} next and {{succeeding}} base. A post runner cannot be declared out when standing at a base. The <b>batter</b> must keep {{in contact with the}} base to avoid being declared out. A rounder is scored if one of the batting team completes a circuit without being out. The Rounders England rules state that a half rounder is scored if half a circuit is completed by a player without being put out, or if the <b>batter</b> has not hit the ball but makes {{it all the way to}} the fourth base. A <b>batter</b> is out if a fielder catches the ball cleanly; the <b>batter</b> reaches a base that had been 'stumped' (touched while holding the ball) by a fielder; the bat is dropped whilst the <b>batter</b> is running; the <b>batter</b> leaves the base before the bowler has bowled the ball; or the <b>batter</b> is 'run out' (overtaken) by the next <b>batter.</b>|$|R
5|$|On August 11 at AT Park, Bumgarner {{pitched a}} {{complete}} game 3–1 {{victory over the}} Houston Astros where he struck out twelve and walked none. During the outing, he struck out a career-high seven straight <b>batters</b> to tie a San Francisco record with Juan Marichal and Jonathan Sánchez. On August 16, he tied his career-high by striking out fourteen <b>batters,</b> including striking out that year's National League MVP Bryce Harper a career-high three times, hit a home run, and pitched a complete game shutout against the Washington Nationals. He became the first Giants left-handed pitcher to record multiple fourteen-strikeout games in a single season and career, and joined Juan Marichal as the only Giants pitchers in the San Francisco Era to strike out ten or more <b>batters,</b> hit a home run, and record a shutout in the same game. Bumgarner was honored {{for the first time}} in his career with National League Player of the Week honors.|$|E
5|$|On June 12 at AT Park, in a 6-3 {{win over}} the Houston Astros, Bumgarner hit his first career home run into left field off of Bud Norris. After May 14, the Giants went sixteen home games without hitting a home run until Bumgarner hit his first. Bumgarner also struck out twelve <b>batters,</b> {{becoming}} the most recent Giant to {{hit a home run}} and strikeout ten or more <b>batters</b> in the same game since Mike Krukow, who was announcing the game.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, 1999, Chili Davis' second-inning {{home run}} {{was the only}} hit by the Yankees against Pedro Martínez, who struck out 17 Yankees—the most strikeouts against a Yankee team ever. Martínez retired the last 22 <b>batters</b> after giving up the home run, {{including}} striking out eight of the final nine <b>batters.</b> The teams finished first and second in their division and both made the playoffs in the same season. This led to the very first post-season meeting in the longtime rivalry.|$|E
25|$|The <b>battered</b> person {{defense is}} a defense used {{in court that}} the person accused of an assault/murder was {{suffering}} from <b>battered</b> person syndrome at the material time. Because the defense is most commonly used by women, it is usually characterised in court as <b>battered</b> woman syndrome or <b>battered</b> wife syndrome.|$|R
5000|$|At San Jose Giants home games, a <b>batter</b> {{from the}} {{opposing}} team is designated the [...] "beer batter." [...] If the San Jose pitcher strikes out that <b>batter,</b> beer is half price in the beer only lines for the 15 minutes immediately following the strike out. The beer <b>batter</b> promotion is in effect only {{for the first six}} innings of the game. The PA system plays Beer Barrel Polka whenever the beer <b>batter</b> comes to the plate and after every strike during the beer <b>batter's</b> at-bat (through the first six innings). After the sixth inning, the beer <b>batter</b> becomes the apple juice <b>batter</b> and if he strikes out, fans get half-priced Martinelli's apple juice.|$|R
50|$|Tap the <b>batter</b> for swing. You should hit a ball timely to {{get more}} score.When a ball comes over the <b>batter,</b> tap the area above the <b>batter</b> for JUMP SWING.|$|R
5|$|On September 9, 1965, Koufax {{became the}} sixth pitcher {{of the modern}} era, and eighth overall, to throw a perfect game, the first by a {{left-hander}} since 1880. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, setting a Major League record (subsequently broken by Nolan Ryan). Koufax struck out 14 <b>batters,</b> {{at the time the}} most recorded in a perfect game (now tied by Matt Cain). The game also featured a quality performance by the opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley of the Cubs. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two <b>batters</b> to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{days after}} {{pitching}} his last high school game, Clyde {{won his first}} ever Major League start before over 35,000 fans in Arlington Stadium, the first sellout in stadium history. After a poor start in which he walked the first two <b>batters</b> he faced, he settled down, pitched five innings, giving up only one hit (a home run to Mike Adams) while striking out eight <b>batters</b> in a 4–3 victory over the Minnesota Twins. Clyde later called it his most memorable game in his Major League career.|$|E
5|$|After {{attending}} {{spring training}} with the Yankees in 2006, Hughes began {{the season with}} Tampa. He was promoted to the Double-A Trenton Thunder of the Eastern League {{at the beginning of}} May after he had a 2–3 record and a 1.80 ERA with Tampa while striking out 30 <b>batters</b> in 30 innings.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the term “leadoff hitter” can be used interchangeably to {{describe}} not only the first <b>batter</b> on the lineup card, but also the first <b>batter</b> up in any particular inning. For example, if, in the second inning, the fifth <b>batter</b> in the lineup card is the first <b>batter</b> up, it will be said that he is leading off or that he is the leadoff <b>batter</b> for that particular inning.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>battered</b> sausage is a {{standard}} menu item in fish and chip shops across Great Britain, often described as an [...] "essential" [...] staple of the fish and chip shop menu. They consist of a pork sausage dipped in <b>batter</b> (usually the same <b>batter</b> used to <b>batter</b> fish), and usually served with chips.|$|R
50|$|Whenever an {{opposing}} <b>batter</b> would line {{one of his}} pitches back toward the mound, Wynn would retaliate by throwing a brushback pitch at the <b>batter</b> {{the next time the}} <b>batter</b> faced him.|$|R
5|$|After going 25–2 in {{his first}} two years of college baseball, he was drafted in the 30th round by the Texas Rangers in 2003. Feldman had Tommy John surgery later that year. He {{followed}} it up with a minor league career in which he had a 2.70 ERA, and held <b>batters</b> to only 6.6 hits per 9 innings, pitching almost exclusively in relief.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} a July 4 {{game against the}} Braves (which he won), Richard was sent into the bullpen to add Tom Griffin into the Astros' starting rotation. He made three relief appearances against the Montreal Expos before making a start against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 27. Four days later, Richard threw his first shutout against the Dodgers, in which he gave up just five hits and struck out nine <b>batters.</b> Nineteen days later, Richard pitched another complete game, this time giving up two runs while striking out nine and walking three <b>batters.</b> He concluded the season with six wins and two losses in 16 total games, 10 of which he started. He finished with a 4.00ERA, and struck out 75batters in 72innings. He walked 38batters, giving him a ratio of 4.75walks per nine innings, which was lower than the ratio he had had in his two previous minor league seasons.|$|E
5|$|Bresnahan {{was known}} for baiting umpires. He and McGraw were often ejected from games, suspended, and on a few {{occasions}} escorted from the field by police. A 1911 directive by NL president Thomas Lynch, compelling umpires to prevent catchers from antagonizing <b>batters</b> with verbal abuse, mentioned only Bresnahan by name.|$|E
40|$|A <b>batter</b> is {{provided}} comprising flour, water and optionally starch, wherein the <b>batter</b> comprises glutenin particles having a volume surface averaged particle size smaller than 10 [mu]m. A <b>batter</b> {{according to the}} invention comprises flour and optionally starch, and optionally baking powder and salt. At least 95 vol. % of all particles comprised in the <b>batter</b> have a particle size of 100 [mu]m or less. It appears that such a <b>batter</b> provides very crispy coatings to (deep-) fried products...|$|R
50|$|In the {{hit-and-run}} play, coaches {{coordinate the}} actions of runner and <b>batter.</b> The runner tries to steal and the <b>batter</b> swings at almost any pitch, if only to distract the catcher. If the <b>batter</b> makes contact, the runner has a greater chance of reaching the next base; if the <b>batter</b> gets a base hit, the runner {{may be able to}} take an extra base. If the <b>batter</b> fails to hit the ball, the hit-and-run becomes a pure steal attempt.|$|R
50|$|Strikes are {{desirable}} for the pitcher and the fielding team, as three strikes {{result in a}} strikeout of that <b>batter.</b> A pitch that misses the strike zone is called a ball(only if <b>batter</b> doesn't swing). Balls are {{desirable for}} the <b>batter</b> and the batting team, as four balls allow the <b>batter</b> to take a base on balls.|$|R
