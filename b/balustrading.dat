5|$|The {{original}} {{approach to}} the house {{would have been far}} more impressive than the picturesque approach today. The east front was then the entrance façade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate <b>balustrading,</b> which with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtyard}} was rebuilt, {{the architect}} Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble <b>balustrading</b> {{on the upper}} level. Today the upper arcades are known as the Galerie d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honoré II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On {{the other side of}} the courtyard a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its external walls with frescoes. It is thought that the galleries (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.|$|E
5|$|As in England, {{commissions}} of new statuary {{tended to}} be made in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99) who produced a monument for Robert Dundas (d. 1787) at Borthwick Church and one for Mrs Allardyce (d. 1787) at West Church, Aberdeen. Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coade stone was used for sphinxes, <b>balustrading,</b> capitals, coat of arms, tablets, ornamental vases, church monuments and fonts. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Register House, Edinburgh, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. As well as supplying sculpture, candelabra and cippi, the Adam family supplied designs to the Carron Company, founded in 1759, which produced a wide range of iron products, including stoves, safes, vases and tablets.|$|E
50|$|Either made of metal, {{sandwich}} panel, or glass, the <b>balustrade</b> {{supports the}} handrails of the escalator. It also provides additional {{protection for the}} handrail and passengers. Some escalators have direction arrows {{on the ends of}} the <b>balustrade.</b> Escalators' on/off buttons are frequently located at the ends of the <b>balustrade.</b> Moving walkways often use <b>balustrades</b> in the same way.|$|R

50|$|The dragon <b>balustrade</b> {{is another}} kind of stone carvings which portray the Makara (dragon). These artworks used to {{decorate}} the entrance of Buddhist stupas, temples and Bo trees. There are two <b>balustrades</b> at main entrance of Lankatilaka Viharaya in Kandy and they are sometimes called Gajasinha <b>balustrades</b> because of {{the shape of the}} Makara there.|$|R
5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century the {{development}} of the Grand Tour took young Scottish aristocrats to the continent, particularly Rome, which was home to the exiled Jacobite Stuarts. This in turn fuelled interest in classical and Renaissance styles, and the buying of artistic works, particularly sculptures. However, the only major Scottish collection of marble before the nineteenth century was that of James Johnstone, 2nd Marquess of Annandale. As in England, commissions of new statuary tended to be crafted in relatively cheap lead and even more economical painted or gilded plaster. The plasterwork of John Cheere's yard in London was particularly in demand. Also important was the work from the yard of John Bacon (1740–99). Bacon was also a partner in Mrs Eleanor Coade's Artificial Stone Manufactory at Lambeth in London. This produced a buff coloured ceramic that could be moulded to provide fine detail, and be fired in sections, but was impervious to frost and fire. Much cheaper than carved stone, Coadstone was used for sphinxes, <b>balustrading,</b> capitals, coats of arms, tablets and ornamental vases. It was used extensively by the Adam brothers, particularly in the houses they built in Scotland, such as Cullen, Banff, Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, Dunbar Castle, East Lothian, Gosford House, East Lothian and Wedderburn, Berwickshire. They also supplied sculpture, candelabra and cippi that made up the neo-classical Adam Style.|$|E
25|$|Later {{examples}} of the Italianate style in England tend to {{take the form of}} Palladian-style building often enhanced by a belvedere tower complete with Renaissance-type <b>balustrading</b> at the roof level. This is generally a more stylistic interpretation of what architects and patrons imagined to be the case in Italy, and utilises more obviously the Italian Renaissance motifs than those earlier {{examples of}} the Italianate style by Nash.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{earliest}} {{of the surviving}} ringside stands, located on the northwest side of the Main Arena. It is a substantial brick structure with a gambrel roof. In {{the centre of the}} roof is a large fleche with cupola and four-faced clock which can be seen from much of the showgrounds. The roof of the stand, which has been re-clad with a recent corrugated metal sheeting, is supported on early light steel trusses and round cast metal columns with cast-iron brackets and valances along the front and sides. Between the arc of the central bay is a large sign with the lettering: JOHN MACDONALD STAND. The sides and front of the stand have a decorative cast-iron <b>balustrading.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is located at}} {{the south side of the}} house. There is an open porch, built in 1800. Over the steps to the {{main entrance}}, a <b>balustraded</b> balcony is supported by two pillars. A semicircular <b>balustrade</b> runs from the bottom of the steps to the edge of the south walls of the west and east wings. This <b>balustrade</b> matches that on the porch balcony.|$|R
50|$|Rudolf Wittkower {{withheld}} judgement as to {{the inventor}} of the baluster and credited Giuliano da Sangallo with using it consistently as early as the <b>balustrade</b> on the terrace and stairs at the Medici villa at Poggio a Caiano (c. 1480), and used <b>balustrades</b> in his reconstructions of antique structures. Sangallo passed the motif to Bramante (his Tempietto, 1502) and Michelangelo, through whom <b>balustrades</b> gained wide currency in the 16th century.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{originally}} had thick stone <b>balustrades,</b> with very narrow pedestrian gangways beside them. The <b>balustrades</b> were replaced in 1732 with thinner slabs of sandstone, widening the roadway. In 1877 these were in turn replaced with granite from Flossenbürg, and the wooden ramp which had connected {{the bridge to}} the Upper Wöhrd since 1499 was replaced with an iron one at the same time. Finally, in 1950, the bridge was given concrete <b>balustrades.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the mid 19th century Brympton d'Evercy was {{the home}} of Lady Georgiana Fane, a single lady of modest means who had no need of a large and lavish household. Thus the house was not given the Victorian wings given so {{carelessly}} to so many of Britain's historic houses. Lady Georgiana confined herself to improvements in the gardens and grounds. She added a balustrade to the walls enclosing the forecourt {{in front of the}} west facade; the walls, topped by <b>balustrading,</b> link the priest house, churchyard on the south side, and clock-tower and stables on the north. The effect was to create what in a grander house than Brympton d'Evercy would be known as a cour d'honneur. Entered through great gate piers crowned by urns (see illustration top of page) the cour d'honneur effect is softened, and de-formalised by lawns and some very English style flower beds. The broad gravel terrace along {{the full extent of the}} south front was also created at this time, along with the large pond which reflects it. Other than necessary restoration work, and installation of modern plumbing and electricity, little has been added to the house since the 19th century. It is now recognised by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E

It is capped by {{openwork}} <b>balustrading</b> matching the parapets which are from the 19th century. There are two-light late-14th-century windows on all sides at bell-ringing and bell-chamber levels, the latter having fine pierced stonework grilles. There is a stair turret to the north-west corner, with a Weather vane termination. The tower contains two bells dating from 1728 and made by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Chew Stoke. The [...] "Great Bell" [...] was recast from [...] to [...] It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.|$|E
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the front elevation comprises a central verandah, which is now enclosed with the <b>balustrades</b> intact and sheeted over, and a protruding bay on the western end. The eastern elevation also comprises an enclosed verandah with intact <b>balustrades</b> {{and the location of}} the separate surgery access is evident, although the stairs to this have been removed. Verandah detailing consists of simple and elegant timber brackets and <b>balustrades</b> typical of Dod's style.|$|R
50|$|At {{the landing}} {{next to this}} window the stairs divide. They are girded by an iron <b>balustrade</b> with bronze railing. The {{stairwell}} is further <b>balustraded</b> with a stylized compass {{in the center and}} a wave beneath the rail.|$|R

2500|$|The {{principal}} facade is {{the long}} West {{facade of the}} corps de logis and its flanking pavilions. Built of Bath stone, the three-storied rectangular corps de logis has a rusticated ground floor, with a piano nobile above and a bedroom floor above this. This block is of seven bays; the central three bays are behind a recessed Ionic portico. Entrance to the mansion is by three segmented arches under the portico, or more formally, by climbing a double curved staircase behind the three arches. The stairs rise to an open loggia beneath the portico which gives access to the mansion's principal entrance. The [...] is designed to indicate the status of their floor. Thus, small windows indicate the domestic ground floor and secondary upper floor, while {{the windows of the}} first floor piano nobile are tall and large. These larger windows are unified along the full length of the facade extending on to the pavilions by a <b>balustrading</b> beneath them which continues the line of the <b>balustrading</b> protecting the central loggia. The roofline is concealed by a high parapet concealing the roofs themselves and broken only by the portico's pediment. This pediment is echoed as a smaller pediment over both of the two-storied pavilions.|$|E

50|$|In 2004, {{the species}} {{was found in}} Buckinghamshire, southeastern England, in the crevices of a {{travertine}} marble and brick <b>balustrade.</b> This <b>balustrade</b> was originally constructed in Italy in about 1816, and had stood in {{the grounds of the}} Villa Borghese, in Rome. In the late 19th century the <b>balustrade</b> was taken from there, and was installed in the formal gardens of the country house Cliveden in 1896. Since 1942, Cliveden has been owned by the National Trust.|$|R
50|$|At {{the extreme}} body, {{the door is}} flanked by two narrow windows crowned and surmounted by two windows, with varanda and <b>balustrade.</b> The facade is surmounted by a cornice {{supported}} by corbels adorned with acanthus leaves, preceding a simple articulated parapet with <b>balustrade.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Trinity Church (1893) has {{probably}} the most distinctive architecture style amongst the churches in the City of Perth, which are predominantly in the Gothic idiom. [...] Trinity is of Romanesque Revival style. The church follows {{the fall of the}} land, with its foundations stepping southwards to St Georges Terrace. The main facade of the church incorporates twin flanking towers capped by octagonal spires roofed in slate, a rose window and large entrance portal. [...] The interior is of note for its galleries and their cast iron <b>balustrading</b> and stained glass by Ashwin of Sydney.|$|E
2500|$|On its opening, {{the church}} was {{described}} as [...] "embod many of the latest ideas of ecclesiastical architecture". The diocesan publication the Church Chronicle praised the [...] "pleasing and dignified design" [...] and the wider windows and roof ventilation system used to keep the building cool. Other ventilation features were a pair of doorways {{on both sides of}} the nave enclosed by <b>balustrading,</b> and metal grilles in the chancel window sills, allowing air to be drawn in through the walls. In January 1925 the Church Chronicle published internal and external images of St Paul's, [...] "in order that other parishes may be inspired to friendly rivalry with the people of East Brisbane and desire to do similar good work".|$|E
2500|$|The Staircase Hall is at {{the centre}} of the house and is {{considered}} to be one of Carr's [...] "most monumental interiors." [...] Typically of this period, the double height room is lit by a clerestory while the wide cantilevered staircase, the Great Staircase, rises in flights around three of the four walls, to a gallery. The <b>balustrading</b> of the staircase and landing is of gilded wrought iron adorned with medallions with classical motifs which were heavily restored in 1952. The groundfloor walls beneath the gallery are decorated with some of Carr's neoclassical plasterwork depicted in white against the eau de nil colour of the walls. Recent analysis of the paint has shown that the walls were originally a pale stone colour and the staircase balustrade was painted blue with gilded figures on the (blue) plaques.|$|E
50|$|The {{cantilevered}} concrete {{staircase to}} the gallery has a metal <b>balustrade</b> with circle ornamentation. The gallery is a stepped concrete slab surrounded by a solid <b>balustrade,</b> which is ornamented with cover strips in a pattern of lines and rectangles on the auditorium side.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} widely copied {{features}} of Renaissance architecture were the great staircases from the chateaux of Blois and Chambord. Blois had been the favourite residence of the French Kings throughout the renaissance. The Francis I wing, completed in 1524, [...] of which the staircase is an integral part was one of the earliest examples of French Renaissance. French renaissance architecture was a combination of the earlier Gothic style coupled with a strong Italian influence represented by arches, arcades, <b>balustrading</b> and, in general, a more flowing line of design than had been apparent in the earlier Gothic. The Chateau de Blois's triumphal staircase was imitated almost from the moment of its completion, and was certainly the predecessor of the [...] "double staircase" [...] (sometimes attributed to Leonardo da Vinci) at the Château de Chambord just a few years later.|$|E
2500|$|The facade {{facing the}} Campo San Geremia is of equal splendour to {{that on the}} Cannaregio. [...] The Grand Canal facade is the smaller of the three, set back from the fondamenta itself and of only three bays. [...] The palazzo is of five floors. [...] The ground and first floors are both low, the first being rusticated, the next two floors the piano nobile and the secondo piano, have tall {{segmented}} windows separated by pilasters, the tall windows are fenced by balustraded balconettes. [...] The fifth floor is a low mezzanine beneath the projecting hipped roof, here the small oval windows are divided by the heraldic eagles of the Labia family. [...] The facade on the Campo San Geremia designed by Tremignon which hints at the more floral Venetian Gothic style contrasts to the more classical canal facades. [...] However the Venetian Gothic {{is more of a}} subtle suggestion than defining style, the typical central recessed loggias of the piano nobili, typical features of the Venetian Gothic, are however glazed, and the roof line, unlike on the water fronts, is concealed by classical <b>balustrading,</b> but the repetition and placing of the fenestration continues the theme of the canal facades.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was built}} all of timber, with the piles being driven {{straight}} into the sea bed; it was [...] "considered {{at the time the}} best specimen of pile-driving", and described as a [...] "pier and breakwater". There was curved stone <b>balustrading</b> at the entrance, taken from old London Bridge which was demolished in 1831. [...] A sail trolley vehicle running on tracks, powered by sail and foot and nicknamed Neptune's Car, ran the length of the pier from 13 June 1833, carrying passengers and baggage. When wind was inadequate as commonly happened, pier employees physically pushed the trolley. The pier's length was defined by the one-fathom draught of the paddle steamers and the shallow two-fathom depth of the sea even three quarters of a mile offshore at high tide. It was followed in 1861 by the railway station, and thus began the town's growth into a holiday resort. However, because the wooden piles were never protected by copper sheathing they suffered from shipworm. By 1850, many piles had been replaced with iron ones, or with wooden ones [...] "prepared by Mr Payne's process" [...] against shipworm, but as a whole they showed irreversible deterioration from 1860 onwards. Pier dues were considered expensive at 1s 6d. Subsequently, the first Herne Bay Pier Company failed due to competition between paddle steamers and the new railway which was opened on 13 July 1861, because previously most visitors arrived by steamer, then they all arrived by rail. The first pier was taken down in 1870 to 1871, long after the paddle steamers stopped coming in 1862.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has a symmetrical elevation facing Julius Street to the southeast, {{which consists of}} a central section surmounted by a decorative shaped gable parapet, with projecting enclosed sleep-outs to either side. The sleep-outs have casement windows above <b>balustrade</b> height, and different overall detailing to each floor; the ground floor has recessed arches {{to the front and}} side; the first floor has a rectangular moulding to the <b>balustrade</b> section; and the second floor has an infilled lattice pattern to the <b>balustrade</b> section.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{front and}} rear upper {{verandah}}s have a simple two-rail dowel <b>balustrade,</b> and timber posts support both {{the upper and lower}} verandahs. The front upper verandah's <b>balustrade</b> is a recent (metal) replica. The lower front verandah has a deep valance of corrugated galvanized iron, with a (non-original) shark-tooth pattern along the bottom edge, and the painted lettering [...] "EINASLEIGH HOTEL". Above the <b>balustrade</b> on the upper rear verandah there are pivoting panels of corrugated iron, which can be opened for ventilation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1906, American painter John Singer Sargent {{completed}} an oil {{painting of the}} exterior staircase and <b>balustrade</b> of the church. [...] Sargent described the ensemble as [...] "a magnificent curved staircase and <b>balustrade,</b> leading to a grand façade that would reduce a millionaire to a worm". [...] Sargent used the architectural features from this painting later in a portrait of Charles William Eliot, President of Harvard University. [...] Sargent also made several preliminary pencil sketches of the <b>balustrade</b> and staircase.|$|R
