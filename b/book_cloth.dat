50|$|The best {{shelving}} {{for books}} is baked enamel steel shelving that stands away from exterior walls. Average size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side {{so they can}} support each other. If a book {{is removed from the}} shelf, it may be replaced with a foam block to maintain verticality. Shelves should not be overpacked. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum. Books should be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion as well as to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in <b>book</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E
