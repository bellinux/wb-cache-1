Additional measurements at SLAC followed, in which the heat produced by 20-GeV electrons was measured in 1982. A <b>beam</b> <b>dump</b> of water-cooled aluminium was employed as calorimeter. The results were in agreement with special relativity, even though the accuracy was only 30%.However, the experimentalists alluded to the fact, that calorimetric tests with 10-GeV electrons were executed already in 1969.

40|$|The LHC <b>beam</b> <b>dumping</b> {{system must}} safely abort the LHC beams under all conditions, {{including}} those resulting from abnormal behaviour of machine elements or subsystems of the <b>beam</b> <b>dumping</b> system itself.

These requirements impose tight constraints on the tolerances of various extraction channel components, and also on the allowed range of beam positions {{in the region of}} these components. Operation of the <b>beam</b> <b>dumping</b> system under various fault states has been considered, and the resulting apertures calculated.

50|$|At {{the conference}} room they meet Lisa, who was {{supposed}} to be in Barcelona for a conference but missed her flight due to the party. The Director General addresses the attendees and informs them that the previous night there was a <b>beam</b> <b>dump</b> in LHC. The <b>beam</b> <b>dump</b> occurred because the beam sensors had detected that the monopole magnet at LHC segment 11G had quenched due to an unknown event, which triggered the LHC to shut down. He further warns that, if the event occurs again, there could be a catastrophic accident at CERN. Dr. Niven is selected to take a team of technicians down to the LHC tunnel to investigate the cause of the incident and try to get the LHC running again. The Director General requests four volunteers to be in the control room while Dr. Niven is busy. Connor volunteers for the task and the Director General selects Connor, James, Amy and Lisa. Lisa bails out, informing the Director General that she has to attend a conference in Barcelona, so Matt is selected instead.|$|E
50|$|An optical <b>beam</b> <b>dump</b> is {{an optical}} element used to absorb {{a beam of}} light. Major design {{concerns}} in a <b>beam</b> <b>dump</b> typically include the management and reduction of back reflections and scattering {{as well as the}} dissipation of heat generated by absorption. For low-power systems and less demanding applications, the device {{can be as simple as}} a piece of black velvet or flock paper glued onto a stiff backing, but higher-power beam dumps must often incorporate more elaborate features to avoid back-reflection, overheating, or excessive noise. Dumping the beam with a simple flat surface may scatter unacceptably large amounts of light for some applications, even though the direct reflection may be effectively reduced. To minimize scattering, it is common to use deep, dark cavities lined with an absorbing material to dump the beam. A particularly simple and relatively inexpensive approach is to use a stack of razor blades with the sharp edges facing the beam, so that the spaces between the blades form very deep cavities from which little light escapes.|$|E
50|$|A {{commonly}} available type of <b>beam</b> <b>dump</b> {{suitable for}} most medium-power lasers is a cone of aluminum with greater diameter than the beam, anodized {{to a black}} color and enclosed in a canister with a black, ribbed interior. Only {{the point of the}} cone is exposed to the beam head-on; mostly, incoming light grazes the cone at an angle, which eases performance requirements. Any reflections from this black surface are then absorbed by the canister. The ribs both help to make light less likely to escape, and improve heat transfer to the surrounding air.|$|E
40|$|The LHC <b>beam</b> <b>dumping</b> {{system must}} protect the LHC machine from damage by {{reliably}} and safely extracting and absorbing the circulating beams when requested. Two sets of 15 extraction kicker magnets form the main active {{part of this}} system. They have been produced, tested and calibrated by measuring the integrated magnetic field and the magnet current at different beam energies. The calibration data have been analysed, and the critical parameters are compared with the specifications.

40|$|An {{internal}} <b>beam</b> <b>dumping</b> {{system is}} needed for the SPS, {{in order to prevent}} uncontrolled loss of the beam in the accelerator. Several possible dumping schemes have been studied and compared in Ref. (1), and the method using fast kicker magnets has been chosen. The <b>beam</b> <b>dumping</b> system will use a pair of kicker magnets, which deflect the beam verti-cally onto the absorber blocks, and the <b>beam</b> will be <b>dumped</b> in one SPS revolution. It has been shown$^{(1) }$ that dumping a ow emittance beam of 10 $^{ 13 }$ ppp at 400 GeV/c leads to severe thermal problems in the absorber blocks. In particular, <b>dumping</b> the <b>beam</b> with fast kickers induces in the absorber blocks instantaneous temperature rises. These depend on the proton density distributions in the beam and the material used for the block and can be at least as high as l 000 $^{°}$C in case of aluminium. Although the values of these temperature spikes cannot be calculated with good accuracy, they are certainly higher than permitted for a reliable absorber block design. It is not possible to blow up the <b>beam</b> before the <b>dumping</b> process starts in order to reduce these spikes,as this is not compatible with a fast emergency <b>beam</b> <b>dumping</b> system. It is therefore necessary to spread the beam over the front surface of the absorber block during the 23 µs long dumping process...|$|R
