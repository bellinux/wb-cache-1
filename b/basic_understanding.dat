However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects as tools in the wild, they can be trained to use objects as tools in captivity and demonstrate a <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{played a}} role in the <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> of the nature of atoms in 1913, when J. J. Thomson, as part of his {{exploration}} into the composition of canal rays, channeled streams of neon ions through a magnetic and an electric field and measured the deflection of the streams with a photographic plate. Thomson observed two separate patches of light on the photographic plate (see image), which suggested two different parabolas of deflection. Thomson eventually concluded that some of the atoms in the neon gas were of higher mass than the rest. Though not understood at the time by Thomson, this was the first discovery of isotopes of stable atoms. Thomson's device was a crude version of the instrument we now term a mass spectrometer.|$|E

5|$|Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's {{review in}} BioSocieties journal, {{acknowledges}} that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in {{a black and white}} manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.|$|E

In studying the material for the next day's lessons, Chabaneau taught himself algebra and geometry. His academic interest soon spread to physics, natural history, and chemistry. At the age of twenty, Chabaneau was convinced to join the newly established Real Seminario Patriotico at Vergara to teach French and physics by brothers Fausto and Juan José Elhuyar. The two brothers, who later made a name for themselves by isolating metallic tungsten, had been hired by the Count of Peñaflorida, who had sent them to France to find professors for the Vergara Seminary.|$|E

Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E

5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a <b>basic</b> <b>understanding</b> of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of a required mathematics content course upon prospective elementary school teachers at Brigham Young University. The investigation consisted of three major areas: (1) attitudes toward mathematics, (2) <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>understanding,</b> and (3) the relationship between certain selected variables. Procedure Pre- and post- tests of <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>understanding</b> and attitudes toward mathematics were given to the 186 students enrolled in a required mathematics content course at Brigham Young University during fall semester 1964. A personal data sheet was completed by each student to obtain background information. A Test of <b>Basic</b> Mathematical <b>Understanding</b> developed by Vincent J. Glennon was used to measure the <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>understandings</b> possessed by the student and Wilbur H. Dutton's Arithmetic Attitude Scale was used to measure the students' attitudes toward mathematics. A t -test for matched groups was used to determine if the changes in attitudes and mathematical understandings were significant. A product - moment correlation was used to determine if a relationship existed between certain selected variables. Item analysis was used to determine the areas of change in attitudes toward mathematics and <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>understanding.</b> Findings There was a significant improvement in attitudes toward mathematics and <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>understanding</b> while the students were enrolled in this mathematics course. The t -ratio was significant at the. 001 level of confidence. The following variables were found to have a positive significant relationship at the. 001 level of confidence: 1. Pre -test attitude scores and final grades. Z. Post -test attitude scores and final grades. 3. Pre -test scores on mathematical understanding and final grades. grades. 4. Post -test scores on mathematical understanding and final 5. American College Test mathematics scores and pre -test scores on mathematical understanding. The following variables were found to have no significant relationship at the. 05 level of confidence: 1. Pre -test attitude scores and change in mathematical understanding. 2. Changes in attitudes and changes in mathematical understanding. Conclusions The following conclusions were drawn from this study: 1. Most prospective elementary school teachers liked some aspects of mathematics and disliked others. 2. The attitudes of prospective elementary school teachers toward mathematics were improved by taking this course. 3. There was a significant gain in <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>understanding</b> by prospective elementary school teachers while they were taking this course. 4. Attitudes toward mathematics and <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>understanding</b> were significantly related to success in this course as measured by the final grade. 5. There was no significant relationship between attitudes toward mathematics and change in <b>basic</b> mathematical <b>understanding</b> while students were enrolled in this course. 6. The American College Test mathematics score is a good predictor of success in this course as measured by the final grade...|$|R
