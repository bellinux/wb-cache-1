5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 <b>brake</b> <b>horsepower</b> compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.|$|E
25|$|The car's 3-phase AC {{induction}} {{electric motor}} produced 137 <b>brake</b> <b>horsepower</b> (102kW) at 7000 rpm. Like electric trains and all vehicles {{with an electric}} motor (and unlike a car powered by an internal combustion engine), the EV1 could deliver its full torque capacity throughout its power band, producing 110 pound-feet (149 newton-meters) of torque anywhere between 0 and 7000 rpm, allowing the omission of a manual or automatic gearbox. Power was delivered to the front wheels through a single-speed reduction integrated transmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{unit has}} its own RHIB navy {{transport}} speedboat with the capacity of holding ten passengers and able to travel at 60+ knots, two engines with 250 <b>brake</b> <b>horsepower</b> to increase its maritime operational capabilities. On 11 July 2007, the RMP purchased 10 units of Marine Alutech Watercat M14 PSC class landing craft vessels from Marine Alutech OY AB Service with 22 passengers capacity and 30 knots speed, possibly equipped with 12.7mm NSV machinegun, 40mm grenade machinegun and 120m Patria NEMO mortar for use by marine police as well as UNGERIN operatives for amphibious assault duties even in shallow waters. The boats are built by Geliga Slipway Sdn Bhd in Malaysia. The boats are to be supplied in 2008-2009.|$|E
30|$|When a VSD unit is used {{to control}} the ESP systemâ€™s liquid rate the {{different}} components of the system behave differently as the driving frequency is adjusted. The centrifugal pump will develop different head values and will need different <b>brake</b> <b>horsepowers</b> from the electric motor. All these changes are described by the pump performance curves valid at variable frequencies usually available from manufacturers. In case such curves are missing, the Affinity Laws (Takacs 2009; 1997) and the performance curves at a constant frequency {{may be used to}} calculate the required parameters at the reduced frequency: heads, efficiencies, and <b>brake</b> <b>horsepowers.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study of log truck travel speeds in three locations in Western Oregon on favorable grades and curves. Independent variables of grade, curve radius, width, ditch depth, superelevation, sight distance, time of day, and maximum engine <b>braking</b> <b>horsepower</b> were regressed against speed. Only grade and curve radius were found to be important variables affecting speed. Regression equations are presented for both the empty and loaded trucks. Speeds were found to be independent of grade for favorable grades less than 11 percent and strongly influenced by grades steeper than this. On sections of road not controlled by alignment, the method of Byrne et al., 1960 (BNG) and the Vehicle Operating Cost Model (VOCN), Sullivan, 1977 were shown to predict downhill speed...|$|R
5000|$|Only the Starfire coupe {{was offered}} for 1966 as the {{convertible}} was discontinued for this final year for that nameplate as a full-sized sporty/luxury coupe. The Starfire price and equipment level both dropped considerably from previous {{years and was}} now {{at the same level}} as the former Jetstar I series with a less plush interior thanks to the leather seats being replaced by Morroceen vinyl for both the Strato bucket seats or no-cost optional notchback bench seat, and the movement of power windows and seats from standard equipment to the option list. Also downgraded from standard to optional equipment were the Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, power steering and power <b>brakes.</b> <b>Horsepower</b> was up to 375, but the Starfire no longer had the most powerful engine offered for sale in an Oldsmobile.
