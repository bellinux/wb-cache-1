In a recent project, large socioeconomic differences between adjacent neighborhoods were observed coinciding with physical features at the neighborhood boundary such as rivers, parks, railroads, and highways. Literature on urban form suggests mechanisms by which these features might create or maintain socioeconomic differences. We therefore test whether the presence of physical features on neighborhood boundaries is associated with greater socioeconomic disparity between the neighborhoods and whether the types of features less easily crossed are more strongly associated. The study area was the city of Glasgow, Scotland. We used vector data to determine which of N = 1, 914 neighborhood boundaries coincided with physical features, a well-validated measure of multiple deprivation to assess differences in socioeconomic character across these boundaries, and linear regression to assess associations. The presence of physical features was weakly associated with greater socioeconomic difference across neighborhood boundaries (B = 0. 193, p = 0. 006). Water (rivers/canals; B = 0. 378, p = 0. 005) and open spaces (B = 0. 283, p = 0. 016) were most strongly associated. The presence of physical features, however, was neither necessary nor sufficient for large interneighborhood differences in socioeconomic character.

Pressure-driven flow of an electrically conducting fluid confined between two parallel, infinite walls with a transverse magnetic field is studied. The walls are electrically conducting, which implies strong currents flowing within the thin conducting walls. The problem is solved both analytically and numerically. It is shown that the Joule heat cannot be neglected in certain range of parameters relevant to fusion <b>blanket</b> <b>applications.</b> The magnitude of the Joule heat released inside the channel and the walls depends on the thermal conductivity of the outside surface of the channel walls. For thermally conducting outside surface of the walls the Joule heat can become significant for high values of the Hartmann number and moderate average velocity. The effect is even more pronounced for thermally insulating outside surface of the walls. For example, for lead–lithium flow with stainless steel walls the temperature increase along the flow exceeds 200 °C over {{the length of the}} blanket, which is almost three times higher than that for thermally conducting outside surface of the walls. The main reason for such a strong rise in temperature is the heat released inside the walls. The heat produced in the fluid region is quickly convected towards the exit from the channel. The heat released inside the walls can only leave the domain by diffusion into the fluid region and thus is accumulated along the channel length...|$|R

In this work, several membranes were prepared by the phase inversion technique. Casting solutions containing cellulose acetate, EDTA and acetone were spread onto a backing material and gelled in iced water. The membranes were then subjected to several post-treatments such as annealing, silver impregnation and silver impregnation followed by reduction to silver metal. The effects of EDTA and film post-treatments were determined with respect to air permeability and oxygen concentration in the permeate. The porosity of the resulting membranes were determined using gas sorption techniques. The presence of EDTA in the casting solution increased the entrapment of silver within the membrane. The air permeability of the membrane and oxygen concentration of the permeate were individually normalized. An objective function was defined as the product of the normalized air permeability and the normalized oxygen concentration in the permeate. The objective function exhibited an optimum at the solubility limit of 2 % EDTA in water. However, the excessive presence of EDTA reduced both membrane air permeability and oxygen separation. The presence of silver in the membrane caused the blockage of pores in the 30 - 100 A diameter range. The pore size distributions of the membranes, measured using gas sorption techniques, provided a good explanation for the observed air permeability and oxygen separation of the membranes...|$|R

These barriers include low soil fertility, variable climates, weak knowledge support, {{and lack of}} markets. Conventional technical options are insufficient to improve smallholder livelihoods. Given the diversity in resource endowments and livelihood sources identifying intensification options that fit circumstances remains problematic. In this paper we demonstrate co‐designing approaches (i. e. with multiple stakeholders) for two sites i. e. Gwanda and Nkayi districts, of contrasting agro‐ecological potential. We engaged low, medium and high resource endowed farmers to (i) co‐design plausible improved scenarios that included incremental changes ‐ testing currently promoted technologies for crop‐livestock intensification and drastic change ‐ assuming that removing barriers will encourage investments towards resilient and profitable farming; and (ii) We quantified benefits and trade offs from alternative integrated actions using an integrated whole farm modelling approach (APSFArm‐LivSim‐TOAMD). At both sites incremental change options improved food security through better‐integrated cereal‐legume‐livestock systems; income effects were however limited. Drastic change options achieved more substantial improvements in productivity, food and income generation: farmers set more land in use, with more diversified forage, food and cash crops and adapted cultivars, organic and mineral fertilizer application, small‐scale mechanization for ploughing and product processing and improved livestock management.

The focus of the vanadium alloy development program has been on the vanadium-chromium-titanium (0 - 15 % Cr, 1 - 20 % Ti) alloy system. Investigations include effects of minor alloy elements such as Si, Al, and Y and substitution of iron fro chromium in the ternary alloy. A V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti alloy is currently regarded as the reference alloy. Significant {{progress has been made in}} the development of vanadium alloys for fusion applications, Two production-scale heats (500 kg and 1200 kg) of the V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti alloys have been produced with controlled levels of impurities. The baseline properties of the 500 kg heat are similar to those of the previous laboratory-scale heats. Additional data have been obtained on baseline tensile and fracture properties. Results obtained on several heats with minor variations in composition indicate high uniform and total elongation of these alloys at temperatures of 400 - 600 {degrees}C. The properties are not significantly different when modest amounts of helium are generated during neutron irradiation by the Dynamic Helium Charging Experiment methods.

Our {{goal was to}} determine whether this can afford maximal cardio- and neuroprotections through cooling rapidity when coronary occlusion is complicated by cardiac arrest. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized animal study. SETTING: Academic research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Male New Zealand rabbits. INTERVENTIONS: Chronically instrumented rabbits were submitted to coronary artery occlusion and ventricular fibrillation. After 8 minutes of cardiac arrest, animals were resuscitated and submitted to a normothermic follow-up (control group) or to 3 hours of mild hypothermia induced by total liquid ventilation (total liquid ventilation group) or by combination of cold saline infusion and cold <b>blankets</b> <b>application</b> (saline group). Coronary reperfusion was permitted 40 minutes after the onset of occlusion. After awakening, rabbits were followed up during 7 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ten animals were resuscitated in each group. In the control group, all animals secondarily died of cardiac/respiratory failure (8 of 10) or neurological dysfunction (2 of 10). In the saline group, the target temperature of 32 °C was achieved within 30 - 45 minutes after cooling initiation. This slightly reduced infarct size versus control (41 % ± 16 % vs 54 % ± 8 % of risk zone, respectively; p < 0. 05) but failed to significantly improve cardiac output, neurological recovery, and survival rate (three survivors, six death from cardiac/respiratory failure, and one from neurological dysfunction). Conversely, the 32 °C temperature was achieved within 5 - 10 minutes in the total liquid ventilation group. This led to a dramatic reduction in infarct size (13 % ± 4 %; p < 0. 05 vs other groups) and improvements in cardiac output, neurological recovery, and survival (eight survivors, two deaths from cardiac/respiratory failure).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chagas {{disease control}} campaigns relying upon {{residual}} insecticide spraying {{have been successful}} in many Southern American countries. However, in some areas, rapid reinfestation and recrudescence of transmission have occurred. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the Bolivian Chaco to evaluate prevalence of and risk factors for T. cruzi infection 11 years after two rounds of <b>blanket</b> insecticide <b>application.</b> We used a cubic B-spline model to estimate change in force of infection over time based on age-specific seroprevalence data. Overall T. cruzi seroprevalence was 51. 7 %. The prevalence was 19. 8 % among children 2 - 15, 72. 7 % among those 15 - 30 and 97. 1 % among participants older than 30 years. Based on the model, the estimated annual force of infection was 4. 3 % over the two years before the first blanket spray in 2000 and fell to 0. 4 % for 2001 - 2002. The estimated annual force of infection for 2004 - 2005, the 2 year period following the second blanket spray, was 4. 6 %. However, the 95 % bootstrap confidence intervals overlap for all of these estimates. In a multivariable model, only sleeping in a structure with cracks in the walls (aOR = 2. 35; 95 % CI = 1. 15 - 4. 78), age and village of residence were associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: As in other areas in the Chaco, we found an extremely high prevalence of Chagas disease. Despite evidence that <b>blanket</b> insecticide <b>application</b> in 2000 may have decreased the force of infection, active transmission is ongoing.

The aim {{was to examine the}} reliability of traditional skeletal markers of health in highly contextualised populations. The link between socio-economic status and health was examined to determine if traditional linking of poor health with poverty was evident in skeletal samples. The analysis indicated that this was indeed the case and that health was significantly compromised in populations of low socio-economic status. Thus it indicated that status intimately influences the physical body form. Sex was also found to be a major defining factor in the response of an individual to physiological stress. It was also evident that contemporary populations may suffer from different physiological stresses, and their responses to those stresses may differ. Adaptation was a key factor here. This has implications for studies of earlier populations that may lack detailed contextual data in terms of <b>blanket</b> <b>applications</b> of interpretations.

This article investigates the association between healthcare spending, deprivation and outcomes. It argues that individual practice data are analysed before <b>blanket</b> <b>application</b> and acceptance that {{one size fits all}} in a local area. Methods Financial data were analysed alongside key outcome data, including quality and outcomes framework (QOF) indicators for a large urban primary care trust (PCT) in the UK. The PCT had a large population and number of practices, including single-handed practices and an average list size in excess of 5000. The PCT will remain anonymous. Results There was no relationship between primary care investment and the practices' deprivation score. There was a strong statistically significant negative correlation between QOF payments and deprivation, (correlation[*]=[*]− 0. 46, p[*]<[*] 0. 001). There were only weak links between primary care investment and health outcomes. There was no relationship between high emergency spending and health outcome.

Spatial models of the contents were generated through geostatistical analysis to map the status of N, P and K nutrients across the locations. Study results indicated that proportion of area deficient in N is 97 %, P is 72 % and K is 12 %. Distribution pattern for N and K nutrients were clusters of low or high contents at specific locations; and that of P was random. Outcome of this study could enhance site-specific nutrient recommendation in Ghana. Alliance for a Green Revolution in AfricaPeer Revie...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we have {{discovered}} that a type of two-fold symmetrical 6 R foldable frame proposed as a deployable core structure to support solar <b>blankets</b> in space <b>applications</b> is actually a line and plane-symmetric Bricard linkage. Using the singular value decomposition of the Jacobian matrix of closure equations, {{we are able to}} show that bifurcations exist during deployment of the frame. And the bifurcations cannot be avoided in current designs. However, we also identified a feasible area for design parameters in which bifurcations can be completely removed. A physical model has been made which proves that our conclusion is correct. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
