40|$|Background—Dipyridamole and {{adenosine}} cause frequent {{side effects}} {{as a result}} of nonspecific adenosine receptor stimulation. Selective agonism of the adenosine A 2 A receptor should result in a similar degree of coronary vasodilation (and thus similar perfusion images) with fewer side effects. Methods and Results—In a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, 2 -arm crossover trial, 240 patients underwent 2 single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging studies in random order, first after pharmacological stress with adenosine and a second study with the selective adenosine A 2 A receptor agonist <b>binodenoson,</b> using 1 of 4 dosing regimens. Safety, tolerability, and SPECT image concordance between the 2 agents were examined. Exact categorical agreement in the extent and severity of reversible perfusion defects ranged from 79 % to 87 %, with kappa values from 0. 69 to 0. 85, indicating very good to excellent agreement between <b>binodenoson</b> and adenosine. The risk of any safety event/side effect was significantly lower with any dose of <b>binodenoson</b> than with adenosine (P 0. 01) because of a dose-related reduction in subjective side effects, as objective events were infrequent. There was a reduction in the severity of chest pain, dyspnea, and flushing in all <b>binodenoson</b> doses compared with adenosine (P 0. 01), and the magnitude of severity reduction was dose-related. Conclusions—The selective adenosine A 2 A receptor agonist <b>binodenoson</b> results in an extent and severity of reversible perfusion defects on SPECT imaging similar to nonselective adenosine receptor stimulation, accompanied by...|$|E
40|$|Background: Vasodilator stress imaging {{is based}} on {{coronary}} A 2 a receptor stimulation via endogenous adenosine (with dipyridamole administration), exogenous adenosine, or selective A 2 a receptor stimulation (with <b>binodenoson).</b> The recognized inter-individual variability in response to adenosine might be in part determined by genetic polymorphism in A 2 a adenosine receptors. Aim: to assess whether A 2 a receptor (263 C>T and 1976 C>T) polymorphism affects the coronary flow reserve (CFR) response in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Methods: we evaluated 44 DCM patients 34 males; age 62 ? 9 years) by transthoracic dipyridamole (0. 84 mg/kg) stress echocardiography. All patients had an ejection fraction T variant of A 2 a gene. However, patients with 1976 TT genotype had significantly lower values from 1976 CC patients (p T polymorphism of the adenosine A 2 A receptor gene may affect CFR response. In particular, the 1976 -TT variant of A 2 a gene blunts the coronary vasodilatory response...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMedicinal {{chemical}} {{approaches have}} been applied to {{all four of the}} adenosine receptor (AR) subtypes (A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B, and A 3) to create selective agonists and antagonists for each. The most recent class of selective AR ligands to be reported is the class of A 2 BAR agonists. The availability of these selective ligands has facilitated research on therapeutic applications of modulating the ARs and in some cases has provided clinical candidates. Prodrug approaches have been developed which improve the bioavailability of the drugs, reduce side-effects, and/or may lead to site-selective effects. The A 2 A agonist regadenoson (Lexiscan®), a diagnostic drug for myocardial perfusion imaging, is the first selective AR agonist to be approved. Other selective agonists and antagonists are or were undergoing clinical trials for a broad range of indications, including capadenoson and tecadenoson (A 1 agonists) for atrial fibrillation, or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, respectively, apadenoson and <b>binodenoson</b> (A 2 A agonists) for myocardial perfusion imaging, preladenant (A 2 A antagonist) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and CF 101 and CF 102 (A 3 agonists) for inflammatory diseases and cancer, respectively.

40|$|Myocardial {{perfusion}} studies {{use either}} physical exercise or pharmacologic vasodilator stress to induce maximum myocardial hyperemia. Adenosine and dipyridamole {{are the most}} commonly used agents to induce coronary arterial vasodilation for myocardial perfusion imaging. Both cause frequent undesirable side-effects. Because of its ultrashort half-life, adenosine must be administered by constant intravenous infusion during the examination. A key feature of an ideal A 2 A agonist for myocardial perfusion imaging studies would be an optimal level and duration of hyperemic response. Drugs with a longer half-time and more selective A 2 A adenosine receptor agonism, such as regadenoson, should theoretically result in a similar degree of coronary vasodilation with fewer or less severe side-effects than non-selective, ultrashort-lasting adenosine receptor stimulation. The available preclinical and clinical data suggest that regadenoson is a highly subtype-selective, potent, low-affinity A 2 A adenosine receptor agonist that holds promise for future use as a coronary vasodilator in myocardial perfusion imaging studies. Infusion of regadenoson achieves maximum coronary hyperemia that is equivalent to adenosine. After a single bolus infusion over 10 s, hyperemia is maintained significantly longer (approximately 2 – 5 min) than with adenosine, which should facilitate radionuclide distribution for myocardial perfusion imaging studies. In comparison with the clinically competitive A 2 A adenosine receptor agonist <b>binodenoson,</b> regadenoson has a several-fold shorter duration of action, although the magnitude of hyperemic response is comparable between the two. The more rapid termination of action of regadenoson points to an advantage of enhanced control for the clinical application. Regadenoson selectively causes vasodilation of the coronary circulation, whereas effects on systemic blood pressure are only mild. The clinical adverse effect profile of regadenoson appears to be favorable, particularly with respect to dreaded atrioventricular conduction disturbances and bronchospasm...|$|E
