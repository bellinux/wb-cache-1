25|$|It {{subsequently}} {{emerged that}} Mikel had travelled to London with his agent John Shittu, {{who was working}} for Jerome Anderson's SEM group. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson considered travelling to Oslo to visit Mikel, but decided against this after Mikel {{was reported to have}} left the country. Staying in a London hotel and some nine days after disappearing, Mikel stated on Sky Sports News that he had been pressured into signing the contract with United without his agent present, claims furiously rebuffed by both Manchester United and Lyn. Mikel told the British media that Chelsea were the club he genuinely wanted to sign for. In response to these events, United made an official complaint to FIFA about the behaviour of both Chelsea and the player's agents, Shittu and Rune Hauge, already infamous {{for his role in the}} George Graham <b>bungs</b> scandal. FIFA dismissed these claims in August 2005, stating there was insufficient evidence to bring a case against Chelsea.|$|E

Graham's future was also called in question, after claims that he received illegal payments from transfer deals (<b>bungs),</b> which he dismissed.
