40|$|The wavelet {{transform}} {{is well suited}} for approximation of two dimensional functions with certain smoothness character-istics. Also point singularities, e. g. texture-like structures, can be compactly represented by wavelet methods. However, when representing line singularities following a smooth curve in the domain – and should therefore be characterizes by a few parameters – the number of needed wavelet coefficients rises dramatically since fine scale tensor product wavelets, catching these steep transitions, have small local support. Nonetheless, for images consisting of smoothly colored regions separated by smooth contours {{most of the information}} is comprised in line singularities (e. g. sketches). For this class of images, wavelet methods have a suboptimal approximation rate due to their inability {{to take advantage of the}} way those point singularities are placed to form up the smooth line singularity.

Although more general domain partitions are possible, we chose for a triangulation of the domain which approximates the contours by polylines formed by triangle edges. The nonlinearity lies in the fact that the normal offset method searches from the midpoint of the edges of a coarse mesh along the normal direction until it pierces the image. These piercing points have the property of being attracted towards steep color value transitions. As a consequence triangular edges are attracted to line up against the contours...|$|E

With the advancement of technology, the world has found itself amid a vast amount of information. An efficient method has to be generated to deal with such amount of information. Data compression is a technique which minimizes the size of a file keeping the quality same as previous. So more amount of data can be stored in memory space with the help of data compression. There are various image compression standards such as JPEG, which uses discrete cosine transform technique and JPEG 2000 which uses discrete wavelet transform technique. The discrete cosine transform gives excellent compaction for highly correlated information. The computational complexity is very less as it has better information packing ability. However, it produces blocking artifacts, graininess, and blurring in the output which is overcome by the discrete wavelet transform. The image size is reduced by discarding values less than a prespecified quantity without losing much information. But it also has some limitations when the complexity of the image increases. Wavelets are optimal for point singularity however for line singularities and curve singularities these are not optimal. They do not consider the image geometry which is a vital source of redundancy.
