According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and Cecil standing together because their feet are <b>both</b> <b>so</b> big. There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E

His manager and sponsor were <b>both</b> <b>so</b> concerned that they flew to New York to visit him two days before his death. Goldstein refused to see his manager, but allowed his sponsor into his apartment, consuming pills and smoking crack cocaine in front of him. He promised to check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that Friday. When he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the food}} is in the {{digestive}} cavity, gland cells in the gastroderm release enzymes that reduce the prey to slurry, usually within a few hours. This circulates through the digestive cavity and, in colonial cnidarians, through the connecting tunnels, so that gastroderm cells can absorb the nutrients. Absorption may take a few hours, and digestion within the cells may take a few days. The circulation of nutrients is driven by water currents produced by cilia in the gastroderm or by muscular movements or <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> that nutrients reach {{all parts of the}} digestive cavity. Nutrients reach the outer cell layer by diffusion or, for animals or zooids such as medusae which have thick mesogleas, are transported by mobile cells in the mesoglea.|$|E

Djokovic defeated Nadal in five sets to win the match. At five hours and fifty-three minutes, it was the Major final match with the longest duration in history. During the trophy ceremony, both Nadal and Djokovic required chairs, as they were <b>both</b> <b>so</b> tired that they couldn't stand.|$|E
5|$|Ran won several {{awards in}} Japan, {{but was not}} quite as honored there {{as many of the}} director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the {{selection}} of Ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the 57th Academy Awards. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit Ran for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film, a French film (due to its financing), or <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Best Directing that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa). Rans costume designer, Emi Wada, won the movie's only Oscar.|$|E

5|$|To face these insurgencies, al-Ma'mun {{turned to}} another of Tahir's sons, Abdallah ibn Tahir, {{to whom he}} {{entrusted}} the command of his army. Ibn Tahir first targeted Nasr ibn Shabath in northern Syria and the Jazira. Nasr was willing to acknowledge al-Ma'mun's authority, but demanded concessions for his followers and remained hostile to the Abbasids' Persian officials, so {{that he had to}} be browbeaten into submission by a show of force before his capital, Kaysum, in 824–825. After securing his northern flank, Ibn Tahir marched through Syria into Egypt. There the two rivals, although not opposed in principle to al-Ma'mun as Caliph, were eager to maintain the status quo, and had already repulsed an invasion in 824 under Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad. Ibn Tahir however managed to outmanoeuvre <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> that Ali al-Jarawi quickly went over to him, leaving Ubayd Allah to submit and face deportation to Baghdad. In Alexandria, Ibn Tahir secured the departure of the Andalusians, who left the city for the Byzantine island of Crete, which they conquered and transformed into a Muslim emirate. On his return to Baghdad in 827, Abdallah ibn Tahir received a triumphal reception, and was appointed governor of Khurasan in 828, replacing Talha. His place in the west was taken over by al-Ma'mun's younger brother Abu Ishaq al-Mu'tasim. In Yemen, another Alid revolt broke out in 822 under Abd al-Rahman ibn Ahmad, but al-Ma'mun managed to secure his surrender by negotiations.|$|E

25|$|The role of Pauline {{was cast}} after Walsh scouted schools all over New Zealand {{to find a}} Pauline 'look-alike'.

25|$|Burkhard Rost, then {{professor}} in the department of biochemistry and molecular biophysics at Columbia University and now the Alexander von Humboldt Professor and chair of bioinformatics and computational biology, computational sciences at the Technical University Munich, succeeded Michael Gribskov as president in 2007 and has been reelected twice with a current term expiration set for January 2013. Under his tenure the ISMB/ECCB 2007 conference in Vienna, Austria, chaired by Thomas Lengauer of the Max-Planck Institute for Informatics, and co-chaired by Burkhard Rost and Peter Schuster of the University of Vienna, was further expanded to include a total of eight parallel tracks, and the 2007 conference attendance of approximately 1,700 was back on track with expectations. Vienna as a destination and the Austria Center Vienna were <b>both</b> <b>so</b> well received by the conference organizers and attendees alike that it was selected to host the 2011 conference as well, which is a first for the ISMB series that had never before repeated a location.|$|E
25|$|The primary way {{to boost}} levels of {{immunity}} {{in a population}} is through vaccination. Their use is originally based on the observation that milkmaids exposed to cowpox were immune to smallpox, so the practice of inoculating people with the cowpox virus began {{as a way to}} prevent smallpox cases. Well-developed vaccines provide protection in a far safer way than natural infections, as vaccines generally do not cause the diseases they protect against and severe adverse effects are significantly less common than complications from natural infections. The immune system does not distinguish between natural infections and vaccines, forming an active response to <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> immunity induced via vaccination is similar to what would have occurred from contracting and recovering from the disease. To achieve herd immunity through vaccination, vaccine manufacturers aim to produce vaccines with low failure rates and policy makers aim to encourage their use. After the successful introduction and widespread use of a vaccine, sharp declines in the incidence of diseases it protects against can be observed, necessarily decreasing the number of hospitalizations and deaths caused by such diseases.|$|E
500|$|Since no one {{has ever}} bothered to explain the {{importance}} of learning to Milo, he regards school as the biggest waste of time in his life. Juster intended that the book speak to the importance of learning to love learning. Teaching methods that might bore children, by memorization for example, are mocked in the book, {{as in the case of}} the Spelling Bee. Like the Bee, the Humbug's insult to his fellow insect goes over Milo's head, but possibly not the reader's: [...] "A slavish concern for the composition of words is the sign of a bankrupt intellect." [...] According to Mary Liston in her journal article on law in fantasy realms, [...] "The Phantom Tollbooth concerns the difference between education and wisdom and what processes are conducive to synthesizing <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> as to encourage an attitude of engagement, alertness, and responsibility within an increasingly autonomous individual." ...|$|E

500|$|Conversely, LA Weekly Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "It isn't that Spider-Man is {{inherently}} unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated." [...] Giving it 2.5/4 stars, Roger Ebert felt the film lacked a decent action element; [...] "Consider {{the scene where}} Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea." [...] Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin's costume, which led IGN's Richard George to comment years later, [...] "We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from Spider-Man is almost comically bad...

Eminem raps, [...] "It's the rage that took over, it controls you <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." [...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's {{what happens when a}} tornado meets a volcano". The described love–hate relationship worsens and leads to domestic violence. Eminem admits to lying about promises he makes and says late in the song, [...] "If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire", a reference to Rihanna's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Keable {{returned}} to the UK in 1914 {{as a result of}} illness, precipitated perhaps by the rigour of service upon which Weston insisted in Zanzibar. He was offered a church posting in Sheffield but declined, fearing [...] "the pull of Rome" [...] if left within reach of Catholic influences in Britain. Instead, he made two attempts to enlist for armed service during the First World War; ill health thwarted <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> he {{returned to}} Africa for mission work, becoming rector of three parishes (including Leribe, Basutoland), under the diocese of the Bishop of Bloemfontein. He published some ten devotional works and works on missionary practice during this time, including The Loneliness of Christ, and a book of verse titled Songs of the narrow way. The damaging effects of the illness he had suffered were compounded by an assault while in the field: accounts vary, with some friends recalling that Keable received a blow to the head from a [...] "powerful native", and others describing a gunshot wound to the thigh, inflicted by a (probably drunk or deranged) Mosutu. Keable's biographer Cecil has suggested that the whole incident may have been a fabrication of Keable's.|$|E
