2500|$|The CH-53K is {{a general}} {{redesign}} of the CH-53E. The main improvements are new engines and cockpit layout. The CH-53K will have over twice the lift capacity and radius of action of the CH-53E, and a wider cargo hold {{to allow it to}} carry a Humvee internally. The CH-53K will feature new stubby composite sponsons to cut overall width, giving the helicopter a narrower footprint for shipboard operations. [...] It will also be equipped with a new composite rotor <b>blade</b> <b>system,</b> with technology similar to that currently found on the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. [...] The CH-53K will use the General Electric GE38-1B engine.

2500|$|A {{biological}} computer {{refers to}} an engineered biological system that can perform computer-like operations, which is a dominant paradigm in synthetic biology. Researchers from around [...] the world, predominantly in the United States, have built and characterized a variety of logic gates {{in a number of}} organisms, as well as demonstrated both analog and digital computation in living cells. For example, research groups have demonstrated that bacteria can be engineered to perform both analog computation or digital computation. In human cells, for example, research by Keller Rinaudo, Leonidas Bleris, Rohan Maddamsetti, Sairam Subramanian, Ron Weiss and Yaakov Benenson demonstrated a universal logic evaluator that operates in mammalian cells in 2007. Subsequently, researchers from MIT and ETH Zurich utilized this paradigm to demonstrate a proof-of-concept therapy that uses biological digital computation to detect and kill human cancer cells in 2011. Furtheremore, a group of researchers from MIT, Boston University, and NIST demonstrated in 2016 that using principles of computer engineering, one can automate digital circuit design in bacterial cells. In 2017, researchers from Boston University and ETH Zurich demonstrated the 'Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision' (<b>BLADE)</b> <b>system</b> to engineer digital computation in human cells.|$|E

50|$|A {{blade server}} is a stripped-down server {{computer}} with a modular design optimized to minimize the use of physical space and energy. Blade servers have many components removed to save space, minimize power consumption and other considerations, while still having all the functional components {{to be considered a}} computer. Unlike a rack-mount server, a blade server needs a blade enclosure, which can hold multiple blade servers, providing services such as power, cooling, networking, various interconnects and management.

40|$|The <b>bladed</b> <b>system</b> {{communications}} challenge <b>Bladed</b> <b>system</b> architectures enable equipment {{providers to}} produce high-density, modular equipment {{that can be}} easily scaled to match user needs. The inherent flexibility and scalability of a bladed architecture supports the expansion or reconfiguration of existing server, storage and telecommunications infrastructure, and supports the rapidly growing and shifting services demand. This high level of scalability is achieved by disaggregating computing and scarce system I/O resources. However, it poses a significant challenge: the system needs an equally scalable interconnect architecture that enables any and all root complexes {{to communicate with each other}} and with any and all endpoints.
