25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E

30|$|Identification of {{individual}} <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{is a crucial}} step towards an improved understanding of anaerobic digestion processes and mixed microbial conversions in general. The knowledge {{of individual}} <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> allows for the calculation of biomass specific conversion rates which {{form the basis of}} anaerobic digestion models. Only few attempts addressed the absolute quantification of individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> in methanogenic microbial ecosystems which has so far impaired the calculation of biomass specific conversion rates and thus model validation. This study proposes a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach for the direct determination of individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> in methanogenic microbial associations by correlating the native qPCR signal (cycle threshold, Ct) to individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> (mg dry matter/L). Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach circumvents error-prone conversion factors that are typically used to convert gene copy numbers or cell <b>concentrations</b> into actual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The newly developed method was assessed and deemed suitable for the determination of individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> in a defined coculture of Desulfovibrio sp. G 11 and Methanospirillum hungatei JF 1. The obtained calibration curves showed high accuracy, indicating that the new approach is well suited for any engineering applications where the knowledge of individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> is required.|$|R

5000|$|Good biomass retention: higher <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{inside the}} reactor can be achieved, and higher {{substrate}} loading rates can be treated.|$|R
50|$|Simply due to {{the high}} number of {{microorganism}} in MBRs, the pollutants uptake rate can be increased. This leads to better degradation in a given time span or to smaller required reactor volumes. In comparison to the conventional activated sludge process (ASP) which typically achieves 95 percent, COD removal can be increased to 96 to 99 percent in MBRs (see table,). COD and BOD5 removal are found to increase with MLSS concentration. Above 15 g/L COD removal becomes almost independent of <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> at >96 percent. Arbitrary high MLSS concentrations are not employed, however, as oxygen transfer is impeded due to higher and non-Newtonian fluid viscosity. Kinetics may also differ due to easier substrate access. In ASP, flocs may reach several 100 μm in size. This means that the substrate can reach the active sites only by diffusion which causes an additional resistance and limits the overall reaction rate (diffusion controlled). Hydrodynamic stress in MBRs reduces floc size (to 3.5 μm in sidestream MBRs) and thereby increases the apparent reaction rate. Like in the conventional ASP, sludge yield is decreased at higher SRT or <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration.</b> Little or no sludge is produced at sludge loading rates of 0.01 kgCOD/(kgMLSS d). Because of the imposed <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> limit, such low loading rates would result in enormous tank sizes or long HRTs in conventional ASP.|$|E
50|$|Fermentation setups {{closely related}} to the chemostats are the turbidostat, the auxostat and the retentostat. In retentostats, culture liquid is also removed from the bioreactor, but a filter retains the biomass. In this case, the <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> {{increases}} until the nutrient requirement for biomass maintenance has become equal to the amount of limiting nutrient that can be consumed.|$|E
5000|$|To {{solve for}} the {{concentration}} of all components appearing in any general biochemical reaction as in (...) , the Michaelis-Menten kinetics for an enzymatic reaction are coupled with the Monod kinetics for biomass dynamics.

These hypotheses lead to the following system of equations ...|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} quantification method poses a major {{improvement over}} prevailing approaches because no error-prone conversion factors and assumptions {{are needed to}} obtain absolute <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The method developed is therefore ideally suited for engineering applications and for providing model input. The gained knowledge on individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> in defined or non-defined microbial communities opens up the opportunity to calculate biomass specific conversion rates which enables the validation of models for anaerobic digestion processes and other mixed microbial conversions.|$|R

This approach is not only tedious but is also affected by varying cell morphologies and the occurrence of cell aggregates which renders cell counting less accurate than DNA-based techniques. In this study qPCR was investigated for the determination of individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> because of its reported higher accuracy, sensitivity and reproducibility compared to other quantification methods such as quantitative FISH or pyrosequencing (Amend et al. [2010]; Kim et al. [2013]).|$|R

The tubes are oriented horizontally or vertically and are supplied from a central utilities installation with pump, sensors, nutrients and CO2.

These photobioreactors take advantage from the high purity levels and their efficient outputs. The biomass production can be done at a high quality level and the high <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> {{at the end of the}} production allows energy efficient downstream processing. Due to the recent prices of the photobioreactors, economically feasible concepts today can only be found within high-value markets, e.g. food supplement or cosmetics.|$|E

50|$|Conventional {{nitrogen}} {{removal from}} ammonium-rich wastewater is accomplished {{in two separate}} steps: nitrification, which is mediated by aerobic ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and denitrification carried out by denitrifiers, which reduce nitrate to N2 with the input of suitable electron donors. Aeration and input of organic substrates (typically methanol) show that these two processes are: (1) highly energy consuming, (2) associated with the production of excess sludge and (3) produce significant amounts of green-house gases such as CO2 and N2O and ozone-depleting NO. Because anammox bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite directly to N2 anaerobically, this process does not require aeration and other electron donors. Nevertheless, oxygen is still required {{for the production of}} nitrite by ammonia-oxiding bacteria. However, in partial nitritation/anammox systems, oxygen demand is greatly reduced because only half of the ammonium needs to be oxidized to nitrite instead of full conversion to nitrate. The autotrophic nature of anammox bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria guarantee a low yield and thus less sludge production. Additionally, anammox bacteria easily form stable self-aggregated biofilm (granules) allowing reliable operation of compact systems characterized by high <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> and conversion rate up to 5-10 kg N m−3. Overall, {{it has been shown that}} efficient application of the anammox process in wastewater treatment results in a cost reduction of up to 60% as well as lower CO2 emissions.|$|E
40|$|The oxygen-limited {{autotrophic}} nitrification/denitrification (OLAND) process comprises one-stage partial nitritation and anammox, catalyzed by aerobic and anoxic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB and AnAOB), respectively. The goal of {{this study}} was to investigate whether quorum sensing influences anoxic ammonium oxidation in an OLAND biofilm, with AnAOB colonizing 13 % of the biofilm, as determined with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). At high <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations,</b> the specific anoxic ammonium oxidation rate of the OLAND biofilm significantly increased with a factor of 1. 5 +/- 0. 2 compared to low <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Supernatant obtained from the biofilm showed no ammonium-oxidizing activity on itself, but its addition to low OLAND <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> resulted in a significant activity increase of the biomass. In the biofilm supernatant, the presence of long-chain acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) was shown using the reporter strain Chromobacterium violaceum CV 026, and one specific AHL, N-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (C(12) -HSL), was identified via LC-MS/MS. Furthermore, C(12) -HSL was detected in an AnAOB-enriched community, but not in an AerAOB-enriched community. Addition of C(12) -HSL to low OLAND <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> resulted in a significantly higher ammonium oxidation rate (p< 0. 05). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that AHLs enhance the anoxic ammonium oxidation process. Future work should confirm which species are responsible for the in situ production of C(12) -HSL in AnAOB-based applications...|$|R
30|$|Only limited {{research}} has focused on the determination of individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> in mixed microbial communities. Seitz et al.

Nevertheless, this approach is time-intensive and suffers from low accuracy since morphologically similar microorganisms and aggregated cells can hardly be distinguished (Manz et al. [1994]; Wagner et al. [2003]). Emerging molecular techniques such as qPCR, quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (qFISH) or pyrosequencing promise to be much faster and more accurate (Coskuner et al.

A statistical experimental design approach including three fractional factorial designs and a central composite design was used to optimize the fermentation process with 21 variables composed of 19 nutritional factors grouped from the 57 components and two environmental factors (initial pH and temperature).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop an approach to estimate the minimum fixed <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> (M(min)) and corresponding active thickness of a nitrifying biofilm. By analyzing the effect of the accumulation of fixed biomass on the specific removal rate of ammonium-N (q(obs)), it was found that q(obs) attained its maximum at a fixed <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> of around 35 mu g COD of biomass/cm(2). This concentration was not sensitive to variation in the influent ammonium-N concentration (S-o), ranging from 16 - 82. 5 mg/L. This suggests that a minimum fixed <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> (M(min)) is needed to maximize the specific ammonium-N removal on a unit biomass basis. The active thickness (Th-a) (min) corresponding to M(min) was calculated. Results showed that (Th-a) (min) was very thin, and decreased from 21. 9 to 8. 1 mu m, with the increase of the volumetric density of biofilm. Comparison between (Th-a) (min) and the active thickness determined from reaction-diffusion theory was made. This study showed that there exists a minimum fixed <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> and active thickness, above which little improvement in effluent quality was produced by further increase of fixed <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> for a constant influent, Consequently, the concept of the minimum fixed <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> can be therefore embodied in modeling of the biofilm process...|$|E

CCAP 211 / 78 was studied in three outdoor pilot-scale photobioreactors: an open raceway pond (OPR), a horizontal tubular (HT) photobioreactor and a vertically stacked horizontal tubular (VT) photobioreactor. The reactors were operated continuously as turbidostat at different biomass concentrations. For all systems highest areal productivities were obtained on {{days with a}} high light intensity, while the highest photosynthetic efficiencies were obtained on days with a low light intensity. Ground areal <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> exceeding 51 g m - 2 had {{a negative effect on}} the areal productivity and photosynthetic efficiency. No significant effect of <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> on the productivity was found for the HT at ground areal <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> lower than 51 g m - 2. Also for the VT, no significant effect of <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> was found {{with the exception of the}} highest <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> of 2. 0 g L - 1 (68 g m - 2) resulting in decreased productivity. For the open raceway pond the highest <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> (0. 5 g L - 1 or 94 g m - 2) resulted in significantly lower areal productivity, compared to the lower <b>biomass</b> <b>concentration</b> (0. 25 g L 47 g m - 2). Highest areal productivities were obtained for OPR and VT, most likely due to more efficient light interception. In this study we observed that night biomass loss was coupled to net growth. At lower biomass concentrations and concomitant higher growth rates the specific biomass loss rate was higher. Microalgal specific light absorption coefficient was correlated to biomass concentration; higher biomass concentrations resulted in higher specific absorption coefficients, resulting in a steeper light gradient in the microalgal cultures. </p...|$|E
30|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} comprises {{a series}} of reaction steps each performed by a specific microbial group of the anaerobic ecosystem (Gavala et al. [2003]; Stams and Plugge [2009]). Due to the interdependence of involved reactions, the overall mechanism is kinetically controlled by the rate limiting reaction step (Griffin et al. [1998]; Lyberatos and Skiadas [1999]; Yu et al. [2005]). Therefore, to improve conversion performance and process control major importance lies {{in the identification of}} the factors that govern a well-balanced reaction mechanism (Chen et al. [2008]; Griffin et al. [1998]; Rittmann and McCarty [2001]). To investigate these factors mathematical models such as the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM 1) have been developed (Batstone et al. [2002]; Gavala et al. [2003]). Unfortunately, validation of ADM 1 and similar models is yet hampered by the lacking information on individual <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> i.e., the <b>biomass</b> <b>concentrations</b> of individual species or different functional groups contained in the microbial community.
