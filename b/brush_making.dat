25|$|Three of {{the four}} Bs that have shaped Chesham's history relate to its industries. <b>Brush</b> <b>making</b> was {{introduced}} around 1829 {{to make use of}} the off-cuts from woodworking. Boot and shoe making which started as a cottage industry later expanding through small workshops thrived following the opening of tanneries around 1792 which also supplied leather for saddle making and glove. By the mid-19th century both brushmaking and footwear manufacture became major industries in the town with production concentrated in large factories. The industry declined in the early-20th century as the market for heavy boots declined. Beer brewing grew rapidly around the town centre in the 19th century again declining at the start of the 20th century. These traditional industries were succeeded by smaller but more commercial enterprises which took advantage of the available skilled labour. For example, in 1908 the Chiltern Toy Works was opened by Joseph Eisenmann on Bellingdon Road, later moving to the 'new' industrial estate in Waterside, making high quality teddy bears. The works finally closed in 1960. Post Second World War industry has ranged from the manufacture of glue (Industrial Adhesives) to aluminium-based packaging (Alcan), Aluminium Castings & Bronze Castings (Draycast Foundries Limited) and balloons (B-Loony).|$|E

5000|$|Marie Cahill (December, 1866 [...] - [...] August 23, 1933) was a Broadway stage {{actress and}} vocalist. Her parents were Irish {{immigrants}} Richard and Mary (née Groegen) Cahill. She had {{an older brother}} named Richard. Both her father and brother ran a <b>brush</b> <b>making</b> business.Marie began her career in the late 1880s first in her native Brooklyn and then on Broadway. In 1902 in the show Sally In Our Alley she introduced the song Under The Bamboo Tree which became her signature song {{and one of the}} most famous songs from the turn of the century. Also in 1902 in the musical The Wild Rose she premiered another hit song Nancy Brown. In 1903 the popularity of the Nancy Brown song was expanded into its own musical for Cahill, and became her favorite role. She had a plump and jolly demeanor and in addition to being a singer she presented herself as a conversationalist in a style that at best anticipates the later Gracie Allen. Daniel Blum in Great Stars of the American Theatre c. 1952 relates that Cahill was a very proper woman who didn't tolerate naughty behavior or salaciousness. However, in contrast she could don a pair of tights in a musical and exude sex appeal. In appearance she resembled rival Della Fox.|$|E
50|$|Using {{electric}} {{tooth brushes}} is less complex {{in regards to}} <b>brushing</b> technique, <b>making</b> it a viable option for children, and adults with limited dexterity. The bristle head should be guided from tooth to tooth slowly, following the contour of the gums and crowns of the tooth. The motion of the toothbrush head removes the need to manually oscillate the brush or make circles.|$|R

5000|$|Axminster Heritage {{tells the}} story of Axminster’s past -its early {{beginnings}} as Stone and Bronze Age settlements, the importance of the waters of the River Axe and of Axminster as a river crossing point for Romans and other travellers, the importance of farming and the growth of industry particularly the story of Thomas Whitty and the history of his carpet business. New displays for 2017 include more about the modern Axminster Carpets started by the Dutfield family in 1937 and more about the town’s important <b>brush</b> <b>making</b> industry. They show Axminster to be not only enterprising but resilient, particularly during times of war. Visitors will learn from an eye-witness Parliamentarian account, for instance, that the town was almost completely destroyed by fire during the English Civil War. Displays also highlight some of the Eminent Victorians who shaped Axminster. They include local historian George Pulman, author of the 'Book of the Axe'; Emily Conybeare, founder of the town's original Cottage Hospital and James Davidson author of ‘A History of the Town and Parish of Axminster’ [...]Fellow Victorian Dean William Buckland, one of Britain's leading geologists, is the anchor for a new range of geological specimens. His fascinating account of the massive Axmouth landslip of 1839 brings alive this stretch of the coast, adding a new dimension to the coastal walk between Seaton and Lyme.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{limitations}} of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the <b>brushes</b> <b>making</b> and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.|$|R

25|$|The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), {{a distant}} {{relative}} of the European red fox, is also hunted in North America. It is an adept climber of trees, making it harder to hunt with hounds. The scent of the gray fox is {{not as strong as}} that of the red, therefore more time is needed for the hounds to take the scent. Unlike the red fox which, during the chase, will run far ahead from the pack, the gray fox will speed toward heavy <b>brush,</b> thus <b>making</b> it more difficult to pursue. Also unlike the red fox, which occurs more prominently in the northern United States, the more southern gray fox is rarely hunted on horseback, due to its densely covered habitat preferences.|$|R

40|$|Polymer brush coatings, {{consisting}} of polymer chains covalently {{attached to a}} surface and being {{less than a hundred}} nanometer thick, allow the creation of functional surfaces without altering the inherent bulk properties or appearance of a product. Surface properties depend on the type and length of the polymer used, {{as well as on the}} grafting density of the polymer <b>brush.</b> By <b>making</b> use of a polymeric primer layer that is covalently linked to the substrate and creates a uniform and highly functionalized surface, polymer brush coatings with high grafting densities can be created. In this paper we report the preparation of hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic brush coatings on different substrates through the use of a poly(acrylic acid) primer layer. In addition, hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) brush coatings thus produced were shown to decrease adhesion of marine bacteria. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Needing {{another option}} besides frontal assaults, Curtis decided {{to search for}} a weak point {{elsewhere}} in the Rebel lines. His scouts found a local farmer named George Thoman, who was eager to help the Federals as the Confederates had absconded with his horse the previous night. Thoman showed Curtis a gulch, cut by Swan Creek, running up to a rise along Shelby's left flank. Curtis personally directed his headquarters escort and the 9th Wisconsin Battery through this gully. Meanwhile, Blunt continued to push Jennison and Ford up the rise across <b>Brush</b> Creek, <b>making</b> slow progress until the 9th Wisconsin opened fire upon the Confederate flank and rear. Encouraged, Blunt's men now poured over the ridge, but Shelby's men fought back stubbornly and a see-saw battle ensued in the open prairie. The Union army gradually gained the upper hand, slowly pushing Shelby's brigades back to the Wornall House.|$|R
