5000|$|In {{the textile}} arts, plying {{is a process}} {{used to create a}} strong, <b>balanced</b> <b>yarn.</b> It is done by taking two or more strands of yarn that each have a twist to them and putting them together. The strands are twisted together, in the {{direction}} opposite that in which they were spun. When {{just the right amount of}} twist is added, this creates a <b>balanced</b> <b>yarn,</b> one which has no tendency to twist upon itself. Almost all store-bought yarns are balanced, plied yarns. The word ply derives from the French verb plier, [...] "to fold", from the Latin verb plico, from the ancient Greek verb πλέκω.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} recent {{development}} of a yarn modification process to produce torque <b>balanced</b> singles spun <b>yarns.</b> Taking advantages of the core-sheath structure of unconventional spun yarns, we have developed a yarn modification process and applied it to singles yarns spun by rotor spinning. Torque free singles yarns have been produced from 100 % cotton fibers. The spirality of resultant single jersey knit fabrics has been greatly reduced or, in some cases, completely eliminated. Properties and performance characteristics of both parent and modified yarns {{as well as their}} resultant fabrics have been evaluated including the yarn tensile properties, surface properties, handle, air permeability, burst strength, and piling resistance of the fabrics.

50|$|Another way {{spindles}} are categorised is by {{the location}} of the whorl. The whorl, where present, may be located near the top, bottom or centre of the spindle. For example a top-whorl drop spindle will have the whorl located {{near the top of the}} shaft underneath a hook that allows the spindle to suspend as it is being spun. The newly spun yarn is wound below the whorl and forms a ‘cop’. Depending on {{the location of the}} whorl and style of the spindle, the cop can be conical, football or ball shaped and it can be wound above, below or over the whorl.Spindles can also be used for plying: intertwining two or more single strands of yarn together in order to create a stronger, more <b>balanced,</b> more durable <b>yarn.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{systematic}} study of various spinning techniques to produce torque-free singles ring spun yarns on a modified ring frame. The modification units, including optional fiber separation devices and a false twist device, were incorporated into the conventional ring spinning frame so that the <b>balanced</b> or reduced <b>yarn</b> residual torque could be achieved in one step. Three modification systems were proposed {{and two of them}} were investigated on a ring frame to produce pure cotton singles yarns. The spirality of the resultant single jersey knit fabrics was greatly reduced. Properties and performance characteristics of control and modified yarns, as well as their resultant fabrics, were evaluated, including yarn tensile properties, hairiness, evenness, snarling, burst strength, air permeability, handle, and pill resistances.

50|$|Handspinners use {{the number}} of twists per inch often. Because the amount of twist defines {{a lot about a}} yarn, {{the number of}} twists per inch is an {{important}} measure to recreate a yarn. As a spinner spins, they will often stop every few minutes to check to see that the number of twists per inch is the same throughout the yarn, as well as that the number of wraps per inch (the thickness of the yarn) is the same. Measuring the number of twists per inch while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a <b>balanced</b> <b>yarn</b> when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists per inch tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists per inch, such as medium twist or hard twist yarns. Yarns that have a very hard twist, enough so that the yarn will double back onto itself when released from tension, are called crepe-twist yarns.|$|E
40|$|During yarn {{formation}} by ring spinning, fibres {{are bent}} into approximately helical shapes and an unbalanced torque or twist-liveliness is created. Generally, the torque depends on yarn geometric {{factors such as}} the yarn twist and linear density and the fibre properties. In order to prevent the instability of yarn (e. g., snarling), twist-liveliness must be controlled. A practical {{solution to the problem of}} twist-liveliness is the formation of a two-fold yarn. This twisting or plying process produces a yarn structure where the energy of the system is determined by purely geometrical constraints of the plied structure and consequently when an energy minimum is reached the plied yarn obtained from the process is torsionally balanced and torque-free. In the present paper, the instability of twisted textile yarns will be interpreted using the Topological Conservation Law (Fuller, 1971) which has been developed to study the dynamics of twisted rods by Van der Heijden et al. (2003). The present work considers the equilibrium configuration of a series of multi-ply twisted yarns (2, 4, 8, and 16 strands) of finite length. The influence of structural properties (the number of strands, the diameter and twist of each strand) on the parameters of a <b>balanced</b> multi-ply <b>yarn</b> (writhe and twist) using a topological invariant of the twisted yarn (link) is established and investigated using experimental results obtained at CSIRO. ...|$|R
