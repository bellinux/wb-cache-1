60|$|The {{incongruity between}} the {{masquerade}} and the mystery {{had created a}} curious psychological atmosphere. At first they had all felt horribly ashamed at being caught in the foolish disguises of a festival, by an event that had only too much {{the character of a}} funeral. Many of them would have already gone back and dressed in clothes that were more funereal or at least more formal. But somehow at the moment this seemed like a second masquerade, more artificial and frivolous than the first. And as they reconciled themselves to their ridiculous trappings, a curious sensation had come over some of them, notably over the more sensitive, like Crane and Fisher and Juliet, but in some degree over everybody except the practical Mr. Brain. It was almost {{as if they were the}} ghosts of their own ancestors haunting that dark wood and dismal lake, and playing some old part that they only half remembered. The movements of those colored figures seemed to mean something that had been settled long before, like a silent heraldry. Acts, attitudes, external objects, were accepted as an allegory even without the key; and they knew when a crisis had come, when they did not know what it was. And somehow they knew subconsciously that the whole tale had taken a new and terrible turn, when they saw the prince stand in the gap of the gaunt trees, in his robes of angry crimson and with his lowering face of <b>bronze,</b> <b>bearing</b> in his hand a new shape of death. They could not have named a reason, but the two swords seemed indeed to have become toy swords and the whole tale of them broken and tossed away like a toy. Borodino looked like the Old World headsman, clad in terrible red, and carrying the ax for the execution of the criminal. And the criminal was not Crane.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1960s Premac was {{manufacturing}} many contract {{parts for}} the heavy industries {{located in the}} Midwest United States. One of the parts being manufactured was a skid plate with Premac's [...] "Prelon" [...] material bonded to it. This eventually morphed into a round bushing (as a <b>bronze</b> <b>bearing</b> replacement) and sadle bearings for hydraulic pumps. In the very early 1980s, a salesman for PBC visited companies in the Detroit, MI area to explain PBC's products and capabilities. At this time, the primary use for PBC bearings was as a saddle bearing in hydraulic pumps (typical Inner Diameter ranged from 6.000 inches to 14.000 inches) for large trucks and equipment. A manufacturing engineer was in the meeting and asked if the technology could be adapted into a much smaller package as he had linear ball bearings which were constantly failing. A quick conference call with the factory and the concept for the Simplicity Bearing was born.|$|E
5000|$|Phrygillus, was {{an ancient}} Greek artist, {{who appears to}} {{have been one of the}} most ancient, as well as one of the most celebrated medallists and {{engravers}} of precious stones. There is a very beautiful intaglio by him, representing Love seated and supporting himself on the ground, in the attitude of those figures of boys playing the game of astragals, which so often occurs in the works of ancient art. The form of the letters of the name ΦΡVΓΙΛΛ, the large size of the wings of the figure of Love, and the whole style of the gem, concur to show that the artist belonged to the earlier Greek school. There is also engraved upon this gem a bivalve shell, which also occurs on the coins of Syracuse whence it may be inferred that the artist was a Syracusan. This conjecture becomes a certainty through the fact, recently published by Raoul-Rochette, that there exist medals of Syracuse, on which the name of Phrygillus is inscribed. One medal of this type is in the possession of R. Rochette himself, who has given an engraving of it on the title-page of his Lettre a M. Schorn, by the side of an engraving of the gem already mentioned. Another medal of this type is in the collection of the Due de Luynes. The same collection contains another very beautiful Syracusan medal, in <b>bronze,</b> <b>bearing</b> the inscription ΦΡΥ, which no one can now hesitate to recognise as the initial letters of the name Phrygillus. Raoul-Rochette accounts these three medals to be among the most precious remains of ancient numismatic art.|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{bearings}} with a PTFE-based {{running surface}} were first introduced as {{a breakthrough in}} scroll compressor performance over 30 years ago. Â These bearings consisted of the polymer surface, porous bronze interlayer and steel supporting layer. Â That bearing construction has become widespread in compressor applications, while the bearing composition and performance have advanced, with improved environmental impact. Â Since that introduction, polymer application to the <b>bronze</b> <b>bearing</b> interlayer has relied on the deposition of a composite slurry to produce the low-friction, wear resistant surface. Â While that deposition method has served the compressor application well, bearing life was basically limited by the polymer integrity and layer thickness that were determined by the inherent nature of the slurry-based process. Â A new material technology {{has been applied to}} scroll compressor bearing manufacture to provide notably improved performance both in durability and seizure resistance in comparison to the historical slurry-based deposition method. Â This comparison has been documented through the utilization ofÂ Â wide-ranging laboratory-scale tribological testing to measure both the durability and starved-lubrication properties in conditions relevant to scroll compressor conditions as well as general tribological testing.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an investigation on {{the failure of}} a large leaded <b>bronze</b> <b>bearing</b> that supports a nine-ton roller of a plastic calendering machine. At the end of the normal service life of a good bearing, which lasted for seven years, a new bearing was installed. However the new one failed catastrophically within a few days, generating a huge amount of metallic wear debris and causing pitting {{on the surface of the}} cast iron roller. Following the failure, samples were collected from both good and failed bearings. The samples were analyzed chemically and their microstructures examined. Both samples were subjected to accelerated wear tests in a laboratory type pin-on-disk apparatus. During the tests, the bearing materials acted as pins, which were pressed against a rotating cast iron disk. The wear behaviors of both bearing materials were studied using weight loss measurement. The worn surfaces of samples and the wear debris were examined by light optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, and energy-dispersive x-ray microanalyzer. It was found that the laboratory pin-on-disk wear data correlated well with the plant experience. It is suggested that the higher lead content (similar to 18) of the good bearing compared with 7 lead of the failed bearing helped to establish a protective transfer layer on the worn surface. This transfer layer reduced metal-to-metal contact between the bearing and the roller and resulted in a lower wear rate. The lower lead content of the failed bearing does not allow the establishment of a well-protected transfer layer and leads to rapid wear...|$|E

40|$|Small {{automotive}} plain engine bearings {{are used}} to provide the relative motion between the engine block and the crankshaft via the connecting rod. Under rapidly changing engine loads, these bearings may suffer fatigue damage during service. In modern multilayered bearing designs, fatigue resistance is a complex function of engine loading coupled with the layer architecture and a multiphase lining alloy. This research has mostly focussed upon micro-scale fatigue damage initiation on thin (0. 2 - 0. 3 mm thickness) lining surface and its subsequent growth leading towards gross failure. The systems examined comprise Al alloys and sintered bronze as relatively soft and conformable lining layers. The weight percent composition of Al lining alloy was Al- 6. 5 Sn- 2. 5 Si- 1 Cu- 1 Ni- 0. 25 Mn roll bonded to a stiffer and thicker backing steel layer (1. 5 - 1. 8 mm thick) via an even thinner Al foil (0. 04 mm) as an interlayer. The other system comprised an Al lining (Al- 20 Sn– 1 Cu) alloy spray coated on to a medium carbon steel layer {{in the form of}} a flat bar. All these systems were compared with the previously investigated Al based designs with lining compositions: Al- 12 Sn- 4 Si- 1 Cu and Al- 20 Sn- 1 Cu- 0. 25 Mn (manufactured by roll bonding processes). The performance evaluation was based upon the investigation of microstructural features involved in early fatigue initiation and their effect upon short crack growth on the surface. Subsurface crack growth through the layers has also been assessed and finally the observed fatigue life of various components linked to these behaviours. A 3 -point bend test configuration was adopted for laboratory fatigue tests. Fatigue comparison was made on the basis of lining surface plastic strain amplitude vs. number of cycles to failure according to a uniform predefined criterion for all the systems. Maximum plastic strains developing at the lining surface were estimated using a combination of finite element analysis (FEA) and strain gauge measurements so that the fatigue life of all systems studied was presented as strain-life data. Specimens in the form of both finished bearings and flat bars were tested. Similar fatigue behaviour was observed for the two testing geometries, giving greater confidence in the fatigue evaluation process and allowing detailed observations of small crack initiation and growth processes in flat bars to be related to behaviour of the actual bearing geometry. In the previous research, the coarser Si particles in the Al- 12 Sn- 4 Si- 1 Cu lining and Sn particles in the Al- 20 Sn- 1 Cu- 0. 25 Mn alloys were identified as potential crack initiation sites, though the relationship between particle geometry and arrangement/clustering was found to be important. The newly developed Al- 6. 5 Sn- 2. 5 Si- 1 Cu- 1 Ni- 0. 25 Mn lining alloy with finer and fewer Sn and Si particles showed a delayed initiation of short fatigue cracks compared to the previous systems. However, a large number of widely scattered intermetallics in the new linings were observed to fracture causing early fatigue initiation at the micro-scale level with some more complex processes of detaching Sn layers from harder intermetallics and Si particles. Using the mechanical property data for bulk lining and secondary phase particles obtained from tensile testing and instrumented hardness testing, stress fields were investigated within the hard particles (intermetallics), surrounding thin layers and the matrix on the basis of the analytical and numerical modelling. On the basis of these modelling results, optimum particle shapes were defined to minimize tensile stresses (within the particles) and hydrostatic stresses (at the particle matrix interfaces). The experimental growth data of a dominant crack when combined with a Hobson type growth model based upon measured particle distributions and experimental crack growth rates, helped in predicting fatigue life of a similar component at different stress levels. Surface crack driving force reduces considerably when subsurface crack deflection occurred within softer Al interlayer. Replacing this interlayer with a harder brazed sheet did not give any significant difference in the observed fatigue life. In the HVOF systems, crack initiation was observed to be from the weaker interface between a harder matrix and softer circular unmelts as well as from various scattered pores. The overall fatigue life of the HVOF systems was comparable to the previous roll bonded systems; however subsurface deflection of crack at the lining-backing interface resulted in the debonding of the lining and hence the observed lining fatigue resistance may not be a good indication of the overall performance in a bearing system. At similar lining surface plastic strain levels, the <b>bronze</b> <b>bearing</b> with very thin Sn and Ni as overlay layers (~ 7 microns each) showed comparable fatigue resistance to the currently investigated RB Al based designs. However annealing this system resulted in the formation of hard Ni 3 Sn intermetallics at the Sn-Ni interface, and the observed fatigue resistance of this system was higher than the RB systems. This has been linked to very fine scale local crack deflection in the overlay layers (although these have not been observed clearly). All these layered bearing systems provide a complex fatigue problem. Factors which reduce initiation /early growth behaviour are likely to offer the best service performance enhancements in view of the relatively HCF nature expected in service.
