25|$|LLDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.915–0.925nbsp&g/cm3. LLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and puncture resistance than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress-cracking resistance, but is not as easy to process. LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and <b>bubble</b> <b>wrap,</b> to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world LLDPE market reached a volume of US$40 billion.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDrops and <b>bubbles</b> <b>wrapped</b> {{in dense}} monolayers of {{hydrophobic}} particles {{are known to}} sustain a significant decrease of their internal pressure. Through dedicated experiments we investigate the collapse behavior of such armored water drops {{as a function of}} the particle-to-drop size ratio in the range 0. 02 - 0. 2. We show that this parameter controls the behavior of the armor during the deflation: at small size ratios the drop shrinkage proceeds through the soft crumpling of the monolayer, at intermediate ratios the drop becomes faceted, and for the largest studied ratios the armor behaves like a granular arch. The results show that each of the three morphological regimes is characterized by an increasing magnitude of the collapse pressure. This increase is qualitatively modeled thanks to a mechanism involving out-of-plane deformations and particle disentanglement in the armor...|$|R

500|$|House {{is often}} filmed using the [...] "walk and talk" [...] filming technique, popularized on {{television}} by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing. The technique {{involves the use}} of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking. Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because [...] "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity". She noted the significance of [...] "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" [...] and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's [...] "cool, Fantastic Voyage–like special effects of patients' innards.

[...] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" [...] of one patient, another critic observed, [...] "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg". Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography. Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{multiphase}} {{model of}} FLUENT 6. 3,a underwater projectile cavitation model is established {{for a new}} designed underwater projectile which have a disc cavitator. Then the cavitation number influence on cavitation form is concerned and contrast with the empirical formula of cavitation form. The conclusion is：with the increase of cavitation number,the drag coefficient will increase non-linear;the cavitation slenderness radio is greater,the drag coefficient is smaller. Supercavitation phenomenon is that when a object moves in water and it’s speed increases constantly, according to Bernoulli's equation, this will make the hydrostatic pressure that it bears drop. And when the pressure down to the vaporization pressure of water at that temperature, the surface moisture of the object will change into steam, form <b>bubbles</b> and <b>wrap</b> it. Due to the density of water and steam has magnitude deviation, the viscous resistance acting on the underwater moving object will reduce greatly, that can make the performance of underwater weapon enhance markedly. In the military applications, there are represented by Russia, the torpedo of “snowstorm ” used the ventilation supercavitation theory and, represented by USA, the “ 20 mm Supercavitatio...|$|R
40|$|An impulsively started jet can {{be formed}} by a gas {{confined}} {{in a high}} pressure reservoir that escapes suddenly through an exit orifice, into a controlled atmosphere. Supersonic gas jets of this type are unsteady and differ from the steady jet that develops later {{by the presence of}} a bow shock, a jet head and a nonstationary Mach disk. The effects of the pressure ratio between the high pressure gas inside the reservoir and the lower pressure atmospheric gas, as well as the gas combination used, are studied experimentally. The gases used for the jet and the atmosphere were selected from helium, nitrogen and sulfur hexafluoride. The data acquisition consisted of: high resolution flash photography to obtain detail from the pictures; high-speed movie pictures to obtain the time development of selected features; and fast-response pressure transducers located at the reservoir end plate, the tank end plate and the jet exit. The initial development of the jet is highly time dependent. During this phase, the shape that the jet assumes varies with pressure ratio and with the choice of gas. In particular an extremely light gas exhausting into a heavy atmosphere, exhibits an uncommon shape. It develops as a <b>bubble</b> <b>wrapped</b> by the bow shock, that increases its volume with flow time and pressure ratio. As the pressure ratio increases, it becomes more tightly wrapped by the bow shock. At later times the jet assumes conventional linear growth. After the jet starts, a Mach disk is observed close to the jet exit which moves downstream as the exit pressure builds up. The monotonic increase in exit pressure is caused by the slow breaking of the diaphragm. The position of the Mach disk is furthest from the jet exit when the exit pressure is a maximum. After that it oscillates around the location predicted by the steady theory of Ashkenas and Sherman (1966) at a frequency close to one of the resonant frequencies of the reservoir. The features observed for the inner structure of the jet were verified to agree with those obtained for impulsive flow generated by a muzzle blast. The frontal part of the jet forms the jet head, whose shape changes with the flow conditions. The initial evolution of the jet head is linear but after propagating a distance of around ten exit diameters, it reaches asymptotic behavior with an evolution that is approximately proportional to square root of time. The head creates a bow shock ahead of it that propagates downstream and increases the pressure of the atmospheric gas. This bow shock was found to be less attenuated than in spherically symmetric explosions. The asymptotic behavior of the bow shock was reached after about eight exit diameters...|$|R
500|$|Impunities London {{exhibited}} alongside {{other works}} in the theme of masculine overreach at her 2015 second solo show in the Lawrie Shabibi gallery of Dubai. The show explored the emergence of machismo culture from themes of war heroism, exploitation, and violence, and machismo's relation to the seven deadly sins. Its central work, The Altarpiece, is an ink and wax print triptych in a gold leaf frame that visualizes war through its depiction of a World War II-era Berlin bunker. Civilians were forced to build the depicted bunker, which held private artworks from the Boros Collection as of the exhibition. ArtAsiaPacific wrote that the bullet holes {{on the walls of}} the bunker symbolized the wounds of Germany's involvement in the war. The magazine compared the work's format to that of early Christian art and considered the work [...] "an allegory for the political strategy of covering up the past for a more favorable present" [...] (revisionism). Tunisian Americans (2012) invoked the burial of American soldiers from the 1942 Tunisia Campaign, occupying foreign territory even in death. Grindballs, Hardballs, and Bangballs (2015) captured sand, cement, and pollen inside <b>bubble</b> <b>wrap</b> to reflect the masculine impulse to exploit the environment. A Short Story of Salt and Sun (2013), an ink and wax painting, comes from a print of a Tunisian resort's eroded wall to reflect on the inescapable erosion of man's creations and the decline of tourism in Tunisia.
