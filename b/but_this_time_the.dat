5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in {{violation}} of many regulations and in danger of default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure the regulators to let a sale go through, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> lawmakers were ignored.|$|E
5|$|A {{southbound}} {{passenger train}} and a pilot engine left Arthington station on 19 September 1854 heading for Leeds. A pilot engine had travelled northbound {{through the tunnel}} earlier the same day with no problems <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> train ran into a pile of stone debris and was derailed when it was three-quarters of {{the way into the}} tunnel. The debris was from a roof fall that affected both tracks. The train engine collided with the pilot engine tender causing considerable damage.|$|E
5|$|At the time, 404 {{would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.|$|E

5|$|Early on 10 June {{another group}} of thirty-one men arrived at the 9th Parachute Battalion position. These and other stragglers, who had arrived through the night, brought the {{battalion}} strength to around 270 men. At 11:00 the Germans attacked 'A' Company again, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> attack was ill-coordinated and was easily repelled. Shortly afterwards the battalion killed around fifty Germans, who had started digging defences {{in full view of}} the British position. Then 'A' Company ambushed a German patrol, causing several casualties. That afternoon a strong force of Germans occupied the Château and used it as a base to start an infantry and self propelled gun assault on the British battalion. With no mortar ammunition left, the British had to use their PIATs and machine-guns to stop the attack.|$|E
5|$|Following Cortés' {{visit in}} 1525, no Spanish {{attempted}} {{to visit the}} warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida {{on a mission to}} attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. They were well received at Nojpetén by the current Kan Ek'. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with the Itza king. The friars returned in October 1619, and again Kan Ek' welcomed them in a friendly manner, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Maya priesthood were hostile and the missionaries were expelled without food or water, but survived the journey back to Mérida.|$|E
5|$|Hyde Park's Speakers' Corner has {{acquired}} an international reputation for demonstrations and other protests {{due to its}} tolerance of free speech. In 1855, a protest at the park was organised to demonstrate against Robert Grosvenor's attempt to ban Sunday trading, including a restriction on pub opening times. Karl Marx observed approximately 200,000 protesters attended the demonstration, which involved jeering and taunting at upper-class horse carriages. A further protest occurred a week later, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> police attacked the crowd.|$|E

5|$|In 1953 Tange and the {{architectural}} journalist and critic Noboru Kawazoe {{were invited to}} attend {{the reconstruction of the}} Ise Shrine. The shrine has been reconstructed every 20years and in 1953 it was the 59th iteration. Normally the reconstruction process was a very closed affair <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> ceremony was opened to architects and journalists to document the event. The ceremony coincided {{with the end of the}} American Occupation and it seemed to symbolise a new start in Japanese architecture. In 1965 when Tange and Kawazoe published the book Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture, he likened the building to a modernist structure: an honest expression of materials, a functional design and prefabricated elements.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Preckwinkle {{and four}} others {{challenged}} Evans for the 4th ward alderman's position. In {{the first round}} of voting on February 26, 1991, she won nearly one-third popular vote in the ward by winning 20 of 58 precincts (all in the Hyde Park-Kenwood community). Evans and Preckwinkle again advanced to a runoff election, as they had in 1983, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> majority of the eliminated candidates endorsed Preckwinkle. On April 2, 1991, Preckwinkle performed better {{in the northern part of}} the ward and was elected by a 109-vote margin, defeating the 17-year incumbent alderman Evans.|$|E

In 2013–14, the Heat made the 2014 NBA Finals as they recorded their fourth straight Finals appearance. Miami faced the Spurs again <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> Heat went on to lose in five games.

5|$|The friars {{returned}} in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek' welcomed {{them in a}} friendly manner, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors, and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never return. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to Mérida.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedures}} {{used in the}} previous tests were repeated, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> winch cable snagged, and the test samples had to be retrieved by a jeep, exposing its crew to more radiation. The Los Alamos personnel assigned to remove the filters from the B-17 drones had apparently carried out the procedure on X-Ray and Yoke without problems, but this time three of them suffered radiation burns on their hands serious enough to be hospitalized and need skin grafting. One {{of the men who}} had carried out the procedure for Yoke was then also found to have burns on his hands and was hospitalized too, but was discharged on 28 May. Once again the drone tank gave trouble, and bogged in the crater, but the soil samples were retrieved by the backup drone tank. Both tanks were subsequently dumped in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|The tercentenary of {{the capture}} of Gibraltar was celebrated in the {{territory}} in August 2004 but attracted criticism from some in Spain. In September 2006, tripartite talks between Spain, Gibraltar and the UK resulted in a deal (known as the Cordoba Agreement) {{to make it easier}} to cross the border and to improve transport and communications links between Spain and Gibraltar. Among the changes was an agreement to lift restrictions on Gibraltar's airport to enable airlines operating from Spain to land there and to facilitate use of the airport by Spanish residents. It did not address the vexed issue of sovereignty, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> government of Gibraltar supported it.

5|$|By 360, Gaul was {{sufficiently}} secure to permit Julian to despatch reinforcements of about 3,000 men under magister armorum Lupicinus to Britain, which {{had suffered a}} serious land and sea invasion by the Picts of Caledonia (Scotland) and the Scoti of Hibernia (Ireland). But at the same time, Julian received a demand from Constantius, who {{was unaware of the}} British expedition, that he send 4 auxilia palatina regiments plus select squadrons of cavalry (about 2,500 men) under Lupicinus to the East as reinforcements for the war against the Persians. This triggered a near-mutiny by Julian's soldiers, who again proclaimed him Augustus. He again refused, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> troops insisted, making it clear they would mutiny if he refused and march against Constantius with or without him. Alarmed, but also secretly pleased, Julian accepted the title and wrote an apologetic letter to Constantius explaining why he had felt it necessary to bow to his soldiers' wishes and requesting his ratification. But this was refused by Constantius, who replied demanding that Julian revert to Caesar status. Julian ignored the order, but to prove his good faith and also to keep his near-mutinous troops occupied, he crossed the Rhine and attacked the Attuarii tribe of the Frankish confederation.|$|E

5|$|In early 2010 La Sombra began a storyline {{feud with}} El Felino. The feud began on February 2, 2010, during a singles match between El Felino and La Sombra; when tied at one fall each, Puma King, El Felino's son, showed up wearing an El Felino outfit and mask, distracting both the referee and La Sombra {{long enough for}} El Felino to land a low blow on La Sombra to win the match. The two met in a Lighting match (a one fall, 10 minute time limit match) on the February 19 CMLL Super Viernes show. Once again Puma King tried to help his uncle, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> referee disqualified El Felino for the transgression. La Sombra and El Felino {{continued}} to feud, both interfering in a match between Volador Jr. and Místico. The storyline led to Místico, Volador Jr., La Sombra and El Felino being booked in a four-way Lucha de Apuestas match as the main event of the 2010 2010 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas ("Homage to Two Legends") show. La Sombra was the first man pinned at Dos Leyendas and El Felino was the second, forcing the two to compete with their masks on the line. La Sombra pinned El Felino, forcing him to unmask and reveal his real name.|$|E
