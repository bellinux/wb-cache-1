[...] Wales was also observed to have modified references to Bomis {{in a way that}} was characterized as downplaying the sexual nature of some of his former company's products.

2500|$|Pelton {{has written}} about {{contemporary}} private military contractors (Licensed to Kill, Hired Guns in the War on Terror), {{as well as his}} experiences with US Special Forces in the opening weeks in the War on Terror. Of Licensed to Kill, one reviewer summarized: [...] "His is a journalistic story-quilt of characters engaged as private security contractors and mercenaries {{in a variety of settings}} from Afghanistan to Equatorial Guinea.... The pages turn... because Pelton’s stories are intrinsically interesting." [...] The book was reviewed by author and filmmaker Sebastian Junger (“An incredible look into the murky and virtually impenetrable world of private military contractors [...] [...] [...] Pelton may well have seen the future.”) and terrorism expert Peter Bergen ("A rollicking read that takes the reader inside the murky world of military contractors—from the craggy passes of the Afghan-Pakistan border, to the extreme danger of Baghdad’s airport road, to the diamond fields of Africa. Licensed to Kill is not only a great travelogue, it also has some important things to say about the <b>brave</b> <b>new</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> privatized violence").|$|E

50|$|To this end, the storyline of Year Zero borrows {{heavily from}} such {{well-known}} dystopian fiction as George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four (government surveillance), Aldous Huxley's <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> (use <b>of</b> drugs to subdue the populace), Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 (large-scale censorship and uniformism), and Yevgeny Zamyatin's We (synthesis {{of church and}} state). Specific plot elements bear a resemblance to the Philip K. Dick short story Faith of Our Fathers, including hallucinogens in the water supply, an oppressive, heavily militaristic state, aggressive government monitoring of the populace, and a venerated entity which manifests in many forms. In keeping with the dystopian theme, Year Zero takes place in 2022, {{the same year as}} the 1973 film Soylent Green.|$|R
