5|$|A snow sweeper uses <b>brushes</b> {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from the {{pavement}} surface. Snow sweepers are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible <b>brushes</b> follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These <b>brushes</b> also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the <b>brushes,</b> and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the <b>brushes,</b> in order to blow the swept snow clear of the pavement and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E

50|$|A {{spring is}} {{typically}} {{used with the}} <b>brush,</b> to maintain constant contact with the commutator. As the <b>brush</b> and commutator wear down, the spring steadily pushes the <b>brush</b> downwards towards the commutator. Eventually the <b>brush</b> wears small and thin enough that steady contact {{is no longer possible}} or it is no longer securely held in the <b>brush</b> holder, and so the <b>brush</b> must be replaced.|$|R

5|$|<b>Brushes</b> Clough and Pingot {{are former}} coal and {{sandstone}} quarries on Crompton Moor. During the 1970s, quarrying was halted, {{the land was}} reclaimed, and thousands of pine trees were planted. The area has since been used for recreation, including hiking, orienteering, and mountain biking. <b>Brushes</b> Clough Reservoir was constructed in the 19th century by the Oldham County Borough Council, using stone quarried from this site. The area is now managed by United Utilities.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{simulation}} method of the <b>brush</b> stroke is proposed by applying force feedback {{technology to the}} virtual painting process. The relationship between force and the <b>brush</b> deformation is analyzed, and the spring-mass model is applied to construct the <b>brush</b> model, which can realistically simulate the <b>brush</b> morphological changes according to the force exerted on it. According to the deformation of the <b>brush</b> model at a sampling point, the <b>brush</b> footprint between the <b>brush</b> and the paper is calculated in real time. Then, the <b>brush</b> stroke is obtained by superimposing <b>brush</b> footprints along sampling points, and the dynamic painting of the <b>brush</b> stroke is implemented. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the virtual painting system based on the force feedback technology. In this system, users can implement the painting in real time with a Phantom Desktop haptic device, which can effectively enhance reality to users...|$|R

40|$|Oral biofilm {{is inevitably}} left behind, even after powered <b>brushing.</b> As a special feature, powered <b>brushing</b> removes biofilm in a noncontact mode. When the <b>brushing</b> {{distance}} becomes too large, biofilm is left behind. We hypothesize that biofilm left behind after <b>brushing</b> has different viscoelastic properties than before <b>brushing,</b> impacting antimicrobial penetration. In vitro grown dual-species biofilms {{were subjected to}} 20 % mechanical deformation before and after powered <b>brushing</b> at 4 -mm <b>brushing</b> distance. Biofilm thickness and stress relaxation were measured for unbrushed and <b>brushed</b> biofilms. Stress relaxation was analyzed with a three-element Maxwell model. Antimicrobial penetration from five mouthrinses was microscopically evaluated for unbrushed and <b>brushed</b> biofilms. Thicknesses of unbrushed and <b>brushed</b> biofilms were similar. <b>Brushing</b> decreased the prevalence of fast and increased the prevalence of slow relaxation elements, which was accompanied by deeper penetration of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride. Penetration of antimicrobials from other mouthrinses was relatively low in unbrushed and <b>brushed</b> biofilms. This confirmation of our hypothesis points to an additional advantage of powered toothbrushing in a noncontact mode, changing the viscoelastic properties of biofilm {{in a direction that}} increases antimicrobial penetration of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium. The biofilm left behind after noncontact powered toothbrushing may have less recalcitrance toward penetration of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride than prior to <b>brushing...</b>|$|R

In this newly designed tooth <b>brush,</b> the bristles of anterior portion {{of the head of}} the tooth <b>brush</b> are elongated and tapered towards the tip of the bristles and rest of the bristles are shorter than the anterior bristles.
