40|$|Anterior eye {{structure}} and retinal visual fields were determined in grey–headed and black–browed albatrosses, Diomedea melanophris and D. chrysostoma (Procellariiformes, Diomedeidae), using keratometry and an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique. Results {{for the two}} species were very similar and indicate that the eyes are of an amphibious optical design suggesting that albatross vision is well suited to the visual pursuit of active prey both on and below the ocean surface. The corneas are relatively flat (radius ca. 14. 5 mm) and hence of low absolute refractive power (ca. 23 dioptres). In air the binocular fields are relatively long (vertical extent ca. 70 °) and narrow (maximum width in {{the plane of the}} optic axes 26 – 32 °), a topography found in a range of bird species that employ visual guidance of bill position when foraging. The cyclopean fields measure approximately 270 ° in the horizontal plane, but there is a 60 ° <b>blind</b> <b>sector</b> above the head owing to the positioning of the eyes below the protruding supraorbital ridges. Upon immersion the monocular fields decrease in width such that the binocular fields are abolished. Anterior eye structure, and visual field topography in both air and water, show marked similarity with those of the Humboldt pengui...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{with left}} {{unilateral}} neglect bisect long horizontal {{lines to the}} right of the true centre. However, when given short lines, many of the same patients mark the midpoint to the left of the true centre, towards the otherwise neglected space. This paradoxical phenomenon has been termed 'cross-over' and is difficult to explain based on current accounts of the neglect syndrome. To explore the causes of cross-over, in a first study we evaluated bisection of 20, 100 and 200 mm horizontal lines in groups of unilateral brain-damaged patients with neglect and hemianopia, with neglect and no hemianopia, with hemianopia and no neglect and without neglect or hemianopia. Cross-over of 20 mm lines was found only in neglect patients with hemianopia. To ascertain further the influence of visual field defects on cross-over, in a second study we compared the performance of two right-brain-damaged patients with contralesional neglect and inferior quadrantanopia with that of a patient with inferior quadrantanopia and no neglect. Patients bisected lines oriented so as to cross or uncross the blind quadrant of the visual field. When short 20 mm lines crossed the blind quadrant, neglect patients showed cross-over; when the same lines crossed the seeing quadrants cross-over was absent. These findings were confirmed by the examination of a neglect patient with sparing of the central 5 degrees of the contralesional left visual hemifield in the right eye and no sparing in the left eye. In monocular viewing, cross-over was present when 20 mm lines were bisected with the left eye and absent when bisected with the right eye. Recording of eye movements showed that at the moment of bisection left eye fixations shifted towards the contralesional line endpoint whereas right eye fixations remained anchored to the centre of the line. With long lines, both eyes deviated ipsilesionally. These results show that in neglect patients ipsilesional deviation in the bisection of long lines turns into apparently paradoxical contralesional bisection of short ones only when these cross a retinotopically <b>blind</b> <b>sector</b> of the neglected space. Cross-over seems to depend on the small spatial effects produced by reflexive contralesional gaze shifts allowing eccentric fixations with the seeing hemifield. During the bisection of long lines, these effects are cancelled out by the strong attentional deviation induced by the marked extension of the ipsilesional line segment. This explanation establishes coherence between cross-over and current accounts of the neglect syndrome...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{completion}} of the Three Gorges reservoir {{makes it possible for}} a fleet with 10, 000 tons or more to proceed directly to Chongqing though the Three Gorges reservoir area. The potential vessel collision risks should be highlighted to large fleets in the Reservoir arising from dead area in the radar blind zones. The analysis of radar <b>blind</b> <b>sectors</b> is of help to overcome the adverse radar conditions and take adequate actions such as piloting, maneuvering, etc. to avoid collisions risks and navigation in radar blind areas. On October 26, 2010, the backwater in 175 meters in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (hereinafter referred to as Reservoir) arrived at Jiangjin Huaqi in Chongqing and indicated that the Three Gorges Reservoir had been completely established after 18 years. Dam water level reaching 175 meters, navigation conditions in the reservoir area from Yichang to Chongqing in 600 kilometers are fundamentally improved and large vessels, especially large fleet will continue to increase. At the same time, ship collision avoidance, especially large fleet will be more and more difficult. As a critical navigation aid on ship, radar {{plays an important role in}} the collision avoidance. However, the effect of radar <b>blind</b> <b>sectors</b> on ship collision avoidance must be paid close attention. In this article, analysis will be made on radar blind spots and some solutions provided t...|$|R

In binocular vision, the patient showed underestimation of the horizontal size of contralesional line segments unless cued to localise their end points. When asked to reproduce, in monocular vision, 10 ° and 20 ° distances between two attentionally cued end points lying on the frontal vertical plane, the patient showed relative contralesional overextension and ipselesional underextension along the directions falling within the <b>blind</b> <b>sectors</b> of the neglected space. No asym-metry was present along the directions falling within the seeing sectors of the same space. These findings sugges...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Lateral, homonymous {{upper and}} lower field <b>blind</b> <b>sectors</b> sparing a {{horizontal}} zone define quadruple sectoranopia. This rare campimetric deficit involves ischemia or infarction of parts of the lateral geniculate body supplied by the distal anterior choroidal artery. METHODS: A 41 -year-old patient presented with a complaint of blurred vision. Visual acuity was 20 / 20 on both sides. Visual field showed a left quadruple sectoranopia. CT scan, MRI, MRA and conventional angiography showed a right cerebral arteriovenous malformation supplied partly by the right anterior choroidal artery. Partial retinal nerve fiber layer atrophy matched to the campimetric deficit proved that some degree of infarction involved the lateral geniculate body. RESULTS: The arteriovenous malformation was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. Two years after treatment, the nidus had completely disappeared. The campimetric deficit began improving from 19 months onwards after stereotactic radiosurgery. Twenty-eight months after treatment, the superior defect had completely reversed. CONCLUSIONS: Quadruple sectoranopia involves ischemia or infarction of parts of the lateral geniculate body supplied by the distal anterior choroidal artery. Following radio-induced angioma thrombosis, blood was no longer shunted away from the right lateral geniculate body, whose viable areas resumed their activity. Accordingly, a partial campimetric recovery occurred...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} {{view that}} visual system damage is permanent {{has given way}} to a more optimistic view. Visual loss does not remain unchanged but it can recover spontaneously to some extent. Even when the period of spontaneous recovery has ended there is still additional potential for plasticity and regeneration, even months or years after the lesion. There are two fundamental approaches to harvest this plasticity potential: (i) to rescue dying cells or induce axonal regeneration of visual system neurons through biological (pharmacological) means and (ii) to capture the residual vision capacities and improve their functions by behavioural training. Visual training can be used to activate residual visual neurons either in the <b>blind</b> <b>sectors</b> of the visual field through alternative pathways or {{it can be used to}} activate partially damaged regions in the border zone near the lesion site. Another example of post-lesion neuroplasticity is the ability of the intact visual field sectors to (spontaneously) take over functions and this is seen, for example, in macular degeneration and even in developmental disorders, such as amblyopia who benefit from training even many years beyond the critical period. Just as plasticity after brain damage is well recognized in other functional systems (motor, somatosensory), plasticity of the visual system is now gradually being recognized as a useful mechanism whereby the brain compensates for its functional loss, either spontaneously or by repetitive visual stimulation. 1...|$|R
