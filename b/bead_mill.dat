The density and the strength of Si 3 N 4 ceramics were degraded, however, because the CNTs prevented Si 3 N 4 from densifying. The CNTs disappeared after firing at high temperatures owing to the reaction between CNTs and Si 3 N 4 or SiO 2, or both Si 3 N 4 and SiO 2. In order to improve the density and suppress the reaction, sintering aids for lower-temperature densification of Si 3 N 4 are needed. In this study, we added HfO 2 as a sintering aid to a Si 3 N 4 –Y 2 O 3 –Al 2 O 3 –AlN–TiO 2 system to fabricate CNT-dispersed Si 3 N 4 ceramics at lower temperatures.

Significant process variables, cell slurry feed rate (A), bead load (B), cell load (C) and run time (D), were investigated and optimized for maximizing COD recovery. RSM predicted an optimum of feed rate of 310. 73 mL/h, bead loading of 79. 9 % (v/v), cell loading OD 600 nm of 74, and run time of 29. 9 min with a recovery of ~ 3. 2 g/L. ANN coupled with GA predicted a maximum COD recovery of ~ 3. 5 g/L at an optimum feed rate (mL/h) : 258. 08, bead loading (%, v/v) : 80 %, cell loading (OD 600 nm) : 73. 99, and run time of 32 min.

In this study, nanocrystals of nicergoline were prepared {{in an aqueous}} solution of polysorbate 80 (nanosuspension) by using four different laboratory scale size reduction techniques: high pressure homogenization (HPH), <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> (BM), and combination techniques (high pressure homogenization followed by <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> HPH+BM, and <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> followed by high pressure homogenization BM+HPH). Nanocrystals were investigated regarding to their mean particles size, zeta potential, and particle dissolution. A short term physical stability study on nanocrystals stored at three different temperatures (4, 20 °C, and 40 °C) was performed to evaluate the tendency to change in particle size, aggregation and zeta-potential. The size reduction technique and the process parameters like milling time, number of homogenization cycles and pressure greatly affected the size of nanocrystals.

The effects of different chemical extractants (sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], chloroform, phenol, Chelex 100, and guanadinium isothiocyanate), different physical disruption methods (<b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> homogenization and freeze-thaw lysis), and lysozyme digestion were evaluated based on the yield and molecular size of the recovered DNA. Pairwise comparisons of the nine extraction procedures revealed that <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> homogenization with SDS combined with either chloroform or phenol optimized both the amount of DNA extracted and the molecular size of the DNA (maximum size, 16 to 20 kb). Neither lysozyme digestion before SDS treatment nor guanidine isothiocyanate treatment nor addition of Chelex 100 resin improved the DNA yields. <b>Bead</b> <b>mill</b> homogenization in a lysis mixture containing chloroform, SDS, NaCl, and phosphate-Tris buffer (pH 8) {{was found to be}} the best physical lysis technique when DNA yield and cell lysis efficiency were used as criteria.

40|$|Contamination of {{soil with}} Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) {{is a serious}} {{environmental}} issue because some PAHs are toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic. Bioremediation is a promising option to completely remove PAHs from the environment or convert them to less harmful compounds. One of the main challenges in bioremediation of PAHs in a conventional roller bioreactor is the limitation on mass transfer due to the strong hydrophobicity and low water solubility of these compounds. To address this challenge, a novel <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactor (BMB) was developed by Riess et al. (2005) which demonstrated a significant improvement in the rates of mass transfer and biodegradation of PAHs. In this study, to further improve mass transfer rates, baffles have been installed in both the conventional and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. Mass transfer rates of 1000 mg L- 1 suspended naphthalene, 2 -methylnaphthalene and 1, 5 -dimethylnaphthalene, three model compounds of PAHs, have been investigated in four bioreactors: conventional (control), baffled, BMB and baffled <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. The baffled bioreactor provided mass transfer coefficients (KLa) that were up to 7 times {{higher than those of}} the control bioreactor. Bioremediation of suspended naphthalene or 2 -methylnaphthalene as a single substrate and their mixtures was studied using the bacterium Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17484. Both baffled and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors provided maximum bioremediation rates that were 2 times higher than the control bioreactor. The maximum bioremediation rates of 2 -methylnaphthalene were further increased in the presence of naphthalene by a factor of 1. 5 to 2 compared to the single substrate. Another rate-limiting step for bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soil is the strong sorption between the contaminant and soil. To find out the effect of sorption on the bioavailability of naphthalene, the appropriate sorption isotherms for three types of soils (sand, silt and clay) have been determined. It was observed that the sorption capacity of soils for naphthalene was proportional to the organic carbon content of the soils. The mass transfer of soil-bound naphthalene from the artificially prepared contaminated soils with short contamination history to the aqueous phase was studied in both the control and <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> bioreactors. It was observed that the mass transfer was unexpectedly fast due to the increased interfacial surface area of naphthalene particles and the weak sorption between naphthalene and soils. It was concluded that artificially, naphthalene contaminated soils would likely not be any more difficult to bioremediate than pure naphthalene particles...|$|E

The results obtained suggest a compromise between pDNA(sc) purity and recuperation in the process development...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCombinations {{of three}} cell disrupting methods {{were used for}} lipid {{extraction}} from the Gram-positive bacterium, Streptomyces pristinaespiralis: lysozyme treatment, freeze-drying and <b>bead</b> <b>mill.</b> The determination of extracted phospholipids (PL) was carried out using thin layer chromatography coupled with a flame ionisation detector. It appeared that freeze-drying induced the highest PL extraction and that only lysozyme addition permitted to extract phosphatidylserine. The optimal cellular dry weight for the extraction and the subsequent separation {{and analysis of the}} PL was 50 mg...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBreakage and {{selection}} functions for wet-phase grinding of carbon in a stirred <b>bead</b> <b>mill</b> have been {{determined by a}} method based on Kapur's first-order approximate solution. This allows calculation of curves of B-ij = F (x(i) /x(j)) which are used to characterise the fragmentation mechanisms in terms of either abrasion or fragmentation. Comparison of the mechanisms identified in this way, with observation of the fragments produced under different grinding conditions {{by means of a}} scanning electron microscope coupled with image analysis confirms the validity of these conclusions...|$|E
30|$|This {{investigation}} utilized theoretically required quantitative {{relations and}} sought ways {{to enhance the}} processability. To fabricate films with a low haze, different processing conditions were tested. For these studies, a film was fabricated from nonstoichiometric cesium-doped tungsten trioxide (Cs 0.33 WO 3) nanoparticles synthesized using a solid reaction [15] and <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> method [16] using a composite layer coating and a novel double layer coating. Then, the optical absorption characteristics from the visible to near-infrared regions were compared to {{examine the effect of}} distance between Cs 0.33 WO 3 nanoparticles in each layer.|$|R
40|$|Gender {{of animal}} {{offspring}} {{is of great}} interest to farmers where gender selection is achieved via the separation of male-bearing from female-bearing sperms prior to performing artificial insemination. A start-up company (Ab Biotech Inc.) has developed a technique for gender selection based on the production of an intracellular single-domain antibody (sdAb) using the bacterium Escherichia coli capable of sexing bovine sperm. The purpose of this research was to provide a recommendation to Ab Biotech Inc. for the lysis of E. coli. An efficient lysis technique was required in order to release the intracellular sdAb. In the dairy industry, sexing for female calves is preferred since male calves are not useful for the purpose of milk production. Multiple lysis techniques were tested in order to provide a feasible recommendation for Ab Biotech Inc. These techniques included high pressure homogenization, sonication, <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> and enzymatic/chemical lysis using lysozymes and Triton X- 100. Required lysis time, extent of lysis and potential operating costs were contributing factors for determining an optimal technique. The extent of lysis was determined by quantifying the total amount of released protein using SDS-PAGE densitometry. It was recommended to choose <b>bead</b> <b>milling</b> for potential process upscaling since a large amount of fractional lysis (0. 70) was obtained over a short amount of lysis time (3 min) with an inexpensive ($ 9. 50 /kg) 0. 3 mm mixture of glass beads...|$|R
30|$|We have {{fabricated}} Si nanoparticles from Si swarf {{using the}} <b>beads</b> <b>milling</b> method. The mode diameter of produced Si nanoparticles was between 4.8 and 5.2  nm. Si nanoparticles in hexane show photoluminescence (PL) spectra with peaks at 2.56, 2.73, 2.91, and 3.09  eV. The peaked PL spectra {{are attributed to}} the vibronic structure of adsorbed dimethylanthracene (DMA) impurity in hexane. The PL intensity of hexane with DMA increases by ~ 3000 times by adsorption on Si nanoparticles. The PL enhancement results from an increase in absorption probability of incident light by DMA caused by adsorption {{on the surface of}} Si nanoparticles.|$|R
