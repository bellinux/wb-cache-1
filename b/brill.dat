5|$|Although little-used by passengers, <b>Brill</b> {{station was}} {{valuable}} {{as a relatively}} rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to <b>Brill</b> station for the first train each morning. There was also {{a small amount of}} coal traffic to the station; <b>Brill</b> coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of <b>Brill</b> were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the <b>Brill</b> Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.|$|E
5|$|Few records survive of the <b>Brill</b> Brick and Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to <b>Brill,</b> implying that <b>Brill</b> Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. This is almost certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the <b>Brill</b> Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to <b>Brill</b> or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E

5|$|In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham {{opened a}} modern brickworks near <b>Brill</b> station, with a {{dedicated}} siding, and in 1895 his heir William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe, expanded the brickworks, {{which became the}} <b>Brill</b> Brick & Tile Works, using the <b>Brill</b> Tramway to deliver bricks to the main line at Quainton Road. With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, <b>Brill</b> Brick & Tile Works was unable {{to compete with the}} nearby brickworks at Calvert, and soon closed. The building was taken over by the Fenemore workshop, making hay loaders, before being converted into a timber yard in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Brill</b> Tramway, {{also known}} as the Quainton Tramway, Wotton Tramway, Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad and Metropolitan Railway <b>Brill</b> Branch, was a six-mile (10km) rail line in the Aylesbury Vale, Buckinghamshire, England. It was privately built in 1871 by the 3rd Duke of Buckingham as a horse tram line to {{transport}} goods between his lands around Wotton House and the national railway network. Lobbying from residents of the nearby town of <b>Brill</b> led to the line's extension to <b>Brill</b> and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought for the line, but as it had been designed and built with horses in mind, services were very slow; trains travelled at an average speed of only 4miles per hour (6.4km/h).|$|E

5|$|The Duke of Buckingham built a short horse-drawn tramway to {{transport}} goods between his estates at Wotton and a terminus {{adjacent to the}} station. He extended it soon afterwards to provide a passenger service {{to the town of}} <b>Brill,</b> and the tramway was converted to locomotive operation, known as the <b>Brill</b> Tramway. All goods to and from the <b>Brill</b> Tramway passed through Quainton Road, making it relatively heavily used despite its geographical isolation, and traffic increased further when construction began on Ferdinand de Rothschild's mansion of Waddesdon Manor. The plan of extending the <b>Brill</b> Tramway to Oxford, which would have made Quainton Road a major junction station, was abandoned. Instead, the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the <b>Brill</b> Tramway were absorbed by London's Metropolitan Railway (MR), which already operated the line from Aylesbury to London. The MR rebuilt Quainton Road and re-sited it to a more convenient location, allowing through running between the <b>Brill</b> Tramway and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. When the Great Central Railway (GCR) from the north of England opened, Quainton Road became a significant junction at which trains from four directions met, and by far the busiest of the MR's rural stations.|$|E
5|$|With the {{stations}} at Wood Siding and <b>Brill</b> closed, and the Great Western Railway's <b>Brill</b> and Ludgershall railway station inconveniently sited, the GWR {{opened a new}} station on the Chiltern Main Line nearby at Dorton Halt on 21 June 1937. Both Dorton Halt and <b>Brill</b> and Ludgersall stations were closed on 7 January 1963; the line remains in use by trains between Princes Risborough and Bicester North. There are no longer any open railway stations {{in the vicinity of}} <b>Brill</b> and Wood Siding.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{existing}} line had been upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, {{operation of the}} <b>Brill</b> Tramway {{was taken over by}} London's Metropolitan Railway and <b>Brill</b> became one of its two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The <b>Brill</b> Tramway went into financial decline.|$|E

5|$|Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, {{aimed to}} move the network away from freight services, and to {{concentrate}} on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. In particular, he saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to <b>Brill</b> and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 30 November 1935 the last train ran on the <b>Brill</b> Tramway between <b>Brill</b> and Quainton Road, and at the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed. The former Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway between Quainton Road and Verney Junction was closed to passengers on 6 July 1936, and London Transport services north of Aylesbury were withdrawn.|$|E

5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the GWR Chiltern Main Line opened, {{allowing}} trains from London to Birmingham to bypass a long curve through Oxford. The new line was routed directly through Wood Siding, although no interchange station was built. The GWR ran in a cutting beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line. The new line included the station named <b>Brill</b> and Ludgershall, which in reality was considerably further from <b>Brill</b> than the existing <b>Brill</b> station.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. As a result, the <b>Brill</b> Tramway {{became a part of}} the London Underground. The management of London Transport aimed to concentrate on electrification and the improvement of passenger services in London, and saw little possibility that the former Metropolitan Railway routes in Buckinghamshire could ever become viable passenger routes. In 1935 all services on the <b>Brill</b> Tramway were withdrawn, and the line was closed. The infrastructure of the route was dismantled and sold shortly afterwards. Very little trace of the <b>Brill</b> Tramway remains, other than the former junction station at Quainton Road, now the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.|$|E
