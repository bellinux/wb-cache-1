40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in healthcare is the loss or failure of organs or tissues resulting from diseases, post-surgery complications, trauma or organ failure. As a result of tissue and organ shortage, {{there is a need}} for biomaterials designed to promote tissue regeneration resulting in good quality repair of tissues or organs, to maintain or repair biological function. Collagen, as one {{of the main}} proteins in the human body, has been extensively used in the development of biomaterials which can be used as tissue substitutes or can assist in tissue regeneration. Before commercialisation is allowed all biomaterials must prove to be functional and suitable for clinical use. Therefore, the evaluation of biomaterials requires rigorous and relevant testing. Biomaterials must be able to perform with an appropriate host response in a specific application. Tests must provide information to understand the host response, long-term outcome and issues pertaining to these. In the research reported in this thesis, an acellular porcine derived cross-linked collagen-based biomaterial (Permacol ® surgical implant) was analysed with a wide range of evaluation and compared to acellular noncross-linked and cellular, naturally cross-linked, equivalents. These matrices were characterized relating to their structure, composition and mechanical and biochemical properties. In addition, biological characterisation was performed through several studies designed to evaluate and compare biological responses in vitro, as well as in situ assessment of biocompatibility and effectiveness as a repair material and as <b>bulking</b> <b>tissue.</b> Permacol ® surgical implant was shown to be biocompatible, effective and efficient when used as <b>bulking</b> <b>tissue</b> and for soft tissue repair; furthermore, this biomaterial was resistant to enzymatic digestion and tolerant to bacterial presence suggesting that it could be used in some complicated clinical situations.

Micro-proton-induced X-ray emission (μ-PIXE) spectroscopy was used to map the elemental distribution of the accumulated metal(loid) s, Ca and K in leaf or pinnule tissues of the two plant species. Samples were prepared by two contrasting specimen preparation techniques: freeze-substitution in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and freeze-drying. The specimens were analysed to compare the suitability of each technique in preserving (i) the spatial elemental distribution and (ii) the tissue structure of the specimens. Further, the μ-PIXE results were compared with concentration of elements in the <b>bulk</b> <b>tissue</b> obtained by ICP-AES analysis. In H. floribundus subsp. floribundus, μ-PIXE analysis revealed Ni, Ca and K concentrations in freeze-dried leaf tissues were at par with <b>bulk</b> <b>tissue</b> concentrations. Elemental distribution maps illustrated that Ni was preferentially localised in the adaxial epidermal tissues (1 % DW) and least concentration was found in spongy mesophyll tissues (0. 53 % DW). Conversely, elemental distribution maps of THF freeze-substituted tissues indicated significantly lower Ni, Ca and K concentrations than freeze-dried specimens and <b>bulk</b> <b>tissue</b> concentrations. Moreover, Ni concentrations were uniform across the whole specimen and no localisation was observed. In P. calomelanos var. austroamericana freeze-dried pinnule tissues, μ-PIXE revealed statistically similar As, Ca and K concentrations as compared to <b>bulk</b> <b>tissue</b> concentrations. Elemental distribution maps showed that As localisation was relatively uniform across the whole specimen. Once again, THF freeze-substituted tissues revealed a significant loss of As compared to freeze-dried specimens and the concentrations obtained by <b>bulk</b> <b>tissue</b> analysis.

CRMs are essential for accurate instrument calibration, for assessing the complete analytical method from sample extraction to data analysis, and for verifying trueness.

We also related the degree of CAM to light habitat and relative abundance of species in the three sites. For all species, the greatest tissue acid accumulation occurred during the rainy season. In the 500  mm site, tissue acidification was greater for the species growing at 30 % of daily total photon flux density (PFD) than species growing at 80 % PFD. Whereas in the two wetter sites, the species growing at 80 % total PFD had greater tissue acidification.

Breast cancer affects one in eleven women over aged 50 in Australia [1]. Triple assessment, a combination of breast examination, mammogram and fine-needle biopsy, is the current standard for diagnosis [2]. Alternative diagnostic techniques, including magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) ex-vivo, allow the distinction between pathologies with accuracies approaching 100 % [3]. Ultimately, we wish to conduct parallel Raman studies with both MRS and pathology. Ideally, sample processing would be common to each of these diagnostic techniques in order to minimise variations.

Laser capture microdissection (LCM) provides higher specificity {{in the selection of}} target cells compared to traditional <b>bulk</b> <b>tissue</b> selection methods, but at an increased processing cost. The benefit gained from the higher tissue specificity realized through LCM sampling is evaluated in this study through a comparison of microarray expression profiles obtained from same-samples using bulk and LCM processing. Methods Expression data from ten lung adenocarcinoma samples and six adjacent normal samples were acquired using LCM and bulk sampling methods. Expression values were evaluated for correlation between sample processing methods, as well as for bias introduced by the additional linear amplification required for LCM sample profiling. Results The direct comparison of expression values obtained from the bulk and LCM sampled datasets reveals a large number of probesets with significantly varied expression. Many of these variations were shown to be related to bias arising from the process of linear amplification, which is required for LCM sample preparation. A comparison of differentially expressed genes (cancer vs. normal) selected in the bulk and LCM datasets also showed substantial differences. There were {{more than twice as many}} down-regulated probesets identified in the LCM data than identified in the bulk data. Controlling for the previously identified amplification bias did not have a substantial impact on the differences identified in the differentially expressed probesets found in the bulk and LCM samples. Conclusion LCM-coupled microarray expression profiling was shown to uniquely identify a large number of differentially expressed probesets not otherwise found using <b>bulk</b> <b>tissue</b> sampling. The information gain realized from the LCM sampling was limited to differential analysis, as the absolute expression values obtained for some probesets using this study's protocol were biased during the second round of amplification.

40|$|AbstractFast and non-invasive, {{diagnostic}} techniques {{based on}} fluorescence spectroscopy {{have the potential}} to link the biochemical and morphologic properties of tissues to individual patient care. One of the most widely explored applications of fluorescence spectroscopy is the detection of endoscopically invisible, early neoplastic growth in epithelial tissue sites. Currently, there are no effective diagnostic techniques for these early tissue transformations. If fluorescence spectroscopy can be applied successfully as a diagnostic technique in this clinical context, it may increase the potential for curative treatment, and thus, reduce complications and health care costs. Steady-state, fluorescence measurements from small tissue regions as well as relatively large tissue fields have been performed. To a much lesser extent, time-resolved, fluorescence measurements have also been explored for tissue characterization. Furthermore, sources of both intrinsic (endogenous fluorophores) and extrinsic fluorescence (exogenous fluorophores) have been considered. The goal of the current report is to provide a comprehensive review on steady-state and time-resolved, fluorescence measurements of neoplastic and non-neoplastic, biologic systems of varying degrees of complexity.

The new fluorescent indicator dyes combine a stilbene-type fluorophore with a tetracarboxylate parent Ca. sup. 2 + chelating compound having the octacoordinate pattern of liganding groups characteristic of EGTA and BAPTA. Preferred forms contain extra heterocyclic bridges to reinforce the ethylenic bond of the stilbene and to reduce hydrophobicity. Compared to their widely used predecessor, quin 2, the new dyes offer up to thirty-fold brighter fluorescence, major changes in wavelength (not just intensity) upon Ca. sup. 2 + binding, slightly lower affinities for Ca. sup. 2 +, slightly longer wavelengths of excitation, and considerably improved selectivity for Ca. sup. 2 + over other divalent cations. These properties, particularly the wavelength sensitivity to Ca. sup. 2 +, make the dyes useful indicators for many intracellular applications, especially in single cells, adherent cell layers, or <b>bulk</b> <b>tissues.</b> The present invention also discloses an improved method for synthesizing alpha-acyloxyalkyl bromides wherein the bromides so synthesized are free of contaminating bis(1 -bromoalkyl) ether. The improved method is exemplified herein in the synthesis of acetoxymethyl bromide, a compound useful in preparing the acetoxymethyl esters disclosed herein as novel Ca. sup. 2 + specific fluorescent indicators...|$|R
