25|$|In {{backcross}} conversion, {{genes are}} introgressed from a donor cultivar or related species into a recipient elite line through repeated backcrossing. A {{problem in this}} procedure {{is being able to}} identify the lines carrying the trait of interest at each generation. The problem is particularly acute if the trait of interest is recessive, as it will be present only in a heterozygous condition after each backcross. The development of molecular markers provides an easier method of selection based on the genotype (marker) rather than the phenotype. Combined with doubled haploidy it becomes more effective. In marker assisted backcross conversion, a recipient parent is crossed with a donor line and the hybrid (F1) backcrossed to the recipient. The resulting generation (BC1) is backcrossed and the process repeated until the desired genotypes are produced. The combination of doubled haploidy and molecular marker provides the short cut. In the <b>back</b> <b>cross</b> generation one itself a genotype with the character of interest can be selected and converted into homozygous doubled haploid genotype. Chen et al. (1994) used marker assisted backcross conversion with doubled haploidy of BC1 individuals to select stripe rust resistant lines in barley.|$|E

50|$|Current {{efforts are}} under way by the Forest Health Initiative to use modern {{breeding}} techniques and genetic engineering to create resistant tree strains, with contributions from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Penn State, the University of Georgia, and the US Forest Service. One {{of the most successful}} methods of breeding is to create a <b>back</b> <b>cross</b> of a resistant species (such as one from China or Japan) and American chestnut. Researchers identified 2 or 3 genes that allow for blight resistance, and are focusing on giving the American Chestnut hybrids only those genes from the Chinese or Japanese chestnut. The two species are first bred to create a 50/50 hybrid. After three back crosses with American chestnut, the remaining genome is approximate 1/16 that of the resistant tree, and 15/16 American. The strategy is to select blight-resistance genes during the back crossing, while preserving the more wild-type traits of American chestnut as the dominant phenotype. Thus, the newly bred hybrid chestnut trees should reach the same heights as the original American chestnut. Many of these 15/16 American chestnut hybrids have been planted along the East Coast, including in the Jefferson National Forest and on the Flight 93 National Memorial. Some of these sites have had researchers check on the saplings that have been planted to see their survival rate. For the hybrids to do well, they need areas with decent drainage and abundant sunlight. Meeting these needs can be hard to do, so not all restoration areas have been successful with hybrid survival.|$|E

50|$|All begomovirus species causing cotton leaf curl disease have geminate particles, {{approximately}} 18-20 nm {{in diameter}} and 30 nm long and a circular, single-stranded DNA genome. All except Cotton leaf crumple virus have a monopartite genome, with all viral products required for replication, systemic movement and whitefly transmission encoded on a single DNA component of c. 2.75 kB (DNA A). The genome of CLCrV is bipartite. Two smaller, circular, single-stranded DNA molecules, named DNA 1 and DNA β, {{are associated with a}} range of monopartite begomoviruses from the Old World including the cotton leaf curl viruses. These molecules are regarded as satellite molecules as they depend on the helper begomovirus to support one or more stages of their infection cycle (movement and insect transmission for both molecules and, additionally, replication in the case of DNA β). DNA β is symptom-modulating and typical cotton leaf curl disease symptoms only develop when this molecule is present: in the absence of DNA β, the concentration of viral DNA (DNA A) is low and the symptoms of infection very mild. DNA β has a single open reading frame (βC1 ORF), which encodes a suppressor of RNA silencing. DNA 1 is homologous to the DNA-R component of the nanoviruses and encodes a master replication initiator (M-Rep) protein but its presence does not alter symptom expression. (Corresponding author: Dr Andrew Geering 2007)The plant resistance to against CLCuV was described by Ali (1997, 1999) that the CLCuV resistanve was controlled by single dominate gene, and could be transferred to any cultivar by using <b>back</b> <b>cross</b> technique.|$|E

Root exudates and organic acids released during decomposition of {{soil organic matter}} can affect the availability of Zn. Thus, this hydroponic experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of some chelates on Zn uptake and translocation in two wheat genotypes with different zinc-efficiency. Two wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L. <b>Back</b> <b>Cross</b> Rowshan as zinc-efficient and Kavir as zinc-inefficient) were exposed to two levels of zinc (10 and 100 µM) and six different carboxylic acids (citric, tartaric, oxalic, salicylic, ethylenediamin tetraacetic acid and L-methionine). Results showed that uptake capability of free and complexed species of Zn were completely different. Zn 2 + activity in nutrient solution had negative correlation with shoot dry weight and positive correlation with shoot zinc concentration in Kavir genotype, while complexed species had opposite results. <b>Back</b> <b>Cross</b> Rowshan genotype showed opposite results in comparison with Kavir genotype. The response of wheat genotypes to different organic acids varied. EDTA treatment caused the lowest shoot zinc concentration in Kavir genotype (18. 8 mg/kg), while the <b>Back</b> <b>Cross</b> Rowshan genotype had highest concentration (99. 5 mg/kg). Tartaric acid and citric acid caused the lowest root Zn concentration in the Kavir genotype (26. 7 and 58. 6 mg/kg, respectively), while the highest content was observed in the <b>Back</b> <b>Cross</b> Rowshan genotype (83. 2 and 98. 1 mg/kg, respectively). Catalase activity had inverse relationship with root Zn concentration in both genotypes.
