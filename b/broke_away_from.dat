5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the Labour Party {{broke out of}} the Comintern. Subsequently the Communist Party <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Labour Party. The {{local chapter of the}} Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the Communist Party in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the British and Irish Lions were {{intended}} as a representative team of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland however, when the Irish Free State <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the United Kingdom it was deemed inappropriate for the British and Irish Lions to use the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. As a result of this, the British and Irish Lions {{did not have an}} anthem to represent them before any of their matches until 2005.|$|E

However, during the great strike of the Fasci in September 1893, the Fratuzzi mobilized to boycott it, {{providing}} the necessary manpower to work on the lands that the peasants refused to cultivate.

He was killed by the Mafia in 1915 when he was the mayor of Corleone.|$|E

5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the {{authority}} of the pope and the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall.

His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, {{but the rest of the}} family remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} breakaway group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race. It was on a section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmuller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the lead group to try for the victory. As if {{the success of the}} breakaway wasn't enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.|$|E

Right now, the Aztecs are left without a dominant male, since Zaphod has died.|$|E
5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They were {{attracted}} by the scenery, the fishermen and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The two fleets sailed within view of {{each other}} for several days, but de Grasse {{preferred}} to lure the British away from the bay where de Barras was expected to arrive carrying vital siege equipment.

Graves returned to New York to organize a larger relief effort; this did not sail until 19 October, two days after Cornwallis surrendered.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1840s, the younger {{members of the}} repeal {{movement}} became impatient with O’Connell's over-cautious policies, and began to question his intentions. Later they were {{what came to be}} known as the Young Ireland movement. In 1842 three of the Young Ireland leaders, Thomas Davis, Charles Gavan Duffy and John Blake Dillon, launched the Nation newspaper. In the paper they set out to create a spirit of pride and an identity based on nationality rather than on social status or religion. Following the collapse of the Repeal Association and with the arrival of famine, the Young Irelanders <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> completely <b>from</b> O’Connell in 1846.|$|R
50|$|The school {{legislation}} greatly {{fueled the}} borough craze in Bergen County. Wealthy communities that had {{had their own}} school districts now faced the prospect of sharing their school tax revenues with poorer areas, or of being divided up piecemeal in borough referenda. Allendale <b>broke</b> <b>away,</b> principally <b>from</b> Franklin Township, because of such fears. At 650 people, Allendale {{was one of the}} more populous boroughs formed in 1894. In such commuter communities as Park Ridge, those new residents often led the borough drives against the opposition of the old inhabitants who feared the improvements would not benefit them and that the new borough would quickly incur debt through issuance of municipal bonds.|$|R
60|$|His veins fused {{with extreme}} voluptuousness. For {{a moment he}} almost lost control of himself, and {{continued}} automatically. But {{there was a moment}} of inaction, of cold suspension. He was not going to take her. He drew her to him and soothed her, and caressed her. But the pure zest had gone. She struggled to herself and realized he was not going to take her. And then, at the very last moment, when his fondling had come near again, his hot living desire despising her, against his cold sensual desire, she <b>broke</b> violently <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him.|$|R
5|$|An {{expansion}} for The Age of Kings, , {{was released}} in 2000. It introduced numerous new game features, including unique technologies for each civilization, and five new civilizations.

Age of Mythology, released in 2002, <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the historical trend and instead focused on Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. It shared many gameplay elements with The Age of Kings and was considered a spin-off of the main Age of Empires series.|$|E
5|$|In 1527 King Henry VIII asked Pope Clement VII to annul his {{marriage}} to Katherine of Aragon, but the pope refused. This started {{a series of events}} known as English Reformation in which Henry <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the authority of the pope. In lieu of the pope, Henry assumed authority over the church: all priests and religious figures, including monks, were required to swear support to the royal supremacy over the church. Abbot Bourchier and the 25 canons at Leicester Abbey acknowledged the king's royal supremacy on 11 August 1534, thereby saving the abbey from immediate dissolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a small leading group {{just before}} Douai {{because he knew}} he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together.

The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E

5|$|When {{the region}} of Biafra <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a {{supporter}} of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador {{for the people of}} the new nation. The war ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took its toll, he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car accident left him partially disabled.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "traditionalist Catholics" [...] {{often is}} used to apply to Catholic Christians who are {{particularly}} devoted to practicing the ancient traditions of the Church; yet there are also groups calling themselves [...] "traditionalist Catholics" [...] that either reject many of the changes made since Vatican II, or regard Vatican II as an invalid Council, or who <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> entirely <b>from</b> the Catholic Church after Vatican II.

Another source states {{he was forced to}} make an escape attempt by a group of senior German prisoners who enforced a brutal regime of punishing those who held anti-Nazi views or who co-operated with the British, and that Berndt only <b>broke</b> <b>away</b> and ran <b>from</b> the Home Guard when he realised they were returning him to Grizedale Hall; they shot him dead after he ignored warning shots. The British placed Rahmlow in a camp with German Army and Air Force prisoners to avoid further incidents of this kind.|$|R
