40|$|Typically, {{low-pressure}} sprayers {{are used}} to uniformly apply pre- and post-emergent herbicides to control weeds in crop rows. An innovative machine for weed control in inter-row and intra-row areas, with a unique combination of inter-row cultivation tooling and intra-row <b>band</b> <b>spraying</b> for six rows and an electro-hydraulic side-shift frame controlled by a GPS system, was developed and evaluated. Two weed management strategies were tested in the field trials: broadcast spraying (the conventional method) and <b>band</b> <b>spraying</b> with mechanical weed control using RTK-GPS (the experimental method). This approach enabled the comparison between treatments {{from the perspective of}} cost savings and efficacy in weed control for a sugar beet crop. During the 2010 – 2011 season, the herbicide application rate (112 L ha− 1) of the experimental method was approximately 50 % of the conventional method, and thus a significant reduction in the operating costs of weed management was achieved. A comparison of the 0. 2 -trimmed means of weed population post-treatment showed that the treatments achieved similar weed control rates at each weed survey date. Sugar beet yields were similar with both methods (p = 0. 92). The use of the experimental equipment is cost-effective on ≥ 20 ha of crops. These initial results show good potential for reducing herbicide application in the Spanish beet industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{introduction of}} genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) crops, with claims of improved weed control, has prompted fears about possible environmental impacts of their widespread adoption, particularly on arable weeds, insects and associated farmland birds. In response to this, we have developed a novel weed???management system for GMHT sugar beet, based on <b>band</b> <b>spraying,</b> which exploits the flexibility offered by the broad???spectrum partner herbicides. Here, we show the results from two series of field experiments which, taken together, demonstrate that, by using this system, crops can be managed for enhanced weed and insect biomass without compromising yield, thus potentially offering food and shelter to farmland birds and other wildlife. These results could be applicable widely to other row crops, and indicate that creative use of GMHT technology could be {{a powerful tool for}} developing more sustainable farming systems in the futur...|$|E
40|$|In the {{conventional}} methods of herbicide and fertilizer application, {{a substantial amount}} of toxic chemicals is sprayed or broadcast into the furrows, which is later washed away by irrigation water and may contaminate ground water, human and animal environment. If herbicide and fertilizer application could be limited to the most needed parts of the field rather than overall broadcasting, the mentioned problems could be alleviated and the application efficiency could also be increased by reducing the consumption rate. In an attempt to achieve this goal, a combination cultivator capable of simultaneously performing cultivation practices such as weed control (mechanical + chemical), fertilizer application and pest control was developed and evaluated. This machine was able to perform <b>band</b> <b>spraying</b> (fungicide, insecticide and herbicide) and mechanical cultivation (within-the-row weed killing, furrow reforming and hilling) simultaneously and properly.

40|$|A point-injection {{system has}} {{successfully}} {{been designed to}} inject and incorporate herbicides applied with water into the soil profile in a band. This point-injection cylinder (PIC) can incorporate herbicides {{in a single pass}} through the field while leaving the soil surface virtually undisturbed. The PIC functions effectively on both bare soil surfaces and soil surface covered with crop residue;The relative persistence of banded herbicides (alachlor, atrazine, and propachlor) using the PIC and a band sprayer was compared in a field study. A bare soil surface and a soil covered with an average of 79 percent corn residue were used in the comparison. Point injection was found to decrease losses due to a combination of volatilization, photodegradation, and runoff thus increasing persistence for alachlor and propachlor applied to soil. The relative persistence of atrazine applied to soil was found to be about the same for both application methods 21 days after application. Losses were higher for the herbicides sprayed on the corn residue as compared to point-injection into the soil;Weed control with the PIC and broadcast spray with disk incorporation was determined for various herbicides using oats as the test species. There was no significant difference found between these application methods in controlling the oats for the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, butylate, or EPTC. Weed control was significantly higher for trifluralin when disk incorporated versus point-injected. In a full field study, no significant difference in weed control were found between applying atrazine and alachlor with the PIC and band sprayers. Both application methods were effective in controlling the weeds in the banded area when compared to a check treatment;In a rainfall simulation study, <b>band</b> <b>spraying</b> was compared against point-injection to determine if there were differences in the percentages of the atrazine, alachlor, and propachlor lost with runoff and leachate during 10 cm of rain 1 to 6 days after application.

40|$|The {{investigation}} was conducted {{as a part}} of the requirements for a Masters Degree in Agriculture at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The work is a result. of cooperation between the Department of Agricultural Engineering and The Swedish Sugar Company. Earlier Swedish investigations have indicated that <b>band</b> <b>spraying</b> with small volume rates (30 - 60 l/ha) can produce a result as good as when spraying with conventional volume rates (about 200 l/ha). Therefore, there is an interest to find an equipment able to distribute small volume rates of spray in a reliable way. The intention was to compare a new Swedish air-turbine-powered rotary atomizer to two other rotary atomizers, two flat fan nozzles and one air atomizing nozzle in <b>band</b> <b>spraying</b> in sugarbeet. The nozzles were used in two field trials with different combinations of spray rates, liquid pressure and, where appropriate, air pressure. The trials were conducted in order to elucidate differences in biological effect. The differences were small and only in some cases significant. There was however a tendency towards better and more even effect to the overall spraying with SS 11001 which was included as a comparison. Droplet size was determined with a laser instrument and the results were in very good accordance with what one can expect when varying pressure, flow rate and measuring point in the spray. All the centrifugal nozzles gave a more narrow drop size spectrum than the hydraulic nozzles, though partly dependent on where the measurement was carried out in the spray. The air atomizing nozzle gave a droplet size as small as 50 m. A comparison of treatments with the same amount of spray, i. e. the same herbicide concentration, does not distinctly show better weed control of small droplets than of big ones. The air-turbine-powered rotary atomizer showed some technical disadvantages. Disc rotational speed varied a lot and the screening caused drop. The air atomizing nozzle was very sensible to contaminations in the spray and was easily clogged up. Girojet was not very well suited for band-spraying due to the wide spray angle...|$|E
40|$|Background Early in {{a season}} the crop covers only part of total field area. Treating that area uniformly can {{therefore}} be wasteful. An ability to differentiate between crop rows and inter-row spaces would provide opportunities for increased treatment efficacy, reduced environmental impact and reduced input costs. Banded treatments on, or between crop rows, requires a level of precision {{that is difficult to}} achieve in practice. So, despite the potential advantages inter-row cultivation and <b>band</b> <b>spraying</b> are limited to use in high value crops. Recent advances pioneered by some of the consortium partners now offer automatic guidance systems for inter-row cultivation. These are currently used in intensive vegetable production and by those growing cereals organically. They offer enhanced accuracy, higher forward speeds and reduced driver fatigue compared to manual systems. Whilst helpful, the science behind these developments has limitations with respect to work rate. In particular the need for inter-row hoes to match drill bout width makes such systems uneconomic for conventional cereal producers.

40|$|When used in genetically {{modified}} herbicide???tolerant (GMHT) crops, glyphosate provides great flexibility to manipulate weed populations with consequences for invertebrates and higher trophic levels, for example birds. A range of timings of <b>band</b> and overall <b>spray</b> treatments of glyphosate to GMHT sugar beet {{were compared with}} a conventional weed control programme in four field trials over 2 years. Single overall sprays applied between 200 and 250 accumulated day degrees (above a base air temperature of 3 ??C; ??Cd) and band applied treatments applied at 10 % or 20 % ground cover within the crop rows generally gave significantly greater weed biomass and seed rain than conventional treatments, while later <b>band</b> <b>sprays</b> (more than 650 ??Cd) reduced seed return. Two overall sprays of glyphosate produced low weed biomass and generally lowest seed return of all treatments but tended to give {{some of the highest}} yields. However, the early overall sprays (200 ??? 250 ??Cd) and <b>band</b> <b>sprays</b> gave as good or better yields than the conventional and were generally equivalent to the two overall???spray programme. Viable seeds in the soil after the experiment were generally higher following the early overall (200 ??? 250 ??Cd) and the <b>band</b> <b>spray</b> treatments than following the conventional. The results show that altered management of GMHT sugar beet can provide alternative scenarios to those of the recent Farm Scale Evaluation trials. Without yield loss they can enhance weed seed banks and autumn bird food availability compared with conventional management, or provide early season benefits to invertebrates and nesting birds, depending on the system chosen. Conventional weed control does not have the flexibility to enable these scenarios that benefit both agriculture and environment, although there may be some options for increasing weed seed return in aut...|$|R
40|$|Most grasslands in the UK are productive, species-poor {{communities}} {{resulting from}} intensive agriculture.
