5|$|The game {{opens with}} a group of Magnemite—magnet-like Pokémon with {{levitation}} abilities—delivering a television to the player's house. Upon turning the television on, Professor Oak appears to request the player's help: he is creating a new television network for Trainers and their Pokémon to enjoy together, and he wants the player to serve as a <b>beta</b> <b>tester.</b> He has them watch an episode of an anime called Pichu Bros. and then introduces the game's basic features before leaving them alone. The player then hears Pokémon cries from outside, which turn out to belong to a Pikachu and two other creatures: the reptilian Treecko and the avian Torchic. While the others run off, the Pikachu stays and the player adopts it. Oak decides to allow Pikachu to be a second <b>beta</b> <b>tester.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Leading {{up to the}} launch, Microsoft enlisted several {{waves of}} beta testers to improve the service and receive feature feedback. The first wave of beta testers were given Revolt! (which never was {{released}} officially) and NFL Fever to beta test. Once beta testing concluded, Microsoft sent these beta testers a translucent orange memory card, a headset carrying case, and a <b>beta</b> <b>tester</b> tshirt with the slogan [...] "I have great hands". [...] When the service debuted, it lacked much of the functionality that later titles included, but Xbox Live grew and evolved on the Xbox and {{many aspects of the}} service were included with the Xbox 360 console out of the box, rather than through a later update. Microsoft's 5000th patent was Live-related and gave Xbox 360 users access to watch other gamers compete against each other over Xbox Live.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} the Internet has brought many {{fundamental}} changes to the way business is conducted. Among others, {{a growing number of}} software firms are relying on public beta testing {{to improve the quality of}} their products before release. While the benefits resulting from improved software reliability have been widely recognized, the influences of public <b>beta</b> <b>testers</b> on the diffusion of a new software product have not been documented. Through their word-of-mouth effect, public <b>beta</b> <b>testers</b> can speed up the diffusion of a software product after release, and hence increase the time-discounted revenue per adopter. In this research, we take into consideration both the reliability-side and the diffusion-side of the benefits, and develop methodologies to help firms decide the optimal number of public <b>beta</b> <b>testers</b> and the optimal duration of public beta testing. Numerical results show the firm’s profit can increase substantially by taking advantage of the world-of-mouth of public <b>beta</b> <b>testers.</b> This benefit is more significant if firms recruit <b>beta</b> <b>testers</b> from those who can benefit from a software product but cannot afford it...|$|R
50|$|<b>Beta</b> <b>testers</b> {{are people}} who {{actively}} report issues of beta software.

2500|$|Designed by Fender, Walker and Sterling Ball (Sterling was a <b>beta</b> <b>tester</b> for the instrument), the StingRay bass {{appeared}} in 1976 and, though physically {{similar to a}} Fender Precision Bass, was a highly innovative instrument. It employed an [...] "MM" [...] humbucking pickup and an active pre-amp powered by a 9-volt battery. The early versions had 2-band EQ (i.e., bass and treble controls), and the range was later augmented {{by the addition of}} a 3 band EQ (bass, mid and treble) model, and then piezo pickups located in the bridge became an option with the 3-band model. The StingRay's 3-band equalization system made it possible to boost midrange frequencies as well as low and high. [...] Along with its electronic improvements, the StingRay had physical attributes that set it apart from other Fender-inspired designs, such as a heavy satin finish {{on the back of the}} neck to allow players' hands to slide effortlessly up and down during play, a symmetrical egg-shaped pickguard ("the toilet seat lid") and separate chromed [...] "boomerang" [...] control plate, and its distinctive [...] "3+1" [...] headstock (on which three tuning machines are situated on the top and one on the bottom) made it an instantly recognizable and distinguishable instrument.|$|E
2500|$|Naughty Dog {{released}} the fourth patch, titled version 1.04 on July 8, which fixed {{issues related to}} the Facebook, the XP and cash during playback of cinema files. On July 8, Naughty Dog revealed that just one day after the beta went fully public on July 5, it passed the one million unique player mark in the Uncharted 3 multiplayer beta and the player count was still growing. Naughty Dog also advised players to reap the rewards from the beta, such as the Uncharted 3 PSN <b>Beta</b> <b>Tester</b> Avatar and Treasure Hunter's Starter Pack, along with in-game cash for the full release of the Uncharted 3 multiplayer component. Naughty Dog confirmed on July 12, that player progress in the Uncharted 3 multiplayer beta has been reset for some, sending them back to level one. User data that keeps track of level, cash and unlocks cannot be retrieved by the studio. However, beta players who were looking forward to rewards in the final version of Uncharted 3 based on their multiplayer beta play history will still get those rewards. Naughty Dog's Christophe Balestra announced on Twitter that the Uncharted 3 beta had reached 1.5 million unique players. On July 14, when the beta actual should have been ended, Naughty Dog extended the beta for an additional 24 hours, to give players a little more time to level up the multiplayer stats. On July 15, Sony announced that the beta for Uncharted 3 is the [...] "LARGEST online beta ever to appear on the PlayStation 3".|$|E

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{software}} firms now rely on public beta testing {{to improve the quality}} of their products before commercial release. While the benefits resulting from improved software reliability are well recognized, some important market-related benefits have not been studied. Through word-of-mouth, public <b>beta</b> <b>testers</b> can accelerate the diffusion of a software product after its release. Additionally, because of network effects, public <b>beta</b> <b>testers</b> can increase users’ valuation of a product. In this study, we consider both reliability-related and market-related benefits, and develop models to determine the optimal number of public <b>beta</b> <b>testers</b> and the optimal duration of testing. Our analyses show that public beta testing can be profitable even if word-of-mouth and network effects are the only benefits. Furthermore, when both benefits are considered, there is significant “economies of scope”—the net profit increases at a faster rate when both word-of-mouth and network effects are significant than when only one benefit is present. Finally, our sensitivity analyses demonstrate that public beta testing remains highly valuable to software firms over a wide range of testing and market conditions. In particular, firms will realize greater profits when recruiting public <b>beta</b> <b>testers</b> who are interested in the software but unable to afford it...|$|R
