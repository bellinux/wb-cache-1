Statistical administration is an excellent case for exploring the relationship between hierarchy and horizontality, since official statistics require coordination and consistency, yet production in many jurisdictions is increasingly dispersed across multiple government agencies. Interviews with senior government statisticians in Australia and the United Kingdom are used to investigate central statistical agencies ’ efforts to secure compliance with methodological standards among new government data producers. The qualitative data show horizontal governance does depend on hierarchy, but not primarily because of the <b>back-up</b> <b>function.</b> Rather, new statistical producers with more hierarchical seniority are more inclined to interpret the governance initiatives of central statistical authorities in softer, more horizontal terms, leading to greater cooperation. Furthermore, increasing the hierarchical powers of central statistical authorities counter-intuitively encourages them to focus more on horizontal mechanisms such as informal dialogue, networking and “value-adding”. 1...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{characteristics}} of electric power grid {{in terms of}} continuity of the supply and energy quality are of outmost importance for both industrial and civil applications with {{special attention to the}} uninterruptible ones. Net congestion problems {{are becoming more and more}} frequent boosting the development of small energy generation systems with <b>back-up</b> <b>function.</b> In this field low temperature fuel cells are an interesting solution addressing both environmental and efficiency issues. In the present work the application of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFC) for an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system (< 1 kWe) is analysed by examining different possible technical solutions. This system is composed by a PEFC 1 kWe stack, assisted by a set of battery and a supercapacitors pack, and using hydrogen stored into a metal hydride tank. Critical aspects as system start-up, response rapidity and autonomy are addressed to obtain an optimal configuration. Both numerical and experimental analysis have been carried out to characterize component behaviour. Once realized and tested, the system has proved to be able to work as UPS with an autonomy of 6. 5 hours, only determined by hydrogen storage capability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research project in which a patented system for asynchronous communication (“ippi”) is used as the basis for a prototype communication device utilizing the participants’ televisions as the primary interface. The aim was to study the extent to which older people’s lifelong experiences watching TV reduced their uncertainty when faced with TV-based applications. The study examined the factors that explained participants’ continued use of the application. The implementation and testing of the system was structured as an iterative design process including conceptual development, a six-month test period in the homes of eleven users with usability tests and interviews, monthly focus groups and information gathered by a <b>back-up</b> <b>function</b> that also provided the users with immediate help with the technology if necessary. The results show that while the use of TV as a metaphor or platform succeeded in getting the older users to try out and use the ippi prototype, it did not contribute primarily to using the ippi on a daily basis during the test period. Rather, participants’ access to a social context or a social network determined the extent of usage. There was a difference between what was easy to use in terms of the interface, and what was easy and worth using in a social everyday context on the other. In order to be used, a new product of this type must add value and that value depends upon integration into daily communication...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} flexibility {{that can}} be achieved through the use of an agile project management system, make it a popular management style within software development projects. Despite the many benefits of using agile teams, there are however also challenges that are likely to occur within these systems. By using an extended version of Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork model, this study identifies possible teamwork challenges that may occur when an agile project management method is used, and discusses how a company can address them. The study is conducted through an interview-based case study of a software development company with self-governing agile teams. This study finds that a lack of shared mental models and inadequate team leadership are sources for teamwork challenges within agile teams. Furthermore this study identifies challenges in relation to team orientation, <b>back-up</b> <b>functions</b> and communication. By using existing theories on agile teams and teamwork, the paper explains why these challenges likely have occurred and how they are related to the use of an agile project management. Finally, the paper provides some suggestions for practice based on the discussion. The suggested solutions involve the provision of better key performance indicators to establish shared mental models and a rotation of team roles in order to increase redundancy and <b>back-up</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{roles of}} {{duplicate}} genes and {{their contribution to}} the phenomenon of enzyme dispensability are a central issue in molecular and genome evolution. A comprehensive classification of the mechanisms that {{may have led to}} their preservation, however, is currently lacking. In a systems biology approach, we classify here back-up, regulatory, and gene dosage functions for the 105 duplicate gene families of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism. The key tool was the reconciled genome-scale metabolic model iLL 672, which was based on the older iFF 708. Computational predictions of all metabolic gene knockouts were validated with the experimentally determined phenotypes of the entire singleton yeast library of 4658 mutants under five environmental conditions. iLL 672 correctly identified 96 %- 98 % and 73 %- 80 % of the viable and lethal singleton phenotypes, respectively. Functional roles for each duplicate family were identified by integrating the iLL 672 -predicted in silico duplicate knockout phenotypes, genome-scale carbon-flux distributions, singleton mutant phenotypes, and network topology analysis. The results provide no evidence for a particular dominant function that maintains duplicate genes in the genome. In particular, the <b>back-up</b> <b>function</b> is not favored by evolutionary selection because duplicates do not occur more frequently in essential reactions than singleton genes. Instead of a prevailing role, multigene-encoded enzymes cover different functions. Thus, at least for metabolism, persistence of the paralog fraction in the genome can be better explained with an array of different, often overlapping functional roles...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of renewable energies as power generators in the electricity grid {{is necessary to}} overcome the dependence and pollution linked to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the variability of these renewable resources limits their quantity in the system. In addition, there exists a trend to change the transport sector {{by means of the}} electrification of the existing conventional vehicles based on internal combustion engine (ICE). A solution to mitigate the mentioned variability and to enable a higher integration is the use of energy storage systems, such as batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). Nonetheless, batteries are nowadays very expensive, so using them only for this <b>back-up</b> <b>function</b> is unviable. Electric Vehicles’ batteries could be used for this purpose and be consequently repaid sooner. In order to provide this support service, the chargers of the electric vehicles (EVs) should work with a bidirectional power flow, in two modes: as dynamic loads, when they are charging, which corresponds to Grid-to-Vehicle (G 2 V) mode; or as generators, when they are discharging, which corresponds to Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) or Vehicle-to-Home (V 2 H) modes. Even if this first mode is broadly deployed, the V 2 G and V 2 H modes are still in developing process and they are not commercialized yet. This thesis is mainly focused on designing, modeling and simulating two different chargers that connect a battery pack to either a single-phase grid for low power applications or to a three-phase grid for high power applications, in which both G 2 V and V 2 G/V 2 H modes are implemented. An assessment of the most typical AC/DC and DC/DC converters’ topologies is carried out, and their benefits and drawbacks are highlighted. Different control strategies are employed and tested, and a harmonics study of the grid current and voltage is performed.

40|$|Intermediate {{storage system}} {{optimization}} {{is an essential}} aspect which this report tends to look upon and putting effort on improving operating efficiency then reducing the capital cost of batch/ semi-continuous or flow production process {{by looking at the}} extent of estimating the figures of boxes that are made to be in the intermediate storage system through evaluations. Additionally, intermediate storage can reduce the effects of process parameter variations, such as recipe inaccuracies and operator errors, in which process operations are particularly visible. In a channel of operations, where there are many amount of shift that are inevitable to pass through in order to complete production process to get a finished product. Hence, longer operating horizon, process variations must include a measurable parameter, either shorter or longer to avoid failure of meeting product specification and limitation of meeting end users specification. Intermediate storage system as a <b>back-up</b> <b>function</b> in case of some sudden failure within the production line In this thesis, it is notable to make an amendment, as a way of knowing the accuracy of boxes of bearing work-piece that will be maintaining a certain intermediate storage system to feed the next shift of workstation in a continuous process with accurate or known estimated number of work-piece in a role, until the final product is been made. Hence, in this research, there are many theory that were adopted to give a clear view of what will be obtainable in the whole research both in empirical finding to have a definite result. To achieve the above goal this thesis followed a steps to fulfil its objective.

40|$|As {{the power}} grid becomes more {{magnified}} and complicated, wide-area protection system in the practical engineering application {{is more and more}} restricted by the communication level. Based on the concept of limitedness of wide-area protection system, the grid with complex structure is divided orderly in this paper, and fault identification and protection action are executed in each divided zone to reduce the pressure of the communication system. In protection zone, a new wide-area protection algorithm based on positive sequence fault components directional comparison principle is proposed. The special associated intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) zones which contain buses and transmission lines are created according to the installation location of the IEDs. When a fault occurs, {{with the help of the}} fault information collecting and sharing from associated zones with the fault discrimination principle defined in this paper, the IEDs can identify the fault location and remove the fault according to the predetermined action strategy. The algorithm will not be impacted by the load changes and transition resistance and also has good adaptability in open phase running power system.

40|$|Mars Express (MEX), {{the first}} {{planetary}} {{mission of the}} European Space Agency (ESA), reached Mars on December 25 th 2003. Since then it is performing routine operations. Its operational phase had to cover one Martian year, {{with the possibility of}} an extension for a second Martian year (i. e. until November 2007). The end of the mission extension is approaching but, given the good health of the payload instruments and the high science return of the mission, there is a strong will to achieve further extensions. Mars Express is also seen as an important asset, capable to provide relay functions for future Martian missions. The ESA Science Program Committee has recently approved a second extension of the MEX mission until May 2009 and even further extensions are possible. Mars Express has an eccentric quasi-polar orbit with a period of approximately 6. 72 hours and a pericentre height of about 300 km. Science observations are mainly performed at pericentre (but not only). In addition the orbit has a resonance of 11 revolutions per 3 Martian days. This means that ground tracks corresponding to orbits separated by 11 revolutions are adjacent, such that a given area can be covered by the on-board camera without leaving gaps. The J 2 effect of Mars causes a drift of both ascending node and argument of pericentre. The drift of argument of pericentre makes it possible to observe periodically all Mars latitudes from close distance. Illumination conditions at pericentre are influenced by both the drift of the argument of pericentre and the drift of ascending node, {{as well as by the}} rotation of Mars around the Sun. The original MEX routine orbit was optimized for the duration of the nominal mission and extension, such that it produced a balanced share of day-side observations (for the optical instruments) and night-side observations (for the radar). The orbit was thus not optimized for the time beyond the assumed extension. Indeed, the evolution of the ascending node and argument of pericentre would cause in the following years a drift of the pericentre towards night-side observation conditions, hence uninteresting for the optical instruments. In order to prevent this an optimisation process for the future routine orbit has taken place. The share between day-side and night-side observations can be controlled by adjusting the drift of argument of pericentre and ascending node. This can in particular be achieved by changing the semimajor axis, eccentricity and/or inclination. A change of inclination is inefficient compared to a change in semimajor axis and eccentricity, and has therefore been discarded. An in-plane maneuvre can be performed to change both semi-major axis and eccentricity, and thus the period of the orbit. Although an apocentre manoeuvre is cheaper in terms of deltaV, it would result in raising the pericentre height, which is unfavourable for close observations. Hence a pericentre manoeuvre is proposed, which will increase the apocentre height. A repeat cycle is still required to allow mapping areas with adjacent ground tracks, so the change of semimajor axis must result in a new resonance. Resonances 18 : 5, 25 : 7 and 7 : 2 have been considered as potential candidates. The resulting long term evolution of the observation conditions has been analysed. Finally it has been decided to perform a change of orbit to reach the 18 : 5. Another aspect of the optimisation process is the control of the ground track. The previous MEX reference trajectory included regular maneuvres at every apocentre in order to adjust the orbital period, such that the separation of the ground tracks would be optimal, regardless of the latitude of pericentre. The implementation of the actual delatVs on-board was done partly by optimizing the attitude of reaction-wheel desaturation activities. Despite of it, this strategy has a significant propellant cost, because it prevents to optimize reaction wheel de-saturation activities to minimize propellant consumption. Therore, with the aim at preserving propellant resources for a long time extension it has been agreed to stop the ground-track control. This requires now a more accurate science operation planning, with improved attitude pointing control. Finally, the approach to phase Mars Express to provide <b>back-up</b> relay <b>functions</b> for NASA Phoenix landing is explained. In the context of the routine trajectory optimisation a new requirement for close fly-bys at Phobos, with different observation geometries, has been specified. The approach to fulfill this requirement is explained...|$|R
40|$|Mozambique, {{situated}} in south-east Africa, has sub-tropical and tropical climate {{and plenty of}} natural resources for energy production. The country is however poor, and only about 25 % {{of the population has}} access to electricity from the grid. A very large part of the energy used in the country is used in the residential sector, and there is a general lack of knowledge, regulations and tools concerning energy efficiency in buildings. The aim of this work is to contribute to a framework of knowledge and tools that can improve the energy efficiency in buildings, which in turn can lead to better use of natural resources, better indoor comfort in residential buildings and better economy for the dwellers. The framework consists of several parts, such as measurement equipment, an energy balance simulation tool and analysis of the potential of efficient appliances and PV-systems, as described in the following. It is believed that this knowledge and tools can be a resource for professionals in Mozambique, which will improve their possibilities to work for better energy efficiency in the residential sector. A reference building, “ 3 de Fevereiro Residential”, in Maputo City was used in the project. This building is typical for the housing stock in Maputo City and can serve as a case study for studying energy improvement in buildings in Mozambique. The use of electricity in the reference building was examined, and {{it was found that the}} equipment that use the largest part of the electrical energy was the cooling system, 26 %, water heating, 23 % and lighting, 15 %. Old, inefficient appliances and traditional light bulbs were used in the house. The effect of changing to new, more efficient, appliances and using LED lamps was analysed and the evaluation showed that this could result in 24 % decrease in electrical energy use. Measurement equipment for monitoring outdoor and indoor climate was installed in the building. Outdoor climate variables measured included global and diffuse irradiance, temperature, wind speed and direction. Indoor temperature and relative humidity was measured. Measurements were performed for a continuous period of one year, and the equipment included a facility for collecting the data via internet. Different theoretical and experimental techniques for analysing and evaluating energy used in buildings were examined in order to find a suitable tool for the climatic conditions and building types prevailing in Mozambique. DEROB-LTH was considered to be the most suitable tool among the evaluated ones. DEROB-LTH is a dynamic simulation tool with three-dimensional modelling of the building geometry for analysis of the effect of solar radiation as a key feature. DEROB-LTH was validated by comparing results of indoor temperature from simulations with measured indoor temperatures for the reference building. Measured outdoor climate data was used as input data. The comparison of simulation results with ones from the measurement equipment presented good agreement, which indicates that the selected tool can be used in Mozambican climatic conditions in particular, and in subtropical and tropical countries in general. An interesting way of decreasing electricity bought from the grid is the use of PVsystems. PV-systems could also be used where there is no grid, and as <b>back-up</b> for critical <b>functions</b> where the grid is unreliable like in Mozambique. To explore this possibility, a pilot PV-system was installed in the reference building. The system proved to work well, and its performance was monitored by measurement equipment. An evaluation of the life-cycle cost, however, showed that the electricity price when using the system would be about eight times higher than buying from the grid...|$|R
