5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, {{said it had}} talked to two sources from the raided village, {{who said that the}} raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had come out of his house {{to see what was going}} on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do know is that Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club was {{generally}} {{favorable to the}} episode, giving it a B+. He wrote, [...] "Much like Fringe fan favorite 'The Arrival' (not a favorite of mine, sorry to say), 'The Dreamscape' is an episode more involved with insinuation and mythology-building than with telling a complete-in-one story. But perhaps because I've come to trust Fringe more over its recent run of entertaining episodes, I enjoyed it fairly well, and found myself {{trying to figure out}} what kind of thematic connections I could make using the notion of the body reacting to mere thoughts." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.8/10, explaining that it [...] "certainly moves in the right direction". Fickett found the [...] "coolest moment" [...] to be when Olivia witnesses John Scott's memory, and he also appreciated Peter's backstory ("It's more than Peter usually gets, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know isn't much and isn't very exciting."). Fickett criticized Olivia however for leaving the man at the hospital unsuitably protected.|$|E
500|$|... "Sectionals" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt it ended {{the beginning of}} the season on a [...] "high note", while Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "You couldn’t have asked for a better cliffhanger of a fall finale". IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it [...] "very satisfying", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as [...] "fine television." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote: [...] "I'm not sure I expected or wanted a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> got from [...] "Sectionals" [...] left me feeling very good about where the show is going this spring." [...] In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, [...] "not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were [...] "uniformly strong." ...|$|E

Two weeks prior to this deadline, the council had raised $31,750, more than $20,000 short of the asking price. In an interview published by The Oregonian, Nye said, [...] "Lee Kelly is a living legend and the pride of Oregon's artistic community. And his studio is right here in Clackamas County. He's a local treasure." [...] She also wrote in a press release, [...] "It would be a terrible loss to the community to have this sculpture removed, but it's fast becoming a reality". The council's board chair, Shari Newman, also stressed the urgent need for financial assistance, saying [...] "We’re more than halfway there, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> really need is a handful of lead donors to step forward and make this important work a permanent part of the City’s collection. And we need them now."

500|$|Writing in Time, Richard Schickel said, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie. But in its way it is a {{thoughtful}} and entertaining one, especially {{in comparison with the}} pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: [...] "It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support." [...] Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: [...] "... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as [...] "unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted" [...] von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that [...] "even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing". She concluded of the film's overall pace, [...] "The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, [...] " [...] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn’t much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was." [...] Lane thought that there was [...] "too much" [...] character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, [...] "These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E

2500|$|One {{response}} to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: [...] "No doubt we do instinctively prefer {{to help those who}} are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ought to do, {{and it is difficult to}} see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations." ...|$|E

By the metaphorical words of Mencius (7a29) is like [...] "digging a well to reach the source of water." [...] It is for this emphasis on transcending the phenomena to reach the true self, which is the divine, that Tu defines Confucian religiosity as the [...] "ultimate self-transformation as a communal act and as a faithful dialogical response to the transcendent" [...] ans says {{that this is the}} Confucian prescription to develop the right nature of humanity. Tu furtherly explains the concept as a prognosis and diagnosis of humanity: [...] "we are not {{what we ought to be}} <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ought to be is inherent in the structure of what we are".|$|E
