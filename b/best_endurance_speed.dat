40|$|Propeller blade {{design for}} fast ships is often driven by {{cavitation}} constraints. A tradeoff exists, where larger chord lengths and section thicknesses typically improve cavitation performance but result in lower efficiency. Typically, chord lengths are optimized {{for the design}} condition (ship <b>endurance</b> <b>speed),</b> with some specified margin to prevent cavitation off-design (at maximum ship speed). Cavitation performance at the maximum speed is considered post-facto, and blade shape often needs to be modified for cavitation considerations in high-speed operation.

The present method simultaneously considers the cavitation performance at the <b>endurance</b> <b>speed</b> design point and a maximum speed off-design point, and blad...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of {{additional}} in-season <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> production versus <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> maintenance training regimes on performance in competitive male soccer players. In a randomised controlled trial 18 male sub-elite players were exposed to additional <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> production (SEP) or <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> maintenance (SEM) training (two additional sessions/wk for 4 weeks) during the competitive season. Players performed the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 2 test (YYIR 2) and a repeated sprint test (RST) pre- and post-intervention. Yo-Yo IR 2 performance increased (p< 0. 001) by 50 ± 8 % and 26 ± 5 % in SEP and SEM, respectively, with greater (p= 0. 03) improvement in SEP. RST performance improved by 2. 1 ± 0. 3 % and 1. 3 ± 0. 4 % in SEP and SEM, respectively, while the RST fatigue index decreased (4. 4 ± 0. 8 to 3. 4 ± 0. 5 %; p< 0. 04) in SEP only.

40|$|Background: Soccer {{is one of}} {{the sports}} {{included}} in the 18 th National Sports Week (Pekan Olahraga Nasional, (PON) 2012, in Riau. Soccer requires a good physical condition to perform various football techniques such as running, shooting, dribbling, tackling, sliding, throw-in and heading. A good physical component can be achieved through a well-rounded program in accordance to the periodization training program. This study was conducted to describe the physical performance of the West Java’s football athletes in order to develop periodization training program and to predict the athletes’ performance. Methods: A descriptive study was carried out on 23 West Java’s football athletes using secondary data from West Java’s KONI sports medicine team test reports during the period of February to December 2012. The variables in this study were 7 predominant physical components in football as follows: muscle strength, muscle <b>endurance,</b> <b>speed,</b> agility, flexibility, explosive leg muscle power, and general endurance (VO 2 max).
