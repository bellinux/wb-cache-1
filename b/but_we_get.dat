One {{editorial}} columnist wrote, [...] "We are amused when Miss Mansfield strains to pull in her stomach to fill out her bikini better; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> angry when career-seeking women, shady ladies, and certain starlets and actresses...use every opportunity to display their anatomy unasked". By the late 1950s, Mansfield began to generate {{a great deal of}} negative publicity because of repeated exposure of her breasts in carefully staged public [...] "accidents". Richard Blackwell, her wardrobe designer (who also designed for Jane Russell, Dorothy Lamour, Peggy Lee and Nancy Reagan), dropped her from his client list because of those accidents. In April 1967, Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "She confuses publicity and notoriety with stardom and celebrity and the result is very distasteful to the public." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{common problem}} with the scripts, {{according}} to Novak, is {{that they tend to}} run too long for the regular 22-minute time slot, leading to several cuts. For example, the script for the episode [...] "Search Committee" [...] was initially 75 pages—10 pages too long. A complete script is written for each episode; however, actors are given opportunities to improvise during the shooting process. Fischer said, [...] "Our shows are 100 percent scripted. They put everything down on paper. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to play around a little bit, too. Steve and Rainn are brilliant improvisers." [...] This leads to a large number of deleted scenes with almost every episode of The Office, all of which are considered part of the show's canon and storyline by Daniels. Deleted scenes have sometimes been restored in repeats to make episodes longer or draw back people who have seen the episode before to see the bonus footage. In an experiment, a deleted scene from [...] "The Return" [...] was made available over NBC.com and iTunes, explaining the absence of a character over the next several episodes. Daniels hoped that word of mouth among fans would spread the information, but eventually considered the experiment a failure.|$|E

500|$|Bart {{is portrayed}} as a popular cool boy and has many friends at school. Out {{of all of them}} his best friend is Milhouse Van Houten, {{although}} Bart has at times shown embarrassment about their friendship. Bart is a bad influence on Milhouse, and the two have been involved in a lot of mischief together. Because of this behavior, Milhouse's mother forbids Milhouse from playing with Bart in [...] "Homer Defined" [...] (season three, 1991). While at first he pretended that he did not care, Bart eventually realizes that he needs Milhouse, and Marge manages to convince Mrs. Van Houten to reconsider. Milhouse is a frequent target for local bullies Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. At times, Bart also [...] finds himself at the hands of their abuse. Despite being the more socially powerful of the two, Bart's social popularity has temporarily subsided various episodes either due to extreme embarrassment caused by his family or other people (or even himself) or an unfortunate coincidence. Milhouse describes their social standing as [...] "Three and a half. We get beat up, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> an explanation." [...] While Bart and the bullies have been adversaries at times, with Bart once declaring war on Nelson, the school bullies actually like Bart for his ways and hang out with him at times, especially Nelson who eventually becomes close friends with him.|$|E

He takes a rein in each hand; jerks and pulls at both; and dances on the splashboard with both feet (keeping his seat, of course) like the late lamented Ducrow on two of his fiery coursers. We come to the spot, sink down in the mire nearly to the coach windows, tilt on one side at an angle of forty- five degrees, and stick there. The insides scream dismally; the coach stops; the horses flounder; all the other six coaches stop; and their four-and-twenty horses flounder likewise: but merely for company, and in sympathy with ours.

We have already seen how he had drawn a [...] petition which Holmes, Lowell, Longfellow, and others were to sign, [...] and while nothing had come of this plan he had never ceased to [...] formulate others. Yet he hesitated when he found that the proposed [...] protection was likely to work a hardship to readers of the poorer [...] class. Once he wrote: [...] "My notions have mightily changed lately.... I can buy a lot of the copyright classics, in paper, at from three [...] to thirty cents apiece. These things must find their way into the [...] very kitchens and hovels of the country.....

We never go near the mine on Sundays, except to look after the steam-pump: our rest, and our walk in the evening once a week, is a good deal to us.
