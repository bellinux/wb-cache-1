25|$|VP Bank Group’s {{total assets}} {{declined}} in 2001 and 2002 by almost 20 per cent to CHF 8.9 billion. Consolidated net income also fell from 197 million Swiss francs in 2000 to 68 million (2001) and ultimately 38 million (2002). Despite the cost-saving measures introduced in early 2002, gross income (revenues less operating expenses at current prices) shrunk {{during this time}} frame from CHF 254 million to 36 million, with the lion’s share of that decrease being attributable to securities-related income. Given the dismal financial market environment, the bank was forced to haircut {{the value of its}} proprietary securities holdings (including its own VP Bank shares) report a loss of 38 million (2001) and 75 million (2002) Swiss francs for this <b>business</b> <b>segment.</b> The collapse in 2002 was also attributable to a decrease in assets under management from CHF 29.6 billion (2001) to 25.2 billion (2002) as well as disadvantageous exchange rate trends. During 2002, the workforce was reduced from 563 to 549 employees. A recovery got underway in 2003, with gross income surging back to 139 million Swiss francs and consolidated net income to CHF 95 million, thereby putting the bank back on its successful pre-crisis course. By the end of 2006, total assets had returned to CHF 9.5 billion (2005: 8.2 billion), consolidated net income to 132 million (2005: 119 million), and assets under management rose to 35.5 billion Swiss francs (2005: 30.1 billion). Gross income of CHF 174 million now stood 30 per cent higher than two years earlier (2004: 134 million).|$|E
