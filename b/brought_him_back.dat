5|$|The history text Zubdat-al Tawarikh, {{dedicated}} to Sultan Murad III in 1583, narrates {{a story of}} Uzair's grief {{for the destruction of}} Jerusalem. His grief {{is said to have been}} so great that God took his soul and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed.

In {{recognition of his}} unforgettable services to Pashto music, the government of Pakistan awarded him with the Pride of Performance. He is also a recipient of numerous awards and certificates {{from a number of}} cultural organizations.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} {{during his time}} in France that Solano Lopez met a Parisian courtesan, the Irish-born Eliza Lynch, and <b>brought</b> her with <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to Paraguay. There she was his {{concubine}} and de facto first lady till his death.|$|R
50|$|Suffering from tuberculosis, he {{was sent}} by doctors to the {{mountains}} of Darjeeling (end of 1891), but {{the urgency of the}} work - and disquieting news of apostasies - <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> hurriedly <b>back</b> to the Chota Nagpur where he again spent himself without counting. He baptized in a few months some 12,000 people in the Barway area (1892). A serious relapse forced him to stop definitively. His religious Superior sent <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to Belgium to recuperate. It was too late. In spite of medical care, the situation worsened and Lievens died in Leuven on 7 November 1893.|$|R
5|$|To {{regain his}} strength, Edwards {{and his wife}} took a {{carriage}} to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the Catskill Mountains but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards {{that there would be}} no recovery for her husband from the advanced Bright's disease with complications from chronic pneumonia so she <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East 116th Street in East Harlem late on June 9, 1891, just hours after returning.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya: Kasih Tak Sampai (Sitti Nurbaya: Unrealized Love, often {{abbreviated}} Sitti Nurbaya or Siti Nurbaya; original spelling Sitti Noerbaja) is an Indonesian {{novel by}} Marah Rusli. It {{was published by}} Balai Pustaka, the state-owned publisher and literary bureau of the Dutch East Indies, in 1922. The author {{was influenced by the}} cultures of the west Sumatran Minangkabau and the Dutch colonials, who had controlled Indonesia in various forms since the 17th century. Another influence may have been a negative experience within the author's family; after he had chosen a Sundanese woman to be his wife, Rusli's family <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to Padang and forced him to marry a Minangkabau woman chosen for him.|$|E
5|$|When the New Zealand Corps was {{established}} for the Battle of Monte Cassino in March 1944, Thornton was made General Staff Officer of the 2nd New Zealand Division.

50|$|Even so, these {{happy days}} did not last. Realizing {{that he was}} now being pampered because of his status as an Ainu, which had <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> {{prejudice}} <b>back</b> home, troubled Iboshi.

He left behind a prosperous year and a half in Tokyo to return to his birthplace of Hokkaido, resolved to save his fellows from poverty and discrimination.|$|R

5|$|On 9 June, Pembroke left Gaveston at {{the rectory}} at Deddington in Oxfordshire, while he himself left {{to visit his}} wife. When Warwick found out about Gaveston's whereabouts, he {{immediately}} rode out to capture him. The next morning he appeared at the rectory, where he took Gaveston captive and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to his castle at Warwick. Pembroke, whose honour had been affronted, appealed for justice both to Gaveston's brother-in-law Gloucester and to the University of Oxford, but to no avail. At Warwick, Gaveston was condemned to death for violating {{the terms of the}} Ordinances, before an assembly of barons, including Warwick, Lancaster, Hereford and Arundel. On 19 June, he was taken out on the road towards Kenilworth as far as Blacklow Hill, which was on the Earl of Lancaster's land. Here, two Welshmen ran him through with a sword and beheaded him.|$|E
5|$|The Germans, who {{had left}} Songea {{only a few weeks}} before, sent two columns to retake it during early November 1916—250 askaris marched from Likuyu, and 180 more (with two machine guns) set off from Kitanda. The latter German column spotted the RNR company that was patrolling the road, and at Mabogoro {{attacked}} the advance guard, which was commanded by Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Frederick Charles Booth. The Rhodesians were caught by surprise, and many panicked, running about and firing randomly. Booth restored discipline and led the defence until reinforcements arrived. The Germans then retreated and continued towards Songea. During this contact, Booth advanced towards enemy fire to rescue a wounded scout who was lying in the open, and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> alive; for this and subsequent actions, Booth received the Victoria Cross in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} the main event from the SmackDown brand, a {{standard}} match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At {{the beginning of the}} match, Lesnar tried {{to walk away from the}} ring, but Angle <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back.</b> There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including DDT and Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a guillotine choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon, who had accompanied Lesnar to the ring, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to tap out. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship.|$|E
5000|$|Milbanke was 27 years old, {{serving as}} a {{lieutenant}} in the 10th Hussars during the Second Boer War, when the following deed took place near Colesberg {{for which he was}} awarded the VC: On the 5th January, 1900, during a reconnaissance near Colesberg, Sir John Miibanke, when retiring under fire with a small patrol of the 10th Hussars, notwithstanding {{the fact that he had}} just been severely wounded in the thigh, rode back to the assistance of one of the men whose pony was exhausted, and who was under fire from some Boers who had dismounted.

50|$|In 44 BC, {{probably}} {{shortly before}} or after the assassination of Caesar, Arabio returned to Africa at the urging of Gnaeus Pompeius' son, Sextus Pompeius. From Africa, he sent men back to Hispania for military training. He reclaimed his father's kingdom with relative ease, forcing Bocchus into exile, and then contrived to assassinate Sittius through a stratagem. News of his conquests had reached Rome by 14 June 44, when Cicero mentions it in a letter to Atticus. His success is sometimes attributed to the Roman training of the forces he had <b>brought</b> with <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to Africa, but is more likely due to the allegiance of the population to one of their own.|$|R
50|$|In March 2012 Accam {{signed for}} Swedish third tier side Östersund. English manager Graham Potter {{was in charge}} of the club and he had already signed two other Ghanaians who were {{studying}} with Accam at Hartpury College. And after scouting him at the Nike Academy he <b>brought</b> Accam with <b>him</b> <b>back</b> to Sweden. Accam became an immediate success with his new team and several Allsvenskan clubs became interested in signing him for the summer transfer window.|$|R
5|$|After {{retiring}} from professional play, Thompson became {{the head coach}} of the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) in the 1940–41 season. He coached 56 games in two seasons. The Bisons missed the playoffs both times. He appeared in one game as goaltender in the 1940–41 season. During World War II, Thompson served in the Royal Canadian Air Force and doubled as the coach of the Calgary RCAF Mustangs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League. He led the Mustangs to the league championship series in 1942–43 against the Calgary Currie Army team where injuries to the Mustangs' goaltenders <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>back</b> onto the ice in March 1943. With Thompson in goal, the Mustangs defeated Currie Army 8–4 to tie the best-of-five series at two wins apiece. He played the deciding game, but his team fell short of winning the Alberta title with a 3–1 loss to Currie Army. After the war, Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the Chicago Black Hawks. He {{was one of the few}} scouts at the time who sought to discover a player's personality along with their playing ability. Thompson often conversed with players as part of an effort to learn about the players he was watching.|$|E

60|$|His murderer! For {{a moment}} the color fled from cheeks and lips, and the room seemed {{whirling}} around her. But one glance at <b>him</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> her drooping courage.

Blanched and colorless as his face was, there was no flinching in it.|$|R

60|$|The cry <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> skulking <b>back</b> to {{his master}} and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, {{crouched}} in flight. He slunk {{back in a}} curve. Doesn't see me. Along by {{the edge of the}} mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.|$|R
50|$|Lappe was not {{involved}} in the Ingolstadt first team {{at the beginning of the}} 2012-13 season, but scored prolifically for the reserves, now in the Regionalliga Bayern, following a restructuring of the league. 21 goals before the winter-break saw <b>him</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> in the first-team fold, and he made an immediate impact, scoring the opening goal in a 2-0 win over FSV Frankfurt, his first 2.

50|$|He first {{stepped onto}} the dohyō in May 2007. In November of that same year at the rank of jonidan 5 he {{achieved}} a perfect 7-0 record and then won a three-man playoff to take his first yūshō or tournament championship. He rose steadily through the ranks recording only a few losing tournaments (two of which he withdrew from due to injury) before reaching the rank of makushita 2 in the July 2011 tournament. His convincing record of 5-2 at this record allowed him {{to rise to the}} level of sekitori and in the following September tournament he was given the rank of juryō 10. A strong 9-6 showing followed by an even stronger 10-5 in the following January tournament allowed him to reach the top makuuchi division in only two tournaments.
