All {{were under the}} command of Joe the Indefatigable, who formed a kind of body-guard of gun-carriers out of the porters that carried the lightest packs. Mr. Dawson assisted me in collecting; Paul prepared to shoulder a bed, and the boatswain was ordered to catch butterflies. The cries of 'bátli,' 'basky,' and 'bokkus' (<b>bottle,</b> <b>basket,</b> and box) continually broke the silence of the bush and gladdened the collector's ears. I was still able to dispense with the hammock.|$|E

The neck of the bottle is broken, but stays in place because of the weaving surrounding it. Threads in pink, blue, purple were added as accents to the open weave. Much of it is now gone...|$|E

By container, we con-sider any physical object that can contain other objects, such as bowls, <b>bottles,</b> <b>baskets,</b> trash cans, refrigerators, etc. In this paper, {{we are interested}} in following questions: What is a con-tainer? Will an object contain another object? How many objects will a container hold? We study those problems by evaluating human cognition of containers and containing rela-tions with physical simulation. In the experiments, we analyze human judgments with respect to results of physical simula-tion under different scenarios. We conclude that the physical simulation is a good approximation to the human cognition of container and containing relations...|$|R

Cars drive off the country road into the meadow, {{a group of}} young people get out {{carrying}} <b>bottles,</b> <b>baskets</b> of food, transistor radios, and cameras. They light fires, pitch tents, turn on the music. In the morning they leave. The animals, birds, and insects that watched in horror through the long night creep out from their hiding places. And what do they see? Old spark plugs and old filters strewn around... Rags, burnt-out bulbs, and a monkey wrench left behind... And of course, the usual mess—apple cores, candy wrappers, charred remains of the campfire, cans, bottles, somebody’s handkerchief, somebody’s penknife, torn newspapers, coins, faded flowers picked in another meadow.|$|R

6000|$|Shut {{up in my}} room, with no voice, spirits, or books, {{that week}} was not a holiday, by any means. Finding meals a humbug, I stopped away altogether, trusting that if this sparrow was of any worth, the Lord would not let it fall to the ground. Like a flock of {{friendly}} ravens, my sister nurses fed me, not only with food for the body, but kind words for the mind; and soon, from being half starved, I found myself so beteaed and betoasted, petted and served, that I was quite [...] "in the lap of luxury," [...] in spite of cough, headache, a painful consciousness of my pleura, and a realizing sense of bones in the human frame. From the pleasant house on the hill, the home {{in the heart of}} Washington, and the Willard caravansary, came friends new and old, with <b>bottles,</b> <b>baskets,</b> carriages and invitations for the invalid; and daily our Florence Nightingale climbed the steep stairs, stealing a moment from her busy life, to watch over the stranger, of whom she was as thoughtfully tender as any mother. Long may she wave! Whatever others may think or say, Nurse Periwinkle is forever grateful; and among her relics of that Washington defeat, none is more valued than the little book which appeared on her pillow, one dreary day; for the D D. written in it means to her far more than Doctor of Divinity.|$|R

Props are used to change the difficulty of the shot or add aesthetic value. As with artistic billiards pros, trick shot artists often have specialized cue sticks for performing particular types of shots, particularly [...] and massés.|$|R

[...] He {{declared}} {{that in the}} future the decorative arts industry would produce only [...] "objects which are perfectly useful, convenient, and have a true luxury which pleases our spirit by their elegance and the purity of their execution, and the efficiency of their services. This rational perfection and precise determinate creates the link sufficient to recognize a style." [...] He described the future of decoration in these terms: [...] "The ideal is to go work in the superb office of a modern factory, rectangular and well-lit, painted in white Ripolin (a major French paint manufacturer); where healthy activity and laborious optimism reign." [...] He concluded by repeating [...] "Modern decoration has no decoration".|$|R
50|$|In the Totem Trial, Sting went first. Janardan put {{his first}} four bottles on without any trouble, {{but as he}} kept going, {{due to a lack}} of cooperation, the rest of Sting were all calling out things and this {{frustrated}} Janardan. While handling his last bottle, it ended up going down the pole from the hook, and the speakers from Sting were arguing within each other. Sting decided to take it off and get another bottle, and finally managed to get it in. After the challenge, Sting's speakers argued about their performance. In Claw's turn, Brandon carefully managed to put the bottles on the scales, and whenever the rest of Claw were all speaking at once, Brandon shouted and told them to speak one at a time. At one point, Brandon knocked over four of five remaining <b>bottles</b> in his <b>basket,</b> but with the help of his teammates, he picked them up and got all of the <b>bottles</b> in the <b>basket.</b> Afterwards, Johnny said that the winners of the Totem Trial was to be revealed at the Island Fire. When they went back to their camps, Sting and Claw pondered over why the island was holding the result of the trial.|$|R

60|$|The {{steerage}} was {{now as a}} bedlam; {{trunks and}} chests were locked and tied round with ropes; and a general washing and rinsing of faces and hands was beheld. While this was going on, forth came an order from the quarter-deck, for every bed, blanket, bolster, and bundle of straw in the steerage {{to be committed to}} the deep.--A command that was received by the emigrants with dismay, and then with wrath. But they were assured, that this was indispensable to the getting rid of an otherwise long detention of some weeks at the quarantine. They therefore reluctantly complied; and overboard went pallet and pillow. Following them, went old pots and pans, <b>bottles</b> and <b>baskets.</b> So, all around, the sea was strewn with stuffed bed-ticks, that limberly floated on the waves--couches for all mermaids who were not fastidious. Numberless things of this sort, tossed overboard from emigrant ships nearing the harbor of New York, drift in through the Narrows, and are deposited on the shores of Staten Island; along whose eastern beach I have often walked, and speculated upon the broken jugs, torn pillows, and dilapidated baskets at my feet.|$|R

Long-drawn faces and continual sighs evidenced nostalgia. At last the house became a scene of preparation. Blue chinaware and <b>basketed</b> <b>bottles</b> of Zemzem water appeared standing in solid columns, and pilgrims occupied themselves in hunting for mementoes of Meccah; ground-plans; combs, balm, henna, tooth-sticks; aloes-wood, turquoises, coral, and mother-o’-pearl rosaries; shreds of Kiswah-cloth and fine Abas, or cloaks of camels’-wool. It was not safe to mount the stairs without shouting “Tarik” (Out of the way!) at every step, on peril of meeting face to face some excited fair.[FN#2] The lower floor was crowded with provision-vendors; and the staple article of conversation seemed to be the chance of a steamer from Jeddah to Suez.|$|R
50|$|In this leg's Roadblock, {{one team}} member had to dive {{to the bottom}} of a {{swimming}} pool and use a set of keys to unlock some boxes. Once they found a bottle of Sting Energy Drink, they could bring it up to the surface. They then were lifted by pulley up to the building's roof, where they had to throw the <b>bottle</b> into a <b>basket.</b> Teams had 1 minute 30 seconds to complete the diving portion, and 1 minute to complete the throwing portion. If either of these time limits expired, teams had to move {{to the back of the}} queue. In the Detour, teams chose between Tháp Cao (High Tower) and Hầm Sâu (Deep Tunnels). In High Tower, teams had to take a cable car to the highest point of the Bà Nà Hills, where they would enter a castle. They had to climb up thousands of spiraling stairs and take five boards with random numbers one at a time back {{to the bottom of}} the stairs so that they came to an exact total of 20 000. In Deep Tunnels, teams traveled by cable car to the largest wine cellar in Da Nang and had search among thousands of wine bottles for one with a race flag attached to it. During this Detour task, one leg of each team member would be tied together.|$|R
50|$|While {{agriculture}} {{was mainly}} what saw to the Obereisenbach villagers’ needs, {{along with the}} two former mills, after the Second World War, the number of agricultural operations shrank. Beginning in the 19th century, other businesses afforded the villagers choices in livelihoods: quarries, businesses that ﬁlled mineral water <b>bottles,</b> distilleries and <b>basket</b> weaving. The Bitschenmühle (mill) up from the village functioned in the 18th century as an estate mill. The Bauernmühlchen (“Little Farmers’ Mill”) down from the village was maintained as a coöperative. The sandstone quarry in the Reuterrech, the slope on the dale’s left side, was from 1831 let out to private interests by the municipality, earning major importance about 1900 when the railway line along the Glan was built. The quarry remained in business until about 1960. Along with this sandstone quarry, there were also several small hard-rock quarries. Since {{a great deal of}} good fruit grew within Obereisenbach’s limits, this was made into fruit wine and spirits. The last distillery, though, closed in 2004. The mineral spring was mentioned as early as the early 16th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, the spring’s owners began to put it to commercial use. There was a spring on the river’s left bank below the Reuterrech near the big sandstone quarry, called the Sankt Julia Quelle, and another one over on the right bank called the Pfälzer Quelle. Bit by bit, three bottling businesses grew up, bottling not only mineral water but also various fruity drinks. The products were shipped to many parts of the Western Palatinate and the Saarland. After the Second World War, it was no longer ﬁnancially worthwhile to continue the business. In 1970, the last bottling business ceased production. The basket weaving craft ﬂourished in the 19th and early 20th centuries and the products were sold by travelling salesmen.|$|R
6000|$|Long {{before dawn}} the goodwife rises, wakens her handmaidens, lights the fire, and prepares for the Afur or morning meal. The quern is here unknown [20]. A flat, smooth, oval slab, {{weighing}} about fifteen pounds, and a stone roller six inches in diameter, worked with both hands, {{and the weight}} of the body kneeling ungracefully upon it on [...] "all fours," [...] are used to triturate the holcus grain. At times water must be sprinkled over the meal, until a finely powdered paste is ready for the oven: thus several hours' labour is required to prepare a few pounds of bread. About 6 A.M. there appears a substantial breakfast of roast beef and mutton, with scones of Jowari grain, the whole drenched in broth. Of the men few perform any ablutions, but all use the tooth stick before sitting down to eat. After the meal some squat in the sun, others transact business, and drive their cattle to the bush till 11 A.M., the dinner hour. There is no variety in the repasts, which are always flesh and holcus: these people despise fowls, and consider vegetables food for cattle. During the day there is no privacy; men, women, and children enter in crowds, and will not be driven away by the Geradah, who inquires screamingly if they come to stare at a baboon. My kettle especially excites their surprise; some opine that it is an ostrich, others, a serpent: Sudiyah, however, soon discovered its use, and begged irresistibly for the unique article. Throughout the day her slave girls are busied in grinding, cooking, and quarrelling with dissonant voices: the men have little occupation beyond chewing tobacco, chatting, and having their wigs frizzled by a professional coiffeur. In the evening the horses and cattle return home to be milked and stabled: this operation concluded, all apply themselves to supper with a will. They sleep but little, and sit deep into the night trimming the fire, and conversing merrily over their cups of Farshu or millet beer. [21] I tried this mixture several times, and found it detestable: the taste is sour, and it flies directly to the head, in consequence of being mixed with some poisonous bark. It is served up in gourd <b>bottles</b> upon a <b>basket</b> of holcus heads, and strained through a pledget of cotton, fixed across the narrow mouth, into cups of the same primitive material: the drinkers sit around their liquor, and their hilarity argues its intoxicating properties. In the morning they arise with headaches and heavy eyes; but these symptoms, which we, an industrious race, deprecate, are not disliked by the Somal--they promote sleep and give something to occupy the vacant mind. I usually slumber through the noise except when Ambar, a half-caste Somal, returning from a trip to Harar, astounds us with his contes bleus, or wild Abtidon howls forth some lay like this:-- ...|$|R
