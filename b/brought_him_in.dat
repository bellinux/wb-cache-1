5|$|In 1867, Dyer {{became a}} member of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a {{patriotic}} society of civil war Union veterans. It was around this time that he started to acquire details about Union regiments. His job as a commercial traveller <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> touch with many veterans and officials, from whom he gathered official figures. The statistics he collected expanded into further areas, from regiments to details of formations, battles, movements, and similar data. He began to research using official records in various state capitals, and continued speaking to ex-soldiers and high-standing officers, such as General Sherman, who expressed interest in a comprehensive compendium and welcomed its future publication.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1916 he was {{transferred}} as first lieutenant to a Q-ship under Gordon Campbell. A Q-ship was a merchant ship with hidden weaponry, commanded secretly by the navy and manned by a Royal Navy crew. When attacked by a submarine, the Q-ship would feign damage until the enemy {{was close enough to}} engage and then reveal its weapons to counter-attack. Campbell, a major proponent of Q-ship strategy, was impressed with Stuart's stubborn refusal to accept the two years of rejection and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> to replace an officer whose nerves had cracked under the strain of Q-ship operations.|$|E
5|$|In July 1889, Police Constable Luke Hanks was {{investigating}} a theft from the London Central Telegraph Office. During the investigation, a fifteen-year-old telegraph boy named Charles Thomas Swinscow was discovered {{to be in}} possession of fourteen shillings, equivalent to several weeks of his wages. At the time, messenger boys were not permitted to carry any personal cash {{in the course of}} their duties, to prevent their own money being mixed with that of the customers. Suspecting the boy's involvement in the theft, Constable Hanks <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> for questioning. After hesitating, Swinscow admitted that he earned the money working as a prostitute for a man named Charles Hammond, who operated a male brothel at 19 Cleveland Street. According to Swinscow, he was introduced to Hammond by a General Post Office clerk, eighteen-year-old Henry Newlove. In addition, he named two seventeen-year-old telegraph boys who also worked for Hammond: George Alma Wright and Charles Ernest Thickbroom. Constable Hanks obtained corroborating statements from Wright and Thickbroom and, armed with these, a confession from Newlove.|$|E

5|$|Laker to {{this point}} had taken 3/22 from 12.4 overs, having also top-scored in the first innings. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would {{for most of the}} day. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and looked unaccustomed to playing in the middle order, but Bradman <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> ahead of Hassett as the new ball was due and Brown was used to {{starting}} his innings against pace bowlers and a new ball. The Australian captain decided to hasten the new ball by using his feet to get to the pitch of the ball to attack the spinners, hitting them through the off side. Yardley removed Lakerwho was bowling effectivelyfrom the attack and took the second new ball, bringing back Bedser and Edrich. However, this move backfired as Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes, and in the first 40 minutes after lunch, 43 runs were added. Yardley brought back his two spinners, and Australia passed England's total before the English captain brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brownwho was attempting to push the ball to mid-onlbw with an off cutter in his first over. This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and Hassett came in at 185/4. The Australian vice-captain came close to being caught when he knocked a ball from Bedser into the air, narrowly evading the grasp of Evans. Following the departure of Brown, the Australian scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once.|$|E

25|$|An erotic revue which Tynan co-ordinated and {{partially}} wrote, called Oh! Calcutta!, debuted in 1969 {{and became one}} of the most successful theatre hits of all time.

Tynan was a poor businessman, however, and the contracts he signed for the show <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> only $250,000 out of the many millions it earned.|$|E

25|$|Of all {{the poets}} who are {{connected}} with Liverpool, {{perhaps the greatest}} is Constantine P. Cavafy, a twentieth-century Greek cultural icon, although {{he was born in}} Alexandria. From a wealthy family, his father had business interests in Egypt, London and Liverpool. After his father's death, Cavafy's mother <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 1872 at the age of nine to Liverpool where he spent part of his childhood being educated. He lived first in Balmoral Road, then when the family firm crashed, he lived in poorer circumstances in Huskisson Street. After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in Liverpool. In 1876, his family faced financial problems due to the Long Depression of 1873, so, by 1877, they had to move back to Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{opened their}} 2010 {{training}} camp at Camelback Ranch on February 20, when {{pitchers and catchers}} reported to camp. The rest of the position players arrived on February 25 and the exhibition season began on March 5 with an 8–3 victory over the Chicago White Sox. With most of the roster spots set heading into the spring the main competition {{was expected to be}} the battle for the Dodgers fifth starter spot among a cast that included Eric Stults, Charlie Haeger, James McDonald, Scott Elbert, Russ Ortiz, Ramón Ortiz and Carlos Monasterios. The Dodgers also needed to pick a starting second baseman from the trio of Blake DeWitt, Ronnie Belliard and Jamey Carroll. Early in the spring, the Dodgers signed veteran outfielder Garret Anderson to a minor league contract and <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> to compete for a bench role.|$|E
25|$|The Miraflores Altarpiece was {{probably}} commissioned by King JuanII of Castile, since JuanII donated {{it to the}} monastery of Miraflores in 1445. In the holy year 1450 Rogier quite possibly made a pilgrimage to Rome which <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> contact with Italian artists and patrons. The House of Este and the Medici family commissioned paintings from him. After interventions from both the Duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin of France, the future LouisXI, Rogier van der Weyden was persuaded to accept the request of Bianca Maria Visconti, Duchess of Milan, that her court painter Zanetto Bugatto go to Brussels to become an apprentice in his workshop. Rogier's international reputation had increased progressively. In the 1450s and 1460s humanist scholars such as Nicolas Cusanus, Filarete and Bartolomeo Facio referred to him in superlatives: 'the greatest', 'the most noble' of painters.|$|E

500|$|Ebenezer Clapp, in The History of Dorchester said of Atherton, [...] "He {{had great}} {{experience}} and skill {{in the treatment}} of the Indians, with whom his public duties <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> frequent contact. He manifested much humanity and sympathy for their ignorant and degraded condition, but exercised great energy and decision of character when necessary." [...] In 1637 the colonists had sided with the Mohegans in the Pequot War, which wiped out most of the Pequot people. By the early 1640s tensions were building between the Mohegans and the Narragansetts. [...] "In 1645, the New England Colonies met by representatives to consult upon the Indian problem, and appointed a Council of War; Capt. Miles Standish, of Plymouth, was chairman. Mason of Connecticut, Leverett and Atherton of Massachusetts, were the other councilors".|$|E
500|$|For the Elvin Bishop hit, [...] "Fooled Around and Fell in Love," [...] it was Szymczyk who {{suggested}} {{the inclusion of}} the song on Bishop's Struttin' My Stuff album, feeling the blues-oriented album lacked a pop single. The song would go on to become Bishop's biggest hit. [...] Such a pattern was repeated throughout his career. The Eagles <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> to refine and improve their [...] "rock" [...] sound, and all of their biggest selling albums and songs were Szymcyzk-produced. Martin Turner of Wishbone Ash has called him [...] "my all time favourite producer". While the two did not always get along during recording, usually over Turner's bass-playing style, Turner does credit Szymczyk with giving the band a more commercial sound on one of their most successful albums, 1974's There's the Rub.|$|E
500|$|After {{commissioning}} the pilot, ITV Network Centre did not dictate to {{the producers}} {{who should be}} cast.

Bullen was impressed by Thomson's natural comedy and Langan asked him to write a role for him to play in Cold Feet. Thomson accepted the role because {{he did not want to}} be known forever for playing [...] "Fat Bob", the sidekick of Coogan's Paul Calf in a series of sketches. Lowney had been introduced to James Nesbitt through a mutual friend. He <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> to audition for the part of Adam after seeing his [...] "wonderfully expressive face" [...] in a Persil advertisement. At the audition, Nesbitt asked to do the reading with his own accent, believing that Northern Irish characters rarely appeared in contemporary British drama without [...] "political baggage".

However, after a meeting with Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher, Blount decided to sign as an undrafted free agent with the Titans instead. [...] In August 2010, Blount was involved in another incident in which he threw a punch, this time at teammate defensive end Eric Bakhtiari, a few moments after having his own helmet ripped off in practice. [...] Blount quickly talked to Titans head coach Jeff Fisher before leaving the field. [...] "He apologized, and I said he didn't have to apologize," [...] Fisher said. [...] "It's football.

I have great confidence in the young man that he learned from his mistake, and he's very competitive. That's why we <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> here is to watch him run the football like that." [...] Blount survived the final roster cut and {{was placed on the}} Titans' 53-man roster. Blount was then waived by the team on September 5, 2010, to make room for veteran linebackers Tim Shaw (Chicago Bears) and Patrick Bailey (Pittsburgh Steelers). Titans sources indicated that Blount would be signed to the rookie practice squad if Blount cleared waivers, which he did not.|$|E

This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and left Australia at 4/185. Following the departure of Brown, the scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once.

500|$|While vacationing at his sister's {{house in}} Coimbatore, in 1933, Narayan met {{and fell in}} love with Rajam, a 15-year-old girl who lived nearby. Despite many astrological and {{financial}} obstacles, Narayan managed to gain permission from the girl's father and married her. Following his marriage, Narayan became a reporter for a Madras-based paper called The Justice, dedicated to the rights of non-Brahmins. The publishers were thrilled to have a Brahmin Iyer in Narayan espousing their cause. The job <b>brought</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> contact with a wide variety of people and issues. Earlier, Narayan had sent the manuscript of Swami and Friends to a friend at Oxford, and about this time, the friend showed the manuscript to Graham Greene. Greene recommended the book to his publisher, and it was finally published in 1935. Greene also counseled Narayan on shortening his name to become more familiar to the English-speaking audience. The book was semi-autobiographical and built upon many incidents from his own childhood. Reviews were favourable but sales were few. Narayan's next novel The Bachelor of Arts (1937), was inspired in part by his experiences at college, and dealt with the theme of a rebellious adolescent transitioning to a rather well-adjusted adult; it was published by a different publisher, again at the recommendation of Greene. His third novel, The Dark Room (1938) was about domestic disharmony, showcasing the man as the oppressor and the woman as the victim within a marriage, and was published by yet another publisher; this book also received good reviews. In 1937, Narayan's father died, and Narayan was forced to accept a commission from the government of Mysore [...] as he was not making any money.|$|E
