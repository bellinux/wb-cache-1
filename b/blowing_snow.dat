5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. <b>Blowing</b> <b>snow</b> continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in Saxtons River. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were unable}} to start a fire using {{friction}} due to the thin air at that altitude, and sent for matches. By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to tend the many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp to give some protection from the high winds and <b>blowing</b> <b>snow.</b> It took another week to bring all the equipment to the summit, including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E

5000|$|A {{layer of}} {{relatively}} stiff, hard snow formed by deposition of wind <b>blown</b> <b>snow</b> on the leeward {{side of a}} ridge or other sheltered area. Wind slabs can form over weaker, softer freshly fallen powder snow, creating an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.|$|R
5|$|When powdery, snow drifts {{with the}} wind from the {{location}} where it originally fell, forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations. After attaching to hillsides, <b>blown</b> <b>snow</b> can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.|$|R
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense <b>blowing</b> <b>snow.</b> This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
25|$|Often, a Chinook is {{preceded by}} a “Manyberries Chinook” during {{the end of a}} cold spell. This {{southeast}} wind was named for the small village Manyberries, now a hamlet, in southeastern Alberta, from where the wind seems to originate. It can be fairly strong and cause bitter windchill and <b>blowing</b> <b>snow.</b> The wind will eventually swing around to the southwest and the temperature rises sharply as the real Chinook arrives.|$|E
25|$|Lake Erie {{was covered}} by a deep, powdery snow; January's unusually cold {{conditions}} limited the usual thawing and refreezing, so the snow on the frozen lake remained powdery. The drifted snow on roadways was difficult to clear because the strong wind packed the snow solidly. In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists {{had to deal with}} vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds and <b>blowing</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E

50|$|It {{takes about}} one {{million gallons of}} water to cover Ruby Hill with 2-3 feet of snow. Once this snow begins to melt, the water simply returns to the {{surrounding}} vegetation. The City of Denver has agreed with Denver Water to reduce its summer consumption of water by an amount equal to what it takes to <b>blow</b> <b>snow</b> on Ruby Hill. Hence, no water is being wasted, only transferred.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first of}} December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a bitter wind <b>blew,</b> <b>snow</b> fell fast, {{and the year}} seemed getting ready for its death. When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long at Beth, held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it gently down, saying, {{in a low voice}} to Hannah, [...] "If Mrs. March can leave her husband she'd better be sent for." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the roads becoming impassable, motorists also {{had to deal with}} vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds, and <b>blowing</b> <b>snow.</b> For example, a maintenance pickup truck at the Buffalo airport had snow blasted into the engine compartment that then melted, saturated the spark plugs, and stalled the engine. A report from Welland, Ontario, (see section below for a description of the blizzard in Canada) indicated many cars there overheated when snow got under the radiator, melted, and then refroze, interfering with the fan.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 2004 an inbound train derailed at Makrellbekken {{after it}} struck a tractor with a snowplow. The {{cause of the}} {{accident}} was a wind gust <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> against the tractor, disorienting the driver and causing him to drive {{too close to the}} platform edge with the shovel sticking out just as the train arrived. The only injury, to the train driver, was minor. The report was critical of the metro's safety routines, pointing out that the company had failed to sufficiently caution the subcontractor of the hazards with the snow clearing task.|$|E
25|$|In the hardest-struck areas, snowmobiles {{became the}} only viable method of transportation. In Western New York and {{southern}} Ontario, snow which was accumulated on frozen Lake Erie and {{snow on the ground}} {{at the start of the}} blizzard provided ample material for the high winds to blow into huge drifts. The combination of bitter cold, high winds, and <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> paralyzed areas affected by the storm. Lake Ontario rarely freezes over, which meant northern New York had to deal with considerable lake effect snow. Coupled with the existing snow cover and wind, this had a similar effect.|$|E
50|$|The {{constant}} freezing temperatures {{cause the}} formation of large ice sheets in ice cap climates. These ice sheets, however, are not static, but slowly move off the continents into the surrounding waters. New snow and ice accumulation then replaces the ice that is lost. Precipitation is nearly non-existent in ice cap climates. It is never warm enough for rain, and usually too cold to generate snow. However, wind can <b>blow</b> <b>snow</b> onto the ice sheets from nearby tundras.|$|R
50|$|In Pincher Creek, the {{temperature}} rose by , from -19 to 22 C, {{in one hour}} in 1962. Trains {{have been known to}} be derailed by Chinook winds. During the winter, driving can be treacherous, as the wind <b>blows</b> <b>snow</b> across roadways, sometimes causing roads to vanish and snowdrifts to pile up higher than a metre. Empty semitrailer trucks driving along Highway 3 and other routes in southern Alberta have been blown over by the high gusts of wind caused by Chinooks.|$|R

25|$|Hundreds of {{accidents}} (including two fatal ones) {{were reported by}} Ontario Provincial Police by the Sûreté du Québec across Ontario, Quebec and across several US States including a pile-up that involved at least seven tractor-trailers on Highway 401 near Cornwall which temporarily closed the road. A second pile-up on Highway 401 near Kingston caused a rig to leaked over 300 liters of fuel into a creek. Another pile-up involving a tractor-trailer was reported on Autoroute 40 west of Montreal forcing the shutdown {{of it as the}} trailer overturned and spilled kerosene on the roadway. Autoroutes 20 and 440 and Highways 132, 138 and 175 north and east of Quebec City were shut down due to heavy and <b>blowing</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E
25|$|Any wind {{stronger}} than a light breeze {{can contribute to}} a rapid accumulation of snow on sheltered slopes downwind. Wind slab forms quickly and, if present, weaker snow below the slab may {{not have time to}} adjust to the new load. Even on a clear day, wind can quickly load a slope with snow by <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> from one place to another. Top-loading occurs when wind deposits snow from the top of a slope; cross-loading occurs when wind deposits snow parallel to the slope. When a wind blows over the top of a mountain, the leeward, or downwind, side of the mountain experiences top-loading, from the top to the bottom of that lee slope. When the wind blows across a ridge that leads up the mountain, the leeward side of the ridge is subject to cross-loading. Cross-loaded wind-slabs are usually difficult to identify visually.|$|E
500|$|Snow flurry, snow {{storm and}} {{blizzard}} describe snow events of progressively greater duration and intensity. A blizzard is a weather condition involving snow and has varying definitions {{in different parts}} of the world. In the United States, a blizzard occurs when two conditions are met for a period of three hours or more: A sustained wind or frequent gusts to , and sufficient snow in the air to reduce visibility to less than [...] In Canada and the United Kingdom, the criteria are similar. While heavy snowfall often occurs during blizzard conditions, falling snow is not a requirement, as <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> can create a ground blizzard.|$|E

During the 2008 race, competitors started in [...] temperatures in Fairbanks and then faced winds of [...] on the trail, resulting in severe wind chills. At higher elevations, such as the crossings of Rosebud and Eagle summits, whiteout blizzards are common. In the 2006 race, 12 teams were struck by a massive storm that eventually caused the evacuation of seven teams by helicopter. In 2009, mushers endured winds up to , <b>blowing</b> <b>snow,</b> and subzero temperatures atop Eagle Summit, where conditions had been even worse in a storm during the 1988 race, when wind chill temperatures dropped below [...]|$|E
500|$|Some railroads {{occasionally}} use air-blowing machines, each {{powered by}} a jet engine to clear snow from tracks and switches.

50|$|Snow {{farming is}} the use of obstacles, {{equipment}} and knowledge about management of snow in order to strategically manipulate snow coverage. Often this is done for the purpose of skiing or even preventing snow drift in certain areas like roads. The most popular obstacle is the snow fence, which is used to create drifts and collect more snow in a given area than would otherwise naturally occur. The snow can be moved to other areas and groomed {{with the use of a}} snow groomer. Sometimes the snow fence is readily movable in order to maximize the collection of <b>blown</b> <b>snow,</b> despite wind direction changes.|$|R

500|$|The {{attack was}} to begin at 5:30am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. The attack was {{originally}} planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed for 24hours {{at the request of}} the French. [...] During the late hours of 8 April and early morning of 9 April the men of the leading and supporting wave of the attack were moved into their forward assembly positions. The weather was cold and later changed to sleet and snow. Although physically discomforting for everyone, the north-westerly storm provided some advantage to the assaulting troops by <b>blowing</b> <b>snow</b> in the faces of the defending troops. Light Canadian and British artillery bombardments continued throughout the prior night but stopped in the few minutes before the attack, as the artillery recalibrated their guns in preparation for the synchronized barrage. At exactly 5:30am, every artillery piece at the disposal of the Canadian Corps began firing. Thirty seconds later, engineers detonated the mine charges laid under no man's land and the German trench line, destroying a number of German strong points and creating secure communication trenches directly across no man's land. Light field guns laid down a barrage that advanced in predetermined increments, often [...] every three minutes, while medium and heavy howitzers established a series of standing barrages further ahead, against known defensive systems. During the early fighting the German divisional artilleries, despite heavy losses, were able to maintain their defensive firing. As the Canadian assault advanced, it overran many of the German guns because there was no means of moving them to the rear on account of many of the horses being killed in the initial gas attack.|$|E
