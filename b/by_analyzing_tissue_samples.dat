40|$|Abstractp 16 INK 4 A (p 16) binds to {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} 4 / 6, {{negatively}} regulates cell growth. Recent studies {{have led to}} an understanding of additional biologic functions for p 16; however, the detailed mechanisms involved are still elusive. In this article, we show an unexpected expression of anion exchanger 1 (AEi) in the cytoplasm in poorly, moderately differentiated gastric, colonic adenocarcinoma cells, in its interaction with p 16, thereby sequestrating the protein in the cytoplasm. Genetic alterations of p 16, AEi were not detectable. Forced expression of AEi in these cells sequestrated more p 16 in the cytoplasm, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of AEi in the cells induced the release of p 16 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, leading to cell death, growth inhibition of tumor cells. <b>By</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from patients with gastric, colonic cancers, we found that 83. 33 % of gastric cancers, 56. 52 % of colonic cancers coexpressed AEi, p 16 in the cytoplasm. We conclude that AEi plays {{a crucial role in the}} pathogenesis of gastric, colonic adenocarcinoma, that p 16 dysfunction is a novel pathway of carcinogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Colorectal carcinomas are {{the third}} most common {{malignancies}} in the Western World. Despite screening programs about 70 % of these tumors are detected at advanced stages. Late diagnosis, however, results in a significant reduction of average survival times. Thus, alternative tools or biomarkers for early detection, prognosis and therapeutic intervention are needed. Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have an increased risk to develop an ulcerative colitisassociated colorectal carcinoma (UCC). To evaluate independent cellular features with possible predictive value, a total of 683 UC biopsies from two patient groups were analyzed by image cytometry and immunohistochemistry: group A consisted of 8 patients with UCC, group B of 16 ulcerative colitis patients without any malignancy. Whereas no difference in inflammatory activity and dysplasia between patient groups could be observed, genomic aneuploidy, laminin- 5 immunopositivity and increased Cyclin A expression could be confirmed as significant predictors for malignant transformation. We then analyzed 23 UCassociated colorectal carcinomas by image cytometry, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and immunohistochemistry. We found that DNA aneuploidy in UCC correlates with specific chromosomal imbalances and increased cyclin A expression levels. Distinct amplifications that were not known {{to be associated with}} colorectal cancer will likely reveal novel genes involved in colorectal tumorigenesis. However, the overall pattern of specific chromosomal aberrations in UCC is similar to that seen in sporadic colorectal carcinomas. To further elucidate the importance of these highly conserved chromosomal aberrations, we modeled specific chromosomal ancuploidies in cancer cells and dissected the immediate consequences of genomic imbalances on the transcriptome: we generated artificial trisomies in a diploid colorectal cancer cell line and in normal human breast epithelial cells using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. Gene expression levels were analyzed using cDNA arrays. Regardless of chromosome or cell type, chromosomal trisomies resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} average transcriptional activity of the trisomic chromosome and affected the expression of numerous genes on other chromosomes as well, revealing a more complex global transcriptional dysregulation. Analogous results could be obtained in primary colorectal tumors: we found that specific and recurrent chromosomal aneuploidies exert strong and direct influence on gene expression levels of resident genes on the affected chromosomes <b>by</b> <b>analyzing</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> from 36 patients with sporadic colorectal carcinoma. In addition, increasing genomic instability, aneuploidy and a recurrent pattern of chromosomal aberrations are accompanied by distinct gene- and protein expression patterns that correlate with subsequent stages of colorectal cancer progression. Our analysis identified 58 genes differentially expressed between normal mucosa and adenoma, 116 genes between adenoma and carcinoma, and 158 genes between primary carcinoma and liver metastasis. Proteomics analysis revealed 42 differentially expressed proteins that were related to similar canonical pathways as the differentially expressed genes. The identified proteins underwent extensive posttranslational modifications, thus multiplying the transcriptional dysregulation. A malignancy related protein profile could also be identified in serum samples: comprehensive serum protein profiling in 147 patients with colorectal malignancy and healthy individuals using SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed a set of 13 differentially expressed features. Using 16 different classifiers allowed class prediction with 96. 7 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity in a blinded validation set, including patient sera with early stage disease. Large scale prospective multicenter studies are now warranted to establish the clinical value of SELDI-TOF based protein profiling for colorectal cancer screening...|$|E

From May to June of the second study year, supplementary samples were taken weekly. Up to 90 % of the specimens of C. viridis and 70 % of those of C. celata sampled were reproductive during the study. In both species, but particularly in C. viridis, reproductive investment, measured {{as the percentage of}} sponge tissue occupied by gametes, was high. Oocytes were present almost year-round in both species, except for a 1 - 4 -month period after zygote release. In contrast, spermatogenesis occurred most frequently in May in both species, when (May-June) oocytes reached their greatest diameters. Cliona viridis and C. celata are hermaphrodites, with oocytes and spermatic cysts coexisting in 10 % of the studied individuals {{in the first year of}} the study, and in 30 % during the second. No developing embryos or larvae were incubated in the sponge tissues, and fertilization was not observed.

40|$|When {{attempting}} {{to determine the}} diet of wild animals, {{a limited number of}} techniques currently exist. Often, biologists look at the stomach contents or feces of an animal, if they cannot observe what it is eating directly. However, these techniques often cannot be used with reptiles because they may not eat often or may have an empty stomach when the contents of their stomach are examined. Many ecologists have begun to use stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to determine what an animal has eaten. Stable isotopes are useful because unlike radioactive isotopes, stable isotopes do not decay and thus {{can be used as a}} better tracer through different trophic levels. Obtaining stable isotopes can be accomplished <b>by</b> <b>analyzing</b> a small <b>tissue</b> <b>sample</b> from the animal and comparing its carbon and nitrogen stable isotope levels to those of several of its potential prey. Since variation in carbon and nitrogen isotopes exists in all living things and is maintained with increases in trophic level, these chemical signatures can be good indicators of an animal’s current diet. Our central question is to test the assumption that there is a direct correlation between the stable isotope signatures found in Side-blotched Lizards (Uta stansburiana) and some of their insect prey in the lab, where we could control their diet. We predicted that there would be a direct correlation between the carbon (δ 1 3 C) and nitrogen (δ 1 5 N) levels of the lizards and those of their prey. We found that, although δ 1 3 C andδ 1 5 N values of lizards generally matched their diet, diet complexity did not significantly alter lizard toe tissue stable isotope ratios. This method has the potential to be more effective at determining wild reptile diet than other techniques currently used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Due to the {{frequent}} dysregulation of the PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, mTOR represents a suitable therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, emerging data from clinical trials of HCC patients indicate that mTOR inhibition by RAD 001 (Everolimus) alone has only moderate antitumor efficacy {{which may be}} due to the feedback activation of AKT after mTOR inhibition. In this study, we analyzed the effects of dual inhibition of mTOR and AKT on the proliferation of HCC cell lines. In addition, we measured the feedback activation of each of the AKT isoforms after mTOR inhibition in HCC cell lines and their enzymatic activity in primary samples from HCC patients. Methods The activation status of specific AKT isoforms in human HCC samples and corresponding healthy liver <b>tissue</b> was <b>analyzed</b> using an AKT isoform specific in vitro kinase assay. AKT isoform activation after mTOR inhibition was analyzed in three HCC cell lines (Hep 3 B, HepG 2 and Huh 7), and the impact of AKT signaling on proliferation after mTOR inhibition was investigated using the novel AKT inhibitor MK- 2206 and AKT isoform specific knockdown cells. Results AKT isoforms become differentially activated during feedback activation following RAD 001 treatment. The combination of mTOR inhibition and AKT isoform knockdown showed only a weak synergistic effect on proliferation of HCC cell lines. However, the combinatorial treatment with RAD 001 and the pan AKT inhibitor MK- 2206 resulted in a strong synergism, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, <b>by</b> <b>analyzing</b> primary HCC <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> we were able to demonstrate that a hotspot mutation (H 1047 R) of PI 3 KCA, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of PI 3 K, was associated with increased in vitro kinase activity of all AKT isoforms in comparison to healthy liver tissue of the patient. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that dual targeting of mTOR and AKT by use of RAD 001 and the pan AKT inhibitor MK- 2206 does effectively inhibit proliferation of HCC cell lines. These data suggest that combined treatment with RAD 001 and MK- 2206 may be a promising therapy approach in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. </p...|$|R

However, FFPE preparation is incompatible with many down-stream molecular biology techniques such as PCR based amplification methods and gene expression studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we investigated the sample quality requirements of FFPE tissues for massively parallel short-read sequencing approaches. We evaluated key variables of pre-fixation, fixation related and post-fixation processes that occur in routine medical service (e. g. degree of autolysis, duration of fixation and of storage). We also investigated the influence of tissue storage time on sequencing quality by using material that was up to 18 years old. Finally, we analyzed normal and tumor breast tissues using the Sequencing by Synthesis technique (Illumina Genome Analyzer, Solexa) to simultaneously localize genome-wide copy number alterations and to detect genomic variations such as substitutions and point-deletions and/or insertions in FFPE <b>tissue</b> <b>samples.</b> CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The application of second generation sequencing techniques on small amounts of FFPE material opens up the possibility to <b>analyze</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> which have been collected during routine clinical work {{as well as in the}} context of clinical trials.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently considered {{the gold standard for}} diagnosis of a prion infection but may be insensitive to early or sub-clinical CWD that are important to understanding CWD transmission and ecology. We assessed the potential of serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) to improve detection of CWD prior to the onset of clinical signs. We <b>analyzed</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> from free-ranging Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) and used hierarchical Bayesian analysis to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of IHC and sPMCA conditional on simultaneously estimated disease states. Sensitivity estimates were higher for sPMCA (99. 51 %, credible interval (CI) 97. 15 – 100 %) than IHC of obex (brain stem, 76. 56 %, CI 57. 00 – 91. 46 %) or retropharyngeal lymph node (90. 06 %, CI 74. 13 – 98. 70 %) tissues, or both (98. 99 %, CI 90. 01 – 100 %). Our hierarchical Bayesian model predicts the prevalence of prion infection in this elk population to be 18. 90 % (CI 15. 50 – 32. 72 %), compared to previous estimates of 12. 90 %. Our data reveal a previously unidentified sub-clinical prion-positive portion of the elk population that could represent silent carriers capable of significantly impacting CWD ecology...|$|R
40|$|Aim: In immunohistochemistry, {{antibodies}} {{are used}} to detect and localize antigens in cellular compartments in sections taken from frozen or paraffin blocks. Currently, computerized image processing techniques are widely available to analyze immunohistochemically stained tissues; however, the image analysis programs are generally highly specific and expensive. We aimed to show the feasibility of computer assisted image analysis (CAIA) by using two computer programs currently in widespread use. Methods: Two available computer programs, Adobe Photoshop CS and ImageJ, were used to separate areas in the same tissue sections stained with NOS antibody and labeled with peroxidase in human endometrial tissue. CAIA was made on the relevant images using these two programs. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} among the groups according to staining intensity, in all three grades of staining (P < 0. 001, P < 0. 05, and P < 0. 001, respectively). Subjective assessment of the images was in good agreement with objective CAIA. One (+) positive stained area was greater in group 1 and less in group 2 and group 3 (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 001, respectively). Group 3, which was considered as the most intensely stained by the observer, had the greatest amount of ++ staining. Conclusion: CAIA is a safe and reliable method of <b>analyzing</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> stained using immunohistochemical methods...|$|R
40|$|Histone posttranslational {{modifications}} (PTMs), {{by their}} {{action on the}} chromatin state, {{play a central role}} in the regulation of gene expression. The discovery that some PTMs in the brain are dynamically regulated by experience and environmental factors makes them an important subject for the study of plasticity changes in learning and memory, addiction, and psychiatric disorders. Current histone isolation protocols, however, require large amounts of tissue, which limits their application for <b>analyzing</b> small <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> from a specific brain region. We describe here a step-by-step protocol for histone extraction and isolation from 1 mm(3) of tissue from brain punches, which allows reproducible and reliable results for histone PTM identification and quantification without losing anatomical precision.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{laboratory}} diagnosis of Buruli ulcer (BU) {{is based on}} microscopic detection of acid fast bacilli, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), histopathology or cultivation. Insertion sequence (IS) 2404 qPCR, the most sensitive method, is usually only available at reference laboratories. The only currently available point-of-care test, microscopic detection of acid fast bacilli (AFB), has limited sensitivity and specificity. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we <b>analyzed</b> AFB positive <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> (n = 83) for the presence, distribution and amount of AFB. AFB were nearly exclusively present in the subcutis with large extracellular clusters being most frequently (67...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a {{group of}} small non-coding RNAs that fine tune {{translation}} of multiple target mRNAs, are emerging as key regulators in cardiovascular development and disease. MiRNAs are involved in cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and remodeling following cardiac infarction; however, miRNAs involved in hypertension have not been thoroughly investigated. We have recently reported that specific miRNAs play an integral role in Angiotensin II receptor (AT 1 R) signaling, especially after activation of the Gαq signaling pathway. Since AT 1 R blockers are widely used to treat hypertension, we undertook {{a detailed analysis of}} potential miRNAs involved in Angiotensin II (AngII) mediated hypertension in rats and hypertensive patients, using miRNA microarray and qPCR analysis. The miR- 132 and miR- 212 are highly increased in the heart, aortic wall and kidney of rats with hypertension (159 ± 12 mm Hg) and cardiac hypertrophy following chronic AngII infusion. In addition, activation of the endothelin receptor, another Gαq coupled receptor, also increased miR- 132 and miR- 212. We sought to extend these observations using human samples by reasoning that AT 1 R blockers may decrease miR- 132 and miR- 212. We <b>analyzed</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> of mammary artery obtained from surplus arterial tissue after coronary bypass operations. Indeed, we found a decrease in expression levels of miR- 132 and miR- 212 in human arteries from bypass-operated patients treated with AT 1 R blockers, whereas treatment with β-blockers had no effect. Taken together, these data suggest that miR- 132 and miR- 212 are involved in AngII induced hypertension, providing a new perspective in hypertensive disease mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. Thyroid {{transcription}} factor- 1 (NKX 2. 1 /TITF- 1) {{is a member}} of the thyroid tissue-specific transcription factor family that has been proven to be closely associated with many human diseases. Recently, it was reported that NKX 2. 1 expression is lost or reduced in some human cancers such as lung cancer and thyroid cancer. However, there was insufficient data to suggest that NKX 2. 1 functionality could be used as a prognostic factor. Therefore, this study aims to investigate NKX 2. 1 expression and its prognostic significance in primary gastric carcinoma. Then, we attempted to investigate if NKX 2. 1 expression was related to the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of gastric carcinoma (GC) patients. The expression levels of NKX 2. 1 were <b>analyzed</b> in <b>tissue</b> <b>samples</b> from 205 gastric carcinoma patients by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical staining(IHC).
