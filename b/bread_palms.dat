50|$|Encephalartos is a genus of cycad {{native to}} Africa. Several species of Encephalartos are {{commonly}} referred to as bread trees, <b>bread</b> <b>palms</b> or kaffir bread, since a bread-like starchy food can be prepared from the centre of the stem. The genus name is derived from the Greek words en (within), kephali (head), and artos (bread), referring {{to the use of the}} pith to make food. They are, in evolutionary terms, some of the most primitive living gymnosperms.|$|E
40|$|Species of Encephalartos, {{commonly}} known as bread trees, <b>bread</b> <b>palms</b> or cycads are native to Africa; the genus encompasses more than 60 species and represents {{an important component of}} the indigenous African flora. Recently, a leaf blight disease was noted on several E. altensteinii plants growing at the foot of Table Mountain in the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens of South Africa. Preliminary isolations from dead and dying leaves of E. altensteinii, E. lebomboensis and E. princeps, collected from South Africa, revealed the presence of several novel microfungi on this host. Novelties include Phaeomoniella capensis, Saccharata kirstenboschensis, Teratosphaeria altensteinii and T. encephalarti. New host records of species previously only known to occur on Proteaceae include Cladophialophora proteae and Catenulostroma microsporum, as well as a hyperparasite, Dactylaria leptosphaeriicola, occurring on ascomata of T. encephalarti...|$|E

It's made from a light fermented mixture of Barley/Brown <b>bread,</b> Date <b>palm</b> sap, Herbs and Spices. It may be either white or colored depending on the flavor. It's also found to have health benefits.|$|R

40|$|The term &lsquo;vitamin E&rsquo; {{refers to}} a group of eight vitamers (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, delta-tocopherols and tocotrienols). Its primary role is thought to be as an {{antioxidant}} commonly added to a variety of foods, e. g. bakery products. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) procedures are used for the separation and analysis of these tocopherols and tocotrienols in foods. The use of a normal phase column is the preferred approach in such methods, with hexane almost universally utilised as the mobile phase. However there is increasing concern regarding the toxicity of hexane. Here we evaluate the use of heptane as a replacement for hexane in HPLC based vitamin E analysis. The two solvents were compared using samples of <b>bread</b> fortiﬁed with <b>palm</b> oil (as a source of vitamin E). Accelerated solvent extraction procedure followed by HPLC showed the eﬀective separation of the E vitamers in a variety of bread samples using both solvents. It is concluded that heptane provides eﬀective separation and quantiﬁcation of the E vitamers found in cereals and cereal products while also reducing operator risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{oil palm}} fibre may provide {{potential}} alternative {{source of revenue}} for oil palm industries and the abundance of this raw materials lead to this study of incorporated it into the production of high fibre bread. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate the feasibility of producing high fibre <b>bread</b> from oil <b>palm</b> pericarp fibre that leads to an acceptable consumption. Toxicological analysis of BSLA was performed onto the raw material of oil palm pericarp fibre and also the finished product to detect the level of toxicant in different concentration was the major concern. In addition, the heavy metals were detected by using AAS. Several other methods were used in these studies which was sensory evaluation, and also physical and chemical analysis. Physical analysis was to measure the firmness of the bread and determined the fibre content in finished product through chemical analysis. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze the sample by one way ANOVA and Duncan’s to evaluate the significant different between formulations. In addition, the oil palm fibre can be incorporated into production of high fibre bread which was safe to be consuming with an improvement in the bread for better acceptability by the consumers...|$|R
30|$|The {{calcium content}} of the dishes ranged {{from a high of}} 158.0  mg/ 100  g in konkonte with {{groundnut}} soup to a low of 4.9  mg/ 100  g in kooko with <b>bread.</b> Konkonte with <b>palm</b> nut soup (146.7  mg/ 100  g), plantain and kontomire stew (116.1  mg/ 100  g), yam with kontomire stew (103.6  mg/ 100  g) and kenkey with fried fish and pepper sauce (100.0  mg/ 100  g) had high calcium contents. Even though calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body, it is present in significant amount in very limited number of foods (Dunne 1990). Wise (1983) suggested that the solubility of phytates and the proportion of zinc bound in a mineral complex in the intestines depend on the levels of calcium. In his model, phytate precipitation is not complete until dietary calcium:phytate molar ratios attain a value of approximately 6 : 1. Based on this observation, the high calcium:phytate molar ratios observed in these foods may lead to a reduction in the level of bioavailable zinc when consumed. The calcium:phytate molar ratios of all the dishes, except konkonte with palm nut soup, were greater than 6 : 1 and this, according to Wise (1983), is regarded as unfavourable for calcium absorption from these foods. Even though, the low calcium content of some of the foods is undesirable, it is of an advantage because, high calcium content may also jeopardize bioavailability of iron (Hallberg and Hulthein 2000) and zinc (Wise 1983). According to Ellis et al. (1987) and Davies and Warrington (1986), if the (calcium × phytate): zinc values are > 0.50  mol/kg there will be interference with zinc availability which will lead to increased risk of deficiency. High calcium levels in foods can promote the phytate-induced decrease in zinc bioavailability when the calcium × phytate:zinc mill molar ratio exceeds 0.5 (Gibson 1994). Therefore, as values > 0.5 were observed in these dishes, {{it would appear that the}} possible contribution of calcium in the diet in exacerbating the low bioavailability of zinc due to phytate is probably minimal.|$|R
