25|$|The final part of {{the chain}} in getting the {{newspaper}} from printer to the reader are the news wholesalers and the newsagents. Newsagents sprang up in Cornwall in the 1850s, but still continued to <b>buy</b> <b>direct</b> from the publisher. This generally meant a long delivery time from publication dates to shelf date, particularly for the national newspapers. However, by the 1870s both independent and national chains of news wholesaler started to make inroads into Cornwall. Currently, there are just two news wholesalers in the County, who distribute all newspapers and magazines to all outlets, from the village Post Office to the hypermarket. They are Smiths News, who are based in Plymouth, but have sub-branches in Bodmin and Redruth, and DashNews, which distributes Cornwall & Devon Media titles as well as News International newspapers.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{of retail}} reform who have voiced {{the need to}} promote {{organised}} retail include Chief Ministers of several states of India, several belonging to political parties that have no affiliation with Congress-led central government of India. The list includes the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. In a report submitted earlier in 2011, these Chief Ministers urged the Prime Minister to prioritize reforms to help promote organised retail, shorten the retail path from farm to consumer, allow organised retail to <b>buy</b> <b>direct</b> from farmers at remunerative produce prices, and reduce farm to retail costs. Similarly, the Chief Minister of Delhi has come out {{in support of the}} retail reform, as have the Chief Ministers of the two farming states of Haryana and Punjab in north India., The Chief Ministers of Haryana and Punjab claim that the announced retail reforms will never benefit farmers in their states.|$|E

Details on the trust's profits are scarce, but it gained significantly more revenue from tourism than from leasing the office space in 2011. In August 2016, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) gained a 10% share in the Empire State Building through a $622 million investment to the Empire State Realty Trust. The trust’s president John Kessler called it an “endorsement of the company’s irreplaceable assets”. The investment has been described as “an unusual move for a sovereign wealth fund”, as they typically <b>buy</b> <b>direct</b> stakes in buildings rather than real estate companies. Other foreign entities that have a stake in the Empire State Building include investors from Norway, Japan, and Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1920s, {{business}} continued to boom at the Pike Place Market. The {{north side of}} the Corner Market became the Sanitary Market, housing delicatessens, butchers, restaurants, and bakeries. Three Girls Bakery opened, which would draw large crowds to watch their new automated doughnut machines. The so-called [...] "mosquito fleet", the precursor to the modern Washington State Ferry system, would bring shoppers from various islands in Puget Sound to shop, and Market vendors began to bring goods to the docks for the island residents to <b>buy</b> <b>direct</b> when they saw the ships approach. The ships would only arrive mid-morning, so islanders had no ability to get the best produce {{at the opening of the}} Market. Seeing an opportunity, the Hotel Dix, which was located at the time just north of the Market, would offer special overnight rates to island residents that allowed them to stay on the mainland with an early morning wake-up call to compete with local residents for the best goods. To compete for all of these customers, Market vendors began to arrange their goods in elaborate patterns. The Liberty Theater, on First Avenue, hired attendants to watch customer's Market purchases who paid the price of a nickel matinee while they shopped more. The area became a social scene, where young Seattle locals went to see and be seen. Children from an orphanage in Des Moines, Washington performed street concerts on Saturdays.|$|E

50|$|Usage of Black Friday Advertising Tip {{sites and}} <b>buying</b> <b>direct</b> varies by {{state in the}} U.S., {{influenced}} {{in large part by}} differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the U.S., especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002. The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult. Dedicated cross-border shopping solutions such as the Canadian shopping platform Wishabi and Canada Post’s Borderfree exist to mitigate the problem through estimation of the various cost involved.|$|R

50|$|In March 2010 Ingram Digital (a {{wholesaler}} part of {{the same}} group) warned its customers it {{might not be able to}} sell them e-books, as most large publishers were moving from the wholesale model (publishers offer wholesale discounts, and the final price is determined by retailers) to the agency model (publishers set the retail price and offer agents a commission, so retailers earn more by <b>buying</b> <b>direct</b> from the publisher rather than via a wholesaler). This was triggered by the eBook pricing dispute between Amazon and Macmillan, and the imminent launch of the iPad. However, in April 2012 the U.S. Department of Justice sued Apple, Macmillan, and others on the basis that the agency model was anti-competitive and a form of collusion used to fix the price of e-books.
