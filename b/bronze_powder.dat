40|$|In {{this study}} {{hardness}} and densification behaviour of copper and <b>bronze</b> <b>powders</b> under wet bag cold isostatic and uniaxial die pressing processes are examined. In uniaxial pressing the specimens were compacted up to a pressure of 800 MPa. Cold isostatic pressing (CIP) resulted in better densification {{for both of}} the studied powder materials. Attained densities were 94 % for copper and 82 % for <b>bronze</b> <b>powders.</b> In uniaxial die pressing greater pressurisation was needed to attain the same densification that obtained with CIP. The microhardness of both of the studied materials were measured before and after pressing processes. Higher pressure resulted in disloca-tion and strain hardening and increased hardness of powders.

50|$|The {{invention}} {{from which}} Bessemer {{made his first}} fortune {{was a series of}} six steam-powered machines for making <b>bronze</b> <b>powder,</b> used in the manufacture of gold paint. As he relates in his autobiography, he examined the <b>bronze</b> <b>powder</b> made in Nuremberg which was the only place where it was made at the time. He then copied and improved the product and made it capable of being made on a simple production line. It was an early example of reverse engineering where a product is analysed, and then reconstituted. The process was kept secret, with only members of his immediate family having access to the factory. It was a widely used alternative to a patent, and such trade secrets are still used today. The Nuremberg powder, which was made by hand, retailed in London for £5 12s per pound and he eventually reduced the price to half a crown, or about 1/40th.The profits from sale of the paint allowed him to pursue his other inventions.|$|E

This research involves a study of sane of the methods available for covering material substrates with a metallic coating.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{overlapping}} sphere packs provide useful {{models for the}} microstructure and elastic properties of sintered <b>bronze</b> <b>powders.</b> In {{the early stages of}} sintering the dilated sphere (or cherry-pit) model is superior, while at low porosities the sintered powders are more accurately described by freely overlapping spheres. The dilated sphere model accurately predicts Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus for materials produced by the selective laser melting of metal powders. This will help improve the match between designed and actual properties of net-shape components made using this process. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform sinterability studies of ball-milled Fe- 12 %Ni- 6. 4 %Cu- 1. 6 %Sn- 0. 6 %C powders. A mixture of precisely weighed amounts of elemental iron, nickel and graphite, and pre-alloyed 80 / 20 <b>bronze</b> <b>powders</b> was ball-milled for 8, 30 and 120 hours. After cold-pressing at 400 MPa the specimens were sintered at 900 ◦C for 30 minutes in a reducing atmosphere and subsequently tested for density and hardness as well as subjected to structural studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The obtained results showed that only the powder ball-milled for 120 hours yielded a near pore-free material after consolidation by cold pressing and pressureless sintering at 900 ◦C. As such, it could have a potential to be used in production of diamond-impregnated wire saw beads...|$|R

The study was focused on copper alloys with lubricating phase particles in form of graphite, tungsten disulphide (WS 2), molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2) and glassy carbon. The metallic matrix of composite materials was composed of alloys from Cu-Sn-Zn system. The mass content of lubricating phase particles was from 5 to 20 %.

40|$|In porous resistances, Darcy's law {{provides}} a good approximation of mass flow rate when the differences between upstream and downstream pressures are sufficiently small. In this range, the mass flow rates are proportional to the porous resistance's permeability. For gas bearings, the pressure difference is normally higher, and it is known experimentally that the mass flow rates are lower than would result from Darcy's law. Forchheimer's law adds an inertial term to Darcy's law and, when an appropriate coefficient is selected for this term, {{provides a}} good approximation of flow rates for the same applications even with the highest pressure differences. This paper presents an experimental and theoretical investigation of porous resistances used in gas bearing and thrust pad supply systems. The porous resistances considered in the investigation were made by sintering <b>bronze</b> <b>powders</b> with different grain sizes to produce cylindrical inserts that can be installed in bearing supply devices. The paper describes the test set-up and experimental results obtained for: a) Mass flow rate through single porous resistances at different upstream and downstream pressures; and b) Mass flow rate and pressure distribution on a pneumatic pad featuring the same porous resistances. The theoretical permeability of the chosen porous resistances was calculated, and the results from set-up a) were then used to obtain experimental permeability and to determine the inertial coefficients. The results, which are expressed {{as a function of}} the Reynolds number, confirmed the validity of using Forchheimer's law.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{synthetic}} polymers has been introduced {{as an alternative to}} traditional materials in conservation of gilding surfaces. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate where and when it is appropriate to use synthetic polymers and when traditional materials are preferred. The synthetic polymers which have been investigated as alternatives are polyvinyl alcohol for animal glue in burnished gold, acrylic dispersion for linseed oil in oil gilding, and acrylic gold paint for <b>bronzing</b> <b>powder</b> in shellac. Reference materials of the traditional materials were made. Solubility and mechanical strength tests were carried out. The solutions tested were; water, ethanol, acetone, ammoniac and white spirit. The mechanical tests were made with; finger, eraser and scalpel. From the results of the tests recommendations for cleaning could be presented. Light photomicrographs of both synthetic and traditional gilding types were created as an aid to visually compare them. A patch of burnished gold with polyvinyl alcohol as the medium was made upon the traditional burnished gold surface. The purpose was to see if it could discern the difference between traditional gilding and the synthetic alternative with the aid of the optical microscope. Recommendation for cleaning, consolidation and retouching could be presented. The recommendations are built on the work of two experts in gilding conservation; Malcolm Green at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London and Jonathan Thornton at Buffalo State University in the US. They have two very different attitudes and approaches to conservation of gilded surfaces. Their differing schools of thought are weighed against Munoz Vinas´s theories of conservation ethics of today.
