40|$|The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, NY District’s wetland {{mitigation}} {{proposal for}} Finderne Farms in Bridgewater, NJ, was approved in August 2005 {{by the state}} regulatory agency. The design goal was to provide mitigation for wetlands impacted by the Green Brook Flood Control project {{at a ratio of}} 2 [*]:[*] 1. As part of the design process in 2001, the available historical hydrologic data was evaluated. At that time, the NJ Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) Water <b>Budget</b> <b>Manual</b> was not available as a tool for accessing an acceptable design hydroperiod. Construction of the Finderne mitigation site was completed in July 2006. A six-year postconstruction monitoring program has determined that certain areas at the site have not achieved the established wetland success criteria. In 2012, there was a 28 % survival of planted woody vegetation and a 74 % cover of invasive species within Creation Area 1, a palustrine forested wetland. With the advent of the Water <b>Budget</b> <b>Manual,</b> a reevaluation of the historical hydrologic data was performed.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an insight into {{budgetary}} practice in UK-based hotel organizations and an update on previous survey work in this area. The research aims to cover a broad range of budgeting issues, including: the process used in setting budgets, monitoring and review of the budgetary processes, and the human aspects of the budgeting process. Design/methodology/approach – This research used a census-based questionnaire of hotel organizations' finance directors. The questionnaire consisted of mainly closed questions, with opportunities for further explanation to be given. Statistical analysis tools included Chi-square tests, Spearman's Rank Coefficient, and ANOVA. Findings – The paper finds that the key reason organizations produce budgets are to aid control, evaluate performance and aid planning. Neither the top-down, bottom-up or combination approaches to budgeting dominated in the UK. The results showed a higher rate of the top-down approach in the UK, compared to previous surveys in other countries. Budgets were generally viewed as the main performance indicator in hotel organizations. There is little use of flexible budgeting, budget committees or <b>budget</b> <b>manuals</b> in the hotel industry. The “human aspects” of budgeting identified some interesting contradictions such as the belief that participation is key in budgeting working, yet there is a lack of participation in practice, most significantly amongst hotel department managers. Originality/value – Limited information as to budgetary practice in hotels has previously been published, particularly related to the UK. This survey and further findings from the broader research project it is part of identify hotel industry budgetary practice. This aids identifying change over time and provides an invaluable insight into how budgets are used in the industry...|$|R

40|$|The paper’s {{main purpose}} is to briefly discuss the concept of {{performance}} budgeting and challenges encountered by different (OECD) countries when seeking to implement performance budgeting, which might offer some helpful guidelines for Slovenia. The paper also presents the methodological framework applied in defining goals in a society {{as well as the}} role and the interdependence of social indicators and performance indicators for specific units/programs in public administration. Theoretical bases of such procedures will be presented along with an empirical concept which is believed to be appropriate for Slovenia. The formulation of the concept stems from the definitions given in the <b>Budget</b> <b>Manual</b> for 2008 - 2009 where individual budget users are responsible for monitoring their performance and efficiency. On this basis, we developed a theoretical concept of connections between different levels of long-term goals, implementational goals as well as efficiency and effectiveness indicators at the level of sub-programs of selected budget users. A theoretical and methodological framework constructed in this way will hopefully {{serve as the basis for}} realizing the concept of Slovenian direct performance budgeting in the near future. ...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if there are significant emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) from a subarctic mire in northern Sweden. Subarctic peatlands in discontinuous permafrost regions are undergoing substantial environmental changes due to their high sensitivity to climate warming and there is need for including NMVOCs in the overall carbon <b>budget.</b> Automatic and <b>manual</b> chamber measurements were used to estimate NMVOC fluxes from three dominating subhabitats on the mire during three growing seasons. Emission rates varied and were related to plant species distribution and seasonal net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide. The highest fluxes were observed from wetter sites dominated by Eriophorum and Sphagnum spp. Total NMVOC emissions from the mire (∼ 17 ha) is estimated to consist of ∼ 150 kgC during a growing season with 150 d. NMVOC fluxes can account for ∼ 5 % of total net carbon exchange (− 3177 kgC) at the mire during the same period.
