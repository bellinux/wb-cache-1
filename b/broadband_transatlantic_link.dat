Central to DVP are distributed pilot applications for professional digital video production over ATM broadband networks (LAN and WAN). Distributed video production refers to situations where the cameras, recorders, switches, mixers and other equipment used in video production (or post-production) are located at several sites linked by high bandwidth network connections. The DVP project investigates requirements of broadcasters for several forms of distributed video production and runs a series of trials of distributed virtual studios, distributed rehearsals and remote video editing and retrieval. Together with North American partners a <b>transatlantic</b> <b>broadband</b> ATM <b>link</b> will be tested for distributed virtual reality simulations.

40|$|After a short {{revision}} {{of changes in}} international system that affect transatlantic relations, this paper analyses {{the impact of the}} Lisbon Treaty on the Transatlantic Relations, even if they are not expressly treated in it. We try to show that main innovations on CFSP and ESDP are able to improve the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>link.</b> Accordingly, a refusal to the amendment Treaty after Irish referendum would imply an impasse or and stand by situation for this relationship. However, as much of the Treaty provisions are jet implemented or could be decided to apply outside the constitutional path, the real impact of the eventual fall or slow down in the ratification process would not be formally a drama. But, the impasse of the Lisbon Treaty has other psychological consequences inside and outside the European Union, on member states attitude and on international community perceptions about the Union that will affect negatively the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>link.</b> A change of perspective is urgently needed in the EU about its actual role in world affairs {{and the best way to}} assume its international responsibilities in global governance...|$|R
40|$|National Security AffairsAfter the Cold War the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>link</b> between Europe and America is {{no longer}} self-explanatory. The allies focus {{increasingly}} on internal problems and prosperity of their own countries. Traditional alliances and partnerships seem to play a diminished role. However, this dividing trend is countered {{by a number of}} new problems, uncertainty about the future, and a worldwide interrelation in many facets of political, economic, social, and technological life. The state {{is no longer}} able to solve problems within an isolationist approach. From this perspective, partners have to be found. Because of their common history, common belief and value system, and common ideological basis, Europe and America are natural partners. On this common ground a multidimensional transatlantic partnership should be established. Structures of this partnership rely on traditional organizations like NATO, additionally however, <b>transatlantic</b> <b>links</b> have to be modernized. Both partners, America and Europe, will have advantages from this. Both, however, will have to make contributions: the Americans by being prepared to take the lead, the Europeans by overcoming their traditional antagonisms, by taking over burdens and responsibilities, and by developing a European identity.

It revisits the image of the traitor in Mexican historiography and Spain's liberal revolution, by showing how the personalism and opportunism rife in early Mexican and Spanish liberalism shaped not only political ideology but also tactics to a remarkable degree. It shows that the popular memory of individual political actions influenced liberal discourse to a larger degree than is usually acknowledged. It does this by tracing the transatlantic radical, nativist and then conservative career of Ramón Ceruti over the fifteen years between the fall of Spain's trienio constitucional, Mexico's First Federal Republic and his betrayal of radicalism during the First Carlist War...|$|R

The NNE is tested for real-time forecasting (online forecasting on a few-minute sample), short-term (one-hour to several-hours sample), and mid-term forecasting (one-day to several-days sample). The NNE is compared against AR models of traditional Holt-Winters, double Holt-Winters seasonal variant to identify repetitions in patterns at fixed time periods, and ARIMA.

Beside uncertainty due to large scale reform in all organizations and the violent conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, we must recognize a third cause: the rise of the European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI). Its “Europeanist” interest is to set up legally and institutionally separate security and defence mechanisms for Western Europe. ESDI interests weaken the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>link,</b> clutter the decision making process, and risk short term military and security capabilities for long term political objectives. Three developments enabled ESDI to reach its take-off stage: German unification, great power competition over the security vacuum left by the end of the cold war, and a lack of leadership in the Atlantic Alliance. An analysis of these causes direct to the need for a German-American coalition, especially on closer CSCE-NATO ties to prevent further disintegration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{research}} community has proved {{the existence and}} studied {{the root causes of}} Path Inflation on the Internet— end-to-end paths significantly longer than necessary. However, it has been typically ignored that the popularity of traffic destinations and, consequently, of network paths, is clearly heterogeneous—some destinations are popular while others are barely accessed. In this paper, we propose a trace-driven method-ology to measure the Path Inflation accounting for the popularity of Internet destinations from a given network, thus evaluating the implications that Path Inflation exerts on real networks under production. This information is important for network operators because it allows them to objectively stand out those destinations whose connection analysis must be prioritized. The results of applying this methodology to the Spanish academic network show that the most critical regions to focus on are Spain’s closest countries, which either are very popular or have large Path Inflation {{as a consequence of the}} use of <b>transatlantic</b> <b>links</b> as intermediate nodes, or both...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe NATO Allies decided at the November 2002 Prague Summit {{to conduct a}} feasibility study concerning the protection of national territories, populations, and forces {{from the threat of}} ballistic missile attacks. This thesis examines current missile defense programs and analyzes their potential to protect the Alliance as a whole, thus maintaining the indivisibility of Allied security. The thesis investigates the political, military, economic, and technological challenges for a NATO full-spectrum missile defense and the major questions that the Allies have yet to resolve. It also examines the prospects for cooperation between NATO and Russia in missile defense and potential perils for international stability, including the non-proliferation regime. The thesis concludes that NATO missile defenses will probably enhance the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>link.</b> However, the most crucial challenges include the command and control issue and the potential reactions of Russia and China to defenses capable of protecting NATO homelands against ballistic missile attacks.

With the concept just {{a little over a year}} old, it is still too early to tell exactly how ESDP will mature and what form it will take.

40|$|Central to the {{endeavor}} of nationalist thought is the nineteenth-century {{idea of the}} nation as the primary political community, resulting in territorially bounded nation-states becoming the globally dominant model. In this chapter, Boele van Hensbroek identifies the imaginative intellectuals and leaders of African resistances who, during the struggle itself {{from the end of the}} nineteenth century onwards, conceived of how the unit of the Fatherland or Nation would be demarcated. Their struggles with local colonial authorities made colonial administrative units to become in most cases (but not all) units of nationalist imagination, while cosmopolitan inspirations were strongest in metropolitan intellectual circles, such as those of Negritude and Marxists in Paris, Pan-Africanism in the <b>transatlantic</b> <b>link,</b> and around Padmore in London. The chapter outlines the transformation of nationalism into a comprehensive vision of national development, leading the most prominent African leaders—Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kaunda, Senghor, etc. —to formulate a “national ideological philosophy” in order to frame their nation-building project, while linking ideologically to selected indigenous values and social practices.

Its strategic location flanking the sea routes to Recife and Salvador and the possibility of Axis aircraft using it as a staging post made the airfield a vital target.
