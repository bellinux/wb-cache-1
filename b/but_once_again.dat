5|$|When news arrived of Cerialis' {{victory over}} Civilis, Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from {{pursuing}} further military endeavours. Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally, suggesting he hand over command of his army <b>but,</b> <b>once</b> <b>again,</b> he was snubbed. With {{the return of}} Vespasian in late September, his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> the troops carried the day.

5|$|While {{the swift}} {{transfer}} of power following Domitian's death had prevented a civil war from erupting, Nerva's position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable, and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority. Upon his accession, he had ordered a halt to treason trials, {{but at the same}} time allowed the prosecution of informers by the Senate to continue. This measure led to , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies, leading the consul Fronto to famously remark that Domitian's tyranny was ultimately preferable to Nerva's anarchy. Early in 97, a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Calpurnius Piso Crassus Frugi Licinianus failed, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> Nerva refused to put the conspirators to death, much to the disapproval of the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Written by James Follett, this {{involved}} monsters {{attacking a}} race of beings who live inside Halley's Comet, unaware that there is anything beyond it they believe that their world is the sum and total of the universe. Into the Comet would have used the companions of Romana and K9. Follett was a novelist who pitched this idea to script editor Douglas Adams circa September 1979 when they met up and discussed the forthcoming return of Halley's Comet. Unfortunately the storyline was rejected by Adams. Follett resubmitted Into the Comet to new script editor Christopher H. Bidmead around May 1980, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> the storyline was not pursued.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge Castle, locally {{also known}} as Castle Mound, is located in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. Originally built after the Norman conquest to control the {{strategically}} important route {{to the north of}} England, it {{played a role in the}} conflicts of the Anarchy, the First and Second Barons' Wars. Hugely expanded by Edward I, the castle then fell rapidly into disuse in the late medieval era, its stonework recycled for building purposes in the surrounding colleges. Cambridge Castle was refortified during the English Civil War <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> fell into disuse, used primarily as the county gaol. The castle gaol was finally demolished in 1842, with a new prison built in the castle bailey. This prison was demolished in 1932, replaced with the modern Shire Hall, and only the castle motte and limited earthworks still stand. The site is open to the public daily and offers views over the historic buildings of the city.|$|E

After struggling to break into the starting line-up however, he spent successful stints on loan with Italian clubs Empoli and Parma, where he matured as a player, before earning a move back to Juventus in 2012. Upon his return to the Turin club, he won two consecutive league titles, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> struggled to maintain a spot in the team's starting eleven. This resulted in a high-profile move to MLS side Toronto FC in early 2015, in a deal which made him the league's highest paid player.|$|E

After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a reputation that followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the Tennessee Volunteers (who won a title the year after he graduated). The Colts lost some key players after the 2005 season, including James, who departed the Colts for the Arizona Cardinals, and kicker Mike Vanderjagt, the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage, who left for the Dallas Cowboys.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August {{a patrol}} from the 13th Parachute Battalion succeeded in {{crossing}} the eastern {{branch of the}} river, and was quickly reinforced {{by the rest of}} the battalion. They fought for three hours to gain a proper foothold and were then forced to withdraw again. The next day, patrols from the 7th Parachute Battalion discovered that the Germans had withdrawn during the night, and they therefore crossed the river and secured the high ground to the north, closely followed {{by the rest of the}} brigade. On 25August the 1st Special Service Brigade took over as the lead formation, and headed towards Beuzeville, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> German defences held up the advance.

This streak included going 13-0 in the month of February, making them the first team since the 1996 Chicago Bulls to finish an entire month undefeated. Houston finished their season 55–27, but were eliminated {{for the second year in}} row by the Jazz in the first round of the playoffs, 4 games to 2.|$|E
