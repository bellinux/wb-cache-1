25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} consequences of the Secular Franciscan charism is that the spiritual formation of the OFS must cater for those whose vocation is, motivated by the dynamic power of the Gospel, to live in secular circumstances.

Therefore, Secular Franciscans should seek to encounter the living and active person of Christ in their <b>brothers</b> <b>and</b> <b>sisters,</b> <b>in</b> Sacred Scripture, in the Church and in liturgical activity. They do this by studying, loving and most of all by living in an integrated way the human and evangelical aspects of their life.|$|E
