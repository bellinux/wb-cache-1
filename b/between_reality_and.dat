Carefully combining the effects of artificial light with the surrounding darkness, she creates mysterious images of lakes, swimming pools and solitary figures in the twilight. Since 2003, she has participated in key exhibitions in Denmark and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|McEwan {{wanted to}} write a novel dealing with the social turmoil of the 1970s, and Sweet Tooth is to a large extent based on his own life. The story explores the {{relationship}} between artistic integrity and government propaganda, and addresses competing approaches to literature; the boundary <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> fiction is tested throughout. The novel is dedicated to McEwan's late friend Christopher Hitchens. He is not referred to directly in the book, but he did play a part as the host of a real-life literary event fictionalised in the book, involving McEwan and Martin Amis, who does appear in the story. Critical reception was mixed; some reviewers found the novel moving and poignant, while others saw it as weaker than much of McEwan's previous work.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

25|$|In some instances, {{unreliable}} narration {{can bring}} about the fantastic in works of fiction. In Kingsley Amis' The Green Man, for example, the unreliability of the narrator Maurice Allington destabilizes the boundaries <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> the fantastic.

This resulted in a report with the title Role-playing as recreation. The report gives no support to claims of correlation between acts of violence and playing role-playing games, nor of claims that impressionable youths would be susceptible to blurring lines <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> fantasy, another claim made in the Riksdag proposals. On the contrary, the report is positive of role-playing as a recreation for youths.|$|E
25|$|Frequently {{linked with}} Updike is the novelist Philip Roth. Roth vigorously explores Jewish {{identity}} in American society, {{especially in the}} postwar era and the early 21st century. Frequently set in Newark, New Jersey, Roth's work {{is known to be}} highly autobiographical, and many of Roth's main characters, most famously the Jewish novelist Nathan Zuckerman, are thought to be alter egos of Roth. With these techniques, and armed with his articulate and fast-paced style, Roth explores the distinction <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> fiction in literature while provocatively examining American culture. His most famous work includes the Zuckerman novels, the controversial Portnoy's Complaint (1969), and Goodbye, Columbus (1959). Among the most decorated American writers of his generation, he has won every major American literary award, including the Pulitzer Prize for his major novel American Pastoral (1997).|$|E

They tend to be less auto-biographical than her novels.

Her characters compare their real and dream worlds to each other in order to [...] "negotiate their sense of destiny."

500|$|The Three Witches {{represent}} evil, darkness, chaos, and conflict, {{while their}} role is as agents and witnesses. Their presence communicates treason and impending doom. During Shakespeare's day, witches {{were seen as}} worse than rebels, [...] "the most notorious traitor and rebel that can be". They were not only political traitors, but spiritual traitors as well. Much of the confusion that springs from them comes from their ability to straddle the play's borders <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> the supernatural. They are so deeply entrenched in both worlds that {{it is unclear whether}} they control fate, or whether they are merely its agents.

500|$|Asturias blurs the {{separation}} {{between dream and reality}} throughout , {{making it one of the}} novel's most prominent themes. Latin American writer and critic Ariel Dorfman notes that the mixing of dream and reality is partly a result of Asturias's frequent use of figurative language. This stylistic choice is reflected in the content of the story itself, which suggests that an important effect of dictatorial power is the blurring of dreams and reality. Dorfman also notes that the President is sustained by fear, which further blurs the distinction <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> dream. This fear grants him the voluntary or involuntary support of others, enabling the President to exercise his mandates. Dorfman asserts that the President's use of fear elevates his mandates to legends. These legends are then able to [...] "impose itself upon reality because men live it fully in a way to make sense of their humanity". One example of this theme, elucidated by Eckart, is a series of scenes leading to the arrest of the lawyer Carvajal. When the President decides to blame Carvajal for the murder of Colonel Sonriente, it is clear that Carvajal is confounded by the charges. Moreover, despite being a lawyer, Carvajal is unable to defend himself during the sham trial with [...] "the members of the tribunal so drunk that they cannot hear him". As Eckart asserts, [...] "to be captured and tortured without ever knowing why is another horrible feature of a dictatorship. For the victim, reality unexpectedly becomes unreality, no longer comprehensible by a logical mind." [...] Therefore, the use of fear by a dictatorship blurs the line <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> dream for the people being ruled.|$|E
500|$|After reiterating {{their views}} of the {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> literature, Wellek and Warren write that narrative fiction takes place in its own [...] "worlds", consisting of five codeterminant elements: narrative structure, characters, setting, world-view, and tone. The latter two {{are discussed in the}} following chapter. They define the narrative structure as built around a pattern of dialog and description, and various concepts related to narrative; these include time within a work, narrative points of view and voices, major types, plot, devices, and pacing. This is followed by a discussion of characterization, involving modes, types, and typologies, then setting (the environment in a work). This world can serve as a basis for analysis and judgment of a work. Although they focus on the [...] "world" [...] in narrative fiction, drama shares similar aspects.|$|E

500|$|Asturias's {{ambiguous}} use {{of detail}} {{adds to the}} confusion <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> dream. For example, the title pages of parts one and two state that they take place between April 21 and 27. Part three, on the other hand, occurs over [...] "Weeks, Months, Years". While this time-scale initially appears very specific, no year is indicated. Furthermore, the novel {{is set in a}} country similar to Guatemala and includes references to Maya gods (such as in the chapter [...] "Tohil's Dance") but no direct statement by any character confirms this. Bauman argues that Asturias, by [...] "preferring instead to distance himself from the immediate historical reality and focus critical light on the internal problems", attends to what [...] "he sees there". This enables Asturias to address a wider audience, not restricted to Guatemalans, that can relate individually to the experience of living under dictatorial rule.|$|E

500|$|The plot of {{the game}} was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who praised it as horrifying, compelling, and [...] "dark". 1UP.com praised the titular room as constantly maintaining a sense of unease for the player.

500|$|Another {{friend of}} Tripathi, Rashmi Pusalkar, {{designed}} the book cover {{according to his}} specifications, which were to keep a balance <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> fantasy. Hence Pusalkar chose to just portray the back profile of Shiva, {{standing in front of}} a huge lake. Since Pusalkar had never designed any book covers before, she felt that the task was more daunting for her, and explained [...] "Shiva is a human of flesh and blood, he is not a God. The challenge was to show him as vulnerable. I portrayed him from the back, because Indian Gods are never seen from the back. He has battle scars and a sculpted physique." [...] Tripathi wanted the cover to have a symbolic meaning. The scenery behind Shiva's image is taken from Mount Kailash and Mansarovar Lake. He also created a clay model of the broken Pashupati seal, which was later photographed and used in the book inlay. The increasing brightness of the book covers, from the dull colors of The Immortals of Meluha to the bright hue of The Oath of the Vayuputras, signified the triumph of good over evil, according to Tripathi.|$|E
500|$|The {{objective}} of Silent Hill: Origins is to guide player character Travis Grady as he searches the monster-filled town of Silent Hill {{for information about}} a girl he rescues from a burning house.

Typical gameplay of Origins consists of alternating <b>between</b> <b>reality</b> <b>and</b> its darker and dilapidated counterpart, the [...] "Other World", to obtain keys and objects needed to solve a riddle. Travis carries a flashlight and indicates {{the direction of a}} nearby usable item, while his [...] portable radio alerts the player to the presence of nearby monsters by emitting static. Often, actions performed in one dimension will affect the other; for example, raising a prop on the stage in the theater results in a similar reaction in the Other World. Once solved, the riddle leads to an encounter with a boss, whose defeat unlocks a new area. Completion of the game results in unlocking special items or alternative outfits for Travis depending on various accomplishments.|$|E
