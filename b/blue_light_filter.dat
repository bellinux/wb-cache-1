40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} a <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter</b> (BLSF), similar in light spectrum transmittance to the intraocular lens Acrysof NaturalTM, on standard automated perimetry (SAP) and short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP). METHODS: Twenty young individuals (< 30 y. o.), without any systemic or ocular alterations (twenty eyes) underwent a random sequence of four Humphrey visual field tests: standard automated perimetry (SAP) and short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) with and without a <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter.</b> All patients had intraocular pressure lower than 21 mmHg, normal fundus biomicroscopy, and no crystalline lens opacity. Foveal threshold (FT), mean deviation (MD), and pattern standard deviation (PSD) indexes obtained from the visual field tests and the difference caused by eccentricity in short-wavelength automated perimetry examinations were analyzed using paired t test. Interindividual variability (standard deviation) was calculated using Pitman's test for correlated samples. RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in the mean deviation (p< 0. 001) and in the foveal threshold (p< 0. 001) measured by short-wavelength automated perimetry {{with the use of the}} <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter</b> in comparison to short-wavelength automated perimetry without the use of the <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter</b> were observed, but not in standard automated perimetry exams. No other parameters showed statistically significant differences in the short-wavelength automated perimetry and standard automated perimetry tests. Interindividual standard deviation of the test points in the short-wavelength automated perimetry exams increased with eccentricity both with and without the use of the <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter,</b> as sensitivity for inferior and superior hemifields (inferior hemifield minus superior hemifield), but no statistically significant difference in the variability when comparing the use or not of the <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter</b> was noted. When comparing only the four most inferior points and the four most superior points, the inferior-superior difference increases in both situations - without and with the use of the <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter.</b> The difference between without and with the use of the <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter</b> was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Statistically significant reductions in mean deviation and foveal threshold in the short-wavelength automated perimetry with the use of the <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> spectrum <b>filter</b> were observed, but not in standard automated perimetry examinations.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{and composition}} of berry anthocyanin was measured in Vitis vinifera L. cv. Yatomi Rosa using various light qualities provided by polyethylene films (red, orange, green, blue, and white). The anthocyanin has been enhanced significantly by <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> <b>filter</b> film and suppressed by red, orange, and green films compared to white film (control), which suggests that Yatomi Rosa has adapted photoreceptors to UV-A/blue light. We also observed that Yatomi Rosa mainly accumulated glucosides of peonidin (Pn). Significant differences in composition of anthocyanin were observed in different light filter films. Despite the use of different light quality films, similar patterns were observed for phenylalanineammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate- 4 -hydroxylase (C 4 H), 4 -coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (4 CL), and chalcone isomerase (CHI) activities, which are components of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. But the activities of PAL and CHI were induced significantly under <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> <b>filter</b> film, which shows that blue light may increase anthocyanin accumulation in V. vinifera L. by stimulating PAL and CHI activities. The present study confirmed the importance of blue irradiance spectrum in anthocyanin biosynthesis in Yatomi Rosa.

40|$|Lutein and {{zeaxanthin}} are carotenoids that {{accumulate in}} the macula. The macula is a yellow spot {{near the center}} of the retina that is responsible of high resolution vision. Macular pigment acts as a natural <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> <b>filter</b> and protects the eye from damage. Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) increases with lutein administration and is related to visual function and to the prevention of age-related macular degeneration. MOPD can be measured non-invasively and has been related to better cognitive performance. Moreover, compositional analyses of centenarian brains have shown that lutein is the main carotenoid in the brain although not in plasma, indicating a preferential accumulation in neural tissues, and that carotenoids status is correlated with some functional outcomes. Carotenoids are present in human milk with higher concentration in colostrum than in transitional and mature milk. Formula fed-infants have less plasma lutein concentration than breast fed infants. Analyses of brain from infants who died during the first year of life showed that lutein is also the predominant carotenoid of brain. Studies in non-human primates revealed that carotenoids are determinant in the formation of the retinal epithelia. In vitro studies showed that lutein stimulates the differentiation of human stem cells to neural progenitor cells. All this findings together, mostly the presence of lutein in breast milk, plasma concentration in breast-fed infants vs. formula fed infants, preferential accumulation in the brain and evidences of influence on the retina and the functionality of the brain signal the importance of the role of lutein and zeaxanthin on visual maturation and brain development...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} paper compares contrast sensitivity, glare, post-operational visual acuity, independency {{of glasses}} and patient satisfaction of {{three groups of}} patients with regards to three types of interocular lenses: multifocal lenses Acrysof ReSTOR SN 60 D 3 with blue filter (19 patients), aspheric monofocal lenses without blue filter AMO Tecnis Z 9002 (21 patients) and monofocal lenses with <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> <b>filter</b> Alcon AcrySof IQ Aspheric - SN 60 WF (21 patients). The inclusion criterion {{for this study was}} that patients have only a cataract and no pathological ailments. In regards to contrast sensitivity, patients tested with aspheric monofocal lenses with blue filter SN 60 WF had better results than patients with aspheric monofocal lenses without blue filter Z 9002 and with multifocal lenses with blue filter ReSTOR. These differences however were not significant and did not affect patient satisfaction. This study shows that a blue filter can have a positive influence on the contrast sensitivity under photopic and mesopic conditions. Post-operational tests show that, in contrast to most of the patients with monofocal lenses, the patients who had multifocal implants could read without the help of glasses. The potential uncorrected visual acuity of patients of monfocal lenses was very good. The best acuity with correction was good for all patients The success rate of patients who did not need glasses was 6 % by monofocal lenses, however 72 % by multifocal lenses ReSTOR. By almost all cases of monofocal lense implants there was, as expected, a deficit in uncorrected near vision of Nieden 4 and 6. The examination of patients with multifocal lenses ReSTOR made of Acryl with asymmetrical distribution of light proves to be an effective lense, which allows patients, after having a cataract operation to live a “life without glasses. ” Patients who choose this lense type must then be willing to accept that there are some disadvantages, particularly with regards to contrast sensitivity, glare and a small reduction in visual acuity. So, currently, after appropriate consultation, the multifocal blue filter lenses with diffractive optic is considered to be an effective solution to lense replacement in cases of cataracts as well as refractive lense surgery...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Trata-se de um estudo prospectivo, randomizado, duplo-mascarado, envolvendo 52 pacientes portadores de catarata senil bilateral, divididos em dois grupos; 25 pacientes (50 olhos) receberam uma LIO asférica em um olho e uma esférica no olho contralateral; e 27 pacientes (54 olhos) com implante de uma LIO de pigmentação amarela e uma LIO convencional no olho contralateral. O principal resultado do estudo foi a sensibilidade ao contraste e os dados da perimetria azul-amarelo ("mean deviation" [MD] e "pattern standard deviation" [PSD]). Os resultados foram analisados interindividualmente. RESULTADOS: Houve diferença estatística entre os grupos (lentes asféricas e esféricas) na sensibilidade ao contraste em condições fotópicas (12 ciclos por grau) e em condições mesópicas (todas frequências).

40|$|Objective of {{the work}} could be found out primarily, whether the refraktive a {{foldable}} multi-focal lens of the type ARRAY SA 40 N meets the expectations of patients and Ophthalmologen, like eyesight nearby and distance at far-reaching glasses independence. At the same time, it should be checked how far prejudices are justified conditionally {{by the quality of}} earlier multi-focal lens generations such as a dazzling sensitiveness increased post-operatively and perception of visual phenomena. As a comparison group patients were consulted by the type Allergan SI 40 nb to this with Monofokallinsen. The two models are foldable intraocular back chamber lenses of silicone material breaking highly with PMMA-Haptik, a complete diameter of 13 mm and a visual diameter of 6 mm. The multi-focal lenses of the type ARRAY SA 40 N are refraktive silicone multi-focal lenses. They stand out wavy surface of the visual part due to an asphärische. At first the extraction of the patient data was carried out from the operation register of the eye hospital Berlin-Marzahn of the period of 1997 - 2001. The data of the medical files were been in a recording bend and encoded with answers of the questionnaires in a database. In the questionnaire these became post-operative glasses carrying behaviors, light sensations, dazzling sensitiveness as well as includes subjective patient satisfaction. 34 patients got bilateral and 45 patients a multi-focal lens, 56 patients from the consecutively select patients a Monofokallinse unilaterally. The after-control and follow-up treatment was generally carried out with the set up eye specialists. 7. 2 months after the first implantation found a first later check-up of the clinic instead of, a further with 10 patients (17 eyes) after 4. 14 years in connection with the implantation of the art lens at the partner eye on average. The examination on hand shows that the Visus after implantation of the multi-focal lens Array SA 40 N has improved with almost all patients. At the multi-focal lens patients 66. 07 % on the first post-operative day reached an approaching keenness of sight of Nieden 1 and 58. 7 % a keenness of sight of at least 1. 0 in the distance without an additional correction. The implantation of this multi-focal lens led to a good post-operative unkorrigierten Fernvisus comparably with it of Monofokallinsen. Better results were obtained in the local area as expected as the examination points. The patient interview has shown {{that the majority of the}} patients is satisfied with the operation result. Although light sensations which are found disturbing of most patients as little, however, appear post-operatively. The perception of visual phenomena depends on the objective refraction, the Astigma-tismus, the IOL design, the pupil distance and the patient age. The post-operative increase of the dazzling sensitiveness as well as the perception of visual side-effects are negligible for the patient at corresponding clearing up and it therefore turns out that the prejudices are not justified opposite the multi-focal lens of the type ARRAY SA 40 N unlike the multi-focal lenses of earlier generation. The multi-focal intraocular lens used here increases the quality of the visual rehabilitation of the patients after cataract extraction by reducing the necessity of an additional glasses correction. By the use of foldable intraocular lenses and with that small cut technology the post-operative astigmatism is negligible. The advantages of the multi-focal lenses get noticeable for many patients particularly after a bilateral implantation as ours covers examination. The majority of the multi-focal lens straps uses primarily or reading post-operative glasses at longer approaching work. The far zones of ARRAY SA 40 N can be used by reading-glasses for the proximity; what particularly when reading longer than pleasant is found. The majority of the patients has also more than four year after implantation of the multi-focal lens a good Fern and also Nahvisus without correction. They get by largely without glasses, have a good contrast sensitiveness and feel neither increased dazzling nor visual phenomena strongly impaired. Our case idea and also other publications show that the implantation of multi-focal lenses is possible also with younger patients, particularly children. The careful pre-operative patient selection as well as a detailed patient clearing up also on the part of the introducing and giving further treatment eye specialists are imperative for a good result. The patient should know that despite an ideal bio metric objective, a complete renunciation of glasses cannot be always reached. It a certain degree of tolerance of the dazzling phenomena known, appearing post-operatively should also from the patient and halo as well as the contrast perception reduced be found. Extremely critical patients should be warned against multi-focal lenses under circumstances. To be able to obtain a correct visual effect of the lens, a symmetrical Kapselsackfixation is imperative from the surgeon. Moreover, astigmatism as low as possible and post-operative Emmetropie have to be striven which is reached by the use of foldable MIOL and an exact biometrics. The stake of the IOL Masters has proved itself very much. The foldable multi-focal lens ARRAY SA 40 N used by us here has several focal lengths and provides with a sharp eyesight in a different distance by the fluent transition of 5 refraktiven zones. At the time of the assessment it was the only multi-focal lens with FDA admission. Further operative proceedings for the correction of the presbyopia which partly are in the experimental stage still are akkommodierende intraocular lenses, magnetically movable intraocular lenses or the replacement of the cloudy lens by "Lens refilling". The so-called akkommodativen lenses are not, however, an actual alternative to the multi-focal lens due to the too low accommodation breadth at present. The method of the "Lens refilling" is still immature by the inaccurate precomputation of the lens size, the bend radii and the refracting power. The sum of our results and the literature enquiry show that the multi-focal lens used by us is a good alternative to the Monofokallinse under strict consideration of the selection criteria which contributes to the improvement on the quality of life. The newest generation of multi-focal lenses seems to compensate for the known disadvantages by the additional asphärische surface, the amplified approaching part of+ 4. 0 diopters, the dependence on pupildiameter lenweitenunabhängikeit, the sharp optics edge, flashing <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> <b>filter</b> as well as apodisierung in a certain measure...|$|E

More-subtle filters are needed to correct for the difference between, say 3200K and 3400K tungsten lamps or to correct for the slightly blue cast of some flash tubes, which may be 6000K.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} sum data rate that a Visible Light Communication (VLC) system with {{multiple}} users can achieve when phosphor-converted white LED panels {{are used to}} provide illumination and communication simultaneously. Three different transmission schemes based on Asymmetrically Clipped Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) are considered to allocate the communication resources in each transmission point: Frequency Reuse (FR), Joint Transmission Coordinated Multi-Point (JT-CoMP), and a Hybrid combination of them. Since phosphor-converted white LEDs have a larger modulation bandwidth for blue optical wavelengths rather than green-yellow-red ones, the performance of each transmission method is also evaluated using a visible and/or <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> optical <b>filter</b> {{in front of the}} Photodetector (PD). When the transmission points apply FR, strong inter-cell interference results in high variability of the achievable data rate at different locations. On the other hand, when JT-CoMP is applied, a more homogeneous data rate coverage is achieved, reducing the peak data rate in the inner parts of the cells but improving notably the data rate in cell-edge areas...|$|R

The majority shows the band performing the song against a white backdrop with smoke flowing along the ground.

40|$|We {{are testing}} our {{hypothesis}} that reduced <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> transmission in the retina causes circadian rhythm disturbances {{among the elderly}} with blue-yellow color blindness (tritanopia). Circadian rhythms are regulated by melanopsin, a molecule in the eye that captures <b>blue</b> <b>light.</b> Yellow lenses <b>filter</b> out the amount of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> reaching the retina, and a study by Pokorny et al., (1987) has shown that our lenses yellow as we age, therefore {{there may be a}} higher incidence of yellow lens in the elderly (Pokorny, Smith 2 ̆ 6 Lutze, 1987). This has been shown to cause sleep disturbances (Kessel, Siganos, Jørgensen 2 ̆ 6 Larsen, 2011). We want to know if tritanopia (blue-yellow colorblindness) might further disrupt circadian rhythms, beyond that due to lens yellowing. The reduced stimulation of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> to the ipRGC 2 ̆ 7 s has also been shown in species of fish, Aequidens pulcher, Labeotropheus fuelleborni (Pauers et al., 2012), humans and macaque monkeys 2 ̆ 7 retina (anatomically not behaviorally) (Dacey et al., 2005) to disrupt circadian rhythms. Tritanopia is caused by malfunctioning blue cones and evidence shows that in addition to melanopsin, the cone system also regulates circadian rhythms (Pauers et al., 2012; Dacey et al., 2005). Participants will be tested for tritanopia using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 -hue test. If the participant is believed to be tritanopic a saliva sample will be taken for DNA verification of tritanopia. Lens yellowing will be estimated by determining blue-yellow heterochromatic flicker luminance ratios in the fovea and 15 ° in the periphery. Data collection is underway...|$|R
40|$|Concept of {{transparent}} welding curtains made {{of heavy}} duty vinyl originated with David F. Wilson, President of Wilson Sales Company. In 1968, Wilson's curtains reduced glare of welding arc and blocked ultraviolet radiation. When later research uncovered <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> hazards, Wilson sought improvement of his products. He contracted Dr. Charles G. Miller and James B. Stephens, both of Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and {{they agreed to}} undertake development of a curtain capable of filtering out harmful irradiance, including ultraviolet and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> and provide protection over {{a broad range of}} welding operation. Working on their own time, the JPL pair spent 3 years developing a patented formula that includes <b>light</b> <b>filtering</b> dyes and small particles of zinc oxide. The result was the Wilson Spectra Curtain...|$|R
40|$|Light quality and, in particular, {{its content}} of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> is {{involved}} in plant functioning and morphogenesis. <b>Blue</b> <b>light</b> variation frequently occurs within a stand as shaded zones are characterized by a simultaneous decrease of PAR and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> levels which both affect plant functioning, for example, gas exchange. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of low <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> itself on gas exchange. The aims of the present study were (i) to characterize stomatal behaviour in Festuca arundinacea leaves through leaf gas exchange measurements in response to a sudden reduction in <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> and (ii) to test the putative role of Ci on <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> gas exchange responses. An infrared gas analyser (IRGA) was used with <b>light</b> transmission <b>filters</b> to study stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (Tr), assimilation (A), and intercellular concentration of CO 2 (Ci) responses to blueless PAR (1. 80 μmol m− 2 s− 1). The results were compared with those obtained under a neutral filter supplying a similar photosynthetic efficiency to the blueless PAR filter. It was shown that the reduction of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> triggered a drastic and instantaneous decrease of gs by 43. 2 % and of Tr by 40. 0 %, but a gradual stomatal reopening began 20 min after the start of the low <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> treatment, thus leading to new steady-states. This new stomatal equilibrium was supposed to be related to Ci. The results were confirmed in more developed plants although they exhibited delayed and less marked responses. It is concluded that stomatal responses to <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> could play a key role in photomorphogenetic mechanisms through their effect on transpiration...|$|R

Our data suggest that <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> is significantly more effective than true light. Surprisingly the association of true <b>light</b> with <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> is significantly more effective than both true <b>light</b> and <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> separately. The greater effectiveness associated with the better tolerance of true <b>light</b> + <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> respect to <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> only, makes it preferable than phototherapy regimen, even if more extensive study on its effectiveness and on {{short and long term}} side effects are need...|$|R
25|$|The most {{difficult}} {{task for the}} special effects artists to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation - to make {{the interaction between the}} humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, than running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing {{the other part of the}} frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte. The Dunning process, invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of <b>blue</b> and yellow <b>lighting,</b> <b>filtered</b> and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera. It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.|$|R
50|$|Light is {{transmitted}} to the retina through the lens. In humans, the amount of light transmitted by the lens is age-dependent. In young children, more than 65% of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> {{is transmitted}}. This transmission rate decreases over time; at age 25, only 20% of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> is {{transmitted to the}} retina. The decreased transmission of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> occurs as our eye’s lens naturally yellows and absorbs more <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> over time, thus preventing <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> from reaching the retina. As {{a result of this}} natural process, younger people are more susceptible to the effects of <b>blue</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
40|$|Although many {{fundamental}} <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> responses {{have been}} identified, <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> dose-response curves {{are not well}} characterized. We studied the growth and development of soybean, wheat and lettuce plants under high-pressure sodium (HPS) and metal halide (MH) lamps with yellow filters creating five fractions of <b>blue</b> <b>light.</b> The <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> fractions obtained were < 0. 1, 2 and 6 % under HPS lamps, and 6, 12 and 26 % under MH lamps. Studies utilizing both lamp types were done at two photosynthetic photon flux levels, 200 and 500 mumol m- 2 s- 1 under a 16 h photoperiod. Phytochrome photoequilibria was nearly identical among treatments. The <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> effect on dry mass, stem length, leaf area, specific leaf area and tillering/branching was species dependent. For these parameters, wheat {{did not respond to}} <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> but lettuce was highly sensitive to <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> fraction between 0 and 6 % blue. Soybean stem length decreased and leaf area increased up to 6 % blue, but total dry mass was unchanged. The <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> fraction determined the stem elongation response in soybean, whereas the absolute amount of <b>blue</b> <b>light</b> determined the stem elongation response in lettuce. The data indicate that lettuce growth and development requires <b>blue</b> <b>light,</b> but soybean and wheat may not...|$|R
