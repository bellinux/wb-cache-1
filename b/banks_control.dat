50|$|Richard and Emily {{are forced}} {{back into the}} arena, where they are pitted against an {{intelligent}} hunter. Emily provides a distraction while Richard tracks and kills their opponent—which {{turns out to be}} mechanical as well. As another, larger killer enters the arena, Richard finally deduces the purpose of the tests; they are being assessed as suitable targets for the hunters in the safari park. Meanwhile, the sailors catapult their explosive fungus at the citadel until two saucer probes arrive to investigate, and the Phiadorans capture them, enabling the Doctor to deactivate the remote controls and rewire them so the British can fly them manually. Turlough leads the flight to {{what appears to be a}} greenhouse dome, where, just as he has read in the diary, he crashes through the glass dome and crushes the robot hunter, saving Richard and Emily’s lives. The sailors then fight their way to the warden, and the TARDIS’ influence enables the Doctor to speak with it. The warden is as much a prisoner as the others, having been genetically and mentally conditioned to keep the park running properly. It is unable to disobey orders directly, but it is weary of its long servitude, and therefore shows the Doctor which computer <b>banks</b> <b>control</b> the robots. The British sailors destroy them, and as the robots shut down, the warden allows itself to die as well, its task finally complete.|$|E

40|$|A {{consensus}} {{now exists}} that central banks, which possess a monopoly over {{the creation of}} fiat money (the monetary base), control trend inflation. But how do they exercise this control, especially given that {{their use of the}} interest rate as the policy instrument renders money endogenous (determined by market forces) ? This paper considers two alternatives. First, central <b>banks</b> <b>control</b> inflation through the way that they manipulate the unemployment rate (subject to a trade-off between changes in inflation and the amount of excess unemployment as summarized in a Phillips curve). Second, and alternatively, central <b>banks</b> <b>control</b> inflation by following consistent procedures that combine two characteristics. Through their consistency, these procedures provide for a nominal anchor by causing the public to expect low trend inflation that is stable in the sense of being unaffected by inflation and recession shocks. Also, they allow the price system to work in the sense of allowing market forces to determine real variables such as the unemployment rate. Monetary policy; Inflation (Finance) ...|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{information}} technology and bank consolidation have altered the way banks operate by necessitating that <b>banks</b> <b>control</b> costs and provide services efficiently to remain competitive. Given the unique role bank operations play in the transmission of monetary policy, a key unresolved question is whether bank efficiency alters monetary policy outcomes.

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} Please do not quote without permission We document that at business cycle frequency, nominal variables, such as aggregate price levels and nominal interest rates, are more correlated across countries than real output. Since national central <b>banks</b> <b>control</b> the domestic money supply and their objective {{has been to}} keep the nominal environment stable this might seem puzzling. We ask whether a simple, transparent standard international business cycle model can account for these nominal {{as well as the}} real aspects of international business cycles. It can. Due to spillovers of technology shocks across countries, responses of national central banks to fluctuations in domestic output and inflation generate responses of prices and interest rates that are synchronized across countries even when output is not. Even modest spillovers produce correlations like those in the data...|$|E

40|$|In {{each country}} {{the central bank}} is a privately owned bank with no {{transparency}} and accountability {{to the government of}} that country. It is also the only bank that can print the money for that country and does it so out of thin air. At the same time this bank wants that the government returns the money with interest. We show that this structure creates deficit, introduces tax, and causes poverty around the globe. This paper shows how central <b>banks</b> <b>control</b> the economy by manipulating the financial system it has designed.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} potential {{impacts of}} banks' leverage on their incentives {{to manage their}} liquidity.

In the basic framework, a model with a single bank, where the possibility of selling long-term assets when in need of liquidity is not taken into account, {{we find that the}} bank chooses to prudently manage its liquidity risk only when its leverage is low. In a model with multiple banks and a secondary market for long-term assets, we find that a banking system where banks are highly leveraged can be prone to liquidity crises. Our model predicts a typical pattern of liquidity crises that is consistent with what was observed during the 2007 - 2009 crisis...|$|E
