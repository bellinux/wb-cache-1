40|$|Expertise {{stemming}} from the psy disciplines is increasingly and explicitly shaping international development policy and practice. Whilst some policy makers see the use of psy expertise as {{a new way to}} reduce poverty, increase economic efficiency, and promote wellbeing, others raise concerns that psychocentric development promotes individual over structural change, pathologises poverty, and depoliticises development. This paper specifically analyses four aspects of psy knowledge used in contemporary development policy: child development/developmental <b>psychology,</b> <b>behavioural</b> economics, positive <b>psychology,</b> and global mental health. This analysis illuminates the co-constitutive intellectual and colonial histories of development and psy-expertise: a connection that complicates claims that development has been psychologized; the uses and coloniality of both within a neoliberal project; and the potential for psychopolitics to inform development. ...|$|R

50|$|Cartographers {{must learn}} {{cognitive}} psychology and ergonomics to understand which symbols convey {{information about the}} Earth most effectively, and <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychology</b> to induce the readers of their maps {{to act on the}} information.

50|$|Intensive Interaction was {{developed}} during the 1980s by teachers working in schools in long-stay hospitals in southern England. The development of the approach came about {{partly as a result}} of practitioners questing for effective teaching approaches and partly as a reaction to and move away from the dominance of <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychology</b> in the field. A psychologist, the late Geraint Ephraim, working at Leavesden Mental Hospital, propounded the original formulation of techniques known then as ‘Augmented Mothering’. The detailed development work carried out at Harperbury Hospital School resulted in the first research projects and publications by Melanie Nind and Dave Hewett.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the outset}} of {{cognitive}} behavioural therapy during the 1950s, hypnosis was used by early behaviour therapists such as Joseph Wolpe and also by early cognitive therapists such as Albert Ellis. Barber, Spanos, and Chaves introduced the term [...] "cognitive-behavioural" [...] to describe their [...] "nonstate" [...] theory of hypnosis in Hypnosis, imagination, and human potentialities. However, Clark L. Hull had introduced a <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychology</b> {{as far back as}} 1933, which in turn was preceded by Ivan Pavlov. Indeed, the earliest theories and practices of hypnotism, even those of Braid, resemble the cognitive-behavioural orientation in some respects.|$|E
50|$|Planners are {{increasingly}} expected {{to adopt a}} multidisciplinary approach, especially due to the rising importance of environmentalism. For example, the use of <b>behavioural</b> <b>psychology</b> to persuade drivers to abandon their automobiles and use public transport instead. The role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies. For example, in Hanoi, {{the increasing number of}} motorcycles is responsible for not only environmental damage but also slowing down economic growth. In the long run, the plan is to reduce traffic through a change in urban planning. Through economic incentives and attractive alternatives experts hope to lighten traffic in the short run.|$|E

40|$|Policies {{explicitly}} {{aimed at}} changing people‟s behaviour and recasting state-citizen relations are becoming {{prevalent in the}} UK. New political rationalities of „co-production‟, „personalisation ‟ and „soft ‟ or „libertarian paternalism ‟ seek to cultivate {{a relationship between the}} adaptive state and the active citizen which is increasingly pedagogical. Informing these new pedagogies of governing is research from <b>behavioural</b> economics, <b>psychology</b> and the neurosciences, from which policy strategists draw insights aimed at improving the effectiveness of behaviour-changing interventions across a range of policy spheres. This paper develops perspectives from feminist economics, critical psychology and feminist political theory in order to demonstrate how such research offers a gendered account of human behaviour and thus is used to assert a conversely gender-blind explanation of the legitimate role of the state in governing through behaviour change...|$|R
