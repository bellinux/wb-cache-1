40|$|Context. Propagating {{disturbances}} of the EUV emission intensity {{are commonly}} observed over {{a variety of}} coronal structures. Parameters of these disturbances, particularly the observed apparent (image-plane projected) propagation speed, are important tools for MHD coronal seismology. Aims. We design and test tools to reliably measure the apparent phase speed of propagating disturbances in imaging data sets. Methods. We designed cross-fitting technique (CFT), 2 D coupled fitting (DCF) and best similarity match (BSM) to measure the apparent phase speed of propagating EUV disturbances in the running differences of time-distance plots (R) and <b>background-removed</b> and normalised time-distance plots (D). Results. The methods were applied {{to the analysis of}} quasi-periodic EUV disturbances propagating at a coronal fan-structure of active region NOAA 11330 on 27 Oct. 2011, observed with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO in the 171 Å bandpass. The noise propagation in the AIA image processing was estimated, resulting in the preliminary estimation of the uncertainties in the AIA image flux. This information was used in measuring the apparent phase speed of the propagating disturbances with the CFT, DCF and BSM methods, which gave consistent results. The average projected speed is measured at 47. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 6 [*]km[*]s- 1 and 49. 0 [*]±[*] 0. 7 [*]km[*]s- 1 for R and D, with the corresponding periods at 179. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 2 [*]s and 179. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 3 [*]s, respectively. We analysed the effects of the lag time and the detrending time in the running difference processing and the <b>background-removed</b> plot, on the measurement of the speed, and found that they are fairly weak. Conclusions. The CFT, DCF and BSM methods are found to be reliable techniques for measuring the apparent (projected) phase speed. The samples of larger effective spatial length are more suitable for these methods. Time-distance plots with background removal and normalisation allow for more robust measurements, with little effect of the choice of the detrending time. Cross-fitting technique provides reliable measurements on good samples (e. g. samples with large effective detection length and recurring features). 2 D coupled-fitting is found {{to be sensitive to the}} initial guess for parameters of the 2 D fitting function. Thus DCF is only optimised in measuring one of the parameters (the phase speed in our application), while the period is poorly measured. Best similarity measure is robust for all types of samples and very tolerant to image pre-processing and regularisation (smoothing) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Methods {{of manual}} cell {{localization}} and outlining are so onerous that automated tracking methods would seem mandatory for handling huge image sequences, nevertheless manual tracking is, astonishingly, still widely practiced {{in areas such}} as cell biology which are outside the influence of most image processing research. The goal of our research is to address this gap by developing automated methods of cell tracking, localization, and segmentation. Since even an optimal frame-to-frame association method cannot compensate and recover from poor detection, {{it is clear that the}} quality of cell tracking depends on the quality of cell detection within each frame. Methods Cell detection performs poorly where the background is not uniform and includes temporal illumination variations, spatial non-uniformities, and stationary objects such as well boundaries (which confine the cells under study). To improve cell detection, the signal to noise ratio of the input image can be increased via accurate background estimation. In this paper we investigate background estimation, for the purpose of cell detection. We propose a cell model and a method for background estimation, driven by the proposed cell model, such that well structure can be identified, and explicitly rejected, when estimating the background. Results The resulting <b>background-removed</b> images have fewer artifacts and allow cells to be localized and detected more reliably. The experimental results generated by applying the proposed method to different Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) image sequences are quite promising. Conclusion The understanding of cell behavior relies on precise information about the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of cells. Such information may play a key role in disease research and regenerative medicine, so automated methods for observation and measurement of cells from microscopic images are in high demand. The proposed method in this paper is capable of localizing single cells in microwells and can be adapted for the other cell types that may not have circular shape. This method can be potentially used for single cell analysis to study the temporal dynamics of cells. </p...|$|E
