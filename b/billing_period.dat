Ezarik's video focused on the unnecessary waste of paper, as the detailed bill itemized all data transfers made during the <b>billing</b> <b>period,</b> including every email and text message.

2500|$|In 2010 during Rubio's senate campaign, {{and again}} in 2015 during his presidential campaign, issues were raised {{by the media and}} his {{political}} opponents about some items charged by Rubio to his Republican Party of Florida American Express card during his time as House speaker. Rubio charged about $110,000 during those two years, of which $16,000 was personal expenses unrelated to party business, such as groceries and plane tickets. Rubio said that he personally paid American Express more than $16,000 for these personal expenses. In 2012, the Florida Commission on Ethics cleared Rubio of wrongdoing in his use of the party-issued credit card, although the commission inspector said that Rubio exhibited a [...] "level of negligence" [...] in not using his personal MasterCard.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I explore {{two aspects}} of the economics of energy. The first focuses on consumer behavior, while the second focuses on market structure and firm behavior. In the first chapter, I demonstrate evidence of loss aversion {{in the behavior of}} households on two critical peak pricing experimental tariffs while participating in the California Statewide Pricing Pilot. I develop a model of loss aversion over electricity expenditure from which I derive two sets of testable predictions. First, I show that when there is a higher probability that a household is in the loss domain of their value function for the <b>bill</b> <b>period,</b> the more strongly they cut back peak consumption. Second, when prices are such that households are close to the kink in their value function - and would otherwise have expenditure skewed into the loss domain - I show evidence of disproportionate clustering at the kink. In essence this means that the occurrence of critical peak days did not only result in a reduction of peak consumption on that day, but also spilled over to further reduction of peak consumption on regular peak days for several weeks thereafter. This was similarly true when temperatures were high during high priced periods. This form of demand adjustment resulted in households experiencing bill-period expenditures equal to what they would have paid on the standard non-dynamic pricing tariff at a disproportionate rate. This higher number of <b>bill</b> <b>periods</b> with equal expenditure displaced <b>bill</b> <b>periods</b> in which they otherwise would have paid more than if they were on standard pricing. In the second chapter, I explore the effects of two simultaneous changes in minimum energy efficiency and Energy Star standards for clothes washers. Adapting the Mussa and Rosen (1978) and Ronnen (1991) second-degree price discrimination model, I demonstrate that clothes washer prices and menus adjusted to the new standards in patterns consistent with a market in which firms had been price discriminating. In particular, I show evidence of discontinuous price drops at the time the standards were imposed, driven largely by mid low efficiency segments of the market. The price discrimination model predicts this result. On the other hand, under perfect competition, prices should increase for these market segments. Additionally, new models proliferated in the highest efficiency market segment following the standard changes. Finally, I show that firms appeared to use different adaptation strategies at the two instances of the standards changing...|$|R

40|$|Based {{on panel}} {{data from the}} City of Davis, California, {{comprising}} more than 15, 000 urban water consumption units and 81 <b>billing</b> <b>periods</b> over 13 years, this study investigates residential water demand {{and the effectiveness of}} three structural water conservation measures. The city switched from a uniform to an increasing block pricing scheme, introduced a second tariff block for single-family residential households, and changed the calculation logic for the household sewer rate. An instrumental fixed effects regression analysis results in a price elasticity of - 0. 19 for residential consumers. The data also suggests that all structural tariff adjustments were effective, even under consideration of the general economic situation. This is the first study which demonstrates the effectiveness of coupling the sewer rate with a proxy for indoor water consumption on a household level...|$|R

50|$|An {{electrical}} load (e.g. a lamp, TV-set, or electric motor) has a rated power, {{which is usually}} measured in watts. This is its running power level, which equates to the instantaneous rate at which energy must be generated and consumed to run the device. The amount of energy that is consumed (at that rate) depends on how long the device is operated. However, its power requirement is constant while running. The unit of energy used for residential electrical billing, the kilowatt hour, shows the cumulative amount of electrical energy used during the <b>billing</b> <b>period,</b> regardless of the power drawn at any moment during the <b>billing</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{systems are}} inevitably {{affected}} by power losses, mainly {{due to the}} current flowing through lines and transformers. Currents depend on end-users' power absorption and are strictly related to the overall power factor, resulting from loads, compensating units and distributed generation. The power factor management has a great influence on network power losses and voltage profiles along distribution lines. In the past, before the distributed generation diffusion, the network losses minimization could be obtained by requiring a high average power factor to end-users, evaluating the parameter on the <b>bill</b> <b>period.</b> Differently, nowadays the power factor management for active users is requiring different rules, since the previous statement is no longer valid. The paper investigates inconsistences between local generation and present power factor requirements in the Italian context. Considerations about sizing compensating devices are introduced, {{in accordance with the}} recent evolution of connection codes. Losses are compared considering different reference power factors, local generation amount and generators' connection topologies.

Methods: For the first question, we applied 5 classification algorithms (decision tree, artificial neural network, logistic regression, Bayesian networks, and Naïve Bayes) and the stacking-bagging method for building classification models. To solve the second question, we performed sequential pattern analysis. Results: We determined: 1) In general, the most influential variables which impact whether a patient of a public healthcare center will revisit it or not are personal burden, insurance <b>bill,</b> <b>period</b> of prescription, age, systolic pressure, name of disease, and postal code. 2) The best plain classification model {{is dependent on the}} dataset. 3) Based on average of classification accuracy, the proposed stacking-bagging method outperformed all traditional classification models and our sequential pattern analysis revealed 16 sequential patterns.
