40|$|This Article {{considers}} the constitutional status of mandatory partisan <b>balance</b> <b>requirements</b> for presidential appointments to independent federal agencies. Since the 1880 s, Congress routinely has included partisan <b>balance</b> <b>requirements,</b> along with fixed {{terms of office}} and “good cause” limitations on the President’s removal power, as standard design elements in its template for independent federal agencies. Until recently, both federal courts and most legal scholars have assumed the constitutionality of such restrictions on the President’s appointment power—and with good reason, given the ubiquity of partisan <b>balance</b> <b>requirements</b> and the executive branch’s historical acquiescence to them. However, the Supreme Court’s decision in Free Enterprise Fund threatens to upend this well-settled consensus; the decision squarely holds that Congress may not unduly attenuate the President’s power to supervise and control executive branch entities—including independent agencies—without violating {{the separation of powers}} doctrine. In this Article, we posit that partisan <b>balance</b> <b>requirements,</b> at least when used in conjunction with fixed terms of office and good cause removal limitations, create a problem of at least equal magnitude to the problem identified in Free Enterprise Fund (namely, unduly insulating executive officers with policymaking authority via a two-tiered good cause removal limitation). Under the logic of Free Enterprise Fund, requiring the President to appoint political opponents to principal offices within the executive branch, and then prohibiting the President from removing such appointees except for good cause, unduly compromises the President’s ability to supervise and control these agencies. Although Humphrey’s Executor settled the constitutional status of good cause limits on the President’s removal power for principal officers serving on independent federal agencies, Free Enterprise Fund’s broadly formalist reading of the Vesting and Faithful Execution Clauses strongly suggests that the combination of a partisan <b>balance</b> <b>requirement</b> with a good cause removal limit constitutes a bridge too far in the age of new formalism...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{extension}} of the capacitated single-allocation hub location problem is considered in which the capacity of the hubs is part of the decision making process and <b>balancing</b> <b>requirements</b> are imposed on the network. The decisions to be made comprise (i) the selection of the hubs, (ii) the allocation of the spoke nodes to the hubs, (iii) the flow distribution through the sub network defined by the hubs and (iv) the capacity level at which each hub should operate. In the latter case, for each potential hub, a set of available capacities is considered among which one can be chosen. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which includes the setup cost for the hubs as well as the flow routing cost. Economies of scale are assumed for the costs. <b>Balancing</b> <b>requirements</b> are imposed to the network. In particular, a value is considered for the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum number of spoke nodes that are allocated to the hubs. Two mixed-integer linear programming formulations are proposed and analyzed for this problem. The results of a set of computational experiments using an off-the-shelf commercial solver are presented. These tests aim at evaluate the possibility of solving the problem to optimality using such a solver with a particular emphasis to the impact of the <b>balancing</b> <b>requirements.</b> The tests also allow an analysis of the gap of the bounds provided by linear relaxation...|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{applications}} are diverse {{in terms of}} the resource requirements, and tend to vary significantly from commercial applications. In order to provide sustained performance, a target high performance computing (HPC) platform must offer a balance between CPU performance to memory, interconnect and I/O subsystems performance. We characterize the system <b>balance</b> <b>requirements</b> for two largescale Office of Science applications, GYRO (fusion simulation) and POP (climate modeling), and develop platformindependent parameterized requirement models. We measure the parallel efficiencies for GYRO and POP on three multiprocessor systems: an SMP cluster (IBM p 690), a shared-memory system (SGI Altix) and a vector supercomputer (Cray X 1). The higher computational intensity and interconnect bandwidth requirements of GYRO result in higher performance efficiencies on the vector platform. At the same time, small message sizes in POP benefit from low MPI latencies of the shared-memory platform. Overall results confirm system <b>balance</b> <b>requirements</b> that are generated by the requirement models. 1...|$|R

Load balancing, has a considerable effect on the grid middleware performance. Current load balancing methods cannot satisfy all necessities for the grid.

Cooperation among different levels in this method, removes disadvantages of each level, while satisfy most of load <b>balancing</b> <b>requirements</b> needed. Simulation results indicate that this new mechanism surpasses its predecessors in increasing effi-ciency and decreasing communication overhead. ...|$|E
