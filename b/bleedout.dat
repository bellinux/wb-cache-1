50|$|Vogster has {{partnered with}} American comic book company Archaia {{to expand on}} the new <b>Bleedout</b> storyline. Together, they {{released}} the Bleedout: The Graphic Novel which featured the artwork of the illustrators that have worked on the <b>Bleedout</b> campaign within CrimeCraft. It will has a similar pattern as the <b>Bleedout</b> expansion. Artists each contribute their own stylized illustrations to a separate chapter of the novel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bleedout</b> is {{the first}} {{legitimate}} expansion for CrimeCraft and was released in autumn 2010.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bleedout</b> {{campaign}} was broken up into episodes that were released weekly for ten weeks. These episodes {{have a set}} of missions, as well as art done by illustrators in the comic book industry. Each episode will progress through {{a small part of the}} <b>Bleedout</b> storyline and will be free to subscribed players. There will be a small fee for each episode for those players who do not have subscriptions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bleedout</b> is {{her first}} thriller. She started writing crime fiction during a legal battle over fumes from a nearby {{shoemaker}} from which she won a large settlement. <b>Bleedout</b> takes place {{against a backdrop of}} political and corporate corruption and follows two men, one a murderer, another his mentor {{in the process of being}} murdered as the action progresses. Its sequel Venom, published in 2010, introduces the theme of pharmaceutical ruthlessness in pursuit of a cure for radiation poisoning.|$|E
50|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons, the lancea {{was tested}} against the Persian spear. The lancea {{went through a}} pig carcass when it was thrown as a javelin while the Persian spear killed two human-shaped targets {{from the back of}} a chariot. The first target was stabbed in the nape of the neck, piercing the carotid artery and the jugular vein and causing death by rapid <b>bleedout.</b> The second target was stabbed directly in the heart and drug behind the chariot for several feet. The edge was given to the Persian spear since it was not a disposable missile weapon, like the lancea, and had a thinner tip to facilitate deeper penetration.|$|E
5000|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons, the Aztec Jaguar's maquahuitl {{took the}} edge over the Zande Warrior's makrigga. The maquahuitl was tested on a ballistic gel horse head, {{in which the}} head was sawed-off using three strikes. It is {{pointed out that the}} maquahuitl inflicted tearing wounds as opposed to cutting wounds; with the former causing greater <b>bleedout.</b> Shards of obsidian were embedded in the gel, indicating the weapon would cause more damage if it hit. For the makrigga, the weapon was tested on a 300-poundpiece of beef filled with animal blood and entrails. The weapon went through the beef, and with the weapon's spiked barbs pulled out entrails when it was pulled out. The maquahuitl, nicknamed [...] "the obsidian chainsaw" [...] by Geiger, was given the edge due to its greater destructive power.|$|E
5000|$|Series creator Hoang Nguyen first {{conceived}} {{of the series}} in 2002, inspired by a sketch he had drawn of a young female soldier. He began developing the concept further in his spare time, recruiting writer Mike Kennedy (Lone Wolf 2100, Superman: Infinite City, <b>Bleedout)</b> to help flesh out the story. Soon after, artist Khari Evans (Daughters of the Dragon, Thor, Harbinger) joined the project as Principal Artist. Nguyen, Evans and Kennedy are together credited as co-creators. Nguyen found Malaysian painter and colorist Kinsun Loh through online art forum CGTalk, and described {{the results of a}} test piece he produced as [...] "spectacular". With Mike Kennedy tied up on other projects Nguyen approached writer Paul Gardner (Afro Samurai, Splatterhouse) to revise the storyline and write the script. The book was picked up by Image Comics at the 2010 WonderCon in San Francisco, after artist Jimmy Palmiotti introduced Nguyen to Image Comics Publisher Eric Stephenson. The first issue shipped in March 2011.|$|E
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, the Celtic long sword {{was tested}} against the sagaris. The long sworddecapitated a gel torso in three hits at 74 mph, {{breaking through the}} spinal cord on the first swing and through the cheekbone on the second swing. Tested against the Persian Immortal's armor, the long sword struck off metal scales with a force of 280 psi, enough to break a rib behind the armor. It cut a gel head through the nose and to the brain {{from the back of}} a chariot. With the pick end of the sagaris, Cyrus Zahiri penetrated a ballistics gel torso multiple times, visually breaking through several ribs and puncturing the bottom portion of the heart, causing a very rapid death by <b>bleedout.</b> The sagaris also punctured a curve in the upper intenstine, causing waste matter to openly spill into the interior of the abdomen, causing a septic death. Later, the sagaris was tested against a dummy wearing Celtic armor; an iron coolus helmet(with a pressure sensor attached to the head beneath), a large leather belt, and an iron-rimmed wooden shield. The Persian Immortal expert used the sagaris as a fulcrum to pull away the shield, punctured the coolus helmet with the pick end(penetrating the frontal lobe of the brain and generating a force of over 323 psi), stabbed the naked torso, and punctured the leather belt. However, the sagaris only managed to inflict a flesh wound beneath the leather belt, and took several seconds to be removed. The edge was given to the long sword for its faster recovery time.|$|E
40|$|Bleeding of {{epoxy resin}} around {{surfaces}} undergoing bonding during electronic packaging assembly has long caused sporadic yield loss. Previously, {{it was thought}} that vacuum baking reduced the yield loss resulting from surface contaminants. Although vacuum baking inhibits epoxy resin bleeding, it also produces coatings of hydrocarbons, which affect surface wettability and surface energy. Surfactant coating results in a surface chemistry similar to vacuum-baked substrates but is a better alternative because of its controllability. Epoxy bleeding is commonly observed in electronic packages around silicon chips attached with epoxy resin to substrates having gold or other metal surfaces. In severe cases, the bleeding contaminates the wire bond pads, causing failure. The effects of bleeding are often critical in advanced packaging components such as ceramic pin grid array (CPGA) substrates. In particular, when there is very little clearance between a bond finger tier and the die, minor resin <b>bleedout</b> can interfere with wire bondability. During the time that CPGA technology has been used here at HP’s Integrated Circuit Business Division in Singapore, we have experienced sporadic yield loss caused by epoxy bleeding. This is known to be an industry-wide problem. For several years the cause of the yield loss was unresolved. With increasing pin count and decreasing clearance between the die and the substrate cavity, resolving the problem has become more urgent. Earlier studies 1 led us to resort to countermeasures like vacuum baking to reduce yield losses. However, the studies were not comprehensive enough to verify the effectiveness of vacuum baking, and yield losses have continued to occur from time to time for no apparent reason. We had not yet investigated the possibility that surface contamination, resulting from vacuum baking, can hav...|$|E
40|$|Although endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) -induced organ {{hypoperfusion}} after trauma-hemorrhage {{is improved}} by estrogen administration, {{it remains unclear}} whether estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes play any role in the attenuation of ET- 1 -induced vasoconstriction in any specific organ bed. To investigate this, isolated perfusion experiments in the heart, liver, small intestine, kidney, and lung were carried out in sham, {{at the time of}} maximum <b>bleedout</b> (MBO; i. e., 5 -cm midline incision, with removal of 60 % of circulating blood volume over 45 min to maintain a mean blood pressure of 40 mmHg), and 2 h after trauma-hemorrhage and resuscitation (T-H/R). Organ-specific ET- 1 -induced vasoconstriction was evaluated, and the effects of 17 β-estradiol (E 2) and ER-specific agonists propylpyrazole triol (PPT; ERα agonist) and diarylpropionitrile (DPN; ERβ agonist) were determined. ET- 1 induced the greatest vasoconstriction in sham animals, with the strongest response in the kidneys, followed by the small intestine and liver. ET- 1 -induced responses were weakest in the heart and lungs. ET- 1 -induced vasoconstriction was evident at the time of MBO but was significantly decreased at 2 h after T-H/R. ERβ {{plays an important role in}} cardiac performance, as evidenced by improved heart performance (+dP/dt) in the presence of DPN. DPN also induced a greater effect than PPT in the reduction of ET- 1 -induced vasoconstriction in the kidneys and lungs. In contrast, PPT attenuated ET- 1 -induced vasoconstriction in the liver, whereas both DPN and PPT were equally effective in the small intestine. The increased +dP/dt values induced by E 2, DPN, or PPT were evident at the time of MBO but were significantly decreased at 2 h after T-H/R. These data indicate that the effects of ET- 1 on vasoconstriction and the role of ER subtypes in estrogen-induced vasorelaxation are organ specific and temporally specific after trauma-hemorrhage...|$|E
