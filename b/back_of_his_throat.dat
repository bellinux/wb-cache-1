500|$|In early 1950, when.he was 55, Kimball, who {{had never}} smoked or used tobacco, began {{experiencing}} persistent hoarseness and after a physical examination, he underwent a biopsy of a white spot in his throat. The biopsy caused some brief voice impairment and indicated that Kimball had a throat infection but not cancer. In late 1956, Kimball's hoarseness returned, coupled with occasional bleeding in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat.</b> Kimball's physician sent him to New York City to meet with Dr. Hayes Martin (18921977), an expert on cancers {{of the head and}} neck. [...] Martin performed another biopsy, which indicated [...] "borderline malignancy," [...] and in early 1957, Martin recommended immediate surgery. Kimball had neglected to seek approval from church president David O. McKay regarding his 1957 biopsy. At the time, the biopsy itself could cause permanent vocal damage. He felt that as an apostle, he should have sought McKay's approval before he underwent surgical procedures that could render him incapable of fulfilling apostolic duties.|$|E

60|$|The {{shortness}} of breath took all fire, all animation out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice; his great, pale cheeks hung like filled pouches, motionless, without a quiver; but in his blue eyes, narrowed as if peering, there was the same look of confident shrewdness, a little crazy in its fixity, they must have had while the indomitable optimist sat thinking at night in his cell. Before him, Karl Yundt remained standing, one wing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> faded greenish havelock thrown back cavalierly over his shoulder. Seated {{in front of the}} fireplace, Comrade Ossipon, ex-medical student, the principal writer of the F. P. leaflets, stretched out his robust legs, keeping the soles <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boots turned up to the glow in the grate. A bush of crinkly yellow hair topped his red, freckled face, with a flattened nose and prominent mouth cast in the rough mould of the negro type. His almond-shaped eyes leered languidly over the high cheek-bones. He wore a grey flannel shirt, the loose ends of a black silk tie hung down the buttoned breast <b>of</b> <b>his</b> serge coat; and his head resting on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chair, <b>his</b> <b>throat</b> largely exposed, he raised to his lips a cigarette in a long wooden tube, puffing jets of smoke straight up at the ceiling.|$|R

40|$|A CLEAR view of {{the vocal}} cords {{is not always easy}} to obtain, even for an {{experienced}} laryngologist. To demonstrate this to others is sometimes impossible. Anyone who teaches nose and throat work realizes the difficulties of demonstrating the vocal cords to students. To reflect light into the pharynx on to a mirror which has been previously warmed, held against the soft palate, and to get a clear picture of the vocal cords, requires endless practice. Various attachments have been made to place on the head mirror so that a number of students can see the image at the same time, but they are not entirely satisfactory. The examination of the larynx is such a routine procedure today, that we are apt to forget the difficulties of the early pioneers. In the history of laryngology, many sporadic attempts were made to reflect light into these darkened passages, but due to poor illumina-tion, very little progress was made. At the beginning of the last century (1807) Bozzini claimed to be able to inspect the various canals of the body, among them, the larynx. The illumination was supplied by means of a wax candle with a reflector behind it. In 1825, Cagniard de la Tour introduced into the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own <b>throat</b> a little mirror, hoping that by the aid of the rays of the sun and a second mirror, to see the epiglottis and even the glottis, but he was only partially successful. Senn, in 1827, tried to use a small mirror in the pharynx to see the parts below. He used no illumination and supposed his failure to be due to the small size of the mirror. In 1829, Benjamin Babbington presented to the Hunterian Society " an oblong piece of looking glass, set in silver wire with a long shank. The reflecting portion was held against the palate, whilst the tongue was held down with a spatula ". Some of the possibilities of such an instrument were appreciated by a London surgeon, who wrote in 1837, " by such a glass as is used by dentists, on a long stalk, previously dipped in hot water...|$|R

60|$|It {{is to be}} {{supposed}} that this interview stung Tom to swift action. Otherwise, one cannot explain why {{he should not have}} been just as reticent on the subject nearest his heart when bestowing on Sally the twenty-seventh cabbage as he had been when administering the hundred and sixtieth potato. At any rate, the fact remains that, as that fateful vegetable changed hands across the fence, something resembling a proposal of marriage did actually proceed from him. As a sustained piece of emotional prose it fell short of the highest standard. Most of it was lost at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> and what did emerge was mainly inaudible. However, as she distinctly caught the word 'love' twice, and as Tom was shuffling his feet and streaming with perspiration, and looking everywhere at once except at her, Sally grasped the situation. Whereupon, without any visible emotion, she accepted him.|$|E

A look, as he passed the doorways of the restaurant, assured him that business was good as ever, and this, which in April would have pleased him, now gave him a certain uneasiness. If the steps which {{he had to take}} ended in his marrying Annette, he would rather see her mother safely back in France, a move to which the prosperity of the Restaurant Bretagne might become an obstacle. He would have to buy them out, of course, for French people only came to England to make money; and it would mean a higher price. And then that peculiar sweet sensation at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> and a slight thumping about the heart, which he always experienced {{at the door of the}} little room, prevented his thinking how much it would cost.|$|E

But Charteris felt unequal to conversation. There are moments when {{one wants to be}} alone. He went down the steps again. When he got out into the road, his small cycling friend had vanished. Charteris was conscious of a feeling of envy towards her. She was doing the journey comfortably on a bicycle. He would have to walk it. Walk it! He didn't believe he could. The strangers' mile, followed by the Homeric combat with the two Hooligans and that ghastly sprint to wind up with, had left him decidedly unfit for further feats of pedestrianism. And it was eight miles to Stapleton, if it was a yard, and another mile from Stapleton to St Austin's. Charteris, having once more invoked the name of his aunt, pulled himself together with an effort, and limped gallantly on in the direction of Stapleton. But fate, so long hostile to him, at last relented. A rattle of wheels approached him from behind. A thrill of hope shot through him at the sound. There was the prospect of a lift. He stopped, and waited for the dog-cart--it sounded like a dog-cart--to arrive. Then he uttered a shout of rapture, and began to wave his arms like a semaphore. The man in the dog-cart was Dr Adamson.|$|E

Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957 was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E

40|$|Tongue {{retaining}} devices make {{a comeback}} and prove their validity through a plethora of scientific research. By Allen J. Moses, DDS, and R. Michael Alvarez, DDS The tongue retaining device (TRD) was invented by Charles Samelson, MD, an analytically trained psychiatrist motivated by his own snoring problem. His wife, an accomplished pianist, complained that the loud snoring was affecting her “musical ear. ” She was also experiencing such secondary effects of his snoring as sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) due to the numerous arousals. Samelson could mimic his snoring by allowing {{the base of his}} tongue to fall against the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> and reasoned that snoring was a partial airway obstruction. To keep his airway open during sleep, he needed to keep his tongue forward. Initially, he molded tongue sleeves out of beeswax. By creating suction in the sleeve and extending the tip of the sleeve anterior to the lips, the goal was accomplished; however, the beeswax was fragile and broke apart easily...|$|E
40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 31 -year-old male {{presented}} to the emergency department (ED) with worsening constant left sided throat pain {{over the past four}} months. The patient reports that he was brushing his teeth when his dog jumped onto his back causing his toothbrush to puncture the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>throat,</b> resulting in immediate bleeding and discomfort. The bleeding subsided and the patient did not seek medical care. The pain radiated to his left ear and the back of the neck. He also noted a change in his voice. The day before presenting to the ED the patient noted subjective fevers, hemoptysis and drooling, which led him to seek medical care. Significant findings: The photograph demonstrates an area of ulcerative tissue at the left palatine tonsil without surrounding erythema or purulent drainage. The computed tomography (CT) scan shows a large ulceration of the left soft palate and palatine tonsil (red arrow). There is no evidence of skull base osteomyelitis. There is suppurative lymphadenopathy with partial left jugular vein compression due to mass effect (yellow highlight). There is mild nasopharyngeal airway narrowing with architectural distortion (blue arrow), but no other evidence of airway obstruction. Discussion: The oral cavity is prone to trauma leading to the formation of superficial ulcerations. There are many causes of mechanical trauma, most commonly accidental biting. Chemical, electrical and thermal insults are also possibilities. Poor fitting dental devices and fractured or malformed teeth can also be etiologies. 1 Traumatic ulcerations are most common in children given bruxism and thumb sucking. However, a broad differential must be considered including malignant and premalignant lesions, infections of the oral mucosa, aphthous ulcerations and autoimmune diseases. 2, 3 Chronic ulcerations are associated with superimposed infection, but there has not been established an association of malignant transformation of the oral mucosa after trauma. If there is an unclear history at presentation, the provider must consider referral for a biopsy to exclude malignancy. Most ulcerations from mechanical or thermal trauma resolve in ten to fourteen days. Antibiotics can be considered to prevent secondary infection if the ulceration is severe; however, most resolve without antibiotics. Supportive measures to consider include removal of irritant, mouth guards, soft diet, sodium chloride mouth rinse, topical corticosteroids or anesthetics. Triamcinolone acetonide and fluocinonide gel are recommended for analgesia. 2 The patient discussed here was discharged home after his visit with a plan to follow up for further evaluation by a specialist. He returned to the emergency department three months later with worsening symptoms. He was admitted and otolaryngology performed biopsies, which demonstrated an advanced stage human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer. The patient is currently in a clinical trial receiving treatment. Again, this stresses the importance of follow up and further evaluation of concerning lesions...|$|E
