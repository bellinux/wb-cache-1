40|$|Cadmium (Cd) is a {{cumulative}} element with a biological half-life of > 10 years in humans. The {{total amount of}} Cd accumulated in the liver and in the kidney {{can be measured in}} vivo by neutron activation (or x-ray fluorescence), but this technique does not necessarily measure the fraction that is biologically active. At low exposure (i. e., general environmental exposure or moderate occupational exposure), blood Cd is mainly influenced by the last 2 to 3 months of exposure. Under such conditions, the Cd concentration in urine mainly reflects the amount of Cd stored in the body, particularly in the kidney. In Europe and the US, the Cd reference values are usually < 2 nmol/mmol creatinine. Because most of the Cd in urine is probably bound to metallothionein, the changes in the urinary metallothionein concentration parallel those of Cd. The determination of Cd concentration in hair is of limited value because in humans it is difficult to distinguish between externally deposited and endogenous Cd. Fecal Cd is a good indicator of the oral daily intake. The results of several cross-sectional epidemiologic studies of the relation between the prevalence of renal dysfunction and Cd concentration in urine led us to propose a <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> for Cd of 5 and 2 nmol/mmol creatine for adult male workers and the general population, respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectives: Low-pressure {{carburising}} is a {{new technology}} used to harden steel; {{the process has been}} shown to be a source of considerable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) pollution. Some PAH are carcinogenic, and activities such as furnace maintenance may thus represent a risk to workers. Occupational exposure during these operations should therefore be assessed. Methods: In this study, the PAH-related carcinogenic risk associated with furnace maintenance was assessed by monitoring atmospheric levels of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a representative marker, alongside urinary levels of 3 -hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene (3 -OHBaP), one of its metabolites. PAH exposure levels were monitored during seven sampling campaigns in four different factories specialized in heat-treatment of mechanical workpieces for the automotive and helicopter industries. Two types of furnace were studied, and 37 individuals were monitored. Results: Values up to 20 -fold the French regulatory value of 150 ng/m 3 for atmospheric BaP, and, for urinary 3 -OHBaP values up to 40 -fold the French <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> (BLV) of 0. 35 nmol/mol of creatinine were detected. Very high concentrations of BaP, close to or even exceeding those found in coal-tar pitch (up to about 20 g/kg), were measured in residues (tars, dusts) deposited inside the furnace. Even when adequate and suitable personal protective equipment was used, urinary 3 -OHBaP values often exceeded the BLV. We hypothesize that this exposure is linked to insidious and fortuitous dermal contamination through contact with factory equipment and staining...|$|E
40|$|Background: Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure in the coke industry poses a risk for workers’ health {{as well as}} for subjects living in the plant vicinity. Objectives: To assess PAHs exposure in coke-oven workers (CW) at the Taranto plant, Apulia, and in subjects from the general population living near (NC) and far away (FC) from the plant. Methods: Exposure was assessed by personal air sampling and urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 -OHP) measured in 100 CW, 18 NC and 15 FC. Results:Median airborne benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) levels were 152, 1. 5, and 3. 6 ng/m 3 in CW, NC, and FC, respectively. In CW, median 1 -OHP increased from 1. 45 to 1. 96 μg/g creatinine (crt) during the work shift (p> 0. 05); in NC and FC, 1 -OHP levels were 0. 56 and 0. 53 μg/g crt. No significant differences between NC and FC for both air and urinary indices were found. BaP exposure in CW exceeded the recently proposed German acceptable (70 ng/m 3) and tolerable (700 ng/m 3) risk-based limit values in 82 and 11 % of subjects, respectively. In NC and FC, BaP exposure exceeded the European target value for ambient air (1 ng/m 3) in 67 and 60 % of subjects, respectively. Biomonitoring showed that 21 % of CW had 1 -OHP levels higher than the proposed <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> for the coke-oven industry (4. 4 μg/g crt), while 93 % of FC, and 88 % of NC, had 1 -OHP levels exceeding the Italian reference value (0. 3 μg/g crt). Among non-smokers, a linear regression between 1 -OHP and BaP (Pearson value r= 0. 65, p< 0. 05) allowed us to estimate levels of 1. 2 and 1. 9 μg/g crt for 1 -OHP end-of-shift corresponding to acceptable and tolerable limit values. Conclusions: Although lower than in the past, PAHs exposure in the coke plant still poses a health risk for workers and the general population and requires further efforts to improve workplace conditions...|$|E

Six Caucasian and six Oriental volunteers were exposed to each organic solvent in an exposure chamber for 6 h at rest. The exposure concentrations were 50 ppm for perchloroethylene, 50 ppm for styrene, and 100 ppm for m-xylene, respectively. Experimental results were compared with simulation results of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PB-PK) model. Differences between Orientals and Caucasians under occupational exposure were also estimated by extrapolation. The simulation results obtained for the Caucasian group showed good agreement with the experimental results. However, the Oriental group did not show good agreement when the same metabolic parameters values applied to Caucasians were used in the PB-PK model. By modification of the metabolic parameters it was possible to get a good fit between the model and the results of the Oriental group.

40|$|International audienceAdequate {{interpretation}} of biomonitoring results of occupational exposures to chemicals requires comparison values {{also referred to}} as biological interpretation values. Among these values are those derived in France by Anses, which are based on a structured approach led collectively by independent and multidisciplinary groups of scientific experts. Two types of occupational biological values are recommended by Anses: <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> and <b>biological</b> reference values. These values are derived from the data available in the scientific literature. The article first shows that the derivation by Anses of the biological values to be used for biomonitoring of occupational exposures is linked {{to the nature of the}} chemical examined.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{two different}} techniques for assessing dermal exposure to 4, 4 '-methylene dianiline (MDA) {{in a field}} study. The results were {{used to test the}} applicability of a recently proposed quantitative dermal occupational exposure limit (DOEL) for MDA in a workplace scenario. Methods. For two consecutive weeks six workers were monitored for exposure to MDA in a factory that made glass fibre reinforced resin pipes. Dermal exposure of the hands and forearms was assessed during week 1 by a surrogate skin technique (cotton monitoring gloves) and during week 2 by a removal technique (hand wash). As well as the dermal exposure sampling, biological monitoring, measurement of MDA excretion in urine over 24 hours, occurred during week 2. Surface contamination of the workplace and equipment was monitored qualitatively by colorimetric wipe samples. Results and conclusions. Geometric means of daily exposure ranged from 81 - 1762 μg MDA for glove monitoring and from 84 - 1783 μg MDA for hand washes. No significant differences, except for one worker, were found between exposure of the hands in weeks 1 and 2. Significant differences between the mean daily exposure of the hands (for both weeks and sampling methods) were found for all workers. The results of the colorimetric wipe samples indicated a general contamination of the workplace and equipment. Excretion of MDA in 24 hour urine samples ranged from 8 to 249 μg MDA, whereas cumulative MDA excretion over a week ranged from 82 to 717 μg MDA. Cumulative hand wash and MDA excretion results over a week showed a high correlation (R 2 = 0. 94). The highest actual daily dermal exposure found seemed to be about 4 mg (hand wash worker A on day 4), about 25 % of the external DOEL. Testing of compliance by means of a <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> (BLV) led to similar results for the same worker. It is concluded that both dermal exposure monitoring methods were applicable and showed a compatible performance in the present exposure scenario, where the exposure relevant to dermal absorption is considered mainly restricted to hands.

Physiological and metabolic changes in the aging process may alter how aging adults biologically respond to pollutants. In a controlled human toxicokinetic study (exposure chamber; 12 m³), aging volunteers (n= 10; > 58 years) were exposed to propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME, CAS no. 107 - 98 - 2) at 50 ppm for 6 h. The dose-dependent renal excretion of oxidative metabolites, conjugated and free PGME could potentially be altered by age. (1) Compare PGME toxicokinetic profiles between aging and young volunteers (20 - 25 years) and gender; (2) test the predictive power of a compartmental toxicokinetic (TK) model developed for aging persons against urinary PGME concentrations found in this study. Urine samples were collected before, during, and after the exposure. Urinary PGME was quantified by capillary GC/FID. Differences in urinary PGME profiles were not noted between genders but between age groups. Metabolic parameters had to be changed to fit the age adjusted TK model to the experimental results, implying a slower enzymatic pathway in the aging volunteers.

The objective {{of the present study}} was to provide information about biological monitoring of occupational exposure to ethylbenzene, and to review the <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> corresponding to the threshold <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of ethylbenzene. METHODS: A total of 20 male workers who had been exposed to a mixture of ethylbenzene and xylene, through painting and solvent mixing with commercial xylene in a metal industry, were recruited into this study. Environmental and biological monitoring were performed during an entire week. The urinary metabolites monitored were mandelic acid for ethylbenzene and methylhippuric acid for xylene. Correlations were analyzed between urinary metabolites and environmental exposure for ethylbenzene and xylene. The interaction effects of a binary exposure to ethylbenzene and xylene were also investigated using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. RESULTS: The average environmental concentration of organic solvents was 12. 77 ppm for xylene, and 3. 42 ppm for ethylbenzene. A significant correlation (R 2 = 0. 503) was found between environmental xylene and urinary methylhippuric acid. Urinary level of methylhippuric acid corresponding to 100 ppm of xylene was 1. 96 g/g creatinine in the worker study, whereas it was calculated as 1. 55 g/g creatinine by the PBPK model. Urinary level of mandelic acid corresponding to 100 ppm of ethylbenzene was found to be 0. 7 g/g creatinine. PBPK results showed that the metabolism of ethylbenzene was highly depressed by co-exposure to high concentrations of xylene leading to a non-linear behavior. CONCLUSIONS: At low exposures, both methylhippuric acid and mandelic acid can be used as indicators of commercial xylene exposures. However at higher concentrations mandelic acid cannot be recommended as a biological indicator due to the saturation of mandelic acid produced by the co-exposure to xylene...|$|R

The results obtained for several solvents are reviewed. The values of correlation coefficients (r) and regression lines obtained for benzene, toluene, xylene, styrene, n-hexane, cyclohexane, 2 - and 3 -methylpentane, methyl chloride, tetrachloroethylene, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, p-dichlorobenzene, nitrous oxide, halothane, isoflurane, enflurane, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone are presented. The correlations observed were generally good: r values range from 0. 50 - 0. 97, and the majority are between 0. 84 and 0. 90. The regression lines reported far the same solvent in different studies present some variability: this is possibly due to an inadequate control of factors influencing the relationship between external dose and absorption, such as differences in body burden, work load, individual characteristics, etc. These factors are discussed. As a whole, results {{reported in the literature}} show that measuring of urinary excretion of unmodified solvents provides a highly sensitive and specific exposure index, and can also be applied for the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to low levels of solvents or to solvent mixtures. Nevertheless, for an adequate assessment of <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values,</b> further studies evaluating the reproducibility of regression lines are needed, given that the aspects influencing the correlation between external dose and urinary excretion are fully controlled. Another crucial aspect is the correlation with early effects: even though this has yet to be evaluated for several solvents, for others such as styrene and perchloroethylene a good correlation was obtained, further supporting the usefulness of the measurement of urinary excretion of solvent for the biological monitoring of occupational exposure...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to {{isocyanates}} {{may induce}} disorders in the airways of workers. Therefore, application, development and validation of methods for exposure assessment {{is of great}} importance. In the present study, we have determined the personal air and biomarker levels of isocyanates {{for a group of}} occupationally exposed workers (n= 170) in different types of industrial processes. Also, the biomarker levels were determined for a control group consisting of occupationally unexposed workers (n= 121). A method with filters impregnated with 1 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) piperazine (2 MP) was used for personal air monitoring of exposure in different types of manufacturing processes. The field performance of the 2 MP method was evaluated. Short-term stationary measurements was collected in parallel with an impinger method using dibutylamine (DBA) in toluene. Also, the long-term performance was evaluated by parallel sampling with consecutive sampling by the 2 MP method itself. The 2 MP method was found to underestimate the air levels of some isocyanates. Correction factors were calculated that may adjust for these observed losses. A new bioanalytical method for determination of biomarkers of aromatic diisocyanates was validated. This method is more convenient, better characterized and more robust than previous methods. The biomarker levels of aromatic diisocyanates were determined in the two groups of workers and upper reference limits (URLs) were calculated. The URLs may be useful in a screening test to assess whether a worker is occupationally exposed to diisocyanates or not. The biomarkers of 4, 4 '-methylene diisocyanate (MDI) were present in 97 % of the occupationally unexposed workers. This indicates an unknown source of background exposure. For the exposed workers, there were strong correlations between urinary and plasma biomarker levels of isocyanates and between air and biomarker levels of isocyanates. The biomarkers of toluene diisocyanate (TDI), 1, 5 -naphthalene diisocyanate (NDI) and MDI were shown to be applicable as an index of exposure.

All analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Environmental sevoflurane levels in the operating rooms were also monitored continuously using an infrared photoacoustic analyzer. Our results showed very low individual sevoflurane exposure levels, generally below 0. 5 ppm (mean 0. 116 ppm; range 0. 007 - 0. 940 ppm). Sev-U and HFIP concentrations were in the range of 0. 1 - 17. 28 μg/L and 5 - 550 μg/L, respectively. Both biomarkers showed a statistically significant correlation with the environmental exposure levels (Sev-U, r= 0. 49; HFIP, r= 0. 52), albeit showing fairly scattered values. Sev-U values seem to be influenced by peaks of exposure, especially at the end of the operating-room session, whereas HFIP levels by exposure on the previous day, the data being consistent with the biomarkers' very different half-lives (2. 8 and 19 h, respectively).

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Gemstone cutters are {{potentially}} exposed to various carcinogenic and fibrogenic metals such as chromium, nickel, aluminium, and beryllium, {{as well as}} to lead. Increased beryllium concentrations had been reported in the air of workplaces of beryl cutters in Idar-Oberstein, Germany. The aim of the survey was to study the excretion of beryllium in cutters and grinders with occupational exposure to beryls—for example, aquamarines and emeralds—to examine the prevalence of beryllium sensitisation with the beryllium lymphocyte transformation test (BeLT), to examine the prevalence of lung disease induced by beryllium, to describe the internal load of the respective metals relative to work process, and to screen for genotoxic effects in this particular profession.  METHODS—In a cross sectional investigation, 57  out of 100  gemstone cutters working in 12  factories in Idar-Oberstein with occupational exposure to beryls underwent medical examinations, a chest radiograph, lung function testing (spirometry, airway resistance with the interrupter technique), and biological monitoring, including measurements of aluminium, chromium, and nickel in urine as well as lead in blood. Beryllium in urine was measured with a newly developed direct electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy technique with a measurement limit of 0. 06  µg/l. Also, cytogenetic tests (rates of micronuclei and sister chromatid exchange), and a BeLT were performed. Airborne concentrations of beryllium were measured in three factories. As no adequate local control group was available, the cutters were categorised into those with an exposure to beryls of > 4 hours/week (group A) and ⩽ 4 hours/week (group B).  RESULTS—Clinical, radiological, or spirometric abnormalities indicating pneumoconiosis were detected in none of the gemstone cutters. Metal concentrations in biological material were far below the respective <b>biological</b> <b>limit</b> <b>values,</b> and beryllium in urine was only measurable in subjects of group A.  Cytogenetic investigations showed normal values which were independent of the duration of beryllium exposure. In one subject, the BeLT was positive. Beryllium stimulation indices were significantly higher in subjects with detectable beryllium in the urine than in those with beryllium concentrations below the detection limit (p< 0. 05). In one factory, two out of four measurements of airborne beryllium concentrations were well above the German threshold <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of 2  µg/m 3 (twofold and 10 -fold), and all gemstone cutters working in this factory had measurable beryllium concentrations in urine.  CONCLUSION—No adverse clinical health effects were found in this cross sectional investigation of gemstone cutters working with beryls. However, an improvement in workplace hygiene is recommended, accompanied by biological monitoring of beryllium in urine.    Keywords: gemstone cutter; beryllium in urine; lymphocyte transformation tes...|$|R

Using both B-pa and F-pa was deemed the approach with the lowest error rate, and it resulted in about the same proportion of Hits in management advice as when B-pa alone was used (62 %), but the proportion of Misses was slightly lower (24 % vs. 26 %).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{evaluation}} of the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> which are stated in CUR 236 – Micropiles is presented. This evaluation has been done by means of a dataset. The dataset contained information on failure tests performed on four different types of micropiles, and was initially used for research on relations between logged installation aspects and the final capacity of the piles; such relations were however not found. This was mainly caused by the shape in which the data was logged, and the lack of details in the data. During this research, significant differences between raw data and data adapted according the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> stated in CUR 236, were found. This led to a change in research direction towards the evaluation of the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>values</b> are values that are used to build in additional safety in a design, and thus, to prevent unsafe situations. The values are based on the shape of data in which in general a linear relation between maximum mobilized shear stresses (τ_(mob;max)) and cone resistance (q_c). This relation continues up to a certain cone resistance level, after which τ_(mob;max) does not increase significantly anymore. The point where no significant increase in τ_(mob;max) over q_c was seen, was used as the <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> for the cone resistance. The limit for α_t was chosen to be 2. 5 % and the limit for τ_(mob;max) 2. 5 % of the cone resistance <b>limit.</b> Data with <b>values</b> above these <b>limits,</b> has to be reduced to the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> (CUR 236, 2011) Differences were thus found between raw data, the same data but then adapted according the <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> method stated in CUR 236, and values stated in CUR 236 Table 6. 1. For further investigation on how these differences were caused, the available dataset was combined with data from the appendix ‘Bijlage A. Proefbelastingen’ of CUR 236. This showed that the current <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> did not suit the shape of the data very well. Investigation on the usefulness of the <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> showed that they are useful for the design process by preventing under- and overestimations of the capacity. <b>Limit</b> <b>values</b> are thus useful, but not in their current form. New <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> were therefore proposed based on a statistical analysis of the available data points. Next to <b>limit</b> <b>values,</b> also design values (expectancy and lower bound) are added. Because no detailed data for all micropile types was available, it is advised to re-elaborate the limit- and design values for the types that were left out of the proposal given in this thesis, in a similar, statistical way. Furthermore is it advised to investigate a different method to estimate the shear stresses that can be mobilized along the anchor body of a micropile, based on a more fundamental approach. Currently are those stresses often based on full-scale tests from which τ_(mob;max) is derived, but bounded by the <b>limit</b> <b>values.</b> A different approach to this might be more time- and cost-effective.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{epidemiological study}} {{was carried out}} among subjects exposed to mercury (Hg) vapour, ie, a group of 131 male workers (mean age: 30. 9 yr; average duration of exposure, 4. 8 yr) {{and a group of}} 54 female workers (mean age, 29. 9 yr; average duration of exposure 7 yr). The results were compared with those obtained in well-matched control groups comprising 114 and 48 male and female workers, respectively. The intensity of current Hg vapour exposure was rather moderate as reflected by the levels of mercury in urine (HgU) (mean and 95 th percentile: males 52 and 147 micrograms/g creatinine; females 37 and 63 micrograms/g creatinine) and of mercury in blood (mean and 95 th percentile: males 1. 4 and 3. 7 micrograms/dl; females 0. 9 and 1. 4 microgram/dl). Several symptoms mainly related to the central nervous system (memory disturbances, depressive feelings, fatigue, irritability) were more prevalent in the Hg-exposed subjects. They were, however, not related to exposure parameters. In both male and female Hg-exposed workers no significant disturbances were found in short-term memory (audioverbal), simple reaction time (visual), critical flicker fusion, and colour discrimination ability. Only slight renal tubular effects were detected in Hg-exposed males and females, ie, an increased urinary beta-galactosidase activity and an increased urinary excretion of retinol-binding protein. The prevalence of these preclinical renal effects was more related to the current exposure intensity (HgU) than to the duration of exposure and was detected mainly when HgU exceeds 50 micrograms/g creatinine. Changes in hand tremor spectrum recorded with an accelerometer were found in the Hg-exposed males only. The prevalence of abnormal values for some hand tremor parameters (total velocity and total displacement in the 2 - 50 -Hz band) was mainly increased in male workers exposed for more than 10 yr. Unlike the renal tubular effects, the preclinical signs of tremor were more related to the integrated exposure than to the current exposure. Since the female workers, who have been exposed to Hg vapour levels usually insufficient to increase their HgU levels above 50 micrograms/g creatinine, did not exhibit any change in hand tremor pattern, {{the results of the present}} study tend to validate our previously proposed <b>biological</b> threshold <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of a HgU of 50 micrograms/g creatinine for workers chronically exposed to mercury vapour...|$|R
