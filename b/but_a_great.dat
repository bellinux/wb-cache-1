5|$|Royal {{administration}} in the entire kingdom was based on counties organized around royal fortresses. In modern Romania's territory, references to an ispán or count of Alba in 1097, and to a count of Bihor in 1111 evidence {{the appearance of the}} county system. The counties in Banat and Crişana remained under direct royal authority, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> officer of the realm, the voivode, supervised the ispáns of the Transylvanian counties {{from the end of the}} 12thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} genetic {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E

25|$|The {{published}} {{figures show}} that both capacitor types, tantalum and aluminum, are reliable components, comparable with other electronic components and achieving safe operation for decades under normal conditions. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> difference exists {{in the case of}} wear-out failures. Tantalum capacitors with solid electrolyte have no wear-out mechanism so that the constant failure rate is least, up to the point when all capacitors fail. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, however, have a limited time of constant random failures up to that point when the wear-out failures start. This time of the constant random failure rate corresponds with the lifetime or service life of “wet” aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Hutton's {{main line}} of {{argument}} was that the tremendous displacements and changes he was seeing did not happen {{in a short period}} of time by means of catastrophe, but that the incremental processes of uplift and erosion happening on the Earth in the present day had caused them. As these processes were very gradual, the Earth needed to be ancient, in order to allow time for the changes to occur. While his ideas of Plutonism were hotly contested, scientific inquiries on competing ideas of catastrophism pushed back the age of the Earth into the millions of years – still much younger than commonly accepted by modern scientists, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> change from the literalist view of an Earth that was only a few thousand years old.|$|E
25|$|In {{the hopes}} that one day the school would reopen, plans were made for its {{maintenance}} in the interim.

There was also the large estate to be managed, with its gum tree plantations (which were still economically viable) and St Francis village, the home of the Springvale Estate workers and their families, which had grown up along with the school since the 1950s and had a chapel and a school of its own.|$|E

25|$|In 1806, four light dragoon regiments (the 7th, 10th, 15th and 18th) were {{converted}} into regiments of Hussars, with {{no change in}} their role, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> increase in the expense of their uniforms. From 1812, the uniforms {{of most of the}} remaining British cavalry changed, following French styles. The heavy cavalry (excepting the Household Cavalry who adopted a helmet with a prominent woolen comb and the Scots Greys, who retained their bearskins) adopted a helmet with a horsetail crest like those of French dragoons or cuirassiers, while the light dragoons adopted a jacket and shako similar to those of French chasseurs a cheval. The Duke of Wellington objected to these changes, as it became difficult to distinguish French and British cavalry at night or at a distance, but without success.|$|E
25|$|In {{its early}} years, the Empire of Manchukuo {{was home to}} many {{resistance}} groups that fought against it and the Japanese occupation forces. Many of those guerrilla fighters were civilians, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> many were former soldiers of Zhang Xueliang's army that decided to continue to resist on their own rather than surrender or leave Manchuria. One of the more notable resistance leaders was Ma Zhanshan, whose army fought rearguard actions as the Young Marshal's main force retreated south. The Japanese were impressed with him and decided to recruit him by offering a large sum of money to the general. Ma initially accepted the offer from Colonel Kenji Doihara and briefly served as the state of Manchukuo's war minister. He used the opportunity to equip and arm his troops before deserting en masse {{to fight against the}} Japanese again.|$|E
25|$|The Song period (10th–13th century) brought {{additional}} economic reforms. Paper money, the compass, {{and other}} technological advances facilitated communication {{on a large}} scale and the widespread circulation of books. The state's control of the economy diminished, allowing private merchants to prosper and a large increase in investment and profit. Despite disruptions during the Mongol conquest of 1279, the 2nd plague epidemic in the 14th century, and the large-scale rebellions that followed it, China's population was buoyed by the Columbian Exchange and increased greatly under the Ming (14th–17th centuries). The economy was remonetised by Japanese and South American silver brought through foreign trade, despite generally isolationist policies. The relative economic status of Europe and China during most of the Qing (17th–20th century) remains a matter of debate, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>Great</b> Divergence was apparent in the 19th century, when British dependence on opium smuggling to fund its tea imports led it into a series of wars that ended China's isolation and autonomy through a number of Unequal Treaties.|$|E

25|$|Small {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{in a number of}} single wicket matches but he seems to have been less successful in this form of cricket than in the eleven-a-side version. He did have one single wicket innings that was of enormous significance {{in the evolution of the}} sport because it led directly to the introduction of the third (middle) stump to what had always been a two-stump wicket. The match in question took place at the Artillery Ground on 22 & 23 May 1775 between Five of Kent (with Lumpy Stevens) and Five of Hambledon (with Thomas White). Kent batted first and made 37 to which Hambledon replied with 92, including 75 by Small, that being his highest known score in a single wicket match. In their second innings, Kent scored 102, leaving Hambledon a target of 48 to win. Small batted last of the Hambledon Five and needed 14 more to win when he went in. He duly scored the runs and Hambledon won by 1 wicket <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> controversy arose afterwards because, three times in the course of his second innings, Small was beaten by Lumpy only for the ball to pass through the two-stump wicket each time without hitting the stumps or the bail. As a result of Lumpy's protests, the middle stump was introduced, although it was some years before its use became universal.|$|E

To prevent guerrilla supplies from north of the Rompin River from reaching the food denial areas to the south, covered by Operation Cobble, an RhAR platoon under Lieutenant David Heppenstall was posted to the area directly south of the river midway through the month.
