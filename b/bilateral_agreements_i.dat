However the country recently negotiated two series of bilateral agreements with the Union. The first series, <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreements</b> <b>I,</b> consists of seven bilateral agreements and was signed in 1999 (entry into force in 2001), the main part being Free Movement of Persons (full text of the agreement).

In so doing, we focus on questions of considerable normative implications: To what extent are policy changes traceable in legal reforms “infiltrated” by the EU? Is the EU's footprint higher in primary legislation (enacted by Parliament) or in secondary legislation (enacted essentially by the Executive) ? Do these linkages result from <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> (<b>i.</b> e. direct Europeanization) or indirect Europeanization processes? How do policy sectors differ in this regard...|$|E
40|$|This chapter aims {{to discuss}} {{some of the}} defects of the WTO, as they affect the TRIPS agreement.

I suggest that it is from this perspective that we should consider whether TRIPS should remain in the WTO, and under what conditions. This entails some consideration of the alternatives to TRIPS, but mainly I will focus on proposals to reform the WTO, and particularly on how to rescue TRIPS and the WTO from the damaging effects of their capture by private interests. 1.

40|$|Internet service {{providers}} (ISPs) must interconnect to provide global Internet connectivity to users. The payment structure of these interconnections are often negotiated and maintained via <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements.</b> Current {{differences of opinion}} in the appropriate revenue model in the Internet has on occasion caused ISPs to de-peer from one another, hindering network connectivity and availability. Our previous work demonstrates that the Shapley value has several desirable properties, and that if applied as the revenue model, selfish ISPs would yield globally optimal routing and interconnecting decisions. In this paper, we focus our investigation of Shapley value in networks with two basic classes of ISP: content and eyeball. In particular, we analyze the revenue distribution between ISPs with elastic and inelastic customer demands, and calculate the bilateral payments between ISPs that implement the Shapley revenue. Our results illustrate how ISP revenues are influenced by different demand models. In particular, the marginal revenue lost by de-peering for an eyeball ISP with inelastic demand is inversely proportional to the square of its degree of connectivity to content ISPs. In practice, these results provide a guideline for ISPs, even in peering relationships, to negotiate bilateral payments and for regulatory institutions to design pricing regulations.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the European Union and Switzerland constitutes {{one of the most}} interesting phenomenons in Europe. Both entities have closely cooperated e. g. in the field of economy, culture or education but there have been just few formal agreements which would regulate this cooperation till the recent time. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> <b>I</b> and II between the EU and Switzerland, which were negotiated at the turn of the century, therefore represent a "small revolution" for both contracting parties and a new quality in their relationship. They regulate the most important common fields of interest, mainly at the area of mutual trade. But the main question remains: do these negotiations and agreements create a solid basis for a further integration of Switzerland into the EU or do they contrariwise constitute a status quo which will not be changed for a longer period of time? The search for this answer is not an easy one. The EU would be surely interested in an accession of Switzerland but it is quite obvious that there is not so much enthusiasm on the Swiss side. The skepticism towards a deeper integration into the EU is spread mainly among electors and it has been proved in several plebiscites on this theme. The accession is backed approximately by 30 percent of voters and there is no canton with a majority of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{political}} activity {{carried out by the}} Spanish region Catalonia and directed towards actors outside the border of the Spanish State. I name this regional external activities "paradiplomacy", and ask: Can the paradiplomatic activity of Catalonia indicate a process of change in the Spanish system of governance? Is it a process of change that will reflect the tendencies of a "Europe of the regions"? As implied by the research questions does the thesis treat the Catalan paradiplomacy on the background of the European regionalisation process. I assume that the regionalisation causes changes in the relationship between the central and regional level of governance, and that the type of relation prevailing between central and regional authorities influences the system of state government. I present four possible outcomes of decentralised state governance: the decentralised state, the federal state, the confederation, and the separation into independent states. And I point out several factors that can influence the outcome {{in the case of the}} Spanish system of state government: the European integration and its institutions, the Catalan nationalism, the Spanish Constitution, the bargaining strategies adopted by the Catalan and the Spanish authorities, and the Catalan paradiplomacy. The central/regional relation is studied in connection with issues defined as paradiplomatic activity, because I assume that paradiplomacy will have a special significance for the relation since international relations always have been the competence of the central government. The modern and democratic Spanish state, "el estado de las autonomías" (the state made up of autonomies) contains 17 autonomous regions. Catalonia is one of the three historic regions, and can point at statehood in the past. The medieval principality of Catalonia preserved its own language, distinctive political administration, written and customary laws, monetary system and fiscal barriers until 1714. During the European nation-building period (18 th and 19 th century) Spain failed to nationalise all inhabitants into Spaniards. Instead a nation-building process took place in Catalonia. The dictatorship of General Franco (1939 - 1975) only led to strengthen the Catalan nationalism. Today Catalonia appears as an economically strong, historic region with a living nationalism. An important part of the Catalan nationalism is to strengthen the Catalan national identity by participation on the international scene. Paradiplomatic activities are therefore pivotal in the national strategy of the Catalan government. In this thesis I present five different categories of Catalan paradiplomatic activities: official trips abroad, Catalan trade and investments, participation in international conferences and organisations, opening offices abroad, and political, cultural and economic <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements.</b> <b>I</b> analyse examples of Catalan paradiplomacy to study the importance of this activity for the Catalan/Spanish relation and the Spanish system of state government. The Catalan/Spanish relation has developed over the years. While it was recognised by conflict and lack of agreement in the first years of Catalan autonomy, it is now mostly recognised by tacit agreements. My analysis shows that there is no one type of relation between the Catalan and the central Spanish authorities that can indicate a clear development in direction of federal state, confederation or separation. But it shows that the Spanish system of governance has been in a continuos process of adaptation and change that has resulted in a specific Spanish semi-federal system. Catalonia has managed to benefit from this system to increase its autonomy through an active paradiplomatic activity. Does the semi-federal system of the Spanish state, with its extensive regional autonomy and dynamic character, reflect the tendencies of a "Europe of the regions"? I argue against this, because my study does not reveal a weakening of the Spanish governments' position and power parallel with the increase in the Catalan influence and participation...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, the number of {{preferential}} trade agreements has grown almost exponentially to reach over 250 by late 2009. In contrast to earlier waves of PTAs, today the majority are agreements between developed and developing countries. This change {{calls into question the}} applicability of existing models that lump North-South PTAs together with other types of trade agreements. This paper presents a general framework based on a model of trade policy with multinational firms and FDI. The move of less capital-intensive manufacturing from North to South leads to the rapid growth of vertical intra-industry trade, or the exchange of similar goods differentiated by unit values. More capital-intensive goods are exported by the North, while more labor-intensive goods are produced and traded by South. This kind of specialization, I argue, creates incentives for governments to support <b>bilateral</b> trade <b>agreements.</b> <b>I</b> test this model using a new measure of vertical intra-industry trade calculated on the basis of highly disaggregated trade flows. The findings challenge existing research that has found limited effects of trade itself and provide strong evidence that growing vertical trade specialization triggers PTA formation. North-South agreements formed {{since the end of the}} Cold War should therefore be seen as part of a broader shift of manufacturing from high- to middle-income countries. 1...|$|R
