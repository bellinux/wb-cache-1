5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E
5|$|Barbara Ketcham Wheaton and Stephen Mennell {{provided}} the definitive arguments against these claims. They {{point out that}} Catherine’s father-in-law, King Francis I, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined at some of Italy’s most élite tables during the king’s Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during King Charles VIII’s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de’ Medici’s father to her French-born mother; {{and that she had}} little influence at court until her husband’s death <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> besotted by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning Renaissance. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.|$|E

De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d'état against him Rodolfo Terragno, De la Rúa's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso-dollar parity despite the costs generated by it. Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party {{had no interest in}} removing De la Rúa from power, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E

25|$|When asked {{later by}} an {{interviewer}} why he eventually gave up directing and returned full-time to acting, Crisp commented that directing had become extremely wearisome <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> often called upon, if not forced, to do favours for studio chiefs {{by agreeing to}} employ their relatives in his films.

500|$|Poochie, {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta and Alex Rocco, is an {{anthropomorphic}} dog {{that appeared in}} [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] (season eight, 1997). In the episode, the producers of The Itchy & Scratchy Show believed the cartoons were getting stale, and needed a new character to reinvigorate the show. Homer Simpson gets the job of voicing Poochie, who is introduced in the cartoon, [...] "The Beagle Has Landed". A product of marketing department thinking, Poochie was near-universally despised, and was killed off in his second appearance, despite Homer's objections. The episode was both a reference to TV shows which added new characters purportedly to reinvigorate the show, and a commentary on the growing complaints of fans of The Simpsons. The original idea for the episode was that Poochie would be obnoxious <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> rich, rather than <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> cool. Poochie would later make brief speaking cameo appearances in [...] "Treehouse of Horror IX" [...] and [...] "Little Big Mom." ...|$|E

500|$|Foliot died on 18 February 1187. The medieval chronicler Walter Map praised him as [...] "a man most {{accomplished}} in the three languages, Latin, French and English, and eloquent and clear in each of them". The modern historian Frank Barlow says of him that [...] "It was probably <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> self-righteous {{that it could be}} suggested that his behaviour was sometimes devious."

[...] Eight years later, Robinson ran into Daniels at a poetry reading in New York City, and told him to audition for the film. Daniels didn't have any money to get to Atlanta where he had to audition, so he hustled money doing poetry in subways, and bought a bus ticket to get there.|$|E

As the work progressed, however, according to Haley, Malcolm yielded more and more to the authority of his ghostwriter, partly because Haley never let Malcolm read the manuscript unless he was present to defend it, partly because in his last months Malcolm had less and less opportunity to reflect on the text of his life <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> busy living it, and partly because Malcolm had eventually resigned himself to letting Haley's ideas about effective storytelling take precedence over his own desire to denounce straightaway those whom he had once revered.|$|E

The second day of these deliberations began on November 6, 2010. Attorney Thomas Ullman told the jury that a sentence of life in prison would be the harshest possible punishment for his client Hayes, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> tormented by his crimes and would be isolated in prison. [...] "Life in prison {{without the possibility of}} release is the harshest penalty," [...] Ullman said. [...] "It is a fate worse than death.

[...] "If you want him to suffer and carry that burden forever, the guilt, shame, and humiliation, sentence him to life without the possibility of release." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E
500|$|Because Jan van Eyck's life is well {{documented}} in comparison to his contemporary painters, and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> clearly the period's innovator, {{a great number of}} works were attributed to him after art historians began to research the period. Today Jan is credited with about 26–28 extant works. This reduced number in part follows from the identification of other mid-15th-century painters such as van der Weyden, Christus and Memling, while Hubert, so highly regarded by late-19th-century critics, is now relegated as a secondary figure with no works definitively attributed to him. Many early Netherlandish masters have not been identified, and are today known by [...] "names of convenience", usually of the [...] "Master of..." [...] format. The practice lacks an established descriptor in English, but the [...] "notname" [...] term is often used, a derivative of a German term. Collecting a group of works under one notname is often contentious; a set of works assigned one notname could have been produced by various artists whose artistic similarities can be explained by shared geography, training, and response to market-demand influences. Some major artists who were known by pseudonyms are now identified, sometimes controversially, {{as in the case of}} Campin, who is usually, but not always, associated with the Master of Flémalle.|$|E
