5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star {{to the south}} celestial pole. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, {{one of the brightest}} dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have been found to have exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to nine planetary companions.|$|E
25|$|Banksia nobilis grows as a shrub {{up to four}} metres high. Its {{leaves are}} pinnatifid, with 14 to 32 {{triangular}} lobes on each side from eight to 22 centimetres long, five to 25 millimetres wide, on a petiole five to 15 millimetres long. Inflorescences occur on short lateral branchlets; this species bears a great many inflorescences, often carrying an inflorescence in almost every axil. Flowers are golden or reddish pink, with a greenish cream limb. After flowering, heads can <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to 5 follicles each.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of [...] (1934–44), {{dedicated}} comics magazines and full-colour comic albums became the primary outlet for comics in the mid-20th century. [...] As in the US, at the time comics were seen as infantile and a threat to culture and literacy; commentators stated that [...] "none <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to the slightest serious analysis", and that comics were [...] "the sabotage of all art and all literature".|$|E
500|$|Cob, {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "monolithic adobe", is a natural building material made from soil that includes clay, sand or small stones and an organic material such as straw. Cob walls are usually built up in courses, have no mortar joints and need 30% or more clay in the soil. Cob can be used as in-fill in post-and-beam buildings, but is often used for load bearing walls, and can <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to two stories. [...] A cob wall should be at least [...] thick, and the ratio of width to height should be no more than one to ten. It will typically be plastered inside and out with a mix of lime, soil and sand. Cob is fireproof, and its thermal mass helps stabilize indoor temperatures.|$|E
500|$|Flowers {{occur in}} a typical Banksia flower spike, an {{inflorescence}} made up of hundreds of small individual flowers, or florets, densely packed around a cylindrical axis. B.prionotes has cream-coloured flowers with a bright orange limb that is not revealed until the flower fully opens. Known as anthesis, this process sweeps through the inflorescence from bottom to top {{over a period of}} days, creating the effect of a cream inflorescence that progressively turns bright orange. The old flower parts fall away after flowering finishes, revealing the axis, which may <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to 60 embedded follicles. Oval or oblong in shape and initially covered in fine hairs, these follicles are from [...] long and [...] wide, and protrude [...] from the cone. Inside, they bear two seeds separated by a brownish woody seed separator. The matte blackish seeds are wedge-shaped (cuneate) and measure [...] long by [...] wide with a membranous 'wing'.|$|E

50|$|A 95-yard {{punt return}} by DeSean Jackson {{was the first}} score, putting the <b>Bears</b> <b>up</b> 7-0. Arizona got a field goal next, putting them on the board 7-3. Midway through the first quarter, Marshawn Lynch's 79-yard {{touchdown}} run was erased by a block-in-the-back call on Lavelle Hawkins, and the Bears {{had to settle for}} a field goal. In the middle of the second quarter, Longshore hit Jackson with a 72-yard touchdown pass to put the <b>Bears</b> <b>up</b> 17-3 at the half.|$|R
500|$|The mood did {{not last}} though: {{conditions}} aboard the small craft during the trip were terrible, with the crew constantly soaked and cold. McNish impressed Shackleton with his ability to <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> under the strain (more so than the younger Vincent, who collapsed from exhaustion and cold). The six men split into two watches of four hours: three of the men would handle the boat while the other three lay beneath the canvas decking attempting to sleep. McNish shared a watch with Shackleton and Crean. All the men complained of pains in their legs and, {{on the fourth day}} out from Elephant Island, McNish suddenly sat down and [...] removed his boots, revealing his legs and feet were white and puffy with the early signs of trench foot. On seeing the state of McNish's feet Shackleton ordered all the men to remove their boots.|$|E
500|$|The Atlantic torpedo is aplacental viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are sustained by yolk, which is later supplemented by protein and fat-enriched histotroph ("uterine milk") {{produced by the}} mother. Females have two functional ovaries and uteruses, and a possibly biennial reproductive cycle. After a year-long gestation period, females <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to 60 pups during the summer; the litter size increases {{with the size of}} the female. When the embryo is [...] long, it has a pair of deep notches {{at the front of the}} disc marking the origin of the pectoral fins, and the curtain of skin between the nostrils has not yet developed; on the other hand, the eyes, spiracles, dorsal fins, and tail have reached adult proportions. Newborn rays measure [...] long, and still have the anterior notches in the disc. Males and females reach sexual maturity at lengths of [...] and [...] respectively.|$|E
500|$|The pelvic fins {{have nearly}} {{straight}} margins and angular tips. The tail {{is long and}} whip-like, measuring some 2.5 times {{the length of the}} disc. A long, saw-toothed spine is placed atop the tail at around half a disc length back from the tail base; sometimes one or two replacement spines are also present in front of the existing one. Behind the spine, there is a long ventral fin fold that is much lower than that of the southern stingray. Individuals under [...] across have completely smooth skin. Larger rays develop increasing numbers of distinctive tubercles or bucklers (flat-based thorns) over the middle of the back from the snout to the tail base, as well as dorsal and lateral rows of thorns on the tail. The bucklers vary in size, with the largest of equal diameter to the eye, and may <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to three thorns each. This species is a uniform dark brown or olive above, and off-white below without dark fin margins. Among the largest members of its family, the roughtail stingray can reach [...] across, [...] long, and [...] in weight. Females grow larger than males.|$|E

50|$|Lilium davidii {{grows up}} to 1.5m high, and <b>bears</b> <b>up</b> to about 20 unscented flowers with {{recurved}} leaves (bent backwards), orange or reddish orange, from July to August.|$|R
500|$|The {{yellow flowers}} appear {{in summer and}} autumn (December to May), peaking over January and February. They are {{arranged}} in leafy racemes, and each stem may <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to 50 flowers. P.linearis is described as auxotelic, which means each stalk bears an individual flower that is subtended by a leaf at its junction with the stem. Known as pedicels, these are covered in fine hair and measure 2–8mm in length. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The tepals are [...] long and covered in fine hair on the outside. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects visiting the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The flowers are followed by the development of smooth fleshy drupes, which are green and more or less round, measuring [...] in diameter. Mature drupes may have purple blotches. Each bears one or two seeds within a woody [...] "stone" [...] and is shed once ripe, generally from September to November.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, bales {{created on}} farms with mobile {{machinery}} {{have been used}} ("field-bales"), but recently higher-density [...] "recompressed" [...] bales (or [...] "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported; where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall, the high density bales <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to 4,000lb./lin.ft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{anterior}} thorax {{consists of}} eleven segments, each bearing {{a pair of}} appendages, called thoracopods or pereiopods. None of the thoracopods are modified into maxillipeds for feeding. The posterior thorax consists of 16–25 segments, incompletely separated to form rings. Each ring may consist {{of as many as}} six fused segments and <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to six pairs of appendages (there are 54–66 limbs altogether).|$|E

2500|$|According to Dewey, the {{successful}} classroom teacher occupies an indispensable passion for promoting the intellectual growth of young children. In addition, {{she knows that}} her career, in comparison to other professions, entails stressful situations, long hours and limited financial reward; {{all of which have}} the potential to overcome her genuine love and sympathy for her students. For Dewey, [...] "One of the most depressing phases of the vocation is the number of care worn teachers one sees, with anxiety depicted on the lines of their faces, reflected in their strained high pitched voices and sharp manners. While contact with the young is a privilege for some temperaments, it is a tax on others, and a tax which they do not <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> under very well. And in some schools, there are too many pupils to a teacher, too many subjects to teach, and adjustments to pupils are made in a mechanical rather than a human way. Human nature reacts against such unnatural conditions" [...] (Dewey, APT, 2101, p.35).|$|E

2500|$|Legend says in {{the early}} 16th century, the local Osage Indians were on a bear hunt, chasing two black bears along the White River until one went up a tree for safety. But a well placed arrow took it out. [...] They {{continued}} to chase the other <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> Roark Mountain, and the bear fell onto a ledge in the sinkhole. The hunting party didn't want to all jump down to kill the bear and have to drag it back up so, a brave young tribe member climbed down to the ledge with his hunting dog and knife. He stabbed the bear and the bear lunged back. The bear, dog and the boy fell through the sinkhole landing in the Cathedral Room. The Indians then looked down the hole and saw nothing. They heard strange sounds; echoing sounds of their voices, bats flying around, water trickling and they felt warm air, all of which made them {{think it was an}} evil place. The Indians thought they had found the entrance to Hades and named the cave the Devil's Den. [...] They marked trees around the Devil's Den with their danger sign (a sideways V), and never returned.|$|E
2500|$|In France, Villaret's {{failure to}} press his attack against Cornwallis's {{squadron}} was blamed {{on a number}} of factors, including accusations that the captains of the French ships leading the attack had deliberately disobeyed orders to engage the British and that they were unable to effectively manoeuvre their vessels. It was also insisted by several of the French officers present that the sails on the northwest horizon really had been Bridport's fleet and that this was the only factor that had induced them to disengage. Villaret placed much of the blame on Captain Jean Magnac of Zélé, whom he accused of withdrawing from the action prematurely and disobeying orders. Magnac was later court-martialed and dismissed from the French Navy. In Britain, the battle was celebrated {{as one of the most}} notable actions of the early years of the conflict, an attitude encouraged by the modesty of Cornwallis's dispatch to the Admiralty, which when describing how he had faced down an entire French fleet at the climax of the action wrote only that the French had [...] "made a Shew of a more ferious attack upon the Mars [...] [...] [...] and obliged me to <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> for her Support [...]" [...] He did however subsequently note of his men that ...|$|E
2500|$|The plant sprouts 5–11 {{white and}} non-photosynthetic leaves known as cataphylls. These membrane-like {{structures}} cover {{and protect the}} crocus's 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are , in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened ("hysteranthous") or do so simultaneously with their blooming ("synanthous"). C.sativus cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear bracteoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as pedicels. After aestivating in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to [...] in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve. The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are [...] in height and <b>bear</b> <b>up</b> to four flowers.
