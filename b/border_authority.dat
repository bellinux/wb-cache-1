25|$|The {{building}} of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 led over the following decades to heavy damage to the Church of the Redeemer. The barrier along {{the border between the}} East German Democratic Republic (GDR) and West Berlin was built straight across the lot of the church property and the campanile was used as part of the protective wall of concrete. The church nave stood in the foreland between wall and border. In spite of these circumstances, regular services were still held in the church until Christmas Eve 1961. A few days later, the church's interior, which stood in an area strictly controlled by the GDR border troops, was defiled – almost certainly by the troops. This way the church was made unserviceable. The <b>border</b> <b>authority</b> thus created a reason to seal off the church completely, in order to prevent any escape in that section of the border.|$|E

The judge offered a scathing critique of PIBA and suggested that racism was at work in PIBA's detaining a black Swedish citizen. In the proceeding PIBA had offered to release the tourist if she agreed to leave a deposit of 30,000 NIS. The judge called this proposal [...] "scandalous" [...] and ordered her immediate release. The judge commented on the implications of PIBA poor decision-making: “Officials of the respondent acted arbitrarily and in an extremely unreasonable manner,” he said. “Israel cannot be perceived {{in the world as}} preventing the entry of European citizens based solely on their ethnicity.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{voluntary}} deportations of some South Sudanese, {{at least two}} students from Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC) and the University of Tel Aviv sought to return in order to finish the studies. They received visas from the embassy in Ethiopia to return to Israel, but were later deported at Ben Gurion International Airport by the Population, Immigration and <b>Border</b> <b>Authority,</b> whose spokeswoman, Sabine Haddad, said that {{as they had been}} [...] "infiltrators" [...] they could were ineligible to return to the country and that as PIBA nor the Interior Ministry issued the visa the embassy's actions were erroneous and the Foreign Ministry was responsible. In turn the foreign ministry said that it was subcontracted to do the consular issues for the interior ministry outside the country and thus had the legal right to approve application while using the interior ministry's computer systems. The move followed an IDC campaign to revoke its student's deportation.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1 January 2013, unaccompagnied minors {{under the}} age of 18 who {{travelled}} outside metropolitan France using their French national identity cards were required to obtain an autorisation de sortie du territoire (AST). In order to obtain an AST, one of the minor's parents had to visit the local mayor's office. On 1 January 2013, the obligation to obtain an AST was removed, and all minors are now able solely to use their French national identity cards when leaving/re-entering France without a parent. However, whilst the French <b>border</b> <b>authorities</b> no longer require an AST from his/her parent when an unaccompagnied minor leaves/re-enters France, the <b>border</b> <b>authorities</b> of other countries may require the unaccompagnied minor to present some form of written approval from the his/her parent(s) before admitting him/her.|$|R

50|$|Border {{zones are}} areas where movement, {{property}} ownership or other activity is prohibited or restricted by legistlation. Unlike regular territory, border zones are under administrative {{control of the}} <b>border</b> <b>authorities.</b> Entrance is generally only with an individual permit. Entering a border zone without authorization is a crime or misdemeanor and grounds for arrest. Border zones are instituted to pinpoint illegal intruders, conceal and obscure and prevent interference with border security procedures and equipment, and thus aid border guards with their work. For example, Russia maintains sizable border zones.|$|R

In this paper we describe {{the development and implementation of}} this strategy of migration management, signaling implications of border externalization from the point of geopolitics and legality, including a suggestive call to reclaim the legal tradition of the Right to Migrate...|$|R
