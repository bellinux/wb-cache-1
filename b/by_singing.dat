5|$|The Germans placed {{candles on}} their {{trenches}} and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> Christmas carols. The British responded <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons and hats. The artillery {{in the region}} fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked {{too much or too}} loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|Faryl Smith (born 23 July 1995) is a British soprano {{who rose}} to fame after {{appearing}} on the second series of the ITV television talent show Britain's Got Talent in 2008. She received praise throughout the competition, and although the favourite to win after the second round, she finished outside the top three in the live final on 31 May. During the competition, she was tutored <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> coach Yvie Burnett and received offers from various record labels. After the show, she, unlike other finalists, did not sign with Simon Cowell's Syco, although she did appear on fellow finalist Andrew Johnston's debut album, One Voice.|$|E
5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied <b>by</b> <b>singing,</b> {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.|$|E
5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey was white and could entice victims onto its back <b>by</b> <b>singing.</b>|$|E

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males {{attract a}} mate <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> from regular {{positions}} {{at the edge of}} their territories throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard their territories year-round.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his tour}} of duty Nash had been wary of {{preferential}} treatment towards him due to his fame and opposed any attempts to promote him, which he believed he did not deserve. However, a jeep crash resulted in further injury to Nash's knees and ultimately led to a medical discharge from the Army on 18 February 1944. Following his return to Australia, Nash sold War Bonds and appeared at war-related charity functions, including one where he raised an additional £100 <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> to the large crowd.|$|E
5|$|His {{mother left}} {{soon after he}} was born, and his father {{remarried}} and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents. The Nelsons, who taught singing back in Arkansas, started their grandchildren in music. Nelson's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and with his sister Bobbie, he sang gospel songs in the local church. He wrote his first song at age seven, {{and when he was}} nine, played guitar for the local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton along with other citizens of Abbott. Nelson disliked picking cotton, so he earned money <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age 13, and continuing through high school. Nelson's musical influences were Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong.|$|E

5|$|In March 1952, Lawton joined Second Division side Brentford for a club record £16,000 fee. Manager Jackie Gibbons {{left the}} club {{at the start}} of the 1952–53 season and was succeeded by his {{assistant}} Jimmy Bain, who proved ill-suited to management, and so in January 1953 Lawton was appointed as player-manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and the strains of management were having a negative impact on his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of 104. They got off to a poor start to the 1953–54 season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> Dear Old Pals.|$|E
5|$|Marge asks Belle {{to close}} down the burlesque house, but Belle refuses, saying that {{the house is a}} part of Springfield. At a town meeting, Marge brings up the matter and shows {{pictures}} of several prominent citizens leaving. They form a mob so they can go destroy the burlesque house. The mob arrives at the house and immediately starts destroying things. Bart and Homer arrive and Homer decides to try to convince the mob to stop. He does so <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> a musical number accompanied by Belle and some of her dancers. The town soon joins in and are convinced to let the house stay. However, Marge arrives with a bulldozer, having missed the song. The town announces their intentions to let the house stay, but Marge tries to sing her own song about her views. During the opening lines, she accidentally puts the bulldozer into drive and destroys a wing of the burlesque house. She apologizes profusely and, to pay for the damage, she starts a ventriloquist act at the house.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game. It quickly becomes clear that Jerry and Donna know much more about each other than the recently married Andy and April. When April reveals her favorite band is Neutral Milk Hotel and not Andy's band Mouse Rat, Andy angrily leaves the game and they later have a big fight which causes him to quit his music. April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to be supportive of Andy no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E

5|$|Performers {{are first}} trained in acrobatics, {{followed}} <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> and gestures. Several performing schools, {{all based on}} the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school. Students previously trained exclusively {{in the art of}} performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians. They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe. In Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking-opera training school.|$|E
5|$|Ramayana narrates: Tara {{says that}} Sugriva is mindful that through Rama, Sugriva has gained the kingship, Ruma and herself. She defends Sugriva saying that even great sage Vishwamitra was tempted by pleasure, Sugriva—a mere forest {{dwelling}} monkey—is fatigued by his past hardships and is relaxing, but not partaking in carnal pleasures. Tara informs Sugriva that Vali {{told her that}} Ravana is a mighty king with several rakshasas in his service. She reminds Lakshmana that without an ally like Sugriva, Rama cannot defeat such a powerful foe. Tara informs him that Sugriva has summoned all monkey commanders and troops to the capital. Adhyatma Ramayana also presents a similar description, where Tara, Angada and Hanuman are sent by Sugriva to calm Lakshmana. In a condensed one-verse description, Ramacharitamanasa says that Tara and Hanuman were dispatched by Sugriva and were successful in appeasing Lakshmana <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> Rama's praises. In Ramavataram, though not Sugriva's consort, Tara pacifies Lakshamana. The usual epithet of Tara, lustrous as the moon, in Ramavataram signifies her white clothes, {{the sign of a}} widow. Lakshmana is reminded of his own widowed mother seeing Tara.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} {{that if they}} can find the Isolus pod and provide it power, the alien will leave Chloe. A frantic Chloe draws the TARDIS and the Doctor, trapping them both {{in one of her}} sketches and forcing Rose to try to find the pod herself. She rationalises that the pod is located on the hottest spot on the street, a patch of freshly laid tar, and is able to dig it up. Meanwhile, Chloe has caused the entire crowd at the Olympic stadium to disappear and now is set on making everyone in the world disappear. Rose tries {{to find out how to}} power the pod, and uses visual indications from the Doctor's picture to understand that the pod needs heat mixed with emotion. Rose throws the pod towards the Olympic Torch - a symbol of hope, courage, and love - as it passes down the street. The missing children and the crowd at the Olympics reappear, and Rose realises that the drawing Chloe had made of her father will similarly come to life. Rose and Chloe's mother are able to calm Chloe <b>by</b> <b>singing</b> the Kookaburra song, causing the unseen monster - having fed off of Chloe's emotions and fears - to disappear.|$|E
