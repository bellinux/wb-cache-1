The development process for the final joint details includes: (1) eliminating two identified structural deficiencies of distortion in column web panel and strain concentrations in the external diaphragms; (2) creating a multi-fuse energy dissipation mechanism; (3) devising a joint to delay onset of beam yielding. Two external diaphragm collar plates are welded to the circumference of the CHS column for connection to <b>beam</b> <b>flanges.</b> Various collar ring widths are examined for these horizontal diaphragms and a width (based on achieving full strength of the <b>beam</b> <b>flanges)</b> is found to produce an acceptable web panel performance. Different types of stiffener geometries in the connection region are then trialed to eliminate strain concentrations in the diaphragms. Two pairs of triangular diaphragm stiffeners are found to provide the desired performance. In order to produce a multi-fuse energy dissipation mechanism, tapered cover plates (TCPs) equipped with vertical stiffeners (VSs) are integrated into the joint. Oversized web holes of 4 – 10 mm are required to enable inelastic deformation for an overall joint rotation of 60 – 100 mrad, without undesirable web distortion. Further FE analyses are used to design the TCPs and VSs so they can be replaceable link post-seismic actions. For the final joint detailing it is shown that 6 mm oversized holes for the TCPs will delay the occurrence of yielding in the beam until the joint rotation is 70 mrad...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Steel moment {{frames are}} common systems in {{multi-storey}} buildings. Even {{the relatively low}} stiffness of the system limits the applicability, they remain popular in seismic applications due to the good dissipation capacity. Considered deemed-to-comply in seismic applications, welded beam to column connections experienced serious damages and even failures during strong seismic earthquakes. These failures included fractures of the <b>beam</b> flange-to-column <b>flange</b> groove welds, cracks in <b>beam</b> <b>flanges,</b> and cracks through the column section. To {{reduce the risk of}} brittle failure of welded connections, beam weakening near the ends became popular. To assure the desired behavior, i. e. the development of plastic deformations in the reduced beam section zones rather than at the face of the column, proper detailing and sizing is necessary. Today design provisions are limited to long beams, where the effect of shear stresses may be neglected. The application of the same rules for short beams might be non-conservative, and therefore qualification testing is necessary. The study presents the qualification testing of reduced beam sections welded connections of short beams. Both monotonic and cyclic tests were performed and numerical models were validated based on the test data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new type of splice joint, named flange bolted-welded hybrid joint, which is {{designed}} to splice I-shape beam to facilitate the construction of industrialized buildings. The flange, welded with the bottom <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> as well as the web close to bottom flange, are jointed by high strength bolts. Stiffening plate is welded at top of the flange while downhand welding and high strength friction grip bolts are used for the top <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> and the beam web, respectively. The connection reduces the construction period and costs. In this paper, monotonic and reversed cyclic loading tests were conducted on three full-scale specimens of this innovative joint, to investigate its load-bearing capacity, energy-dissipating capacity and failure modes. The results indicate that the joint has high load-bearing capacity and great ductility. The failure mode is due to the slippage of flange bolts as well as the gap development between the two flange plates. The experimental studies enabled improvement of the design of the connection to be used in moment-resisting steel frame structures.

External stiffeners around the columns are used at the <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> levels. Five specimens are tested monotonically. The test parameters are the column stiffener dimensions and filling the steel tube column with concrete. Two types of failure modes are observed; <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> failure and stiffener failure. The experimental {{results show that the}} ultimate moment of the connection is increased by increasing stiffener’s dimensions and filling the steel tube column with concrete.

Analytical results that are in fair agreement with the experimental ones are then used to discuss the influence of the main geometric parameters on the connection behavior. The parameters are the stiffener and column dimensions as well as filling the steel tube column with concrete. Different square column cross sections are chosen to cover the three classes of section classifications according to Egyptian code of practice, which are: compact, non compact or slender. The increase in the ultimate moment of the connections is based upon both column cross sections’ compactness and stiffener dimensions while the maximum advantages occur with slender columns...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of non-linear finite element analyses on two types of improved steel moment-resisting connections, either reinforced with cover plates or weakened with RBS detail: the aim is to protect the potentially vulnerable beam-to-column groove welded joint by relocating the plastic hinge away {{from the face of the}} column. The investigation is based on results from experimental tests carried out on a two-storey steel frame tested at Ispra and involves the modeling of the 3 -way beam-to-column joints. Numerical analyses on reinforced joints show that fracture indices decrease in the weld region and near the weld access hole respect to the unreinforced connection, but high values of the Triaxiality Index are registered in the weld at the column interface. In order to eliminate the high shear stress in the <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> and to reduce the high triaxial stress condition at the beam flange-column flange interface, the <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> was disconnected from the column flange. The reduced beam section detail provided both in the top and bottom beam flanges reduces the vulnerability of the connection to the occurrence of a fracture near the weld: yielding is concentrated within the reduced section of the beam where large inelastic strains are registered...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using reduced flange plates (RFPs) or rib plates for seismic response of steel moment connections was investigated through cyclic testing of six full-scale specimens. The first scheme utilized RFPs {{to connect the}} beam flanges to the column, without any direct connection of the <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> to the column. Plastic hinges were forced to form in the RFPs instead of the steel beam due to strong beam-weak RFPs, so the weakened moment connection eliminated buckling of the beam and reduced cost of repairing after earthquakes. The second scheme was to strengthen a connection, which was removed from an existing 33 -story steel building, by welding rib plates between the column face and inner side of the beam flanges. Test results of the weakened connections showed that (1) the connections developed beam plastic moment and reach more than an interstory drift of 4 % without strength degradation, (2) the RFP was effective in dissipating energy before buckling, and (3) no buckling of the beam was observed. Test results of the strengthened connection showed that the rib plates significantly reduced the <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> strain by 75 % compared to a non-retrofitted steel moment connection.

The ultimate moment capacities from the tests and finite element analyses were compared with currently available design standards: AS/NZS 4600, AS 4100 and AISI S 100.
