40|$|Particle fluxes in the {{radiation}} belts can vary dramatically during geomagnetic active periods. Transport and wave-particle interactions {{are believed to}} be the two main types of mechanisms that control {{the radiation}} belt dynamics. Major transport processes include substorm dipolarization and injection, radial diffusion, convection, adiabatic acceleration and deceleration, and magnetopause shadowing. Energetic electrons and ions are also subjected to pitch-angle and energy diffusion when interact with plasma waves in the radiation belts. Important wave modes include whistler mode chorus waves, plasmaspheric hiss, electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, and magnetosonic waves. We investigate the relative roles of transport and wave associated processes in radiation belt variations. Energetic electron fluxes during several storms are simulated using our Radiation Belt Environment (RBE) model. The model includes important transport and wave processes such as substorm dipolarization in global MHD fields, chorus waves, and plasmaspheric hiss. We discuss the effects of these competing processes at different phases of the storms and validate the results by comparison with satellite and ground-based observations.

40|$|International audienceSince Deccan Traps {{extrusion}} ~ 65 Ma ago, thick weathering mantles {{have developed}} over Peninsular India {{on both the}} western coastal lowland and adjacent plateau separated by the Western Ghats Escarpment. Manganiferous lateritic profiles formed by supergene weathering of Late Archean manganiferous protores are exposed on paleolandsurface remnants {{on both sides of}} the escarpment. Petrological and geochemical characterizations of samples from those Mn lateritic profiles allowed identifying cryptomelane (K-Mn oxide) dated by 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology.

The total survey area was 1. 5 deg^ 2 near ecliptic plane {{and close to the}} opposition. We detected 150 MBAs with 4 bands (B, V, R, I) in this survey. The range of absolute magnitude of detected asteroids was between 13 and 22 magnitude, which is equivalent to the size range of kilometer to sub-kilometer diameter in MBAs. From this observation, 75 of 150 MBAs with color uncertainty less than 0. 1 were used in the spectral type analysis, and two possible Q-type aster- oids were detected. This mean that the Q-type to S-type ratio in MBAs is < 0. 05. Meanwhile, the Q/S ratio in near Earth asteroids (NEAs) has been estimated to be 0. 5 to 2 (Binzel et al., 2004; Dandy et al., 2003).

40|$|International audienceMost shields of the {{tropical}} belt show extended lateritic landform relicts, which result fromconjugated chemical weathering and mechanical erosion processes over the Cenozoic. After DeccanTraps extrusion ca. 65 m. y. ago, Peninsular India has been shaped by successive periods of lateriticweathering and erosion {{on both sides of}} the Western Ghats escarpment (WGE), which separates acoastal lowland from a highland plateau. The weathering periods are documented from 40 Ar/ 39 Ardating of K-Mn oxides (cryptomelane, Kx Mn 8 -xIV MnxIII O 16, nH 2 O) formed in Mn ore deposits and Fe-Mn lateritic weathering profiles, which are developed from Archean supracrustal rocks and exposedon stepped remnants of paleolandsurfaces on either side of the escarpment. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar agesobtained document three major weathering periods [1], ca. 53 - 45 Ma both in the highland and thelowland, ca. 37 - 24 Ma only in the highland [2], and ca. 24 - 19 Ma only in the lowland [3]. These ages’series document evolving geomorphic and climatic patterns on either side of the WGE over theCenozoic. The intense lateritic weathering at 53 - 45 Ma and 37 - 24 Ma reflect the Early Eocene optimum and theonset of Asian monsoon regimes, when the peninsula drifted across the equatorial <b>belt.</b> Synchronousearly Eocene <b>weathering</b> {{on both sides of the}} WGE and the preservation of laterites as old as 47 Maon its piedmont attests to the stabilization of this marginal escarpment before that time, and furtherdocuments a slow denudation of the lowland since then [3]. The ages series also indicate that thehighland landsurfaces were mostly dissected after ca. 24 Ma, while little incision affected thelowland after ca. 19 Ma.

40|$|AbstractThe lack of new gold {{discoveries in}} recent times has {{prompted}} suggestions that Tanzania is mature or approaching maturity, in terms of gold exploration. New tectonic–metallogenic subdivisions proposed {{in this study are}} used to explain gold-endowment, assess gold exploration maturity, and suggest the potential for new discoveries from the following three regions: 1) the Lake Victoria Region, comprising the gold-endowed East Lake Victoria and Lake Nyanza Superterranes of 3. 11 Ga continental crust. These superterranes are separated by the gold-poor, Mwanza–Lake Eyasi Superterrane, comprising deeply eroded and/or exhumed terranes of gneissic-granulite belts and widespread granitoid plutons; 2) the Central Tanzania Region, comprising the Moyowosi–Manyoni Superterrane, which is largely composed of granitoid and migmatitic–gneissic terranes, and the Dodoma Basement and Dodoma Schist Superterranes, these are underlain by extensive, > 3. 2 Ga migmatitic-gneisses and granitoid belts with interspersed, relatively narrow, < 2. 85 Ga greenschist–amphibolite facies greenstone and schist belts. The Central Tanzania Region also includes the East Ubendian–Mtera Superterrane, comprising the East Ubendian Terrane of predominantly Paleoproterozoic belts with cryptic Archean age components, and the ~ 2. 85 – 3. 0 Ga Isanga–Mtera Terrane of thrust-transported migmatitic ortho- and para-gneisses; and 3) Proterozoic Tanzania Regions, comprising various Archean terranes which were once sutured to the Tanzania Craton prior to later Proterozoic orogenic and tectonic events that separated them from the craton and thermally reworked them. These include the Archean Nyakahura–Burigi Terrane in the Northwestern Tanzania Proterozoic Orogen and the Kilindi–Handeni Superterrane in the Southern East African Orogen of Tanzania. The major metallogenic significance of the new tectonic subdivisions is the recognition of under-explored belts: 1) in the gold-endowed East Lake Victoria and Lake Nyanza Superterranes, Lake Victoria Region. Here deeply <b>weathered</b> <b>belts</b> in the Musoma–Kilimafedha, Kahama–Mwadui and Nzega–Sekenke Terranes and belts, situated in tectono-thermally reworked crustal blocks such as the Iaida–Haidon, Singida–Mayamaya and Mara–Mobrama Terranes, are predicted to be prospective; 2) in the Dodoma Basement Superterrane, Central Tanzania Region, where relatively thin, juvenile granitoid-greenstone belts, similar to the ~ 2815 – 2660 Ma Mazoka Belt in the Undewa–Ilangali Terrane, contain small-scale gold systems with analogous terrane-scale geologic settings and evolution histories to those of gold-hosting greenstone belts in the Sukumaland Terrane, Lake Victoria Region. The overall geologic–geometric setting of the greenstone belts in the Central Tanzania Region (Mazoka-type) is comparable to those of the gold-hosting juvenile granitoid-greenstone belts in the South West and Youanmi Terranes, Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, and North Superior and North Caribou Superterrane, northwestern Superior Craton, Canada; and 3) in the Proterozoic Tanzanian Regions, where terranes that lie in close geographic proximity and regional strike extension to the gold-endowed Lake Nyanza Superterrane are likely to be most prospective. They include the Archean Nyakahura–Burigi Terrane in unroofed thrust windows of the Mesoproterozoic Karagwe–Ankolean Belt of northwestern Tanzania, and the Kilindi–Handeni Superterrane where Archean proto-crust has been reworked by Pan-African tectonothermal events in the Southern East African Orogen...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of energization of particles (both electrons and ions) to tens and hundreds of keV and the associated transport process in the magnetotail during substorms. Particles energized in the magnetotail are further accelerated to even higher energies (hundreds of keV to MeV) in the radiation <b>belts,</b> causing space <b>weather</b> hazards to human activities in space and on ground. We develop an analytical model to quantitatively estimate flux changes caused by betatron and Fermi acceleration when particles are transported along narrow high-speed flow channels from the magnetotail to the inner magnetosphere. The model shows that energetic particle flux can be significantly enhanced by a modest compression of the magnetic field and/or shrinking of {{the distance between the}} magnetic mirror points. We use coordinated spacecraft measurements, global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations driven by measured upstream solar wind conditions, and large-scale kinetic (LSK) simulations to quantify electron local acceleration in the near-Earth reconnection region and nonlocal acceleration during plasma earthward transport. Compared to the analytical model, application of the LSK simulations is much less restrictive because trajectories of millions of test particles are calculated in the realistically determined global MHD fields and the results are statistical. The simulation results validated by the observations show that electrons following a power law distribution at high energies are generated earthward of the reconnection site, and {{that the majority of the}} energetic electrons observed in the inner magnetosphere are caused by adiabatic acceleration in association with magnetic dipolarizations and fast flows during earthward transport. We extend the global MHD+LSK simulations to examine ion energization and compare it with electron energization. The simulations demonstrate that ions in the magnetotail are first nonadiabatically accelerated in the weak field region close to the reconnection site, and then adiabatically accelerated in the high-speed flow channels as they catch up with and ride on the earthward propagating dipolarization structures. The nonlocal adiabatic acceleration mechanism for ions is very similar to that for electrons. However, the motion of energetic electrons is adiabatic except in very limited regions near the reconnection site while the motion of energetic ions is marginally adiabatic in the dipolarization regions. The simulations also show that the earthward transport of both species is controlled by the high-speed flows via the dominant ExB drift in the magnetotail. To understand how the power law electrons are initially produced in the magnetotail, we use an implicit particle-in-cell (PIC) code to model the processes in the near-Earth reconnection region. We find that the power law electrons are produced not in the reconnection diffusion region, but in the immediate downstream of the reconnection outflow in the course of dipolarization formation and intensification. Our study illustrates that during substorms, particles are accelerated via a multi-step process, including local acceleration in the reconnection region and nonlocal acceleration during the earthward transport, and the multi-step acceleration occurs on multiple spatial scales ranging from a few kilometers (the scale of electron diffusion region) to more than ten Earth radii (the transport scale) ...|$|R
40|$|New {{measurements}} of the low-temperature near-infrared absorption of methane (Sihra, 1998, Laboratory {{measurements of}} near-infrared methane bands for remote sensing of the jovian atmosphere, Ph. D. thesis, University of Oxford) have been combined with existing, longer path-length, higher-temperature data of Strong et al. (1993, Spectral parameters of self- and hydrogen-broadened methane from 2000 to 9500 cm - 1 for remote sounding of the atmosphere of Jupiter, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 50, 309 – 325) and fitted with band models. The combined data set {{is found to be}} more consistent with previous low-temperature methane absorption measurements than that of Strong et al. (1993, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Trans. 50, 309 – 325) but covers the same wider wavelength range and accounts for both self- and hydrogen-broadening conditions. These data have been fitted with k- coefficients in the manner described by Irwin et al. (1996, Calculated k- distribution coefficients for hydrogen- and self-broadened methane in the range 2000 – 9500 cm - 1 from exponential sum fitting to band modelled spectra, J. Geophys. Res. 101, 26, 137 – 26, 154) and have been used in multiple-scattering radiative transfer models to assess their impact on our previous estimates of the jovian cloud structure obtained from Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) observations (Irwin et al., 1998, Cloud structure and atmospheric composition of Jupiter retrieved from Galileo NIMS real-time spectra, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 23, 001 – 23, 021; Irwin et al., 2001, The origin of belt/zone contrasts in the atmosphere of Jupiter and their correlation with 5 -μm opacity, Icarus 149, 397 – 415; Irwin and Dyudina, 2002, The retrieval of cloud structure maps in the equatorial region of Jupiter using a principal component analysis of Galileo/NIMS data, Icarus 156, 52 – 63). Although significant differences in methane opacity are found at cooler temperatures, the difference in the optical depth of the atmosphere due to methane is found to diminish rapidly with increasing pressure and temperature and thus has negligible effect on the cloud structure inferred at deeper levels. Hence the main cloud opacity variation is still found to peak at around 1 – 2 bar using our previous analytical approach, and is thus still in disagreement with Galileo Solid State Imager (SSI) determinations (Banfield et al., 1998, Jupiter's cloud structure from Galileo imaging data, Icarus 135, 230 – 250; Simon-Miller et al., 2001, Color and the vertical structure in Jupiter's <b>belts,</b> zones and <b>weather</b> systems, Icarus 154, 459 – 474) which place the main cloud deck near 0. 9 bar. Further analysis of our retrievals reveals that this discrepancy is probably due to the different assumptions of the two analyses. Our retrievals use a smooth vertically extended cloud profile while the SSI determinations assume a thin NH 3 cloud below an extended haze. When the main opacity in our model is similarly assumed to be due to a thin cloud below an extended haze, we find the main level of cloud opacity variation to be near the 1 bar level—close to that determined by SSI and moderately close to the expected condensation level of ammonia ice of 0. 85 bar, assuming that the abundance of ammonia on Jupiter is (7 ± 1) × 10 − 4 (Folkner et al., 1998, Ammonia abundance in Jupiter's atmosphere derived from the attenuation of the Galileo probe's radio signal, J. Geophys. Res. 103, 		 22, 847 – 22, 855; Atreya et al., 1999, A comparison of the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn: deep atmospheric composition, cloud structure, vertical mixing, and origin, Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1243 – 1262). However our data in the 1 – 2. 5 μm range have good height discrimination and our lowest estimate of the cloud base pressure of 1 bar is still too great to be consistent with the most recent estimates of the ammonia abundance of 3. 5 × solar. Furthermore the observed limited spatial distribution of ammonia ice absorption features on Jupiter suggests that pure ammonia ice is only present in regions of localised vigorous uplift (Baines et al., 2002, Fresh ammonia ice clouds in Jupiter: spectroscopic identification, spatial distribution, and dynamical implications, Icarus 159, 74 – 94) and is subsequently rapidly modified in some way which masks its pure absorption features. Hence we conclude that the main cloud deck on Jupiter is unlikely to be composed of pure ammonia ice and instead find that it must be composed of either NH 4 SH or some other unknown combination of ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulphide and exists at pressures of between 1 and 2 bar. </p...|$|R
40|$| model which {{includes}} weather impacts {{in form of}} sum of precipitations SUMPit, RPM is random parameter model that {{does not account for}} <b>weather</b> impacts, <b>KIT</b> is random parameter model that includes climatic index KITit into the mean of inefficiency. All estimated models fullfilled the conditions of monotonicity and kvasikonvexity for each production factor with the exception of capital in FMM, AVT, SUMP and RPM model. Violating the kvasikonvexity condition is against the theoretical assumptions the models are based on, however, since capital is also insignificant, it is not necesary to regard model as incorrect specification. Violation of kvasikonvexity condition can be caused by the presence of other factor, which might have contraproductive influence on final production in relation to capital. For example, Cechura and Hockann (2014) mention imperfections of capital market as possible cause of inadequate use of this production factor with respect to technological change. Insufficient significancy of capital can be the result of incorrect specification of variable itself, as capital is defined as investment depreciation and sum of contract work in the whole production process and not only capital related to crop production. The importance of capital in relation to crop production is, thus, not strong enough to be significant. Except of capital are all other production factors significant on the significancy level of 0, 01. All estimated models exhibit a common pattern as far as production elasticity is concerned. The highest elasticity is attributed to production factors specific and othe material. Production elasticity of specific material reaches values of 0, 29 - 0, 38, the highest in model KIT and lowest of the values in model AVT. Production elasticity of other material reahed even higher values in the range 0, 40 - 0, 47. Highest elasticity of othe material was estimated by model AVT and lowest by model KIT. Lowest production elasticity are attributed to production factors labour and land. Labour reached elasticity between 0, 006 and 0, 129 and land reached production elasticity in the range of 0, 114 a 0, 129. All estimated models displayed simmilar results regarding production elasticities of production factors, which also correspond with theoretical presumptions about production elasticities [...] highest values of elasticity of material inputs correspond with naturally high flexibility of these production factors, while lowest values of elasticity of land corresponds with theoretical aspect of land as relativelly inelastic production factor. Low production elasticity of labour was explained as a result of lower labor intensity of cereals sector compared to other sectors. Production elasticity of weather is significant both in form of average temperatures between planting and harvest in a given region, AVTit, and form of total precipitation between planting and harvest in a given region, SUMPit. Production elasticity of AVTit, reach rather high value of 0, 3691, which is in the same level as production elasticities of material inputs. Production elasticity of SUMPit is also significant and reach rather high lower value of 0, 1489. Both parameters shows significant impact of weather on the level of final crop production. Sum of production elasticities in all models reach the values around 1, indicating constant returns of scale, RS (RSRPM= 1, 0064, RSKIT= 0, 9738, RSSUMP = 1, 00002, RSFMM= 0, 9992, RSAVT= 1, 0018.). The results correspond with the conclusion of Cechura (2009) and Cechura and Hockmann (2014) about the constant returns of scale in cereals sector in Czech republic. Since the value of RS is calculated only with the use of production elasticities of production factors, almost identical result provided by all three specifications of fixed management model is a proof of correct model specification. Further, the significance of technological change and its impact on final production and production elasticities were reviewed. Technological change, TCH, represents changes in production technology over time through reported period. It is commonly assumed that there is improvement on production technology over time. All estimated models prooved significant impact of TCH on the level of final production. All specified fixed management models indicate positive impaact of TCH, which accelerates over time. Estimated random parameter models gave contradicting results [...] model KIT implies that TCH is negative and decelerating in time, while model RPM indicates positive impact of TCH on the level of final production, which is also decelerating in time. It was concluded, that in case that weather is not included into model, it can have a direct impact on the positive direction of TCH effect, which can be captured by implementing weather into model and so the TCH becomes negative. However, as to be discussed later, random parameter model appeared not as a suitable specification for analyzed relationship and so the estimate of the TCH impact might have been distorted. The impact of technological progress on the production elasticities (so-called biased technological change) is in fixed management models displayed by parameters representing the interaction of production factors with trend variable. The hypothesis of time invariant parameters (Hicks neutral technological change) associated with the production factors is rejected for all models except the model AVT. Significant baised technological change is confirmed for models FMM and SUMP. Biased technological change is other material-saving and specific material-intensive. In the AVT model, where weather is represented by average temperatures, AVTit, technological change is not significant in relation to any production factors. In both random parameter models, rejection of hypothesis of time invariant parameters only confirms significance of technological change in relation to final crop production. Nonsignificant effect of technological change on production elasticity of labor, land and capital indicates a generally low ability of farmers to respond to technological developments, which can be explained by two reasons. The first reason can the possible complications in adaptation to the conditions of the EU common agricultural market (eg. there are not created adequate conditions in the domestic market, which {{would make it easier for}} farmers to integrate into the EU). This assumption is based on conclusion made by Cechura and Hockmann (2014), where they explain the fact that in number of European countries there is capital-saving technological change instead of expected capital-using technical change as the effect of serious adjustment problems, including problems in the capital market [...] Second possible reason for nonsignificant effect of technological change on production elasticity of labor, land and capital is that the financial support of agricultural sector, which was supposed to create sufficient conditions for accomodation of technological progress, has not shown yet. Then, the biased TCH is not pronounced in relation to most production factors. Weather impacts (SUMPit, AVTit) are not in significant relation to technological change. Both types of models, FMM and RPM were discussed in relation to the presence of the heterogeneity effects All estimated random parameters in both RPM models are statistically significant with the exception of the production factor capital in a model that does not involve the influence of weather (model RPM). Estimated parameter for variable KITit (0, 0221) shows significant positive impact of the weather on the distribution of TE. That way, heterogeneity in relation to TE is confirmed, too, as well as significant impact of weather on the level of TE. Management (production environment) is significant in all three estimated fixed management models. In models that include weather impacts (AVT, SUMP), the parameter estimates indicates positive, slightly decreasing effect of management (or heterogeneity, respectivelly) on the level of final crop production. In model FMM, on the contrary, first and second order parameters of mangement indicate also significant, but negative and decelerating effect of management (heterogeneity) on final crop production. If weather impact is included into models in form of AVTit, or. SUMPit, the direction of the influence of management on the level of final crop production changes. Based on the significance of first order parameter of management, significant presence of heterogeneity of analyzed sample is confirmed in all three estimated fixed management models. As far as the effect of heterogeneity on single production factors (so called management bias) is concerned, the results indicate that in case of model that does not include weather impacts (model FMM) the heterogeneity has positive impact on production elasticities of land and capital and negative effect on the production elasticities of material inputs. In models that account for weather impacts, heterogeneity has negative effect on production elasticities of land and capital and positive effect on the elasticity of material inputs. Heterogeneity effect on the production elasticity of labor is insignificant in all models FMM. In all three estimated models, the effect of heterogeneity is strongest in case of production factors specific and othe material, and, also, on production factor land. In case of FMM model, heterogeneity leads to increase of production elasticity of land, while in AVT and SUMP heterogeneity leads to decrease of production elasticity of land. At the same time, the production elasticity of land, as discussed earlier, is rather low in all three models. This fact leads to a conclusion that in models that accomodate weather impacts (AVT and SUMP), as the effect of extraction of weather from the sources of unmeasured heterogeneity, the heterogeneity has a negative impact on production elasticity of land. It can be stated that the inclusion of weather effects into the sources of unmeasured heterogeneity overestimated the positive effect of unmeasured heterogeneity on the production factor land in the model FMM. Management does not have a significant effect on the weather in form of SUMPit, while it has significant and negative effect on the weather in form of average temperature, AVTit, with the value of - 0. 0622 **. In other words, heterogeneity is in negative interaction with weather represented by average temperatures, while weather in form of the sum of precipitation (SUMPit) does not exhibit significant relation to unmeasured heteregeneity. In comparison with the model that does not include weather impacts, the effect of heterogeneity on the production elasticities has the opposite direction the models that include weather. Compare to the model where weather is represented by average temperature (model AVT), the effect of management (heterogeneity) on the production elasticity of capital is bigger in model with weather represented by sum of precipitations (model SUMP) while the effect of management (heterogeneity) on the production elasticity of land and material imputs is smaller in model with weather represented by sum of precipitations (model SUMP). Technical efficiency is significant in all estimated models. The variability of inefficiency effects is bigger than the variabilty of random error in both models that include weather and models where weather impacts are not specified. The average of TE in random parametr models reaches rather low value (setting the average TE = 54 %), which indicates, that specified RPM models underestimate TE as a possible result of incorrect variable specification, or, incorrect assumptions on the distribution of the error term representing inefficiency. All estimated FMM models results in simmilar value of average TE (86 - 87 %) with th...|$|R
