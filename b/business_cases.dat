Councillor Clive McGregor was optimistic this could provide an economic stimulus for Anglesey, along with further proposals to extend passenger traffic between Llangefni and Amlwch.

The process ends on investment approval while others scholars call for a continuous <b>business</b> <b>case</b> process used throughout the entire investment life cycle.

With investment costs of about 4. 7 million dollars and annual operating costs of about 1. 3 million, we needed to determine if the machines would provide enough cost savings and cost avoidance. We constructed a model of the existing factory environment consisting of 8 machines and subsequently, we conducted average day simulations with light and heavy volumes to facilitate planning decisions required to be documented and substantiated in the <b>business</b> <b>case.</b> Keywords—Investment cost, <b>business</b> <b>case,</b> return on investment, simulation.
