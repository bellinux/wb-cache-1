This paper considered {{the impact of}} a stylized reduction of 10% in the then existing marginal rate of federal income tax in the US (for example, if those facing a 25% marginal federal income tax rate had it lowered to 22.5%). Unlike earlier research, the CBO paper estimates the <b>budgetary</b> <b>impact</b> of possible macroeconomic effects of tax policies, that is, it attempts to account for how reductions in individual income tax rates might affect the overall future growth of the economy, and therefore influence future government tax revenues; and ultimately, impact deficits or surpluses. In the paper's most generous estimated growth scenario, only 28% of the projected lost revenue from the lower tax rate would be recouped over a 10-year period after a 10% across-the-board reduction in all individual income tax rates. In other words, deficits would increase by nearly the same amount as the tax cut in the first five years, with limited feedback revenue thereafter. Through increased budget deficits, the tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy will be paid for—plus interest—by taxes borne relatively evenly by all taxpayers. The paper points out that these projected shortfalls in revenue would have to be made up by federal borrowing: the paper estimates that the federal government would pay an extra US$200 billion in interest over the decade covered by the paper's analysis.|$|E

40|$|This study {{illustrates}} the importance for policymakers of long-termbudget impact analyses of preventive health policies, specifically those aimed at obesity prevention. The study recommends that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the {{agency responsible for}} estimating costs of proposed federal legislation, develop the capacity to estimate the costs of these policies over a 75 -year horizon. Obesity rates have doubled among adults in {{the last twenty years}} and tripled among children in a single generation. Evidence suggests that by 2040 roughly half the adult population may be obese. Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, and many other diseases and conditions. These associated conditions carry high financial costs and can be devastating to quality of life. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as $ 210 billion annually, or 21 percent of total national health care spending. When also accounting for the nonmedical costs of obesity, the overall annual cost is estimated to be $ 450 billion. The Institute of Medicine and other scientific bodies have identified evidence-based strategies for addressing the childhood obesity epidemic. One impediment to pursuing obesity prevention policies at the federal level lies in how their <b>budgetary</b> <b>impacts</b> are assessed. CBO generally uses a ten-year budget window, but effective preventive health measures can have long-run <b>budgetary</b> <b>impacts</b> that differ greatly from their ten-year projections. In fact, very little of the federal savings they induce may be captured in the first decade, especially if an intervention is geared toward children or young adults and yields meaningful impacts on health care costs for individuals receiving Medicare decades in the future. In addition to distorting policymakers' understanding of the net cost of preventive health policies, a narrow budget window also fails to distinguish between effective and ineffective interventions. Because a ten-year window misses most or all of the savings from an effective obesity prevention policy, a tenyear cost estimate for such a policy would not differ from a ten-year estimate for an ineffective one. This study constructs an illustrative model of the long-term budget impact of obesity prevention policies, accounting for the Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and tax effects of preventing obesity. The model demonstrates the complexities involved in reaching a long-term cost estimate. Using four obesity prevention policies and programs as examples, the model generates lifetime (i. e., 75 -year) percapita savings estimates for different types of people. In so doing, it makes it possible to compare the discrepancy between 75 -year and ten-year cost estimates of a policy to prevent obesity...|$|R

Methods One hundred randomly selected charts from each of 13 Diabetes Centres audited between 1997 and 2001 were extracted from the Diabetes Care Program of Nova Scotia Registry. Multivariate logistic regression analyses examined the relationship between individual characteristics and self-reported antihypertensive use. Included were 1132 adults, mean age 63 years (48 % male), with 9 years mean time since diagnosis of diabetes. Results According to the 1992 guidelines, 63 % of the patients and according to the 2003 guidelines, 84 % of patients were above target blood pressure or receiving antihypertensive medications. Forty-seven percent of patients are considered to be hypertensive and not on treatment according to 2003 guidelines.
