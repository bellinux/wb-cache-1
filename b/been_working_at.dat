5|$|This story occurs {{before the}} events of the war that brought the world to ruin; at this point, Yumemi has <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> the Flowercrest Department Store's rooftop planetarium for about ten years. One day, Yumemi begins to act strangely, {{culminating}} in her simply walking out and wandering around the town. The staff of the planetarium are bewildered, and one of the workers—a woman named Satomi Kurahashi—is ordered to go follow Yumemi and bring her back. Before long, Yumemi begins to run out of battery power.|$|E

5|$|Chapman {{was still}} working at the coke works in Selby when his ban was imposed, but by Christmas 1920 the company was sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was {{approached}} by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, {{who had been a}} former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had not been in charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.|$|E
5|$|Quentin Tarantino had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Video Archives, a {{video store}} in Manhattan Beach, California, and {{originally}} planned {{to shoot the}} film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16mm black-and-white format, with producer Lawrence Bender playing a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked it enough to sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth.|$|E
5|$|Soemanang had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> the Tjaja Timoer newspaper, while Sipahoetar was an {{employee}} for a Dutch advertisement agency.

Soemanang named the agency Antara based on Perantaraan, a weekly magazine he had previously established in Bogor. He became its editor-in-chief, while Sipahoetar became a senior editor. Antara's first news bulletin reporting its own establishment, was reprinted in the newspapers Perasaan Kita on 14 December 1937 and Kebangoenan the following day.

5|$|RKO, and {{the movie}} {{industry}} as a whole, had its most profitable year ever in 1946. A Goldwyn production released by RKO, The Best Years of Our Lives, was the most successful Hollywood film of the decade. But {{the legal status of}} the industry's reigning business model was increasingly being called into doubt: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bigelow v. RKO that the company was liable for damages under antitrust statutes for having denied an independent movie house access to first run films—a common practice among all of the Big Five. With profits at a high point, Floyd Odlum cashed in by selling off about 40% of his shares in the company to a group of investment firms. After Koerner's death, Radio-Keith-Orpheum president N. Peter Rathvon and RKO Radio Pictures president Ned Depinet had exchanged positions, with Depinet moving to the corporate offices in New York and Rathvon relocating to Hollywood and doubling as production chief while a permanent replacement was sought for Koerner. On the first day of 1947, producer and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dore Schary, who had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> the studio on loan from Selznick, took over the role.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Rosecroft's history, it has {{featured}} notable races. From 1984 to 1988, it hosted {{segments of}} the Breeders Crown. Starting in 1990 and ending in 1995, the racetrack hosted the Messenger Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. Rosecroft hosted the Potomac Stakes, Maryland most successful harness race, from 1990 to 1992. Rosecroft features the Maryland Sire Stakes, which showcases the best standardbred horses in Maryland. Besides the races, Rosecroft has had famous people and horses work and race at the track. John Wager, Maryland's all-time most winning driver, has <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Rosecroft since 1974. Several famous people—Lyndon B. Johnson, Elizabeth Taylor, and Nancy Pelosi, among others—have visited Rosecroft. Cam's Card Shark raced at Rosecroft in 1994 and challenged the single-season record for most money won in a season by winning over $2 million, and Robust Hanover set a track record while winning the Breeders Crown in 1985.|$|E

25|$|The prisoners {{consisted}} of two groups; the larger group were Koreans and members of forced labour units who had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Henderson Field (Guadalcanal), and the smaller group {{consisted of}} about 240 officers and other ranks of the Imperial Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force. The majority of this second group were crew from the Japanese cruiser Furutaka, which was sunk during the Battle of Cape Esperance.

25|$|By 1981, when work on {{the film}} began, Norshteyn had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Soyuzmultfilm (the main Soviet {{animation}} studio) for 13 years and had worked on some 40 films and directed or co-directed six. Progress was slow, with many interruptions (Norshteyn estimates that only about three years of work were actually done). Norshteyn says that Viktor Tinyaev (Виктор Тиняев) helped him during this period. In 1986, with only 10 minutes of the film completed, Norshteyn was fired from the Soyuzmultfilm studio {{in which he had}} worked. This was despite the fact that his films had gathered many international awards, and Tale of Tales had been voted the best animated film of all time by a large panel of international critics in 1984.|$|E
500|$|Kricfalusi's team wrote story {{outlines}} for thirteen {{episodes in}} a week and pitched them to Price. By the next week, Kricfalusi had hired animators he knew who had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> other studios. [...] went into production the month it was greenlighted; it was scheduled to premiere on September 19, 1987. This haste required the crew to be split into four teams, led by supervising director Kricfalusi, Fitzgerald, Steve Gordon and Bruce Woodside. Each team was given a handful of episodes, and operated almost entirely independently of the others. Although the scripts required approval by CBS executives, Kricfalusi insisted that the artists add visual gags as they drew. Bruce Timm, Andrew Stanton, Dave Marshall and Jeff Pidgeon were among the artists {{who worked on the}} series. Despite the time constraints, CBS was pleased with the way Bakshi Productions addressed the network's notes.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{its release}} to Xbox Live Arcade, Braid {{was met with}} nearly {{unanimously}} positive reviews, with an aggregate review score of 93% at Metacritic, making it the top-rated Xbox Live Arcade game and the 10th highest-rated Xbox 360 game. Braid was purchased by more than 55,000 people {{during the first week}} of release. According to Blow, Braid was the second-largest selling Xbox Live Arcade title in 2008 and sales were [...] "very profitable", making him more money than if he had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> a high-paying job for the time it took to develop the game. The game had sold 450,000 copies by April 2012. By 2014, Blow had stated that sales of Braid brought in more than $4 million in revenue, much of which he used towards the development of his 2016 game, The Witness.|$|E
500|$|The airline was {{established}} as Vestfoldfly by Øyvind Skaunfelt in 1961. He had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Thor Solberg's aviation school at Tønsberg Airport, Jarlsberg, {{and offered to}} purchase the school and airplanes when Solberg retired. Two years earlier, Sandefjord Airport, Torp had opened a civilian sector and Skaunfelt decided to establish his company there. In May 1961, he received government permission for commercial flying. He started a newspaper route to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, and could also carry three passengers in his single-engined Cessna. The route continued onwards from Sandefjord to Tønsberg, Larvik and at Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Vestfoldfly also started offering scenic trips and charter. During the summer, the airline also flew seaplanes south along the coast to Kragerø, Risør and Arendal. Other activities involved crop dusting of forest for Felleskjøpet. The airline also provided a target service for the military. Four aircraft were permanently used to tow a target about [...] behind the aircraft, and military personnel would practice shooting at the target.|$|E
500|$|Actual work on Banjo-Kazooie {{started in}} March 1997 with a {{development}} team of 10 people.

The team was composed of both experienced and inexperienced people; some had <b>been</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Rare for 10 years while others had never previously worked on a video game. The 3D world of Super Mario 64 was a major inspiration for Banjo-Kazooie, as Rare intended to combine it with the look of Donkey Kong Country. The game was designed to appeal players of all ages in a similar vein to Walt Disney Animation Studios films. According to Rare, [...] "We wanted the characters to primarily appeal to a younger audience but, at the same time, give them enough humour and attitude not to discourage older players." [...] The music of the game, composed by Grant Kirkhope, was designed to gradually fade from one style to the next without pause, while the overall composition loops continuously.|$|E
