50|$|The use of {{farmed fish}} in the Filet-O-Fish first came about in 1981, when an owner of a New Zealand {{fisheries}} company was dissatisfied with the pollock Filet-O-Fish he purchased at the Courtenay Place, Wellington restaurant. Saying to the manager {{that he could make}} a better-tasting fish fillet, he was handed a box of fillets and told to come back with identical, better-tasting fillets. He substituted red cod for the pollock, and after the manager was satisfied with the better-tasting red cod fillets, ended up in agreement to supply the Courtenay Place restaurant (and eventually several other New Zealand restaurants) with the red cod fillets. The similar-tasting hoki was substituted several years later, due to its competitive market value and its <b>boneless</b> <b>fillets,</b> and eventually was introduced widely in the early 1990s when global pollock stocks were facing low numbers. McDonald's removed the Filet-O-Fish from its menus in the United States on September 26, 1996, and replaced it with the Fish Filet Deluxe sandwich, which was part of McDonald's ill-fated Deluxe line of sandwiches. However, the Filet-O-Fish was brought back to its menus on a gradual basis starting in the middle of 1997, due to overwhelming letters and petitions, receiving the larger fish patty from the Fish Filet Deluxe. The Fish Filet Deluxe itself was discontinued at most restaurants early the next year, while others kept it a little longer until the Fish Filet Deluxe was finally removed in the year 2000.|$|E

40|$|Market trends have {{dictated}} that broilers be reared for divergent market demands for decades. Also, broiler genetic strains have been adapted to meet market demands which include: genetic selection for improved breast meat, {{the practice of}} growing birds to older ages and greater market weights to meet demands, and decreasing postmortem (PM) aging time to improve processing efficiency and fillet yield. These production practices can also affect product quality, specifically <b>boneless</b> breast <b>fillet</b> tenderness and water-holding capacity. To address these factors, a series of experiments were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of strain and slaughter age on meat quality parameters, as well as potential causes of these differences in meat quality. Furthermore, commonly accepted methods for improving <b>boneless</b> breast <b>fillet</b> meat quality were evaluated for the effect of older slaughter age and greater market weights. Based on these results, it appears that, regardless of debone time, broilers reared to greater market weights are tougher than birds reared to a lighter market weight. There are several factors that are compounding this increased toughness, including slower progression of rigor development, greater myofibrillar diameter, and perhaps decreased PM fragmentation; however, the relationship among factors is not fully exploited. Also, it appears that <b>boneless</b> breast <b>fillet</b> marination is critical in these larger birds to alleviate the toughness associated with pre-rigor debone, and may be necessary even when birds are deboned at 24 h PM. Therefore, based on these results it can be recommended that longer PM aging prior to debone is necessary when birds are slaughtered at heavier market weights, and aging the meat off the bone may be beneficial to improving <b>boneless</b> breast <b>fillet</b> tenderness. Furthermore, the commercial practice of tumble-marinating is effective for breast fillets of greater size and may be necessary to avoid negative consumer perception of tenderness...|$|R

Product identification is critical to the industry and is complicated because, even in Australia, literally thousands of marketing names are used. In addition, an increasing trend to sell fish species as skinless and <b>boneless</b> <b>fillets</b> makes identification post-processing highly problematic. Not suprisingly, there is increasing concern amongst consumers and regulatory authorities regarding the veracity of labelling of such products. The seafood {{industry is}} aware of the need for consistent and accurate labelling as incorrect identification of fish fillets, whether deliberate or accidental, can have serious negative effects on consumer confidence. Here, we demonstrated that single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, coupled with direct sequencing, of the 16 S mtDNA gene region, can provide a rapid, efficient and reliable method of identifying fish fillets sold in south-eastern Australia. Fillets of barramundi, cod hake, hoki and snapper were purchased and compared first using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis with comparisons against taxonomically verified Australian reference samples. All fillet and reference samples were then sequenced to determine the efficiency of the single strand conformation polymorphism technique and make comparisons with sequences available from GenBank for imported products. Our results revealed labelling inconsistencies due to multiple marketing names being applied to single species and multiple species being marketed under a single name.

Breast fillets were also packaged and stored in vacuum packaging in an attempt to reduce effects of electron beam irradiation on lipid oxidation in breast fillets. Microbial analyses were conducted to determine population levels of coliforms, generic E. coli, total aerobic bacteria, psychrotrophs, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in the fillets. Color determination, sensory evaluation, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were used as parameters {{to determine the effects of}} electron beam irradiation on overall quality of breast fillets. Results suggested that even the minimum dose of 0. 8 kGy was effective in eliminating coliforms, generic E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in irradiated samples. Population levels of total aerobic bacteria and psychrotrophs were not completely eliminated, but even the minimum dose of 0. 8 kGy resulted in a substantial decrease in population levels. Vacuum packaging had no effect on population levels. All three levels of irradiation resulted in an increase in a* values or redness of the products with vacuum packaged samples having higher a* values. Results from sensory evaluation indicated that increasing levels of irradiation and storage time resulted in less acceptable products. However, fewer TBARS were observed in breast fillets that had been vacuum packaged and then irradiated indicating that less lipid oxidation occurred.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 38 - 42). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Pale, soft, exudative (PSE) turkey meat is a growing problem for the further processed poultry meat industry. The low pH condition due to rapid glycolysis while the body temperature is still high leads to protein denaturation, which causes pale color and reduced water hold capacity. These conditions may impact the ability of the muscle to absorb or retain a marinade solution. These studies were designed to estimate the incidence of PSE broiler meat in a commercial plant and use response surface methodology to characterize the relationship between pH and lightness (L* value) at deboning and at 24 h postmortem, expressible moisture, drip loss, and cook loss. In addition, characteristics of pale and normal fillets were evaluated after marination in sodium chloride and sodium tripolyphosphate brines at pH 9 and pH 11 to determine if lost protein functionality could be restored. The pale fillets had significantly lower pH, greater L* values at both 3 and 24 h postmortem, and higher expressible moisture, drip loss, and cook loss. The pale fillets exhibited poor water holding capacity, a characteristic of PSE meat. Additionally, L* values were measured on 3554 <b>boneless</b> broiler breast <b>fillets</b> in a commercial processing line. Using the L* value range (> 54) from the pale fillets as an indication of paleness, approximately 37 % of the 3554 fillets were in this pale range and could potentially exhibit poor water holding capacity. Marinade (pH 9) uptake and drip losses were similar in pale and normal fillets, but cook loss from pale fillets was greater than that of the normal fillets. Marinade solution at pH 11 showed no difference in pH or cook loss between pale and normal fillets. These results indicate that PSE chicken can represent a large proportion of commercially processed broiler meat and that the marination techniques used in this study cannot reverse this condition...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{that was}} used {{historically}} for gold recovery in mining areas of the Sierra Nevada continues to enter local and downstream water bodies, including the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta and the San Francisco Bay of northern California. Methylmercury is of particular concern {{because it is the}} most prevalent form of mercury in fish and is a potent neurotoxin that bioaccumulates at successive trophic levels within food webs. In April 1999, the U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with several other agencies—the Forest Service (U. S. Department of Agriculture), the Bureau of Land Management, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California State Water Resources Control Board, and the Nevada County Resource Conservation District—began a pilot investigation to characterize the occurrence and distribution of mercury in water, sediment, and biota in the South Yuba River, Deer Creek, and Bear River watersheds of California. Biological samples consisted of semi-aquatic and aquatic insects, amphibians, bird eggs, and fish. Fish were collected from 5 reservoirs and 14 stream sites during August through October 1999 to assess the distribution of mercury in these watersheds. Fish that were collected from reservoirs included top trophic level predators (black basses, Micropterus spp.), intermediate trophic level predators [sunfish (blue gill, Lepomis macrochirus; green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus; and black crappie, Poxomis nigromaculatus) ], and benthic omnivores (channel catfish, Ictularus punctatus). At stream sites, the species collected were upper trophic level salmonids (brown trout, Salmo trutta) and upper-to-intermediate trophic level salmonids (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss). <b>Boneless</b> and skinless <b>fillet</b> portions from 161 fish were analyzed for total mercury; 131 samples were individual fish, and the remaining 30 fish were combined into 10 composite samples of three fish each of the same species and size class. Mercury concentrations in samples of black basses (Micropterus spp.), including largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted bass, ranged from 0. 20 to 1. 5 parts per million (ppm), wet basis. Mercury concentrations in sunfish ranged from less than 0. 10 to 0. 41 ppm (wet). Channel catfish had mercury concentrations from 0. 16 to 0. 75 ppm (wet). The range of mercury concentrations observed in rainbow trout was from 0. 06 to 0. 38 ppm (wet), and in brown trout was from 0. 02 to 0. 43 ppm (wet). Mercury concentrations in trout were greater than 0. 3 ppm in samples from three of 14 stream sites. Mercury at elevated concentrations may pose a health risk to piscivorous wildlife and to humans who eat fish on a regular basis.

40|$|Farmed Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) (Thunnus maccoyii) is an {{important}} export product for South Australia (SA). It is exported to Japan, China, Korea and the United States for the sushi and sashimi markets. The primary purpose of SBT farming in SA is to fatten wild-caught juvenile fish (2 - 4 years of age with initial mean weights between 12 - 20 kg) {{over a period of}} approximately five months by feeding a selection of baitfish types. Farmers, farm managers and consumers of SBT all have an interest in managing chemical residues that have the potential to biomagnify in the fatty tissue of the farmed SBT fillets. Of particular interest are chemical residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins / dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This research presents the investigations and experimental validation of a predictive model {{that can be used to}} address the levels of residues in the fillets of farmed SBT at harvest from feeding (as the source) when applied to SBT aquaculture. An additional industry-focussed aim of this research was to determine if a Longer Term Holding (LTH) farming period, with a duration of an extra 12 months after a typical farming period of approximately five months, could produce SBT with higher condition index (CI) and lipid content, while keeping levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs low, compared to the typical farming period. The justification for this research is that an adequate quantitative model is essential to help industry achieve targeted concentrations in the final fillet product by making scientific-based decisions on baitfish selection (baitfish strategies for the feeding of SBT), and longer term, to confidently demonstrate to local markets and importing countries that Australia is actively managing levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in farmed SBT, to ensure a high quality and safe product is delivered to the consumer. The novelty of this research is underpinned by four integrated stages, and the criteria for an adequate model established. The important criteria included: accurate predictions versus observed data demonstrated through the analysis of residual plots, potential physiological interpretation of model coefficients, parsimony – the model should be as simple as possible (but no simpler) and that the model should be easy to use. Firstly, a logical starting point was the development of a risk framework for residues in SBT. The developed framework was based on conventional principles of microbiological risk assessment highlighted in Codex Alimentarius. The risk framework consists of five governing principles: hazard identification, hazard characterisation, exposure assessment, risk characterisation and model validation. The advantages of the risk framework is that it provides a systematic research approach and permits information to be handled unambiguously, especially important for the niche SBT industry where chemical residue research is carried out for the first time. Secondly, because of a lack of available scientific data in context of this research, commercial-scale experimental field data for levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in typical farmed SBT as affected by feeding and growth were collected over 17 months at seven time intervals from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd in 2005 / 06 (n = 50). Field data from another commercial company, Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd, was collected over the typical farming period specific to this company, spanning 15 weeks at three time intervals in 2006, for validation work (n = 15). The data obtained from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd revealed that whole weight of farmed SBT increased from 18. 5 kg to 30. 3 kg for a typical farming period, and subsequently to 41. 0 kg by the end of the LTH farming period. A maximum mean CI of 24. 0 ± 0. 5 kg. m⁻³ and a maximum mean lipid content of 17. 6 ± 0. 5 % was achieved at the third time interval of the typical farming period, for the baitfish types and ratios used as feed. There were no significant differences in the CI and lipid between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods, i. e. even after an additional 12 months of farming. PCB and PCDD/F concentrations, however, increased between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods. The data indicated that a typical farming period was sufficient to achieve a maximum CI and lipid content with lower concentrations of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in the fillets relative to the LTH farming period. For the third stage of this research, a quantitative model was synthesised and applied to the PCB and PCDD/F (2, 3, 7, 8 -TeCDF) data detected in farmed SBT fillets. Assimilation efficiencies for PCBs and 2, 3, 7, 8 -TeCDF in the fillets of SBT were obtained. An assimilation efficiency, or percentage retention (efficiency expressed as a percentage), in the fillet of SBT is a measure of the uptake of a chemical residue from food (baitfish) to the SBT fillet. For the WHO-PCBs, assimilation efficiencies based on SBT fillets ranged between 19. 1 – 35. 3 % with the exception of PCB 169. The highest assimilation efficiency of 35. 3 %, with a range of 30. 4 – 40. 3 % (at the 95 % confidence level) was attributed to the most toxic PCB congener, PCB 126. An assimilation efficiency of 39. 2 % was determined in SBT fillets for the congener 2, 3, 7, 8 -TeCDF, which was higher than the assimilation efficiencies determined for the WHO-PCB congeners. A residual plot as predicted value versus observed value indicated that the predictive model was neither under- or over-parameterised. However, when the predictive model was assessed against the data set from Farm Alpha Pty Ltd, the model over-predicted the actual PCB and PCDD/F concentrations. The over-prediction is attributed to possible overfeeding of SBT farmed by Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd. From a food safety point of view, in the absence of ideal predictions because of a lack of ideal validation data sets, an over-prediction instead of under-prediction is preferred. In the fourth stage, the practical application of the predictive model was demonstrated. Because SBT fillets are retailed as tissue group-specific, i. e. akami (low fat), chu-toro (medium fat) and otoro (high fat) fillets, PCB and PCDD/F analyses were carried out on the three tissue groups for selected SBT (n = 7). Dietary modelling on SBT consumption in humans was carried out using findings from the predictive model and tissue-specific data. The baitfish strategy employed for the feeding of farmed SBT consequently affects dietary exposure to SBT consumers. Exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is approximately seven times lower for the consumption of a skin-free, <b>boneless</b> akami <b>fillet</b> than for a comparable otoro fillet of the same size. This dietary exposure assessment accounted only for consumption of SBT tissue-specific fillets. The experimental field study and modelling work on PCB and PCDD/F concentrations in farmed SBT (fillets) outlined in this thesis importantly directs the need to re-evaluate a specific model to better cater for SBT farming practices where SBT fillets are produced for human consumption. Because conditions that normally pertain to commercial farming of wild-caught fish were studied, findings should be of interest to industries where other species of fish (for food) are farmed in sea-cages in the open ocean.
