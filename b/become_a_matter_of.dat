They ruled till 1815 with Kandy as their capital and were also the last ruling dynasty of Sri Lanka. The Kings of Kandy had from an early time sought and procured their wives from Madurai. The Kandy Nayaks received military support from the Nayaks of Madurai in fighting off the Portuguese. And in the 17th and 18th centuries, marital alliances between the Kandyan kings and Nayak princesses had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> policy.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{there was}} {{significant}} Arab and Muslim immigration into Palestine during the 19th and 20th centuries, {{especially after the}} beginning of Zionist settlement there in the late 19th century has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> some controversy. It is known that the Arab population of Palestine doubled during the British Mandate era, from 670,000 in 1922 to over 1.2 million in 1948, {{and there has been}} considerable debate over the subject on how much of this growth was due to natural increase, as opposed to immigration. Estimates on the scope of Arab immigration to Palestine during this period vary.|$|E
25|$|Astern of Lawrence, Niagara, under Elliot, {{was slow}} to come into action and {{remained}} far out of effective carronade range. It is possible that Elliott was under orders to engage his opposite number, Queen Charlotte, and that Niagara was obstructed by Caledonia, but Elliot's actions would <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> dispute between him and Perry for many years. Aboard Queen Charlotte, the British ship opposed to Niagara, the commander (Robert Finnis) and First Lieutenant were both killed. The next most senior officer, Lieutenant Irvine of the Provincial Marine, found that both Niagara and the American gunboats were far out of range, and passed the brig General Hunter to engage Lawrence at close range.|$|E
25|$|The {{hammered}} dulcimer was extensively {{used during}} the Middle Ages in England, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Although it had a distinctive name in each country, it was everywhere regarded {{as a kind of}} psalterium. The importance of the method of setting the strings in vibration by means of hammers, and its bearing on the acoustics of the instrument, were recognized only when the invention of the pianoforte had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> history. It was then perceived that the psalterium in which the strings were plucked, and the dulcimer in which they were struck, when provided with keyboards, gave rise to two distinct families of instruments, differing essentially in tone quality, in technique and in capabilities: the evolution of the psalterium stopped at the harpsichord, that of the dulcimer gave us the pianoforte.|$|E

25|$|Since Descartes's {{proposal}} of dualism, {{it became a}} general consensus that the mind had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> philosophy and that science {{was not able to}} penetrate the issue of consciousness- that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness. Antonio Damasio and Gerald Edelman are two neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness. Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation {{play a critical role in}} high level cognition, and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation. In his research on this problem, Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms primary consciousness and secondary consciousness.|$|E
25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different issues can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a special fluid). In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> dispute.|$|E
500|$|Since the French and Indian War had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> {{imperial}} concern, two British Army regiments under General Edward Braddock {{were sent}} to America. [...] In written exchanges, Braddock announced his intention to use this force against Fort Duquesne in the Ohio Country, while Shirley unsuccessfully lobbied him to instead target Fort Niagara. [...] At a conference of governors and military leaders in April 1755 Shirley favorably impressed Braddock. [...] Braddock declared that Duquesne would be his target, but he authorized Shirley to take his regiment and that of Sir William Pepperrell to Fort Niagara, and confirmed Johnson's command of the Lake George campaign. [...] Braddock's instructions only gave Shirley the vaguest command over Johnson, which was to later {{become a source of}} trouble. [...] The two northern expeditions were to be made without logistical assistance from the regular army.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Profumo's Commons statement, Ward {{appeared}} on Independent Television News, where he endorsed Profumo's version and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as [...] "baseless". Ward's own activities had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> official concern, and on 1 April the Metropolitan Police began to investigate his affairs. They interviewed 140 of his friends, associates and patients, maintained a 24-hour watch on his home, and tapped his telephone—this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke. Among those who gave statements was Keeler, who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her {{sexual relationship with}} Profumo, providing corroborative details of {{the interior of the}} Chester Terrace house. The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses; Rice-Davies was remanded to Holloway Prison for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward. Meanwhile, Profumo was awarded costs and £50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt. He donated the proceeds to an army charity.|$|E
500|$|Morton was {{nominated}} by the Democratic-Republicans {{to run for}} Congress in 1814, but lost {{by a wide margin}} to Laban Wheaton in what was then seen as a strongly Federalist district. [...] Two years later he was, to some surprise, victorious in a rematch with Wheaton despite Federalist strength in other races. [...] Morton was reelected in 1818, but narrowly lost to Francis Baylies in 1820. [...] In Congress he supported Andrew Jackson, whose actions in the Seminole Wars were being scrutinized, and opposed the Missouri Compromise. [...] Morton was personally opposed to slavery, but did not often let it inform his political decisions until later in life; he preferred instead to focus his efforts on other priorities. [...] Despite this, his written statements on slavery were to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> contentious debate when party factions within the Democratic Party sought to use them against him in the 1840s. [...] In these early years he was also a proponent of free trade; like many Massachusetts politicians, he later adopted a strong protectionist stance, calling the early period [...] "the lamest ... of my life".|$|E
