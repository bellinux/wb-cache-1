50|$|The {{restoration}} of New Zealand’s mainland ecological communities {{has been extremely}} challenging. The use of aerial and <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> poisoning for rats and possums and kill-trapping of mustelids has been attempted in many mainland forests. This has resulted in increased breeding success of native bird species. Poisoning of stoats rather than trapping {{has the potential to}} greatly reduce the cost of controlling stoats as fewer visits to the area are required and because stoats are difficult to trap and it has been identified that secondary poisoning of stoats in South Island beech forest could be an effective means of control. In a study by Alterio (2000) on the use of 1080 and brodifacoum for controlling rodents such as rats and mice, secondary poisoning of stoats and cats was found to be significant and so this could be an especially useful way of restoring New Zealand mainland ecological communities. However, it is necessary that poisoning is carried out {{in a way that it}} will not have any impacts on non target native species.|$|E
40|$|For {{control of}} the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), the attract-and-kill or attracticide {{technique}} is {{an alternative to the}} spraying of traditional organophosphate pesticides. In this study, the effectiveness of Ceranock and AAL&K attract-and-kill <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> was assessed for control of C. capitata in Tunisian peach (Prunus persica) orchards. Our results showed that, in orchards with early-ripening varieties, the numbers of C. capitata males and fruit damage were significantly lower in plots treated with Ceranock and AAL&K <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> than in plots treated with conventional organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides. In addition, the abundances of non-target insects in the Chrysopidae, Coccinellidae and Miridae were significantly greater in plots treated with the <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> than in plots treated with the conventional pesticides; that is, the use of attract-and-kill <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> had fewer negative effects than the application of conventional pesticides on the biological diversity in Tunisian peach orchards. Overall, the results indicate that Ceranock and AAL&K attract-and-kill <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> are useful alternatives for the control of C. capitata in Tunisian peach orchards planted with early-ripening varieties.

During 17 February and 2 March 2011, we created a grid of experimental <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> (n= 64) on Sandhill Wildlife Management Area, Wisconsin, USA, to assess station densities needed to attract and deliver placebo baits to free-ranging white-tailed deer and look for associations among deer density, number of <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> per deer, and bait consumption. We placed 1 L of commercially available alfalfa cubes at <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> 652 m apart, and monitored stations with motion-activated cameras for 5 days to document visitation and consumption by deer and nontarget species. Deer discovered 38 % of all <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> within 37 hr, on average (SE= 3. 91 hr), and consumed variable amounts of <b>bait</b> at each <b>station.</b> Deer were documented in 94 % of all photographs of wildlife at <b>bait</b> <b>stations.</b> We found no correlation between bait consumption and deer density or the number of <b>bait</b> <b>stations</b> per deer.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of baiting on feral swine (Sus scrofa) {{movements}} and corresponding likelihood of disease spread under real and simulated culling pressure. Our objectives were to determine the proportion of feral swine that used the <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> site, and if baiting of feral swine altered areas of utilization, distances from location centroids to treatment location (control or <b>bait</b> <b>station),</b> and movement rates by survivors during culling activities. We hypothesized that the <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> would increase the sedentary nature of feral swine, thus reducing the potential for dispersal and hence disease dispersal. Our experiment was conducted between February and May 2011 on the Rob and Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation (WWF) in San Patricio County, Texas. We trapped 83 feral swine and placed GPS collars on 21 animals. We established and maintained a centralized <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> {{on one side of}} the WWF from 13 March to 27 April. We conducted population-wide culling activities, including trapping, controlled shooting, drive shooting, and aerial gunning, from 3 to 27 April and removed 143 feral swine (4. 6 feral swine/km 2). Areas of utilization did not differ between treatments (control or <b>bait</b> <b>station).</b> However, we found location centroids of <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> site feral swine to be closer to the treatment location than those of control site animals and daily movement rates of <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> site feral swine to be 39 % greater than movement rates of control site animals. Based on our observation that only 62 % of feral swine trapped in proximity to the <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> used it, we cannot recommend baiting as an alternative to fences for containing animals during culling activities. However, there is value in using bait stations to describe patterns of feral swine movements, facilitate observation, and improve efficacy when conducting removals...|$|E
40|$|Three {{species of}} fruit flies cause serious damage to cucurbit crops on Reunion Island: Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae) (Coquillett 1899), Dacus ciliatus (Loew 1901), and Dacus demmerezi (Bezzi 1917). To control them, {{a program of}} agroecological {{management}} of cucurbit flies has been implemented based on the application of Synéis-appât, especially spot sprays on corn borders. However, the high rainfall on Reunion Island limits the long-term efficiency of the bait; in addition, this method cannot be used for large chayote trellises, because corn borders cannot be planted around them. The {{aim of this study}} was to design a <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> adapted to prevailing conditions on Reunion Island. An 'umbrella trap' tested in Taiwan was used as a reference to compare its efficacy with our local <b>bait</b> <b>station.</b> Experiments were conducted in field cages on B. cucurbitae to test different characteristics of bait stations and to construct one using local materials. Results were validated in the field. The attractiveness of the <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> was related mainly to the color of the external surface, yellow being the most attractive color. The efficacy of the <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> with respect to fly mortality was found to be linked to the accessibility of the bait, and direct application of Synéis-appât on the <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> was found to be the most efficient. In the field, B. cucurbitae were more attracted to the local <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> than to the umbrella trap, while the two other fly species displayed equal attraction to both trap types. Our local <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> is a useful alternative to spot sprays of Synéis-appât and is now included in a local pest management program and is well accepted by farmers.

40|$|Abstract: Plastic bait {{stations}} were trialled {{to assess their}} usefulness as a rabbit control tool. Non-toxic cereal baits were applied at two 171 ha Mackenzie Basin sites, at one site in stations and at the other site spread directly on the ground. Bait-take at each site was measured. Rhodamine-dyed baits were also {{used to determine the}} proportion of rabbits at each site that took bait. Bait-take, and the proportion of shot rabbits with stomachs containing dye, were both significantly lower (P ≤ 0. 0001) at the <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> site. The <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> design used in this trial is unlikely to prove an effective rabbit control tool.

40|$|The last {{decades the}} populations of wild boar (Sus scrofa) has {{increased}} rapidly over the species’ entire European range, including Sweden. This is followed by increasing human-wildlife conflicts {{as a result of}} the wild boar foraging behavior, causing damage to agricultural crop fields due to trampling and feeding. To be able to minimize damage we need more knowledge of where in the fields the risk of damage is high and what features in the landscape that affect this risk. I analyzed damage distribution in relation to the distance to six different landscape features; forest, road, ditch, building, game field and <b>bait</b> <b>station,</b> in the study area, the Island Mörkö in eastern central Sweden. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that damage increased with proximity to forest, road, ditch and <b>bait</b> <b>station,</b> strongest affected by the distance to forest and <b>bait</b> <b>station.</b> The damage also showed to be more severe closer to the forest edge. I also calculated the cost of wild boar damage, during the harvest season of 2010, based on the field survey. The apparent income loss due to damaged and reduced harvest in wheat, oats and barley fields was this year about 120 000 SEK. This sum indicates a significant problem and point at the need for measures to minimize damage. My results suggest, for example, that sensitive crops like wheat should be cultivated on fields with less edge towards the forest, and that bait stations should be placed as far away from fields as possible...|$|E

40|$|One {{component}} of brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) management on Guam {{is the use}} of a toxic bait that consists of acetaminophen tablets inserted into a dead neonatal mouse (DNM), which in turn is placed within a cylindrical polyvinyl chloride (PVC) <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> suspended above ground. Whereas this technique is effective in killing snakes, possible hazards to nontarget species, especially the Mariana crow (Corvus kubaryi), are of concern. We used the fish crow (C. ossifragus) as a surrogate for the Mariana crow to evaluate (1) oral toxicity of acetaminophen, (2) behavior of crows exposed to DNM containing acetaminophen tablets, and (3) ability of crows to remove DNM from cylindrical bait stations. In the oral toxicity test, all five crows that were each force-fed two 40 -mg acetaminophen tablets survived and at least two birds regurgitated the tablets. Five additional crows received a double dose (four 40 -mg tablets); each regurgitated all of its tablets, but one bird died. Crows given DNM containing two 40 -mg acetaminophen tablets consumed the DNM but avoided eating tablets by picking them from the carcass and either setting them aside or dropping them from the perch. Forty individually caged crows were tested with various size <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> cylinders containing an untreated DNM. Only the longest (45. 7 cm), narrowest (5. 1 cm) cylinder prevented crows from removing the DNM. In brown tree snake control operations, it appears that the risk of accidental exposure of Mariana crows to toxic acetaminophen bait can be minimized through appropriate <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> design.

40|$|European rabbits in Australia have a {{significant}} impact on the environment and the economy. It is therefore necessary to implement control programs. In rural areas a number of methods including warren ripping and poisoning are frequently used. In urban areas though, rabbit control is not as easily accomplished because the use of many control methods is not appropriate. For example, the poison 1080 often cannot be used due to public health concerns and warren ripping cannot be used in conservation areas. Poisoning with pindone, an anticoagulant, is therefore one of few options available to the managers of urban reserves. However, the use of pindone is not without risks to wildlife and domestic animals. This study was conducted in Bold Park, Perth, Western Australia, as tt was recognised that rabbits have a tremendous impact on the bushland. The study investigated the use of bait stations during a bailing program and was designed to: assess the bait uptake from two different <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> designs; identify animals visiting the bait stations; and determine whether these animals showed a preference for one of the <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> designs. Prior to the field trials, oat seed viability studies were carried out to ensure that the oat seeds used as bait would not germinate in the field. To identify animals visiting the bait stations (through tracks and scats), bait stations were placed onto existing sand plots. The study showed that rabbits accepted bait stations and fed from both <b>bait</b> <b>station</b> types. Although they preferred the slab design the difference in visitation was not significant. Bird visitation to the drum design was significantly lower than to the slab design and rodents visited the drum more often than the slab design. From these results it was concluded that bait stations similar to the drum design should be used whenever bird poisoning is a concern. When small native mammals are present in the area, additional precautions should be taken to protect these animals from being poisoned. Also discussed are potential problems associated with the use of bait stations...|$|E
