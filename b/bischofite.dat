25|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} is {{the name}} for the chemical compound with the formula MgCl2 and its various hydrates MgCl2(H2O)x. These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from Great Salt Lake brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the Dead Sea in the Jordan valley. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral <b>bischofite,</b> is also extracted (via solution mining) out of ancient seabeds; for example, the Zechstein seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale.

According to literature and based on the energy storage density (esd), MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O is a promising candidate material for thermochemical energy storage. <b>Bischofite</b> is an inorganic salt obtained as a by-product material from extraction processes of non-metallic minerals, from Salar de Atacama in Chile, containing approximately 95 % of MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to characterize the dehydration reaction of <b>bischofite</b> ore, studied as a low-cost thermochemical storage material. Thermogravimetric data for <b>bischofite</b> were obtained using a TGA instrument coupled to a DSC, at four different isotherms 70 °C, 80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C. The results of conversion reaction (alpha-t) from the thermal dehydration experiments, demonstrated the first phase of dehydration with the loss of two water molecules. The study showed a typical sigmoid curve with a significant acceleration in the conversion at the beginning of the reaction until it reaches a maximum rate, where the curve keeps constant. The same behavior was observed for all the temperatures used. The kinetics of <b>bischofite</b> dehydration model was determined using the isothermal kinetics method. For this, the thermogravimetric data were fitted to the most used kinetic models (D, F, R, A) and then their respective correlation coefficients R were evaluated. The results indicated that the dehydration reaction of <b>bischofite</b> was described by the kinetics of chemical reaction of cylindrical particles R 2. The rate of dehydration reaction and esd of <b>bischofite</b> are lower as compared to synthetic MgCl 2 · 6 H 2 O, at temperatures higher than 80 °C.

The main impurities of <b>bischofite</b> are the cations sodium, potassium and lithium and the anions chloride and sulfate. The results of this investigation established that the presence of KCl and NaCl in <b>bischofite</b> (up to 5 [*]wt%) does not affect its use as PCM, because its melting enthalpy and temperature do not vary significantly.

Two regimes could be distinguished: one with a stress exponent n = 4. 5 in the power law creep equation for values of the differential stress above 2. 0 MPa. and one with n = 1. 5 for stresses below this value. The main deformation mechanisms were intracrystalline slip. twinning, and grain-boundary sliding. Recrystallization occurred by subgrain rotation and high-angle grain-boundary migration.

40|$|<b>Bischofite</b> exits in {{the upper}} crust with its related {{minerals}} carnallite, sylvite and halite, and {{is known as the}} most ductile material within the halide family of minerals. It is normally extracted from the subsurface by solution mining in underground caverns. Abandonment of the caverns causes the wall rock to creep towards the inside due to overburden stress, which in turn results in subsidence at the surface. In order to allow reliable prediction of the creep of <b>Bischofite</b> at cavern walls, a well-defined flow law is required that can be applied at strain rates at least as low as 10 - 9 s- 1. Such rates are difficult to achieve in the laboratory. We have conducted new, conventional axi-symmetric compression tests on as-received polycrystalline <b>Bischofite</b> samples from natural cores. The experiments have been carried out at near real in situ conditions of temperature and pressure (70 oC and 40 MPa, respectively), using a range of strain rates from 10 - 5 to 10 - 8 s- 1. All experiments were strain rate stepping experiments including stress relaxation after every step down to strain rates of 3 × 10 - 9 s- 1. In the relaxation part of the experiments, the deformation piston was arrested at fixed position and the stored elastic energy in the sample and in the machine was allowed to relax through plastic deformation of the sample. The measured mechanical data were used to obtain the stress exponent (n) as included in a conventional (Dorn-type) power law. We observed that during the stress relaxation, the n-value gradually changed from n> 5 at 10 - 5 to n~ 1 at 10 - 9 s- 1. The absolute strength of the samples remained higher if the relaxation started at a higher stress, i. e. at a faster rate within the range tested. We interpret this as indicating a difference in microstructure at the initiation of the relaxation, notably a smaller grain size related to dynamical recrystallization during the constant strain rate part of the test just before relaxation. The data thus suggest that there is gradual change in mechanism with decreasing strain rate, from grain size insensitive (GSI) dislocation creep to grain size sensitive (GSS) pressure solution creep. We propose that a hybrid flow law in which strain rate is equal to A’σnexp(σ/B) should best be applied to describe the flow of <b>Bischofite</b> at in situ conditions of 70 oC, 40 MPa and slow strain rate.

40|$|Raw {{magnesium}} chloride can be recovered using solution mining {{at a depth}} of a 1500 to 2000 meters. Underground caverns are formed in stacked layers of <b>bischofite,</b> carnallite and halite. The salt layers consist for a large part of NaCl and but contain a minimum of at least 35 % {{magnesium chloride}}. Recovery is implemented by injection of fresh water in the salt layer, which becomes saturated with magnesium. The carnallite and <b>bischofite</b> layers largely consist of the less soluble NaCl, with interdispersed magnesium salts. A cylindrical model of magnesium recovery is presented that consists of a central open space, an annular space filled with a porous salt (NaCl) layer with an outer boundary that consists of a <b>bischofite</b> layer or carnallite layer. The central cavity is an open cylinder filled with a solution of NaCl and MgCl 2. The presence of KCl can be disregarded. Fresh water is injected into the centre of the central cavity. Brine is extracted at a distance below the injection point. The natural convection flows of the fresh injection water in the cavity are investigated. Calculations show that the central cavity contains a solution of more or less constant composition except near the central axis of the cavity. Fresh injection water is lighter than the brine and therefore it migrates {{to the top of the}} cavity while mixing with the brine. The concentration of the brine near the injection point at the axis of the central cavity increases rapidly so that the roof will not be exposed to brines that are able to dissolve significant amounts of NaCl. Adjacent to the central cavity there is a concentric annular space, which consists of a skeleton of crystalline NaCl. This acts as a porous medium. The outer radius of the porous medium is adjacent to the undisturbed <b>bischofite</b> layer. At the outer radius the concentration of <b>bischofite</b> and sodium chloride are given by the saturated equilibrium conditions. Also at the outer radius there is a no flow boundary. At the inner radius the concentrations are constant due to the mixing conditions in the central cavity. The values of these concentrations are given by the cavity growth model. The Elder model is used to simulate natural convection flows through a porous annular cylinder of low permeability. The enhancement in the transfer rate due to natural convection flows with respect to mass diffusion is expressed in the Sherwood number. Simulations were conducted on porous media with a permeability of 2 e- 12 m^ 2 or less. The maximum enhancement factor resulting from the simulations is two and a half. For higher permeabilities the Brinkman model is used. The cavity growth model describes the rate of change of the inner and outer radius of the porous medium. The rate of change of the outer radius is determined by the diffusive mass flux of MgCl 2. The rate of change of the inner radius is determined by the dissolution of the NaCl skeleton. However, the equilibrium concentration of NaCl in the presence of dissolved MgCl 2 is rather small leading to a low dissolution rate of NaCl. Results of the cavity growth model are presented in terms of the inner and outer radius of the annular cylinder as a function of time. The cavity growth model requires enhancement factors in the order of 1 e 5 to get magnesium concentrations that are comparable to field data. Such high enhancement factors can possibly only be obtained using the Brinkman model. ?Section Resource EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of evaporitic formations in sedimentary basins, often {{dominated by the}} salt mineral halite, is of great influence on the structural style developed during tectonic events. On a somewhat smaller scale, salt rocks often host a variety of deep solution mined caverns, which are increasingly finding use for strategic storage of energy resources {{in the form of}} gaseous or liquid fuels and as vessels for off-peak energy storage in compressed gas. This is in addition to the use of conventionally mined galleries for the long term storage of hazardous waste materials. The low permeability of most salt rocks, with weak rheological behaviour and tendency to self-seal, has attracted engineers to use salt formations to host such projects. The Zechstein salt deposits in the Netherlands exist in the form of original beds and as migrated salt domes/pillows that may reach the kilometre scale. Some contain magnesium rich salts which are solution mined as an economic resource. Caverns constructed within these more soluble and weaker materials pose additional challenges for long term storage management. Careful management of fluid filled caverns requires a full knowledge of the rheological and transport properties of the host salt formations for a safe operation into the future. This thesis addresses a number of deficiencies in the current knowledge of salt mechanical behaviour regarding the creep of halite and its mixtures with magnesium salts. (1) The pressure sensitivity of creep was investigated, using dry synthetic halite rock. The rate controlling mechanism in the temperature range 22 - 350 oC was found to change from dislocation glide to dislocation climb. The experimental results allow quantification of the activation volume for creep. (2) The transition from creep governed by grain size sensitive (GSI) dislocation mechanisms to creep controlled by grain size sensitive (GSS) solution-precipitation mechanisms was studied on the basis of multi-step deformation experiments with constant strain rate parts and stress relaxation. Stress exponents n of conventional creep laws changed from ~ 10 at relatively high stress and strain rate to ~ 1 {{at the end of the}} relaxation steps. (3) The rheology of the magnesium bearing salts carnallite and <b>bischofite</b> was also investigated by means of multistep experiments including relaxation. Special attention was given to the mechanical behaviour of mixtures of these salts with halite. Both <b>bischofite</b> and carnallite, tested at real in situ conditions of temperature 70 oC and pressure 40 MPa, showed a change from GSI creep to GSS creep comparable to what was found for wet halite. n-values changed from ~ 5 to ~ 1. Composite GSI-GSS flow laws for <b>bischofite</b> and carnallite were established. (4) The effects of compositional layering on permeable transport in the excavation damage zones around mined cavities were investigated by argon gas permeability, using natural layered material from mines in China, to better understand effects of bedding orientation relative to deformational stresses expected in cavity and gallery walls at depth. Microstructural investigation revealed that local dilatancy occurred at interfaces, which must have given rice to a local increase in permeability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} estimate soil salinity through modelling of soil spectra using an inverted Gaussian (IG) function. The approach is tested on experimental datasets including measurements of soil physicochemical properties and their spectral reflectance which are obtained under controlled laboratory conditions. The near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the salt-affected soil spectra were fitted to an inverted Gaussian curve. Parameters of the fitted curve, such as functional depth, distance to the inflection point and area under curve, were then used as predictors in regression analysis to estimate soil salinity levels. The results suggest a successful estimation of salinity levels, especially, for soil samples treated with epsomite and <b>bischofite</b> solutions. Amongst the calculated IG parameters, the area under fitted curve resulted in the most accurate estimations. The results demonstrate the relative utility of high spectral resolution data for estimating soil salinity under laboratory controlled conditions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In the {{northern}} part of The Netherlands the magnesium salts carnalite and <b>bischofite</b> are mined in a deep solution mine. For optimal production and also for environmental impact such as subsidence, it is vital to understand the process of salt production. To this aim, it is studied whether seismic in time-lapse mode may help to visualize and quantify the changes due to the salt production. The main questions addressed are: Can changes due to salt production be detected in seismic time-lapse mode? And if so, how big are these changes? To address these issues, a modelling study was performed. Seismic data were synthesized using acoustic and elastic finite-difference schemes, and further processed to obtain migrated seismic images. For the models themselves, different production scenarios were studied. Analysis of these data clearly shows that salt mining causes detectable changes in time-lapse seismic signals and can be quantified. The amplitude effect seems relatively larger than the induced time shift...|$|E
