5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the adventurers' ship lands in New Phlan, and they receive a <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> {{informative}} tour of the civilized area. They learn that the city is plagued with a history of invasions and wars and has been overtaken by a huge band of humanoids and other creatures. Characters hear rumors that a single controlling element is in charge of these forces. The characters begin a block-by-block quest to rid the ruins of monsters and evil spirits.|$|E

5|$|Gale Eugene Sayers (born May 30, 1943) is {{a former}} {{professional}} American football player who earned acclaim both as a halfback and return specialist in the National Football League (NFL). In a <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> highly productive NFL career, Sayers spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1971, though multiple injuries effectively limited him to five seasons of play. He {{was known for his}} elusiveness and agility, and was regarded by his peers {{as one of the most}} difficult players to tackle.|$|E
5|$|Rococo {{provided}} a <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> significant interlude in Norway, appearing {{primarily in the}} decorative arts, and mainly in interiors, furniture and luxury articles such as table silver, glass and stoneware. In some country districts folk artists produced the distinctly Norwegian craft of decorative painting, rosemaling, and related wood carving style. In polite architecture, a few wooden town houses and manors show rococo influence, notably in Trondheim and Bergen, Damsgård Manor in Bergen being the most significant.|$|E
5|$|The Capture of USS Chesapeake, or the Battle of Boston Harbor, {{was fought}} on 1 June 1813, between the Royal Navy's frigate HMS Shannon and American frigate USS Chesapeake, {{as part of}} the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain. The Chesapeake was {{captured}} in a <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> intense action in which over 80 men were killed. This was the only frigate action of the war in which there was no preponderance of force on either side.|$|E

5|$|The Gardens {{feature in}} a number of other works of literature. They are the scene of a <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> pivotal turning point in the {{fortunes}} of anti-heroine Becky Sharp in Thackeray's 19th-century novel Vanity Fair, as well as a setting in his novel Pendennis. Thomas Hardy sets scenes in his The Dynasts in the Gardens. In Cecilia by Frances Burney the Gardens are where the character Mr Harrell commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group selection was <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E

5|$|Minogue was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer at age 36 on 17 May 2005, leading to the postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl– The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival. Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of support. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E
5|$|Scott (known then as Norman Josiffe) {{had first}} met Thorpe early in 1961 when the former was a 20-year-old groom working {{for one of}} Thorpe's wealthy friends. The initial meeting was <b>brief,</b> <b>but</b> nearly a year later Scott, by then in London and destitute, called at the House of Commons to ask the MP for help. Thorpe later {{acknowledged}} that a friendship had developed, but denied any physical relationship; Scott, on the other hand, claimed {{that he had been}} seduced by Thorpe on the night following the Commons meeting. Over the following years Thorpe made numerous attempts to help Scott to find accommodation and work, but instead of repaying these favours with gratitude, Scott became increasingly resentful to Thorpe, believing that he was the source of all his ills and threatening him with exposure.|$|E
5|$|Scott, who {{because of}} his Discovery fame had entered Edwardian society, first met Kathleen Bruce early in 1907 at a private luncheon party. She was a sculptress, socialite and {{cosmopolitan}} who had studied under Auguste Rodin and whose circle included Isadora Duncan, Pablo Picasso and Aleister Crowley. Her initial meeting with Scott was <b>brief,</b> <b>but</b> when they met again later that year, the mutual attraction was obvious. A stormy courtship followed; Scott was not her only suitor—his main rival was would-be novelist Gilbert Cannan—and his absences at sea did not assist his cause. However, Scott's persistence was rewarded and, on 2 September 1908, at the Chapel Royal, Hampton Court Palace, the wedding took place. Their only child, Peter Markham Scott, born 14 September 1909, was to found the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).|$|E
50|$|While at Berkeley, Noonan {{represented}} John Negre, a Catholic {{conscientious objector}} {{who insisted that}} the Church's just war theory forbade participation in the Vietnam War. Although Justice William O. Douglas initially ordered the Army not to ship out Negre, that stay was removed by the full U.S. Supreme Court on April 21, 1969. Noonan continued to file <b>briefs,</b> <b>but,</b> after hearing argument, the Supreme Court ruled against Negre in Gillette v. United States (1971).|$|R
50|$|An overall comparison: The gender-symmetric single {{surnames}} {{presented in}} the previous section have the advantage of being simpler and <b>briefer,</b> <b>but</b> if actually used alone, would give different surnames for two genders in a nuclear family. In contrast, all of the children in a nuclear family have the same double surname. Also, these double surnames do record (on legal documents) both matriname and patriname, with both identity-surnames later aiding each gender in genealogy work and other historical-record searching.|$|R

5|$|Shaw was {{particularly}} {{known for his}} performances in productions of Shakespeare plays which were considered daring and ahead of their time. In 1966, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he remained for a decade and delivered {{some of his most}} acclaimed performances. He also wrote several poems and a novel, The Christening, in 1975. He is also known for his <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> important performance in Return of the Jedi, the original third installment in the Star Wars franchise, in which he portrayed an unmasked and redeemed Anakin Skywalker (formerly Darth Vader), and his ghost in the original version of the film.|$|E
5|$|To {{accomplish}} her goal, Varian {{sought the}} assistance of British horse breeder Patricia Lindsay, who traveled to Poland and purchased three mares on Varian's behalf. The mares arrived in California in December 1961. They were Bachantka (sired by Wielki Szlem out of Balalajka, who was by Amurath Sahib), purchased from the Albigowa stud; Ostroga (Duch × Orda by Omar 11), from the Nowy Dwór stud; and Naganka (Bad Afas × Najada by Fetysz), from the Michalow stud. Bachantka and Naganka had been trained and raced in Poland. Bachantka had a record of 2/15 (0-1-3), and Naganka a record of 2/12 (3-4-1). After her arrival in the USA, Bachantka also had a <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> successful horse show career.|$|E
5|$|With {{few other}} options {{available}} to him, the President of the Assembly, Jean Joseph Mounier, accompanied a deputation of market-women into the palace to see the king. A group of six women nominated by the crowd were escorted into the king's apartment, where they told him of the crowd's privations. The king responded sympathetically, and using all his charm impressed the women {{to the point that}} one of them fainted at his feet. After this <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> pleasant meeting, arrangements were made to disburse some food from the royal stores, with more promised, and some in the crowd felt that their goals had been satisfactorily met. As rain once again began to pelt Versailles, Maillard and a small cluster of market women trooped triumphantly back to Paris.|$|E

5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} of {{his ability}} to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the Battle for Saigon. After a <b>brief</b> <b>but</b> violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss {{him in the middle of}} the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên. In addition, General Paul Ely, the head of the French presence in Vietnam, tried to impede Diệm; his troops put road blocks against the VNA and gave intelligence to the Bình Xuyên.|$|E
5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 {{was a year}} of transition. The {{international}} situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; it was three years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events set in motion resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After <b>brief,</b> <b>but</b> tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E
5|$|He had a {{short and}} {{relatively}} unsuccessful playing career, spent mostly as a striker in non-league football. He turned out {{for a wide variety}} of clubs, including: Gillingham, Barnet, Wycombe Wanderers, Kingstonian, Wealdstone, Farnborough Town, Harlow Town, Enfield, Aylesbury United, Harrow Borough, Tooting & Mitcham United, Molesey and Walton & Hersham. He started his managerial career at the age of 28, managing Kingstonian for five months, before spending a year in charge of Enfield. In 1999, Westley became manager of Farnborough Town, guiding them to the Football Conference in 2002. He left Farnborough the following season, to become manager of Stevenage. He took the club to within one game of promotion to the Football League, but left the club in 2006 when his contract expired. Westley then had a <b>brief,</b> <b>but</b> successful, spell with Rushden & Diamonds, as well as acting as caretaker manager at Kettering Town.|$|E
