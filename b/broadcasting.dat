5|$|From {{a global}} perspective, {{there have been}} {{political}} debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and <b>broadcasting.</b> The history of <b>broadcasting</b> discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio <b>broadcasting.</b> The onset of World War II brought on the first explosion of international <b>broadcasting</b> propaganda. Countries, their governments, insurgents, terrorists, and militiamen have all used telecommunication and <b>broadcasting</b> techniques to promote propaganda. Patriotic propaganda for political movements and colonization started the mid-1930s. In 1936, the BBC broadcast propaganda to the Arab World to partly counter similar broadcasts from Italy, which also had colonial interests in North Africa.|$|E

5|$|A large <b>broadcasting</b> {{tower was}} {{needed in the}} Kantō region after NHK, Japan's public <b>broadcasting</b> station, began {{television}} <b>broadcasting</b> in 1953. Private <b>broadcasting</b> companies began operating {{in the months following}} the construction of NHK's own transmission tower. This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting to the entire region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E

5|$|Bayern is an {{exception}} in professional, international football, having generated profits in nine of the last ten seasons. Other clubs often report losses, realizing transfers via loans, whereas Bayern always uses current assets. Also Bayern differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. While other clubs derive more than 35% of their revenues from <b>broadcasting</b> right, Bayern earn only 22% of their revenues that way. This is often accounted for by Bayern not marketing their <b>broadcasting</b> right themselves. Instead the Deutsche Fußball Liga negotiates <b>broadcasting</b> rights for the whole Bundesliga.|$|E
