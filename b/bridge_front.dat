50|$|The {{new class}} had two funnels, a long fo'c'sle {{and a tall}} bridge which, unusually, was located behind the break in the main deck. Following {{consultations}} with sea-going officers, a number of novel features were included, principally to enhance sea-keeping capabilities in rough weather and battle-worthiness in night action. Consideration was given to having a well-deck forward of the bridge with an additional pair of torpedo tubes, in the fashion of contemporary German ocean-going torpedo boats, but this arrangement was rejected {{because it would be}} detrimental to ship handling in rough weather. The design had a heavily raked stem and sheer forward, a slight turtleback on the fo'c's'le deck, and a rounded <b>bridge</b> <b>front,</b> intended to deflect waves. Two single 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted under the bridge on single rotating mounts port and starboard, intended to be fired directly by the commanding officer with toggle ropes during night actions, and the searchlight was relocated aft, mounted on top of the aft torpedo tubes (this to avoid the bridge officers being blinded by its glare during night actions). The single 18-inch torpedo tubes proved to be of little use, and were soon removed in the majority of vessels as a weight-saving measure (only Tara, Tintagel and Trojan retained theirs).|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of two coalescing liquid drops in the `inertial regime', where the effects of viscosity are negligible and the propagation of the <b>bridge</b> <b>front</b> connecting the drops {{can be considered as}} `local'. The solution fully computed in the framework of classical fluid-mechanics allows this regime to be identified and the accuracy of the approximating scaling laws proposed to describe the propagation of the bridge to be established. It is shown that the scaling law known for this regime has a very limited region of accuracy and, as a result, in describing experimental data it has frequently been applied outside its limits of applicability. The origin of the scaling law's shortcoming appears to be the fact that it accounts for the capillary pressure due only to the longitudinal curvature of the free surface as the driving force for the process. To address this deficiency, the scaling law is extended to account for both the longitudinal and azimuthal curvatures at the <b>bridge</b> <b>front</b> which, fortuitously, still results in an explicit analytic expression for the front's propagation speed. This new expression is then shown to offer an excellent approximation for both the fully-computed solution and for experimental data from a range of flow configurations for a remarkably large proportion of the coalescence process. The derived formula allows one to predict the speed at which drops coalesce {{for the duration of the}} inertial regime which should be useful for the analysis of experimental data.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that healing of adhesively capped pulps may depend {{on the type of}} adhesive system used and its specific application approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Buccal Class V cavities were prepared in 24 intact monkey teeth. After exposing the pulps, infiltration anesthesia (Xylocaine containing 1 : 80, 000 epinephrine) was administered around the root apex. Two adhesives that make use of a different hybridization approach, Clearfil Liner Bond II (CLB-II) and Super-Bond D Liner II (SB-II) were directly applied to the exposed cavities. The pulpal response was histopathologically investigated using light microscopy at 3 and 90 days. In addition, the resin-pulp interface was characterized by transmission electron microscopy in an attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of healing. RESULTS: In the CLB-II capped pulps, little inflammation was detected at 3 days with the bonding resin intimately attached to the exposed pulpal tissue. At 90 days, a complete dentin bridge was formed in close adaptation to the resin cap. The ultra-structure of a thin intermediary layer at the <b>bridge</b> <b>front</b> resembled a so-called "reversal line". This layer typically appears during remodeling of bone to couple the newly formed to the old osseous tissue. In the SB-II capped pulps, an acute inflammation was in progress immediately beneath the bonding resin at 3 days. This tissue was resorbing the resin that had infiltrated relatively deeply into the pulp. Whereas healing of CLB-II capped pulps appeared to have been initiated promptly, healing of SB-II capped pulps was probably retarded. The formed soft-tissue hybrid layer had first to be resorbed before the formation of a dentin bridge could have been initiated. Hence, the dentin bridge was not completely finished at 90 days and no evidence of a "reversal line"-like layer could be detected. These results suggested that although both the adhesives tested appeared effective as pulp capping materials, the process and duration of healing substantially differed. status: publishe...|$|E
