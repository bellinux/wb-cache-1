He opened a saloon below Barnum's American Museum; {{it would be the first}} of four saloons he would run in New York City over his lifetime. [...] After running this first bar, Thomas went on the road for several years, working as the head bartender at hotels and saloons in St. Louis, Missouri; Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California; Charleston, South Carolina; and New Orleans, Louisiana. At one point he toured Europe, carrying along a set of solid-silver <b>bar</b> <b>tools.</b> [...] He was well known for his showmanship as a bartender: he developed elaborate and flashy techniques of mixing cocktails, sometimes while juggling bottles, cups and mixers. [...] He often wore flashy jewelry and had his <b>bar</b> <b>tools</b> and cups embellished with precious stones and metals. [...] At the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, Thomas was earning $100 a week—more than the Vice President of the United States.|$|R

30|$|A spruce {{specimen}} was rubbed {{with the}} metal round <b>bar</b> <b>tool</b> under pressure using our previously reported method [2]. The wood specimen was clamped on a unidirectional movable stage {{in contact with}} the tool and moved in the feed direction under pressure. The pressure of the round <b>bar</b> <b>tool</b> with a diameter of 12  mm on the wood specimen was controlled by the reduction rate, t. The wood specimen was rubbed at a rotation speed of R =  13, 000  rpm at a constant feeding speed of f =  0.2  mm/s. The tool rotated and the feeding direction was set in parallel to L direction. The temperature was measured with an infrared thermal imaging camera as previously reported [2]. The specimen was either rubbed at t =  0.3  mm with the S-tool, or it was first rubbed at t =  0.3  mm and then seven times at t =  0.1  mm. The specimen was finished by rubbing with the MP-tool twice at t =  0.1  mm. To prevent from adhering to the tool surface, linseed oil in the marketplace(Simamoto Inc, Fukuoka, Japan)was applied to each specimen.|$|R

The GUI helps to package the various software components {{that are essential}} for effective user interactions, while the mathematical model helps to simulate the fate and transport of water and solute in subsurface soil environments. For a successful GUI deployment, integration of the following various components is essential: 1) an input component comprised of graphical units such as graphics editor, menu <b>bars,</b> <b>tool</b> <b>bars,</b> and dialog boxes allows the user to generate useful site-specific data; 2) a database component retrieves or updates information about specific soil properties, solute properties, plant properties, and climatic conditions of a site; 3) the mathematical model component, developed in FOR-TRAN, executes the input generated by the input component; and 4) the output component of the GUI displays to the user the model predictions in a graphical format. A friendly graphical manner of model predictions helps the user to quickly comprehend and make effective management-related decisions such as irrigation and fertilization requirements.

50|$|In 1953 {{a project}} for the {{engineering}} company and bolt manufacturer GKN took the North <b>Bar</b> <b>Tool</b> Company in a new product direction. GKN had designed a bolt called 'Prolong' that had a splined section above the nut. By gripping the splined section of the bolt and counter rotating the nut, the fastener could be tightened {{without the need for}} any external reaction device. In a further development, a shear groove was placed below the spline, so designed that the bolt would fail at the groove when the pre-determined torque had been achieved. This bolting method was known as 'Torshear'. GKN required an air driven tool capable of high torque output to sell with their 'Prolong' bolts. Probably Britain's best known gearbox designer of the time was Dr. Henry Edward Merritt and so Dr. Merritt was contracted to design a suitable range of air driven gearboxes for the Torshear application.|$|R

50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for honing cylinder bores of engines. Torque wrenches were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of engine cylinder head bolts would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture torque wrenches in the UK. Torque wrenches were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North <b>Bar</b> <b>Tool</b> Company' to start manufacturing torque wrenches in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'.|$|R

30|$|Iteration no. 2 {{corresponds}} to the intermediary phase readings after performing moderate improvements like setting up a standard procedure for tool-insert setting on boring bar, cleaning the filter–regulator–lubrication (FRL) unit of pneumatic gauges and replacing the worn out cutting tool insert edge. In Iteration 2, a slight cyclic pattern is observed. This {{is because of the}} reason that there is a constant progressive wear out of the boring bar insert on continued boring operation. After every ten components being machined, the boring bar insert must be compensated for the wear by elevating the insert by about five micrometers, over the diametric dimension. This exercise is performed {{with the help of a}} test mandrel and a boring <b>bar</b> <b>tool</b> insert setting Vee-block. Because of worn out Vee-surfaces of tool insert setting Vee-block, though the insert setting is done it is not accurate and this is reflected in the cyclic pattern observed in the second optimization step of Iteration 2. As a measure of corrective action, a new insert setting Vee-block is replaced with the old worn-out piece and the Vee surfaces of the Vee-Block are case hardened to achieve hardness up to 55 HRc with a case depth of 0.5 – 0.8  mm. In this iteration we see a marginal increase in CP to 1.32 and CPK to 0.90.|$|R
