In such environments, it is valuable to utilise the vast amount of data contained within the <b>building</b> <b>information</b> <b>models</b> to improve access control administration.

40|$|Abstract- The {{increasing}} use of <b>Building</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Modeling</b> in {{the commercial}} sector has affected construction in the federal sector. The Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Industry performs design and construction for federal agencies and using <b>Building</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Modeling</b> will impact the federal construction process. <b>Building</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Modeling</b> is a design process that operates in an information technology environment. It contains dynamic and interactive features that allow for greater efficiency {{in the design and}} construction of a facility. However, the use of <b>Building</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Modeling</b> in federal construction does present some degree of risk because of these features. The authors identified potential security risks associated with its implementation by studying the United States Air Force Military Construction process.

40|$|<b>Building</b> <b>information</b> <b>models</b> (BIM) are an {{increasingly}} {{common form of}} building design representation and are extensively used {{in the design and}} planning phases of the construction process. To a lesser extent the <b>information</b> from <b>building</b> <b>information</b> <b>models</b> is directly used at the construction site. The digital becomes real at the construction site and a design is constructed there. Therefore, the authors believe that this could be improved with the right interface. A technology that can bridge the gap between the digital and the real world is augmented reality (AR). It is increasingly available to the public; currently on mobile hand-held devices and in the future on affordable wearable computing devices. This paper presents a research on how the component based software engineering method can be used to implement a BIM based AR system, i. e. a system in which <b>building</b> <b>information</b> <b>models</b> are used to augment the reality in which the user is located. More specifically, a gap analysis of the systems that can be built in this way was performed. Components needed for developing BIM-based augmented reality system are presented and reviewed. Based on theoretical background of augmented reality and review of components, architecture of a related software system is proposed. A prototype system, which is based on this architecture, has been developed. Structure, operation and preliminary tests of the prototype are presented as well. It was established that many components for building working BIM-based AR systems exist; however, serious technological gaps have been found which represent a barrier for making use of the richness of <b>building</b> <b>information</b> <b>models.</b> We also established that AR raises the requirements for the richness of <b>building</b> <b>information</b> <b>models,</b> particularly its 4 th dimension. The developed system was tested on a construction site of a real construction project. Preliminary tests indicate that although there exist limitations with both hardware and software performance, it is already possible to provide suitable augmented reality access to remote <b>building</b> <b>information</b> <b>models</b> and substantially improve the usefulness of <b>building</b> <b>information</b> <b>model</b> design data on the construction site. ...|$|R
