50|$|The Strelitziaceae {{include three}} genera, all {{occurring}} in tropical to subtropical regions: Strelitzia with five species in southern Africa, Ravenala {{with a single}} species in Madagascar, and Phenakospermum with a single species in northern South America. The best-known species is the <b>bird-of-paradise</b> <b>flower</b> Strelitzia reginae, grown for its flowers worldwide in tropical and subtropical gardens, and a well-known flower in floristry. The other species of Strelitzia have less colourful flowers and are grown instead for their striking foliage. Also grown for its foliage is the traveller's tree, Ravenala madagascariensis.|$|E
50|$|Realidad Nortena, {{translated}} as “The Reality of the North”, was Campos’ first painting after {{almost ten years}} away from his artwork (UNC Gallery and Stories). He says this is his favorite painting and it represents his personal journey to the United States.The left side symbolizes Mexico while the right symbolizes the United States. The desert on the left shows a woman with her son, who might be waiting for a loved one to return home. The right side displays an expanse of sandy, dry desert filled with crosses for those who died during the risky journey. Campos says families are often unaware if their loved ones reached their destination, or not. Beyond this desert is a tobacco field representing Campos’ time working on a farm. Dominating {{the center of the}} painting, a hybrid figure of a dark-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe (on left) is joined to a blond-haired Statue of Liberty (on right). Included in the same large circle as this hybrid woman are the official seal of Mexico, a monarch butterfly, and a hybrid flower with a bird-of-paradise (on left side) and dogwood flower (on right). To Campos, The Virgin of Guadalupe and the Statue of Liberty both represent the ideal of freedom. The eagle is similar to one on Mexican money. The monarch butterfly spans the left and right side of the painting. Known for migrating back and forth between Mexico, the United States, and Canada it illustrates the artist’s hope of safer, more humane movement between countries. The dogwood is the state flower of North Carolina, representing his current home, while the orange one, a <b>bird-of-paradise</b> <b>flower,</b> is representative of his hometown, Cherán. Overall, “Realidad Nortena” signifies the reasons for and the struggles of immigrants who take risks while seeking a better life.|$|E
5000|$|The Moya crew {{discover}} that the Scarrans have sent an attack vessel, commanded by Akhna's lover, to take over Earth {{in order to gain}} access to the <b>bird-of-paradise</b> <b>flowers</b> that they need, because John destroyed their mother plant on Katratzi in [...] "We're So Screwed Part III: La Bomba". The Peacekeepers offer to hold off the Scarrans, if John—and by extension, Earth—will form an alliance with the Peacekeepers. John says no, and speeds to the wormhole to intercept the Scarrans and figure out a way to stop them.|$|R
50|$|Heliconia, {{derived from}} the Greek word helikonios, is a genus of {{flowering}} plants in the family Heliconiaceae. Most of the ca 194 known species are native to the tropical Americas, but a few are indigenous to certain islands of the western Pacific and Maluku. Many species of Heliconia are found in rainforests or tropical wet forests of these regions. Several species are widely cultivated as ornamentals, and a few are naturalized in Florida, Gambia and Thailand. Common names for the genus include lobster-claws, toucan peak, wild plantains or false bird-of-paradise. The last term refers to their close similarity to the <b>bird-of-paradise</b> <b>flowers</b> (Strelitzia). Collectively, these plants are also simply referred to as heliconias.|$|R
5000|$|The {{enormous}} paddle-shaped {{leaves are}} borne on long petioles, in a distinctive fan shape aligned {{in a single}} plane. The large white flowers are structurally {{similar to those of}} its relatives, the <b>bird-of-paradise</b> <b>flowers</b> Strelitzia reginae and Strelitzia nicolai, but are generally considered less attractive, with a green bract. These flowers, upon being pollinated, produce brilliant blue seeds; possibly the only blue seeds found in nature. In tropical and subtropical regions, the plant is widely cultivated for its distinctive habit and foliage. As the plant grows older, it progressively loses the lowest or oldest leaves and reveals a sturdy grey trunk. Of the four forms, varieties or subspecies, the largest is the [...] "Bemavo", from the hills of eastern Madagascar, which can be 100 feet (30 meters) in height with a trunk 2 feet (60 cm) thick. The foliar fan consists of 20 to 35 leaves, each as much as 36 feet (11 meters) in length.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to the {{determination}} of the effect of storage on some biochemical characteristics (PAs content, POX activity and total protein content) of <b>flower</b> tissue of <b>bird-of-paradise.</b> <b>Flowers</b> were selected and labeled, avoiding any mechanical damage, and randomly distributed in recipients for two postharvest trials. In the first experiment, flowers were placed in recipients containing tap water and stored in a cold room, at 7. 5 ºC and 90 % RH, for a period of 12 days. In experiment 2, flowers were stored in room temperature for a period of 6 days. For biochemical characteristics, samples (sepals, petals, stems and bracts) from experiment 1 were collected at 0, 4, 8 and 12 days, and at 0, 2, 4 and 6 days for experiment 2. Results showed that flower bracts, stored at 7. 5 °C, presented a lower content of PAs (Put and Spd), when compared to samples stored at room temperature. In both experiments, a high content of PAs (Spm) was observed in flower tissues in relation to Put and Spd. An increase of POX activity was observed in sepals stored in the cold, and was related to PAs degradation during senescence. No differences in total protein content were observed between the two treatments. The present study provides numeric results on changes in level of PAs, POX activity and total protein during postharvest of bird-of-paradise...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyse the {{endogenous}} levels of free polyamines putrescine (Put), spermidine (spd) and spermine (spm) under {{the effect of}} 8 -HQC (8 -hydroxyquinoline citrate) and chlorine during cold storage of <b>bird-of-paradise</b> floral scapes. <b>Flowers</b> were selected, labelled and randomly distributed in recipients for postharvest trials. The base of flower scapes was immersed with pulsing treatments (Control, 100 chlorine, 250 or 500 mg L- 1 8 -HQC) for 48 h, thereafter, stored at 10. 5 °C and 90 % relative humidity {{for a period of}} 12 days. Flower parts were sampled for polyamines analysis at day 0, 4, 8 and 12 days during storage. All samples had higher Put levels than the control. Treatment with 500 mg L- 1 8 -HQC showed the highest Spd levels in bracts, while chlorine treatment had the highest Spm levels in stems...|$|R
