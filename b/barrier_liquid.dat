50|$|In {{a double}} seal Back to Back, the <b>barrier</b> <b>liquid</b> in the cavity {{between the two}} seals is pressurized. Thus if the primary seal fails, the neutral liquid will leak into the pump stream instead of the {{dangerous}} pumped fluid escaping into the atmosphere. This application is usually used in gas, unstable, highly toxic, abrasive, corrosive, and viscous fluids. These are detailed in API Piping Plan standards #53a, 53b, 53c; or 54. Plan 74 may also be considered a double seal piping plan, although it is used exclusively when describing a dry gas barrier seal support system. The barrier fluid used in a Plan 74 system is simply a gas, not a liquid. Typically, nitrogen is used as its inert nature makes it advantageous due to mixing with the process stream being sealed.|$|E

When leakage occurs, {{it is expected to}} be from the high pressure area to the lower pressure surroundings. The basic concept of the upstream pumping seal is that the conventional seal is replaced by a low volume, high pressure ?pump?- the upstream pumping seal.

30|$|The {{apparatus}} (see Additional file 1 : Annex 2 pictures 1 - 2) {{consists of}} an eudiometer (e.g. from Behr Labor-Technik, Düsseldorf, Germany, Behrotest Eudiometer Unit FH 10 as per DIN 38414 p 8) with a volume of 400 ml, graduated {{from top to bottom}} at intervals of 5 ml. This is attached to the incubation bottle (500 ml capacity) by a ground glass joint. A connection tube is led through the base of the eudiometer tube to allow the sludge gas produced in the incubation bottle to enter the eudiometer tube and in this way displace the <b>barrier</b> <b>liquid</b> into the leveling bottle (750 ml) through a tube. At {{the upper end of the}} eudiometer is a stopcock to allow gas samples to be removed and also to adjust the zero point of the <b>barrier</b> <b>liquid.</b> The <b>barrier</b> <b>liquid</b> consists of 30 ml sulfuric acid (density: 1.84 g/ml), 200 g sodium sulfate decahydrate and a few drops of 0.1 % methyl orange solution per liter deionized water. The incubation bottles are placed in a water bath kept at 35 ± 1 °C by a controlled water thermostat (e.g. Behrotest Apparatus FH 6 from Behr Labor-Technik, Düsseldorf).

40|$|A {{first stage}} field {{injection}} {{of a new}} generation of <b>barrier</b> <b>liquids</b> was successfully completed. Two types of <b>barrier</b> <b>liquids,</b> colloidal silica (CS) and polysiloxane (PSX), were injected into heterogeneous unsaturated deposits of sand, silt, and gravel typical of many of the arid DOE cleanup sites and particularly analogous to the conditions of the Hanford Site. Successful injection by commercially available chemical grouting equipment and the tube-a-manchette technique was demonstrated. Excavation of the grout bulbs permitted visual evaluation of the soil permeation by the grout, as well as sample collection. Both grouts effectively permeated all of the formation. The PSX visually appeared to perform better, producing a more uniform and symmetric permeation regardless of heterogeneity, filling large as well as small pores and providing more structural strength than the CS. Numerical simulation of the injection tests incorporated a stochastic field to represent site heterogeneity and was able to replicate the general test behavior. Tiltmeters were used successfully to monitor surface displacements during grout injection...|$|R

Susceptibility of either material to microbial degradation would suggest that the effectiveness of a barrier in the subsurface may deteriorate over time. Degradation may result from several different biological events. Organisms may consume the material as a carbon and/or energy source, organisms may chemically change the material as a detoxification mechanism, or organisms may erode the material by their physical penetration of the material during growth. To determine if degradation occurs, physical interactions between soil microbes and the barrier materials were analyzed, and the metabolic activity of individual organisms in the presence of CS and PSX was measured...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{coefficient}} of friction (CoF) of skin against fabric when the skin {{is covered with a}} <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film versus a silicone dressing, relative to a bare skin baseline. Approach: A laboratory instrument allowing the measurement of friction be-tween two surfaces was used to compare the CoF between a fabric re-presenting bed linen (100 % cotton) and the skin of two laboratory operators, either bare (dry or hydrated) or covered with a <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film or a silicone dressing. Results: The CoF of hydrated skin was over twice the value found for dry skin. The <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film product reduced the CoF of hydrated skin {{to a greater extent than}} the silicone dressing. Innovation and Conclusion: Silicone dressings have recently been promoted to help prevent pressure ulcers. Published data have shown that their CoF is lower than other dressings, but the data were not compared to bare skin. We found that a <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film provided a greater reduction in the CoF of skin against linen than a silicone dressing. In the context of preventative use (e. g., application on intact skin) to reduce the risk of pressure ulcers, applying a <b>liquid</b> <b>barrier</b> film may reduce friction better than a silicone dressing...|$|R

The LBNL viscous barrier technology employs barrier liquids which, when injected into the subsurface, produce chemically benign nearly impermeable barriers through a very large increase in viscosity. The initially low-viscosity liquids are emplaced through multiple injection points in the subsurface and the intersecting plumes merge and completely surround the contaminant source and/or plume. Once in place, they gel or cure to form a nearly impermeable barrier.

The demonstration site was Retention Basin 281 - 3 H, a shallow catchment basin at the Savannah River Site, which is contaminated mainly by radionuclides ({sup 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr, and {sup 238 }Pu). The goals of the field demonstration were (a) to demonstrate the ability to create a continuous subsurface barrier in order to isolate the contaminants, and (b) to demonstrate the continuity, performance, and integrity of the barrier.

Based on the site characteristics and the functional requirements, a conceptual model was developed, the barrier specifications were defined, and lance injection was selected as the emplacement method. The injection strategy for the subsurface conditions at the site was determined using numerical simulations.

40|$|Landfill design {{requires}} a low permeability closure cap {{as well as}} a low permeability liner. The Savannah River Site, in South Carolina, has approximately 85 acres of mixed waste landfills covered with compacted kaolin clay. Maintaining low permeability of the clay cap requires both that the permeability of the compacted clay itself remain low and that the integrity of the barrier be maintained. Barrier breaches typically result from penetration by roots or animals, and especially cracks caused by uneven settling or desiccation. In this study, clay layers, 0. 81 m in diameter and 7. 6 cm thick, were compacted in 7 lysimeters to simulate closure caps. The hydraulic conductivity of each layer was measured, and the compacted clay layers (CCL`s) were cracked by drying. Then various repair techniques were applied and the effectiveness of each repair was assessed by remeasuring the hydraulic conductivity. Finally the repaired CCL was again dried and measured to determine how the repair responded to the conditions that caused the original failure.

To evaluate the long term stability of this type of barrier, an understanding of the interaction of the entrapped contaminants with the barrier material is needed.
