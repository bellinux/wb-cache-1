In her class of 113 students, only five were women and {{they were required to}} study in a separate workshop from the men. She graduated in 1937, the first Mexican woman to graduate with a degree in architecture. Her thesis, which won honorable mention from the jurors, was entitled Artillery <b>Barracks</b> <b>Type.</b> It was accepted in 1939 and she attained her professional designation.|$|R
5000|$|The United Fruit Company {{built a new}} town, called Tela Nueva, {{outside the}} older town for its employees. The town, which was {{carefully}} planned was segregated by race, and the best housing (single family homes of varying size) was in the [...] "White Zone" [...] (later called the [...] "American Zone") in which only Euro-American employees lived. The remaining workers lived in <b>barracks</b> <b>type</b> houses outside the zone. The town included an excellent hospital, good schools, and a golf course. Some of these units remain today {{as part of a}} hotel complex.|$|R
5000|$|The asylum {{complex is}} an example of the E-plan <b>barracks</b> <b>type</b> lunatic asylums based on the model 1850s asylum in Colney Hatch, England. Ararat is very similar in design to its sister asylums at Kew and Beechworth, however Ararat's use of linking bridges with an arcade on an arched {{gateways}} is unique. Kew is considered to be an example of Second Empire design, whereas Ararat and Beechworth are considered more typically Italianate, though both styles have similar characteristics. The buildings are constructed from oversize bricks, which were then rendered with cement. Two storeyed ward wings extend to each side, one for each sex. The ward wings were surrounded by courtyards lined with iron columned verandas, ...|$|R

Eighteen patients with acute tendo-achilles injury due {{to fall in}} the lndian <b>type</b> of <b>lavatory</b> pan came directly to the emergency department of Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, Kolkata and subsequently were treated in the Department of Plastic Surgery. Direct repair with prolene or stainless steel (SS) wires with or without flap cover were performed for management. Exercises were started 1 month later with gradual increase in activity. Complications were minor and temporary in nature. Long term results {{in the form of}} performing previous activities were excellent...|$|R
5000|$|During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Army {{maintained}} the 6th Convalescent Center at Cam Ranh Bay enabling most wounded soldiers {{to be treated}} in country. Only those who required advanced treatment not available in Vietnam got sent out of country. Injured and wounded soldiers whose injuries had received initial treatment, usually at an evacuation hospital unit, but who could not immediately return to duty, {{were sent to the}} 6th CC where they could recover and, if needed, receive further treatment which did not require hospitalization. The [...] "wards" [...] were typical wooden US Army Vietnam-type barracks. Some patients, based on the status of their injuries, were initially admitted to an Intensive Care ward. They were nothing like what one would view as an Intensive Care ward in a regular hospital. They were the normal <b>barracks</b> <b>type</b> [...] "wards," [...] but the patients were more closely monitored. When well enough, patients were moved to a regular ward, from which they were ultimately discharged when recovered enough to return to duty with their units.|$|R

2500|$|These new barracks {{were added}} to by the {{building}} of the new Havannah barracks (renamed Prince Philip Barracks on 27 June 1984), built to what was a standard design known as the [...] "Sandhurst Block", laid out to house a battalion or regiment in one barracks unit. This was followed shortly after by Martinique <b>Barracks</b> (Militia <b>type)</b> to the north-west of Louisburg. The old wooden hut Martinique barracks were renamed the San Domingo barracks. Demolished between 1961 and 1967, it is now the site for additional married quarters.|$|R

50|$|Players {{expand and}} grow by gaining new territories, these {{can either be}} bought or taken by force. They can then be {{assigned}} to varying different buildings, from military production <b>types</b> (<b>barracks</b> and war factories), production buildings (bakeries, steel factories, research facilities and cement factories), missile defence installations and money generating buildings (beaches, solar panels, tax offices and condominiums). These buildings will determine what sort of economy the player has, whether they are generating cash to purchase units and resources or producing units to sell for resources, or producing resources to sell for units.|$|R
50|$|To {{the rear}} of the turret was the side crew door, on the {{starboard}} side of the fuselage. This was the main entrance to the aircraft, and also could be used as an emergency exit. The Elsan chemical toilet, a <b>type</b> of aircraft <b>lavatory,</b> was located near the spars for the tailplane. At the extreme tail-end of the fuselage, the rear gunner sat in his exposed position in the tail turret, which was entered through a small hatch in {{the rear of}} the fuselage. Depending on the size of the rear gunner, the area was so cramped that the gunner would often hang his parachute on a hook inside the fuselage, near the turret doors. Neither the mid-upper nor the rear gunner's position was heated, and the gunners had to wear electrically heated suits to prevent hypothermia and frostbite.|$|R
40|$|The sale {{of public}} real estate assets {{is one of}} the main issues in the governments agenda. The goal is to find {{resources}} and improve the management of the building stock. Such assets are different from each other and transformation involves issues of urban and regional importance. Former military sites are mainly characterized by: different <b>types</b> (<b>barracks,</b> military airports, military bases, military hospitals, firing ranges, powder magazine, ports), spread out, obsolescence and environmental liabilities. Also historical buildings are relatively few in the military building stock. It follows that these assets cannot be converted to other uses without a technological knowledge. The paper discusses the key issues in rehabilitation of the military sites with particular attention to recent international experiences. The paper then goes on to focus the role of the research institutions in the screening required of the military real estate to be divested...|$|R

The Arkansas State Penitentiary System at that time had already {{been found to have}} held inmates at the Cummins Unit under conditions rising to the level of unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment, in cases tried by the US District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, among others."Certain characteristics of the Arkansas prison system serve to distinguish it from most other penal institutions in this country. First, it has very few paid employees; armed trusties inmates, according to the source guard rank and file inmates and trusties perform other tasks usually and more properly performed by civilian or [...] "free world" [...] personnel. Second, convicts not in isolation are confined when not working, and are required to sleep at night in open dormitory <b>type</b> <b>barracks</b> in which rows of beds are arranged side by side; there are large numbers of men in each barracks. Third, there is no meaningful program of rehabilitation whatever at Cummins; while there is a promising and helpful program at Tucker, it is still minimal." ...|$|R
2500|$|Among {{the many}} {{different}} types of base bodies are the Military Academy, the School of the Arms and the regiments. The Military Academy is a public military university establishment with the primary mission of training the professional officers of the arms and services of the Army and of the National Republican Guard. The School of the Arms is a training unit with the primary mission of conceiving and provide training programs in the scope of the combat and combat support arms. The regiments are the base units of the Army and integrate the structure for the readying of forces and logistical support. Despite being designated [...] "regiments" [...] and being usually associated to an arm of service for historical reasons, presently these types of organizations are not deployable units, serving mainly as military bases intended to lodge and support the operational deployable units (battalions/groups, independent companies/squadrons/batteries and others) permanently stationed or temporary deployed in their <b>barracks.</b> Some regimental <b>type</b> units do not include the word [...] "regiment" [...] in their designation as are the cases of the Special Operations Troops Center, of the Santa Margarida Military Camp and of the Army Materiel General Support Unit.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{undertakes}} {{a comparative}} analysis {{of some of}} the stone buildings within the forts of the completed concept of Hadrian's Wall. The buildings included are the principia, granaries, gates and <b>barracks.</b> Each building <b>type</b> has been measured and inspected on site, or the data obtained from archival or documentary sources. As a background to the study the forts are set {{in the context of the}} Wall, examining its structure, garrisons and taking an overview of the archaeological record, additionally general Roman building techniques are reviewed. The selected buildings within each fort are then discussed and compared with other buildings on the Wall, or on other military sites. In this way then- form, dimensional analysis, construction sequence and building techniques are considered and discussed. Common features and major differences are highlighted in the forts and the buildings, and comparisons drawn. Some tentative links are made as to the builders of the forts and the probable use of standard units of measure. Reconstructions of the buildings are put forward, taking into account the archaeological evidence and architectural considerations. Supporting information supplied in the appendices includes data relating to each fort as well as schedules of dimensions of the buildings, together with comparative tables. A catalogue of the decorated and moulded stonework sets out and discusses the stonework from the various buildings...|$|R
