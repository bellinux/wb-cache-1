5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so {{the black hole}} must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.|$|E

25|$|However, the semilattices used {{in these}} {{negative}} results are relatively complicated. The following result, proved by Ploščica, Tůma, and Wehrung in 1998, is more striking, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> examples of representable semilattices that do not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. We denote by FV(Ω) the free lattice on Ω in V, for any variety V of lattices.|$|E
25|$|Cave 24 is like Cave 21, {{unfinished}} {{but much}} larger. It features {{the second largest}} monastery hall (29.3 X 29.3 m) after Cave 4. The cave 24 monastery has been important to scholarly studies of the site <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> how multiple crews of workers completed their objectives in parallel. The cell construction began {{as soon as the}} aisle had been excavated and while the main hall and sanctum were under construction. The construction of Cave 24 was planned in 467 CE, but likely started in 475 CE, with support from Buddhabhadra, then abruptly ended in 477 with the sponsor king Harisena's death.|$|E
25|$|Baekje {{was founded}} in 18 BC and its {{territory}} included {{the west coast of}} the Korean peninsula. After the fall of Nangnang County under the Han dynasty in China, Baekje established friendships with China and Japan. Great temples were built during this time. The earliest stone pagoda of the Mireuksa Temple in Iksan county is of particular interest <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> the transitional features from a wooden pagoda to a stone one. Baekje assimilated diverse influences and expressed its derivation from Chinese models. Later, important elements of the architectural style of Baekje were adopted by Japan.|$|E
50|$|The album sleeve {{showed a}} 15th-century {{painting}} of Christ by Giovanni Bellini. The picture {{was removed from}} the version of the album issued in Germany <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> Christ's nipple exposed.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} about PROTON, a {{reactive}} policy management system developed {{to set up}} policies to decide when vertical handover should occur, based on a 3 -layer subsystem. This work is significant <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> that PROTON could not be run on the mobile node. The paper proposed running PROTON in the network that would then specify a finite-state machine (i. e. an autonomic system) to execute on the mobile. The work is significant <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> that autonomic techniques {{can be used in}} 4 G systems to support client-based handover. It is also a tremendously useful paper for implementers of real systems...|$|R
25|$|BMI Prime, a {{modification}} of the BMI system, is the ratio of actual BMI to upper limit optimal BMI (currently defined at 25kg/m2), i.e., the actual BMI expressed {{as a proportion of}} upper limit optimal. The ratio of actual body weight to body weight for upper limit optimal BMI (25kg/m2) is equal to BMI Prime. BMI Prime is a dimensionless number independent of units. Individuals with BMI Prime less than 0.74 are underweight; those with between 0.74 and 1.00 have optimal weight; and those at 1.00 or greater are overweight. BMI Prime is useful clinically <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> by what ratio (e.g. 1.36) or percentage (e.g. 136%, or 36% above) a person deviates from the maximum optimal BMI.|$|E
25|$|Ghailani was transported from Guantanamo Bay to New York City {{to await}} {{trial in the}} United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in June 2009. When the case came to trial, the judge {{disallowed}} the testimony of a key witness. On November 17, 2010, a jury found him guilty of one count of conspiracy, but acquitted him of 284 other charges including all murder counts. Critics of the Obama administration said the verdict proves civilian courts cannot be trusted to prosecute terrorists <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> a jury might acquit such a defendant entirely. Supporters of the trial {{have said that the}} conviction and the stiff sentencing prove that the federal justice system works.|$|E
25|$|The {{second reason}} Hacienda Buena Vista is {{significant}} {{is that it}} offers {{one of the best}} remaining examples of a Puerto Rican coffee plantation. This is important because {{in the latter part of}} the nineteenth century the coffee produced in Puerto Rico and exported to Europe and the United States was considered among the finest in the world. It is said to have even been the favorite at the Vatican at the time. Hacienda Buena Vista is also significant <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> the evolution of the coffee industry in the region. Various periods can be appreciated. These range from the cultivation of produce such as plantains (1833–1845); to the production of flour (from rice and corn) (1847–1872). These products were staples for the subsistence of the local population.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{banned in the}} Republic of Ireland <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> a priest having a {{relationship}} with a woman (even though, in the film, the relationship takes place before the character becomes a priest).|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was banned from MTV <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> people jumping {{in front of}} trains to kill themselves, though it has on {{occasion}} been shown {{as a part of}} 120 Minutes which is broadcast post-watershed.|$|R
50|$|Asyrmatos {{was used}} as natural scenery for the notable Greek neorealistic film Synoikia To Oneiro. The film was censored by the Greek {{authorities}} of the 1960s <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> real pictures of poverty and misery near Athens.|$|R
25|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} quantum mechanics in some contexts.

25|$|The primary {{threats to}} this species are {{anthropogenic}} habitat disturbance and hunting for food. A common human disturbance occurs through habitat destruction via land reclamation from marshes for agriculture, which has occurred especially in southeast Brazil and may therefore evoke conservation {{concern for the}} species in this area. Claiming land for agriculture by digging canals, together with land filling and sewage discharges may also threaten dry-season foraging environments for maguari storks especially on the northern Rio de Janeiro coast. The maguari stork is vulnerable to nesting habitat destruction <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> nest-site fidelity, {{and will continue to}} nest in the same place even after onset of recent anthropogenic disturbance. Use of pesticides may also adversely affect the health and breeding success of this species. The capture of individuals for food presents another survival threat and occurs particularly in the Southern Amazon and Venezuela.|$|E
25|$|Some dinophytes, like Kryptoperidinium and Durinskia have a diatom (heterokontophyte) derived {{chloroplast}}. These chloroplasts are {{bounded by}} up to five membranes, (depending on whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast, or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it). The diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original mitochondria, and has endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, a nucleus, and of course, red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete cell, all inside the host's endoplasmic reticulum lumen. However the diatom endosymbiont can't store its own food—its storage polysaccharide is found in granules in the dinophyte host's cytoplasm instead. The diatom endosymbiont's nucleus is present, but it probably can't be called a nucleomorph <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> no sign of genome reduction, and might have even been expanded. Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.|$|E
30|$|Finally, it was {{important}} to evaluate silicalite- 1 (450  nm) as an adsorbent for the creation of other enzyme biosensors. This zeolite was chosen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> the best results when developing urease-based biosensors in the previous part of the work.|$|R
50|$|Mortimer painted Queen Elizabeth II in 1998. The {{commission}} marked her 50 {{years as}} President of the Royal Society of Arts. Prue Leith, who arranged the commission, recalls {{the painting was}} controversial <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> the Queen's head separated from her body.|$|R
60|$|I {{was pleased}} {{because she was}} pleased, and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> that Lord Pledge had some sense of {{gratitude}} (although he afterward took occasion to intimate that I owed the favor chiefly to HOPE), and I believe my eyes never expressed more fondness.|$|R
25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E
25|$|On April 9, 2015, the Öberg Astrochemistry Group {{published}} a paper stating they detected the first complex carbon molecule in a protoplanetary disk, this molecule being methyl cyanide. Methyl cyanide (CH3CN) {{is thought to}} be important for the origins of life because it contains carbon-nitrogen bonds, which make up amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Up until this discovery, it was unclear if these molecules could exist in abundance in young disks because of their turbulent and chaotic nature. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Öberg’s group was able to survey the orbital debris of the newly formed star MWC 480, to discover enough methyl cyanide to fill all of Earth’s oceans and the presence of other simpler molecules such as hydrogen cyanide. This discovery is significant <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> that the backbone of life, complex carbon bonds, are not exclusive to our universe. In an interview, Öberg stated that comet records suggest the presence of complex organic molecules in other protoplanetary disks as well.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, despite Metzinger's conceptualism of Cubist painting—the {{reflexive}} {{function of}} complex geometry, juxtaposed multiple perspectives, planar fragmentation suggesting motion and rhythmic play with various symmetry types—there does manifest itself in Danseuse a certain spatial depth or perspective {{reminiscent of the}} optical illusion of space of the Renaissance; in the way, for example, the wall-mounted lighting fixtures become smaller with distance, and so too {{the man at the}} upper left appearing smaller in the background than his counterparts in the foreground. Interesting <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> that non-Euclidean geometry does not imply the absolute destruction of classical perspective, or that simply, the breakdown of classical perspective need not be complete. Unlike the flattening of space associated with the Cubist paintings of others, Metzinger had no intention of abolishing depth of field. Of course here perspectival space is only alluded to by changes of scale, not by co-ordinated linear convergence, resulting in a complex space perfectly adapted to a stage-set. This feature is observed not only in Metzinger's Cubist paintings, but also in his Divisionist and proto-Cubist works between 1905 and 1909, as well as in his more figurative works of the 1920s (during the Return to order phase).|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} other American comic strips, Beetle Bailey has been censored {{from time to}} time. In 1962, the comic strip was censored <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> a belly button, and in 2006, the {{description}} of Rocky's criminal past was replaced with a non-criminal past.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Thai Airways {{flight attendants}} urged the {{government}} to remove a prime-time TV drama (Songkhram Nang Fah) <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> women flight attendants in short-skirted uniforms fighting over a male pilot. They complained the soap opera portrayed their job in a negative light.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} Strategic Hamlet Program and the {{intensified}} military operations of 1962, the events at Ap Bac placed additional pressure on Diem's government <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>it</b> could not cope with the resurgence of the Viet Cong, particularly in the regions surrounding the Mekong River.|$|R
500|$|In contrast, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode, calling it [...] "one of the series' all-time best episodes, mainly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> us a human side, not just of Principal Skinner, but of his hectorish [...] Mom as well." [...] They add that [...] "Martin Sheen steals the show [...] in a brief but {{important}} slice of Simpsons history." [...] Total Films Nathan Ditum named Martin Sheen's performance in the episode the 20th best guest appearance on The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|The Bermúdez {{album was}} {{borrowed}} by the Academy for the 1863 edition. The original titles or captions were etched onto the plates, even with Goya's spelling mistakes. One title was changed, one plate had work added, and the printing {{was carried out}} with much more ink on the plates (producing [...] "surface tone") than in the proofs, in accordance with mid-century taste. The Bermúdez set is considered [...] "uniquely important... <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> the series as Goya must have intended to publish it, {{and the way he}} intended the plates to be printed". There is therefore a distinction between the published edition of 1863, with 80 plates, and the full series in the album, which contains 82 (ignoring the three small Prisioneros).|$|E
500|$|Part of {{what this}} {{argument}} shows {{is that there is}} a least upper bound of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc.: a smallest number that is greater than all of the terms of the sequence. [...] One of the axioms of the real number system is the completeness axiom, which states that every bounded sequence has a least upper bound. [...] This least upper bound is one way to define infinite decimal expansions: the real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations. [...] The argument here does not need to assume completeness to be valid, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> that this particular sequence of rational numbers in fact has a least upper bound, and that this least upper bound is equal to one.|$|E
50|$|Even during filming {{there was}} an {{expectation}} that the film would be controversial <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> Jewish settlers fighting the British and not Arabs. Universal barred reporters from the set {{during the last week}} of filming because several London papers had carried adverse articles on the project.|$|R
50|$|Originally Morocco leather was {{imported}} to Europe from Morocco, {{and from}} the late 16th century it was valued in luxury bookbindings in Western countries because of its strength and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> off the gilding.
