Types of features have also been studied in correlation to categories of news content. Theory: Marketing, marketing communications theory, and web theory are applied for the purpose of describing the differences and similarities in choices made by tabloids and <b>broadsheets,</b> in regards to selection and use of interactive features. Method: A quantitative method of analysis has been applied. The content of four of Sweden’s best known newspapers, Aftonbladet, Expressen, Dagens Nyheter (DN) and Svenska Dagbladet (SvD), has been analysed during the length of a week in December 2015. Results: Results indicate that tabloids interact more with their readers than <b>broadsheets,</b> using a broader variety of types of interactive features connected to a spectrum of social media outlets. <b>Broadsheets</b> use fewer types of interactive features, but offer them to their audience as much as the tabloids do. Tabloids let their readers comment on news more often than <b>broadsheets,</b> but <b>broadsheets</b> present more of actively solicited user generated content in their content. Tabloids offer most interactive features in news categorized as sports and entertainment. <b>Broadsheets</b> offer most interactive features in content categorised as news and entertainment...|$|R

The newspaper was established by two wealthy local pastoralists, Auber George Jones and Thomas Darlow and first printed on 10 December 1868 by editor Frank Hutchison, an Oxford graduate. Originally printed bi-weekly, by 1880 it was tri-weekly and finally became 'daily' on 31 December 1910. In 1962 the newspaper reduced in size from a <b>broadsheet</b> to a tabloid format. The Riverina Leader, the local free community newspaper was launched in May 1979.|$|E

Sunderland was heavily bombed in the Second World War and, although the Echo building was undamaged, it was forced to print its competitor's paper under wartime rules. It was during this time that the paper's format changed, from a <b>broadsheet</b> to its current tabloid layout, because of national newsprint shortages.|$|E

5|$|Grimshaw {{was born}} in or around Great Harwood, Lancashire, in 1824 or 1825 {{and was one of}} six {{children}} brought up in a working-class family. His father, Thomas, had a reputation as a radical public speaker {{in the early part of}} the 19th century. Grimshaw initially worked as a cotton weaver before becoming a full-time activist and agitator. He first came to prominence in the village of Royton, near Oldham, in 1852 as a campaigner for the improvement and enforcement of the Factory Acts, to improve the working conditions of those employed in the cotton mills. In the same year he became editor of the anti-Whig <b>broadsheet,</b> the Royton Vindicator. He criticised the suppression of local political activists and supported the alliance of the Chartist movement with the Tories against the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Odense is {{the centre}} for media {{activity}} on Funen, and {{the hub of}} the regional network. Its principal newspaper is Fyens Stiftstidende, a daily <b>broadsheet</b> owned by Den Fynske Bladfond and published by Fyens Stiftstidende A/S, which was established on 3 January 1772. Until 1841 the newspaper was known as Kongelig Priviligerede Odense Adresse-Contoirs Efterretninger, and on 13 April 1993 the newspaper changed its 221-year-old tradition as a midday newspaper, to a morning paper. In 2013, it had an average circulation of 47,738, down from some 60,500 in 2005.

5|$|The Second World War brought havoc to Wearside, with Sunderland one of {{the seven}} most heavily bombed towns in the country. Despite the heavy {{shelling}} of the North East coast and River Wear, the Echo offices and printing plant escaped undamaged. The Shields Gazette, the Echo's nearest rival, was not as fortunate. Its premises in Chapter Row, South Shields, were bombed in September 1941 and, under an emergency wartime arrangement, the paper was printed on the Echo presses. The Echo continued to be published throughout the war, despite paper rationing, a lack of reporters and a strict censorship of photographs. The war did have one major impact on the Echo—in the form of its size. Wartime restrictions on newsprint reduced the former <b>broadsheet</b> to its present tabloid size, and this style has been retained ever since.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Jamaican <b>broadsheet</b> The Gleaner, Carolyn Cooper, Professor of Literary and Cultural Studies at UWI, {{condemned}} the group who committed Jones' murder. She blamed their behaviour on the selective {{use of the}} Bible, noting that while many Jamaicans embrace those Biblical passages which condemn same-sex sexual activity and cross-dressing, they are themselves typically guilty of many other Biblical sins, such as adultery and murder. She commented that Jones had been killed just for being himself and expressed the hope that his killers face legal prosecution for their crime. The following week she published a follow-up article in which she responded to several emails that she had received which claimed that the real victims of the scenario were the men whom Jones deceived when he was dancing with them. She reiterated her condemnation of Jones' killers, remarking that rather than retaliating violently, they should have brushed {{it off with a}} humorous comment.|$|E
5|$|The Sunday Times is a British {{national}} <b>broadsheet</b> newspaper, the Sunday sister {{paper of}} The Times. In 1968, under {{the ownership of}} Lord Thomson, The Sunday Times {{had been involved in}} a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an agreed final purchase price of £250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of £60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both The Times and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of The Sunday Times. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of The Times in 1974. Trevor-Roper—who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979—was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the Führer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published The Last Days of Hitler (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in Hitler's War Directives (1964) and Hitler's Place in History (1965).|$|E
