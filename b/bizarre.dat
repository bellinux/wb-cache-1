5|$|GioGio's <b>Bizarre</b> Adventure was {{developed}} by Capcom. It is based on Vento Aureo, the fifth part of Hirohiko Araki's manga series JoJo's <b>Bizarre</b> Adventure, and features artwork by Araki. To recreate the art style of the manga, Capcom developed a technique called Artistoon, {{which is used to}} render cel-shaded graphics. Capcom published the game in Japan on July 25, 2002 for the PlayStation 2, with a budget-priced re-release following on September 20, 2007.|$|E

5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of <b>bizarre</b> cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these <b>bizarre</b> structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the <b>bizarre</b> crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{the series}} Warehouse 13 premiered on the Syfy cable network. The series later {{introduced}} a character named Steve Jinks, played by actor Aaron Ashmore, a gay government agent assigned {{to assist in}} the containment of <b>bizarre</b> artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The aerial robots vary {{in design}} from fixed wing airplanes, to {{conventional}} helicopters, to ducted fans, to airships, and beyond to <b>bizarre</b> hybrid creations. Because the competition focuses on fully autonomous behavior, the air vehicle itself is of less importance.|$|E
5|$|The film's protagonist, Jacob, is a Vietnam veteran whose {{experiences}} {{prior to}} and during the war result in strange, fragmentary flashbacks and <b>bizarre</b> hallucinations that continue to haunt him. As his ordeal worsens, Jacob desperately attempts {{to figure out the}} truth.|$|E

5|$|While {{alternative}} East Coast hip hop albums, such as De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising ultimately {{sold over}} a million copies, there was no equivalent from the West Coast. With <b>Bizarre</b> Ride, The Pharcyde {{became one of the}} first alternative acts on the West Coast to sell large numbers of albums. Though <b>Bizarre</b> Ride did reach Gold status, the album's sales paled in comparison to West Coast G-funk releases of the era, such as The Chronic by Dr. Dre and Doggystyle by Snoop Dogg.|$|E

5|$|Amongst other {{witnesses}} to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably <b>bizarre</b> or compromising situations, leading {{him to believe}} that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Douglas {{was very}} close with her mother after her parents' separation. She {{witnessed}} her mother's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her, she exhibited <b>bizarre,</b> childlike behaviors.

5|$|Capcom also {{announced}} North American and European releases of the game, and showcased {{it at the}} 2002 edition of the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The North American version was to be titled JoJo's <b>Bizarre</b> Adventure, while the European version was announced to be titled GioGio's <b>Bizarre</b> Adventure in August 2002. This change in naming was on the request of Araki, who wanted an Italian spelling {{in order to stay}} true to the title character. The game was shown at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's PlayStation Experience expo in August 2002, and was available for the public to play. At E3 2002, it was announced for an October 2002 release in the West, but was delayed to December 2002, and then again to February 14, 2003. By May 2003, it had not been released outside Japan, and was not listed as part of Capcom's game lineup for E3 2003, leading Eurogamer to speculate that the Western release had been cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} for the Europa League group stages in 2011–12 in <b>bizarre</b> circumstances. Swiss side Sion defeated Celtic 3–1 on aggregate in the qualifying tie. Sion, however, were {{thrown out of the}} tournament by UEFA due to them fielding ineligible players in the two games against Celtic. Celtic were thus reinstated, eventually finishing third in Group I, behind Atlético Madrid and Udinese and ahead of Rennes.|$|E
5|$|Cute 'em ups feature brightly {{coloured}} graphics depicting surreal {{settings and}} enemies. Newer, particularly Japanese, cute 'em ups may employ overtly sexual characters and innuendo.

5|$|In 1969 {{there were}} nine band members and Zappa was {{supporting}} the group himself from his publishing royalties whether they played or not. 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with MGM Records' interference, left them for Warner Bros.

5|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{may experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often <b>bizarre</b> or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} <b>bizarre</b> {{software}} products for the ZX81 came about {{as a result of}} music companies attempting to capitalise on the popularity of Sinclair's computers. In 1983, EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B-side. Island Records responded with XL1 by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley, packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The large frill {{also may}} have helped to {{increase}} body area to regulate body temperature. A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of Stegosaurus, although this use alone would {{not account for the}} <b>bizarre</b> and extravagant variation seen in different members of the Ceratopsidae. This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display.|$|E
5|$|The large frill on Styracosaurus {{and related}} genera {{also may have}} helped to {{increase}} body area to regulate body temperature, like the ears of the modern elephant. A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of Stegosaurus, although this use alone would {{not account for the}} <b>bizarre</b> and extravagant variation seen in different members of the Ceratopsidae. This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display.|$|E
5|$|The {{professor}} {{has received}} acclaim from critics, particularly for his <b>bizarre</b> inventions {{such as the}} hamburger earmuffs, and he has appeared on many reviewers' listings of their favorite supporting characters from The Simpsons.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the <b>bizarre</b> facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and <b>bizarre</b> syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
5|$|An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black {{comedy and}} B-movie conventions, the film portrays <b>bizarre</b> {{situations}} involving a death row inmate. The film was a box-office flop, {{and has since}} fallen into obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi. Few critics reviewed the film, though the little amount of critical attention it received was mostly negative. Several elements of the film influenced later productions by Raimi, {{and the failure of}} Crimewave directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II (1987). The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film.|$|E
5|$|Bill Nighy as Davy Jones: Captain of the Flying Dutchman. Davy Jones {{was once}} a human being who was unable to bear the pain of losing his true love. He carved out his heart {{and put it into}} the Dead Man's Chest, then buried it in a secret location. He has become a <b>bizarre</b> {{creature}} – part octopus, part lobster, part man. Jones collects the souls of dead or dying sailors to serve aboard his ship for one hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in his development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and <b>bizarre</b> to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E
