50|$|Apart {{from the}} Darwin {{width of the}} reflection, the width of single {{dislocation}} images may additionally depend on the Burgers vector of the dislocation, i.e. both its length and its orientation (relative to the scattering vector), and, in plane wave topography, on the angular departure from the exact <b>Bragg</b> <b>angle.</b> The latter dependence follows a reciprocity law, meaning that dislocations images become narrower inversely as the angular distance grows.

The XRD pattern of AC nano alloy displays two strong peaks which are assigned to the (111) reflections for silver and copper, respectively.

50|$|A {{simple method}} of {{modulating}} the optical beam travelling through the acousto-optic device {{is done by}} switching the acoustic field on and off. When off the light beam is undiverted, the intensity of light directed at the Bragg diffraction angle is zero. When switched on and Bragg diffraction occurs, the intensity at the <b>Bragg</b> <b>angle</b> increases. So the acousto-optic device is modulating the output along the Bragg diffraction angle, switching it on and off. The device is operated as a modulator by keeping the acoustic wavelength (frequency) fixed and varying the drive power to vary the amount {{of light in the}} deflected beam.|$|E

If the angle of illumination is changed, reconstruction will occur at a different wavelength and the colour of the re-constructed scene changes.

50|$|White-beam {{topography}} {{uses the}} full bandwidth of X-ray wavelengths in the incoming beam, without any wavelength filtering (no monochromator). The technique is particularly useful {{in combination with}} synchrotron radiation sources, due to their wide and continuous wavelength spectrum. In contrast to the monochromatic case, in which accurate sample adjustment is often {{necessary in order to}} reach diffraction conditions, the Bragg equation is always and automatically fulfilled {{in the case of a}} white X-ray beam: Whatever the angle at which the beam hits a specific lattice plane, there is always one wavelength in the incident spectrum for which the <b>Bragg</b> <b>angle</b> is fulfilled just at this precise angle (on condition that the spectrum is wide enough). White-beam topography is therefore a very simple and fast technique. Disadvantages include the high X-ray dose, possibly leading to radiation damage to the sample, and the necessity to carefully shield the experiment.|$|E
50|$|A {{relatively}} new topography-related technique (first published in 1996) {{is the so-called}} reticulography. Based on white-beam topography, the new aspect consists in placing a fine-scaled metallic grid ("reticule") between sample and detector. The metallic grid lines are highly absorbing, producing dark lines in the recorded image. While for flat, homgeneous sample {{the image of the}} grid is rectilinear, just as the grid itself, strongly deformed grid images may occur in the case of tilted or strained sample. The deformation results from <b>Bragg</b> <b>angle</b> changes (and thus different directions of propagation of the diffracted beams) due to lattice parameter differences (or tilted crystallites) in thesample. The grid serves to split the diffracted beam into an array of microbeams, and to backtrace the propagation of each individual microbeam onto the sample surface. By recording reticulographic images at several sample-to-detector distances, and appropriate data processing, local distributions of misorientation across the sample surface can be derived.|$|E
50|$|Inside the SEM, the {{electron}} beam is focussed {{onto the surface}} of a crystalline sample. The electrons enter the sample and some may backscatter. Escaping electrons may exit near to the <b>Bragg</b> <b>angle</b> and diffract to form Kikuchi bands which correspond to each of the lattice diffracting crystal planes. If the system geometry is well described, it is possible to relate the bands present in the diffraction pattern to the underlying crystal phase and orientation of the material within {{the electron}} interaction volume. Each band can be indexed individually by the Miller indices of the diffracting plane which formed it. In most materials, only three bands/planes which intercept are required to describe a unique solution to the crystal orientation (based upon their interplanar angles) and most commercial systems use look up tables with international crystal data bases to perform indexing. This crystal orientation relates the orientation of each sampled point to a reference crystal orientation.|$|E

Recent improvements that have been introduced into the data analysis are described. The ability to process data from arbitrary detector positions allows for optimization of the experimental setup for higher spatial or strain resolution, including high <b>Bragg</b> <b>angles</b> (0 < 2 θ < 180 °). The geometry refinement, grain indexing and strain analysis are based on Friedel pairs of diffraction spots and can handle thousands of grains in single- or multiphase materials. The grain reconstruction is performed with a simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique using three-dimensional oblique angle projections and GPU acceleration. The improvements are demonstrated with the following experimental examples: (1) uranium oxide mapped at high spatial resolution (300  nm voxel size); (2) combined grain mapping and section topography at high <b>Bragg</b> <b>angles</b> of an Al–Li alloy; (3) ferrite and austenite crystals in a dual-phase steel; (4) grain mapping and elastic strains of a commercially pure titanium sample containing 1755 grains...|$|R
