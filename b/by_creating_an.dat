5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> {{opening in the}} body using a sharp object through the area to be pierced. This can either be done by puncturing an opening using a needle (usually a hollow medical needle) or scalpel or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through scalpelling.|$|E
5|$|After the episode, fans {{wanted their}} own bobblehead dolls of Dwight. A {{petition}} was {{started to get}} NBC to sell them at their online store. NBC responded <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> initial run of 4,000bobblehead dolls, which sold out almost immediately. The network decided to make more, and since then, the bobblehead has become the best-selling merchandise on the NBC website, and has sold over 150,000units.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, Presque Isle {{played a}} part in the victory over the British in the Battle of Lake Erie. Oliver Hazard Perry, {{commander}} of the American fleet, made strategic use of the bay as a place to construct six of the nine ships in his fleet. Using this location protected the men <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> obstacle, forcing potential attackers to circumnavigate the peninsula to reach them.|$|E

5|$|The normal resting {{heart rate}} {{is called the}} sinus rhythm, created and {{sustained}} by the sinoatrial node, a group of pacemaking cells found in {{the wall of the}} right atrium. Cells in the sinoatrial node do this <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> action potential. The cardiac action potential is created by the movement of specific electrolytes {{into and out of the}} pacemaker cells. The action potential then spreads to nearby cells.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Cromwell's rule and the {{subsequent}} Restoration, Smith manoeuvred to protect his position and to further his essentially Puritan religious stance, which he modified to suit the religious sensibilities of the new Royalist regime. He achieved this in part <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> eponymous trust whereby some of his Irish property {{was used for the}} purpose of financing the education of children and provided scholarships for the most promising of those to continue their studies at Trinity College, Dublin. However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily to protect his interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Kotaku after {{the announcement of the}} remaster, Schafer stated that he has long considered the aspect of a Grim Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting that was created for the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the issue is <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E
5|$|In {{collaboration}} with Burton Richter, O'Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, particle beams from the Stanford Linear Accelerator {{were collected in}} his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 MeV. At the time, this was the highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 attometers across. O'Neill considered his device {{to be capable of}} only seconds of storage, but, <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours. In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction. He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as professor emeritus until his death.|$|E
5|$|Jones himself {{came under}} threat of {{transfer}} or subordination in April 1943 when the Federal government began moves to unite the Air Force's command <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> overarching Air Officer Commanding RAAF position that would have effectively replaced Jones as CAS and also been senior to Bostock. Air Marshal Drummond was again approached but once more the British Air Ministry refused to release him, having selected him for an Air Council post. MacArthur rejected two other RAF candidates, and the plan was held over. In the King's Birthday Honours that June, Jones was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E

5|$|The Hammond organ is an {{electric}} organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various {{models have been}} produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so it can drive a speaker cabinet. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker.|$|E
5|$|The firm {{expanded}} {{throughout the}} 1880s <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>an</b> agency network, establishing sixteen offices in nearby settlements, and offering free trade discounts on their beer of 20 percent or higher. By 1889, the brewery was producing 150,000 barrels annually. In 1889, the company's first scientifically-trained head brewer was appointed, Percy Clinch, son of Charles Clinch of the Eagle Brewery in Witney. In 1892, the partnership became a limited company called John Smith's Tadcaster Brewery Company Limited, with Henry Herbert Riley-Smith as chairman. In 1899 the company acquired Simpson & Co of Market Weighton, with 51 public houses, and converted the brewery into a maltings.|$|E
