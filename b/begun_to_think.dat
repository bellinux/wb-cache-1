Méhul's first published composition was a book of piano pieces in 1783. He also arranged airs from popular operas and by the late 1780s he had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about an operatic career for himself.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Yugoslav {{members of}} the Albanian Communist Party had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that this was a}} plot by Tito who {{intended}} to destabilize the Party. Koçi Xoxe, Sejfulla Malëshova and others who supported Yugoslavia were looked upon with deep suspicion. Tito's position on Albania was that it was too weak to stand on its own and that it would do better as a part of Yugoslavia. Hoxha alleged that Tito had made it his goal to get Albania into Yugoslavia, firstly by creating the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and Mutual Aid in 1946. In time, Albania began to feel that the treaty was heavily slanted towards Yugoslav interests, much like the Italian agreements with Albania under Zog that made the nation dependent upon Italy.|$|E
500|$|In {{the latter}} 1930s, Waugh's {{inclination}} to Catholic and conservative polemics affected his {{standing with the}} general reading public. The Campion biography is said by David Wykes to be [...] "so rigidly biased {{that it has no}} claims to make as history". The pro-fascist tone in parts of Waugh in Abyssinia offended readers and critics and prevented its publication in America. There was general relief among critics when Scoop, in 1938, indicated a return to Waugh's earlier comic style. Critics had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that his wit had been displaced by partisanship and propaganda.|$|E

500|$|Berry was {{religious}} {{as well as}} worldly, {{and collected}} relics as keenly as other types of objects. [...] By 1397 both of his sons had died, {{he was in his}} late fifties, and he had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of his tomb, finally deciding to build a new [...] "Sainte Chapelle" [...] in his capital of Bourges to house it. [...] His collection of relics included objects claimed to be the wedding ring of the Virgin Mary, a cup used at the Wedding at Cana, a piece of the Burning Bush and many others. [...] However the provenance of the Holy Thorn, as well as its centrality to the Passion of Christ must have given it a special status. [...] The crown from which the thorn came had been bought in 1239 by Louis IX, both a saint and King of France, from the Latin Emperor in Constantinople, Baldwin II, along with a portion of the True Cross. [...] Both had been in Constantinople since the Muslim Conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century, and may very well be the same relics that Bishop Paulinus of Nola saw in Jerusalem in 409. [...] There {{are a number of other}} thorn relics said to have come from the relic in the Paris Sainte Chapelle, including the far smaller Salting Reliquary in the British Museum, a French pendant of about 1340.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} he had reached the eighth grade, Johnson had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about a future in basketball. He had become a {{dominant}} junior high player, once scoring 48 points in a game. Johnson looked forward to playing at Sexton High School, a school with a very successful basketball team and a great tradition that also happened to be only five blocks from his home. His plans underwent a dramatic change when he learned that he would be bused to predominately white Everett High School instead of going to Sexton, which was predominately black. Johnson's sister Pearl and his brother Larry had bused to Everett the previous year and did not have a pleasant experience. There were incidents of racism, with rocks being thrown at buses carrying black students, and white parents refusing {{to send their children to}} school. Larry was kicked off the basketball team after a confrontation during practice, prompting him to beg Earvin not to play. Johnson did join the basketball team but became angry after several days when his new teammates ignored him during practice, not even passing the ball. He nearly got into a fight with another player before head coach George Fox intervened. Eventually Johnson accepted his situation, and the small group of black students looked to him as their leader. When recalling the events in his autobiography, My Life, he talked about how his time at Everett had changed him: ...|$|E

[...] The new… nationalism precipitates strong tensions between conservative and radical elements within local intelligentsias. [...] Here too, the Haitian experience of the early 1900s, with its armed conflict…Finally, the accelerated urbanization and migration experienced in Haiti, which resulted from the centralizing tendencies of the state, import-dependency, and the extreme exploitation of labor, …trends {{in the global economy}} created the impetus for a massive population exodus after World War II." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{gap between}} the end of {{promotion}} for iMegaphone internationally and the re-promotion, Heap had also <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about her second solo album, and had started writing songs, both solo, as well as working with Guy Sigsworth; however, as she was without a record deal, the songs were shelved. During the time when she was unsigned, Heap appeared on two UK singles, [...] "Meantime" [...] (a track written by her former Acacia colleagues Guy Sigsworth and Alexander Nilere for the soundtrack to the independent British film, [...] ) and [...] "Blanket" [...] (a 1998 collaboration with Urban Species). In 2000, Heap sang on two tracks of the album You Had It Coming by Jeff Beck.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} 1984 Olympics {{and a few}} select trips to Moscow and Cuba, the {{government}} prevented Comăneci from leaving Romania. A few years earlier, she had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about retiring, and her official retirement ceremony took place in Bucharest in 1984, and was attended by {{the chairman of the}} International Olympic Committee. She later wrote in her memoir:Life took on a new bleakness. I was cut off from making the small amount of extra money that had really made a difference in my family's life. It was also insulting that a normal person in Romania had the chance to travel, whereas I could not [...] when my gymnastics career was over, there was no longer any need to keep me happy. I was to do as I was instructed, just as I'd done my entire life [...] If Bela hadn't defected, I would still have been watched, but his defection brought a spotlight on my life, and it was blinding. I started to feel like a prisoner.|$|E
