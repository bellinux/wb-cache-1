50|$|The {{land on the}} {{property}} is described as being composed of open and <b>broken</b> <b>downs,</b> with river and creek flats, low limestone ridges, inferior flats and rough hills. An assessing commissioner also noted that it is light carrying country, safe if not over-stocked and is excellent country for raising an fattening heavy cattle.|$|R

5|$|The papers can be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> {{by author}} {{as well as}} by topic. At the start of the series, all three authors were contributing; the first twenty papers are <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> as eleven by Hamilton, five by Madison and four by Jay. The rest of the series, however, is {{dominated}} by three long segments by a single writer: No. 21 through No. 36 by Hamilton, No. 37 through 58 by Madison, written while Hamilton was in Albany, and No. 65 through the end by Hamilton, published after Madison had left for Virginia.|$|E
5|$|UPLB's {{endowment}} totaled some ₱4 billion (US$90 million) in 2010, <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> into {{cash reserves}} (₱1.7 billion/US$40 million), investments (₱745 million/US$17 million) and national government subsidy (₱1.19 billion/US$30 million).|$|E
5|$|Abciximab is a {{commonly}} used medication to prevent platelets from clumping together. <b>Broken</b> <b>down</b> into ab-ci-xi-mab, its name shows {{the drug to}} be a chimeric monoclonal antibody used on the cardiovascular system. This {{and the following two}} names would look the same if the new convention were applied.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sit down there,' she said, {{pushing the}} half-throttled preacher with some {{violence}} against a <b>broken</b> chair--'sit <b>down</b> there and gather your wind and your senses, ye black barrow-tram o' the kirk that ye are. Are ye fou or fasting?' ...|$|R
40|$|For a two–dimensional {{model of}} pattern {{formation}} {{the interplay between}} a <b>broken</b> up <b>down</b> symmetry and a weakly broken rotational symmetry is investigated. Both symmetries may be broken, for instance, in chemical reactions with an applied electric field or in thermal convection of planarly aligned nematic liquid crystals. In a system with rotational symmetry and a <b>broken</b> up <b>down</b> symmetry hexagonal patterns are favored in a certain parameter range. With increasing values for the anisotropies, by keeping the up <b>down</b> symmetry <b>broken,</b> hexagons may be deformed to centered rectangular patterns. Hence, breaking both symmetries is an alternative mechanism leading to rectangular patterns. Finally, at larger values of the anisotropies a bifurcation to stripes takes place...|$|R

5|$|Adalimumab {{is a drug}} {{targeting}} TNF alpha. Its name can be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> into ada-lim-u-mab. Therefore, the drug is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune system. If adalimumab had been named after 2009, {{it would have been}} adalumab.|$|E
5|$|Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull {{recognized}} {{a need for}} an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered {{a rite of passage}} to own a <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> vehicle.|$|E
5|$|During its lifetime, {{a nucleus}} may be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> or destroyed, {{either in the}} process of cell {{division}} or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the couple}} has {{successfully}} flipped hundreds of homes, and with each deal they have refined their house-flipping system and <b>broken</b> it <b>down</b> {{into a series of}} repeatable steps. Their system helps to maximize profits, reduce expensive mistakes and get the best overall profits from every deal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, my dear child, why can't {{she let me}} alone?"--this time Sir Claude unmistakeably blushed. Before Maisie, however, {{could answer}} his question, which would indeed have taken her long, he went on in another tone: [...] "Mrs. Beale thinks she has {{probably}} quite <b>broken</b> her <b>down.</b> But she hasn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{my mother}} to be present at the release of my father. So long a {{confinement}} may well have <b>broken</b> him <b>down.</b> Now that I see how obstinately bent our enemies are upon our destruction I will take with me two or three stout fellows from Tours, {{to act as an}} escort." ...|$|R
5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to free {{fatty acids}} and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Reduce {{proteolytic}} susceptibility. The rate {{at which}} proteins are <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> can have a large impact on their activity in cells. Since termini are often accessible to proteases, designing a circularly permuted protein with less-accessible termini can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell.|$|E
5|$|Rozrolimupab is a {{polyclonal}} antibody. <b>Broken</b> <b>down</b> into rozro-lim-u-pab, {{its name}} shows {{the drug to}} be a human polyclonal antibody acting on the immune system. The suffix -pab shows it is a polyclonal antibody.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he heard}} another noise, and snow and rocks and a <b>broken</b> pine rolled <b>down</b> the gully. The {{avalanche}} vanished, the uproar sank, and Deering gasped, [...] "Hold fast!" ...|$|R

He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows {{says that he is}} a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria." ...|$|R

5|$|Shed Light’s initial {{programs}} were <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> {{into a number}} of categories, the most important being communication and navigation systems, sensors, and illumination and target marking equipment. Also detailed were proposed aircraft modifications and tactics.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} adapted from Oliver Goldsmith's novel The Vicar of Wakefield. The complex plot was <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> to a single-reel {{adaptation}} by Edwin Thanhouser and/or Lloyd Lonergan. Edwin Thanhouser's wife Gertrude assisted with the scenarios and editing of the films, {{but it is not}} specifically known if she contributed to this production.|$|E
5|$|Access {{to parts}} of the station is {{difficult}} for people with physical disability. The introduction of lifts in 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station accessible from the concourse, though customers found them unreliable and frequently <b>broken</b> <b>down.</b> Wayfindr technology {{was introduced to the}} station in 2015 to help the visually impaired navigate the station.|$|E
50|$|The Royalists, {{assaulted}} {{at three}} points, were <b>broken</b> and driven <b>down</b> Kirkgate to their defences near the Parish Church. From the church {{they attempted to}} escape across the river, though several were drowned.|$|R
50|$|The new {{categorization}} of this spider {{is part of}} an effort to more carefully catalog American tarantula species. For decades there has been a suspicion that there are more species than identified, but that they are similar enough to be overlooked. The new effort has <b>broken</b> them <b>down</b> according to behavior and observable traits, though there has not been genetic testing done to truly ascertain where the species lines are drawn.|$|R
6000|$|Poor girl! the tax {{upon her}} {{strength}} had been heavier than anyone knew, heavier {{than she could}} bear, and the sorrow of knowing, as {{she had come to}} know, that it was all in vain, and that her utmost efforts had failed to [...] "keep the wolf from the door", had almost <b>broken</b> her <b>down.</b> Little wonder, then, that the sight of sudden and ample relief upset her altogether.|$|R
5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> by an oxidoreductase enzyme, {{it is also}} susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
5|$|At {{the taping}} of the episode, {{the cast and}} crew passed around yearbooks, {{custom-made}} by the production staff, and signed them for each other. The cast gave the producers inscribed Cartier SA watches, while the producers gave the cast Neil Lane jewelry. As the sets were <b>broken</b> <b>down,</b> {{the cast and crew}} each got a chunk of the street outside Central Perk in a glass box as a keepsake.|$|E
6000|$|... 'This: I {{would have}} you find some three or four men who are not fallen into this madness, and with them aid me to loose the Teules, for we cannot save the others. If this may be done, surely we can lower them with ropes from that point where the road is <b>broken</b> away, <b>down</b> to the path beneath, and thus they may escape to their own people.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The content {{consists}} {{of a series of}} domas, [...] "dooms" [...] or judgments, and while providing historical information about Kentish compensation and management of public order, it focuses more on procedure than do the other two Kentish codes. There are eleven distinct groups of provisions according to the text's most recent editor Lisi Oliver, though F. L. Attenborough had previously <b>broken</b> it <b>down</b> into 15. Surprisingly, there are no provisions directly related to the church.|$|R
60|$|They plunged {{deeper into}} the <b>broken</b> belt, clambering <b>down</b> ravines, {{crossing}} frozen lakes and snowy creeks. Indeed, they were thankful when a strip of level surface indicated water, for the toil of getting through the timber was heavy.|$|R
