500|$|After the BBC diary ended, Yousafzai and {{her father}} were {{approached}} by New York Times reporter Adam B. Ellick about filming a documentary. In May, the Pakistani Army moved into the region to regain control during the Second Battle of Swat. Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated. Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives. [...] "I'm really bored <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> books to read", Yousafzai is filmed saying in the documentary.|$|E
500|$|Larter took on {{the title}} role in Marigold (2007), {{alongside}} Salman Khan. The film was released in August 2007 and revolved around an American actress (Larter) who goes to India and gets {{caught up in the}} exotic world of Bollywood. Filming took place in North India and London, commencing in June 2004. In an interview with the BBC, Larter remarked this role was [...] "an opportunity to overcome my fear of singing and dancing <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> professional training [...] I really focused on the character and loved this journey she went on and the experiences she had." [...] She was paid a seven-figure salary for her part in the film.|$|E

My friends thought it necessary to support their defence legally; I will not do so. Not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> confidence in you, {{but it is the}} law that does not concern me. So I do not defend myself. You have to sentence: we are the elements that destroy your sacred institutions. You have to sentence: it is logical, human. I will always pay tribute to your loyalty. But we say to our friends outside: do not ask for pardon, do not ask for amnesty. Socialist civilization should not begin with an act of cowardice. We demand a condemnation, we do not ask for mercy. Martyrs are more useful to the holy cause than any propaganda. Condemn us!” ...|$|E

2500|$|Astaire's {{life has}} never been portrayed on film. [...] He always refused {{permission}} for such portrayals, saying, [...] "However much they offer me—and offers come in all the time—I shall not sell." [...] Astaire's will included a clause requesting that no such portrayal ever take place; he commented, [...] "It is there <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> particular desire to have my life misinterpreted, which it would be." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, Barenboim {{was awarded}} the Wolf Prize at a {{ceremony}} at the Israeli Knesset. Education Minister Livnat held up the nomination until Barenboim apologized for his performance of Wagner in Israel. Barenboim called Livnat's demand [...] "politically motivated", adding [...] "I don't see what I need to apologize about. If I ever hurt a person privately or in public, I am sorry, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> intention of hurting people...", which {{was good enough for}} Livnat. The ceremony was boycotted by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin, {{also a member of the}} Likud party. In his acceptance speech, Barenboim expressed his opinion on the political situation, referring to the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Encyclopædia Iranica {{entry for}} Dhalla – {{written by the}} son of a {{contemporary}} of Dhalla's with whom the Head Priest was at loggerheads for many years – summarizes Dhallas's position as [...] "embroiled in the problem of proselytizing [...] that plagued the community; even though he held liberal views in the matter, he always sided with the orthodox majority." [...] Dhalla himself merely acknowledged that [...] "in replying to questions concerning ceremonies and conventions I do not give my personal opinion as a thinking individual or as a humble scholar or as a reformist, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> authority to do so. I am the Head Priest of a [...] that is 75% conservative and of a performing priest-class that is 99% orthodox. These gentlemen consider the later [...] as authentic law-books on customs and conventions, hence my replies are perforce based mainly in conformity with their teachings." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... {{they are}} not your friends, but they are your enemies in fact, though not in intention, who teach you {{to look to the}} Legislature for the radical removal of the evils that afflict human life. ... It is the {{individual}} mind and conscience, it is the individual character, on which mainly human happiness or misery depends. (Cheers.) The social problems that confront us are many and formidable. Let the Government labour to its utmost, let the Legislature labour days and nights in your service; but, after the very best has been attained and achieved, the question whether the English father is to be the father of a happy family and the centre of a united home is a question which must depend mainly upon himself. (Cheers.) And those who ... promise to the dwellers in towns that every one of them shall have a house and garden in free air, with ample space; those who tell you that there shall be markets for selling at wholesale prices retail quantities—I won't say are impostors, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt they are sincere; but I will say they are quacks (cheers); they are deluded and beguiled by a spurious philanthropy, and when they ought to give you substantial, even if they are humble and modest boons, they are endeavouring, perhaps without their own consciousness, to delude you with fanaticism, and offering to you a fruit which, when you attempt to taste it, will prove to be but ashes in your mouths.

6000|$|... "I did not move. It {{looked up}} at me and wagged its tail. Then it drew back--I suppose <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> words for it. I watched it run {{half-round}} the room and stop and look at me again. Then it slunk out.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} rest of the world I was {{convinced}} that all the colours are contained in the light; <b>no</b> one <b>had</b> ever told me anything different, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never found the least cause to doubt it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> further interest in the subject.|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} lyrics Ghostface wrote while in Africa was [...] "Nutmeg", a song with a rhythmic, off-beat cadence. Regarding the songs form, he stated [...] "Thats a wild song.
