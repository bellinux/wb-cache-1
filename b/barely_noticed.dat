5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{death was}} <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact on the English Puritans. Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E

25|$|The bombings were {{an attempt}} to {{eliminate}} American soldiers {{on their way to}} Somalia {{to take part in the}} international famine relief effort, Operation Restore Hope. Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the US, the attack was <b>barely</b> <b>noticed.</b>|$|E

The instant that happens, a sniper's bullet kills Patsy, again for no apparent reason. A blood-splattered Alfred goes to her parents' apartment, New Yorkers <b>barely</b> <b>noticing</b> his state. He descends into a silent stupor, Patsy's father even having to feed him.|$|R

However, the members <b>barely</b> <b>notice</b> them and continue dancing and singing through the halls, the roof, a bus, and {{leading to a}} space eventually with the zombies themselves. It ends {{as one of the}} zombies hearing his own heartbeat and slowly turning back into a human.|$|R
25|$|In 1938, mutual friends {{introduced}} her to Adolph Green, an aspiring actor. Along with the young Judy Holliday and Leonard Bernstein, Comden and Green formed a troupe called the Revuers, which performed at the Village Vanguard, a club in Greenwich Village. Due to the act's success, the Revuers appeared in the 1944 film Greenwich Village, but their roles were so small they were <b>barely</b> <b>noticed,</b> and they returned to New York.|$|E
25|$|Several other Soviet armies also {{attempted}} to counter-attack in the {{sectors of the}} German Army Group North and Army Group South. This effort was apparently part {{of an attempt to}} implement the Soviet prewar general defense plan. The Soviet attacks managed to slow the Germans but the results were so marginal that the Germans <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> them as a large coordinated defensive effort and the German offensive continued.|$|E
25|$|As {{the events}} of the wars of Yugoslav {{succession}} (1991–95 and 1999) unfolded, Zastava (GB) LTD became a <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> casualty. During Easter 1999, the Zastava factory in Kragujevac was targeted by NATO forces during the Kosovo campaign, and whilst severely damaged, was not put out of action. Supplies of vehicles to the United Kingdom were, however, reduced to a trickle in 1991-92 and with the imposition of United Nations sanctions on Slobodan Milosević’s rump Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), the company folded in 1993. The remaining Yugos on dealer forecourts were sold at drastically reduced prices or written off altogether as economically unviable.|$|E

They say he is in a coma, and he is dying.|$|R
25|$|When McNulty {{finds that}} most dead {{homeless}} men {{are concentrated in}} the Southern District, Freamon puts him in touch with an old patrol partner there who agrees to tip them off when new bodies are found. Freamon also devises a plan to show maturation in their serial killer's pattern and acquires dentures to create bite marks on the victims, thus enhancing the media appeal for the story. While canvassing an area frequented by local homeless, McNulty complains that Landsman <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> {{his work on the}} case, but Freamon reminds him that if their plan works, the case will attract more interest and sloppiness could be their downfall. Upon returning home, McNulty is confronted by Russell over his drinking and philandering.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, a young Jet Li {{arrived at}} the temple to shoot his feature film debut, Shaolin Temple. Though Shi <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> him at the time, the film's 1982 release was a major turning point for the temple, which {{experienced}} {{a significant increase in}} tourism. This in turn resulted in more positive attention to the temple by the Chinese government, which rebuilt the building, and in a change to the monks' daily routine, so that they could accommodate the tourists. Around this time, when Shi was 16, his parents, who held stressful jobs and were heavy smokers, died of lung cancer within six months of each other. Shi would then take care of his younger brother, while his older brothers would take care of the younger siblings, with whom Shi is still in contact today.|$|E
500|$|The rescued party, {{having had}} its last contact with civilization in 1914, {{was unaware of}} the course of the World War. [...] News of Shackleton's safe arrival in the Falklands briefly eclipsed war news in the British {{newspapers}} on 2 June 1916. [...] The expedition returned home in piecemeal fashion, at a critical stage in the war, without the normal honours and civic receptions. When Shackleton himself finally arrived in England on 29 May 1917, after a short American lecture tour, his return was <b>barely</b> <b>noticed.</b>|$|E

I was obliged to be cautious, and to begin by asking about the lodgers first--the men being still visible out in the garden, to excuse the inquiry. The rooms to let in the house had (as I understood her) been taken by a person acting for Geoffrey Delamayn--his trainer, I presume. He had surprised Hester Dethridge by <b>barely</b> <b>noticing</b> the house, and showing the most extraordinary interest in the garden." ...|$|R
50|$|While {{driving home}} that evening {{one of the}} tyres on Pilkington's car gets a {{puncture}} from broken glass lying on the road. It has been put there by {{the owners of the}} Jack-in-the-Box restaurant, who hope their cabaret act will be given a contract with the BBC and have so far failed to gain an audition. Pilkington sits unwittingly through their act, including singers Jack Hylton and Patricia Kirkwood, <b>barely</b> <b>noticing</b> it while he reads the newspaper. When he discovers that they have caused his puncture, he storms off in anger.|$|R
500|$|In 2005, Too Much Too Soon was remastered and reissued by Hip-O Select and Mercury, {{after which}} Christgau wrote in Blender that both it and New York Dolls make up [...] "a priceless proto-punk legacy". He wrote that {{although}} Johansen's best original songs {{are on the}} first record, Too Much Too Soon has consistent hooks, clever lyrics, and exceptional cover songs, including [...] "two R novelties whose theatrical potential was <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> until the Dolls penetrated their holy essence". That same year, rock journalist Toby Creswell named [...] "Babylon" [...] {{as one of the}} greatest songs of all time in his book 1001 Songs. In the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006), Colin Larkin felt the band's issues with alcohol and other drugs affected their performance on the record, which he deemed [...] "a charismatic collection of punk/glam-rock anthems, typically delivered with 'wasted' cool".|$|E
500|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australians that volunteered {{to serve in}} Russia can really only be guessed at, they seem {{unlikely}} to have been political. Maybe, as one historian has suggested, [...] "a few had not seen enough fighting, or perhaps had seen too much." [...] Regardless they confirmed the Australians' reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign. However, as the Australian government had refused flatly to supply forces for the intervention, their involvement was limited. Indeed, Australian involvement in North Russia was a minor episode in its history, and was <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> in Australia at the time. Ultimately {{it made no difference}} to the outcome of the Russian Civil War either, perhaps other than to help confirm the Bolshevik's mistrust of the Western powers. Total Australian casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during the Mesopotamian operations.|$|E
500|$|The seventh series {{attracted}} critical acclaim, {{with some}} reviewers considering {{it to be}} the best series of Spooks. Leigh Holmwood of The Guardian feared that the death of Adam [...] "would have cast a long shadow," [...] but <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> his absence given the pace of the episodes. Holmwood also believed that Lucas' introduction [...] "more than made amends" [...] for replacing Adam, and also felt the return of Ros Myers and her promotion was [...] "a genius move." [...] Mark Wright of The Stage thought that it was [...] "stunning" [...] with the last three episodes in particular [...] "hitting new heights of tension and storytelling for the series," [...] adding it is [...] "as good as, if not the better, than the first couple of seasons." [...] Wright also believed the series performed well with a reduced series length of eight as opposed to the ten episodes from the last few series, which he said allowed for [...] "tighter, more focussed storytelling." [...] He also felt the cast changes [...] "always felt naturally organic," [...] and praised Adam's exit, Lucas' introduction, and the [...] "fantastic, strong female role model" [...] of Hermione Norris' portrayal. Wright ended by saying [...] "Spooks has been my favourite show of the last few months and indeed of 2008." ...|$|E

Del and Albert reassure her that they will help out. Del is still worried about Rodney after he and Cassandra had suffered a miscarriage two weeks previously, and Albert suggests that {{they come up with}} a [...] "counter-worry" [...] to take his mind off it, which leads to Del pretending to be ill, though Rodney <b>barely</b> <b>notices.</b>|$|R

One step more would have brought him to the taffrail, when that step was {{suspended}} by a sound behind him, a sound like a faint groan. He turned, and looked at the sleeper on the deck.

2500|$|Automotive {{trends in}} the early middle 1960s had all the US {{automakers}} looking at making compact sporty cars. The Valiant was a natural choice of basis for Chrysler's efforts in this direction. Ford's Mustang gave this type of vehicle its common [...] "pony car" [...] moniker, but in fact Chrysler beat Ford to market by two weeks with the April 1, 1964 release of the Barracuda fastback. The Barracuda used the Valiant's [...] wheelbase and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent windows, quarter panels and bumpers; all other sheet metal and glass was new. This hybrid design approach significantly reduced the development and tooling cost and time for the new model. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was as similar to the Valiant as the Mustang {{was different from the}} Falcon, and its introduction was, at first, <b>barely</b> <b>noticed</b> by most buyers.|$|E
