40|$|If developed, a {{nondestructive}} method {{would be}} useful for verifying canister contents without requiring the canister to be opened. This paper addresses {{the application of the}} {sup 252 }Cf-source-driven frequency analysis measurements for verification of the fissile material content of sealed spent fuel canisters. The cross-power spectral density (CPSD) between the {sup 252 }Cf source in an ionization chamber and external neutron detectors depends only on the induced fission rate in the fissile system and is independent of inherent sources. Thus the source-to-detector CPSD is ideal for determination of fissile material content of the spent fuel. This paper evaluates the application of this method to a 125 ton spent fuel canister that contained 21 pressurized-water reactor fuel elements. The results demonstrate that the fissile materials content of a sealed spent fuel canister could be obtained using the {sup 252 }Cf frequency analysis method if calibration standards were available.

40|$|This {{calculation}} is {{a revision}} of a previous calculation (Ref. 7. 5) that bears the same title and has the document identifier BBAC 00000 - 01717 - 0210 - 00006 REV 01. The purpose of this revision is to remove TBV (to-be-verified) - 41 10 associated with the output files of the previous version (Ref. 7. 30). The purpose of this and the previous calculation is to generate source terms for a representative boiling water reactor (BWR) spent nuclear fuel (SNF) assembly for the first one million years after the SNF is discharged from the reactors. This calculation includes an examination {{of several ways to}} represent BWR assemblies and operating conditions in SAS 2 H in order to quantify the effects these representations may have on source terms. These source terms provide information characterizing the neutron and gamma spectra in particles per second, the decay heat in watts, and radionuclide inventories in curies. Source terms are generated for a range of <b>burnups</b> and enrichments (see Table 2) that are representative of the waste stream and stainless steel (SS) clad assemblies. During this revision, it was determined that the <b>burnups</b> used for the computer runs of the previous revision were actually about 1. 7 % less than the stated, or nominal, <b>burnups.</b> See Section 6. 6 for a discussion of how to account for this effect before using any source terms from this calculation. The source term due to the activation of corrosion products deposited on the surfaces of the assembly from the coolant is also calculated. The results of this calculation support many areas of the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR), which include thermal evaluation, radiation dose determination, radiological safety analyses, surface and subsurface facility designs, and total system performance assessment. This includes MGR items classified as Quality Level 1, for example, the Uncanistered Spent Nuclear Fuel Disposal Container (Ref. 7. 27, page 7). Therefore, this calculation is subject to the requirements of the Quality Assurance Requirements and Description (Ref. 7. 28).
