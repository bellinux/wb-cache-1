25|$|Clusters of consonants are {{represented}} by different and sometimes quite irregular characters; thus, learning to read the script {{is complicated by the}} sheer size of the full set of characters and character combinations, numbering about 500.

It is still not quite uniform as yet, as many people continue to use various archaic forms of letters, resulting in concurrent forms for the same sounds. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Bengali and Assamese variations exist today in the formalized system.|$|E
