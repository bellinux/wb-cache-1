500|$|When Lichtenstein {{made his}} {{transition}} to comic-based work, {{he began to}} mimic the style while adapting the subject matter. He applied simplified color schemes and commercial printing-like techniques.

[...] The borrowed technique was [...] "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of <b>Ben</b> <b>Day</b> dots used in newspaper printing". PBS asserts {{that this is an}} adaptation of the ligne claire style associated with Herg√©.

500|$|Lichtenstein's {{borrowings}} from comics mimicked {{their style}} while adapting their subject matter. He explained that [...] "Signs and comic strips are interesting as subject matter.

Lichtenstein was attracted to using a cool, formal style to depict emotive subjects, leaving the viewer to interpret the artist's intention. He adopted a simplified color scheme and commercial printing-like techniques. The borrowed technique was [...] "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of <b>Ben</b> <b>Day</b> dots used in newspaper printing, and surrounding these with black outlines similar to those used to conceal imperfections in cheap newsprint."
