25|$|Between September and October 2013, Cleese {{embarked}} {{on his first}} ever cross-Canada comedy tour. Entitled 'John Cleese: Last Time to See Me <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>Die</b> tour', he visited Halifax, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary, Victoria and finished in Vancouver, performing to mostly sold-out venues. Cleese returned to the stage in Dubai in November 2013, where he performed to a sold-out theater.|$|E
500|$|Between {{seasons of}} Richard, in 1934 Gielgud {{returned}} to Hamlet in London and on tour, directing {{and playing the}} title role. The production was a box-office success, and the critics were lavish in their praise. In The New York Times, Charles Morgan wrote, [...] "I have never before heard the rhythm and verse and the naturalness of speech so gently combined.... If I see a better performance of this play than this <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die,</b> {{it will be a}} miracle." [...] Morley writes that junior members of the cast such as Alec Guinness and Frith Banbury would gather in the wings every night [...] "to watch what they seemed intuitively already to know was to be the Hamlet of their time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The only {{exception}} {{was by the}} Dominican Republic, which pledged to accept 100,000 refugees on generous terms. Meir was disappointed at the outcome and she remarked to the press, [...] "There is only one thing I hope to see <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> {{and that is that}} my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{observed}} {{that it was}} a useful thing to know that, and I made up my mind to smoke as much tobacco as ever <b>I</b> could <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "I dreamed only {{of seeing}} Prague again <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died.</b> Isolated in Austria by an Iron Curtain ... I {{nonetheless}} had a premonition that somehow <b>I</b> would <b>die</b> here. It never {{dawned on me}} until soon after 1989's Velvet Revolution that first I could live here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{when one}} gets old {{one has a}} longing for home. For years I've been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of England. At last I {{determined}} to see them <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died.</b> <b>I</b> saved enough to bring me across, and then I came here where the soldiers are, for I know their ways and how to amuse them and so earn enough to keep me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Songs {{and poems}} {{have been written}} about Ani and its past glory. [...] "Tesnem Anin u nor mernem" [...] (Տեսնեմ Անին ու նոր մեռնեմ, Let me see Ani <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die)</b> is a famous poem by Hovhannes Shiraz. It was turned into a song by Turkish-Armenian {{composer}} [...] Ara Gevorgyan's 1999 album of folk instrumental songs is titled Ani.|$|E
2500|$|Through the years, {{the lyrics}} became more personal. [...] "Dead Boy's Poem" [...] from Wishmaster {{is a very}} {{emotional}} piece, which Holopainen calls his [...] "legacy and [...] testament for the whole world. [...] I {{wanted to do this}} song <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die,</b> because I wanted to tell the whole world what I think and feel. It expresses a lot of myself." [...] The personal development became even more obvious on the Wishmaster-successor Century Child. Turunen thinks that the lyrics do not anymore deal [...] "with the dreamland we were used to, but with the brutal reality of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In her {{autobiography}} My Life (1975), Golda Meir {{described her}} outrage being in [...] "the ludicrous {{capacity of the}} [...] observer from Palestine, not even seated with the delegates, although the refugees under discussion were my own people...." [...] After the conference Meir told the press: [...] "There is only one thing I hope to see <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> {{and that is that}} my people should not need expressions of sympathy anymore." [...] Chaim Weizmann was quoted in The Manchester Guardian as saying: [...] "The world seemed to be divided into two parts – those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter." ...|$|E
6000|$|A public-house, thought Morgan--me in a public-house!--the old fool!--Dammy, if I was {{ten years}} younger I'd set in Parlyment <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> that <b>I</b> would.--"No, thank you kindly, sir. I don't think of the public line, sir. And I've got my little savings pretty well put out, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fifteen, {{my young}} cockerel? you look liker twenty," [...] said Oxenham, with an admiring {{glance at the}} lad's broad limbs, keen blue eyes, curling golden locks, and round honest face. [...] "Fifteen? If I had half-a-dozen such lads as you, I would make knights of them <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died.</b> Eh, Yeo?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Manic Street Preachers song, [...] "Of Walking Abortion", {{from the}} album The Holy Bible, {{begins with a}} quote from Selby: [...] "I knew that someday <b>I</b> was gonna <b>die.</b> And <b>I</b> knew that <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> two things would happen to me, that number one: I would regret my entire life; and number two: I would want {{to live my life}} over again." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Having labored now twenty years, {{the best}} ones of my life, in {{dispensing}} at retail, as the saying goes, at the demand of everyone, that little talent in my profession that God and my own efforts have given me, my desires would truly be to obtain enough leisure and quiet as would enable me <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> to complete three great works that I have in hand {{in order to be}} able to publish them, perhaps with some praise for me and for whoever has helped me in the business. ... It is not possible to receive a salary from a Republic, however splendid and generous, without serving the public, because to get something from the public one must satisfy it and not just one particular person; and while I remain able to teach and to serve, no one can exempt me from the burden while leaving me the income; and in sum I cannot hope for such a benefit from anyone but an absolute prince." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1990s, Ice Cube {{converted}} to Islam, and was associated {{at that time}} with the Nation of Islam, although he denies ever {{being a part of}} it. He does not regularly attend services at a mosque, and calls himself a [...] "... natural Muslim, 'cause it's just me and God. You know, going to the mosque, the ritual and the tradition, it's just not in me to do. So I don't do it." [...] When asked in a 2017 interview if he was a practicing Muslim, Ice Cube replied, [...] "Yeah. But, you know, I’m gonna live a long life, and I might change religions three or four times <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die.</b> I’m on the Islam tip—but I’m on the Christian tip, too. I’m on the Buddhist tip as well. Everyone has something to offer to the world, and to be honest, we’re not fighting over religions, man. We’re fighting over resources. That’s just a smokescreen. And it’s not just oil, too—it’s water, it’s land, it’s everything. It’s greed." ...|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>Die.</b> This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Under your lordship's favour," [...] he continued, [...] "I was 'prentice, my lord, to old Mungo Moniplies, the flesher at the wanton West-Port of Edinburgh, which I wish <b>I</b> saw again <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died.</b> And, your honour's noble father {{having taken}} Richie Moniplies {{into his house}} to wait on your lordship, there {{was a sort of}} connexion, your lordship sees." ...|$|R
60|$|However, when I {{found that}} I {{was going to}} Australia it revived. And naturally: for if the people should say that I was a dull, poor thing {{compared}} to what <b>I</b> was <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> {{it would have a}} bad effect on business. Well, to my surprise the Sydney journalists had never heard of that impostor! I pressed them, but they were firm--they had never heard of him, and didn't believe in him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here.--I am {{wasting my}} time and brains on ribaldry, but I am worth nothing better--at least, I think so at times; but you, who can do {{anything}} you put your hand to, what business have you, in the devil's name, to be throwing yourself away on gimcracks and fox- hunting foolery? Heavens! If I had your talents, I'd be--I'd make a name for myself <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>died</b> to make it.' The colonel griped his hand hard, rose, and looked out of the window for a few minutes. There was a dead, brooding silence, till he turned to Lancelot,-- ...|$|R

60|$|Rod. Is Manuel there? Hold up my arm, that I {{may make}} one thrust At him, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{could not}} part from {{you to go}} to any home on earth,' replied Smike, {{pressing}} his hand; 'except one, except one. I shall never be an old man; and if your hand placed me in the grave, and <b>I</b> could think, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> that you would come and look upon it sometimes with one of your kind smiles, and in the summer weather, when everything was alive--not dead like me--I could go to that home almost without a tear.' ...|$|R
60|$|What {{was said}} did not please the priest, for {{suddenly}} he howled aloud {{and made a}} dash towards me to kill me, but again his arm was caught before the knife fell. Then he withdrew into {{the temple of the}} god Quetzal, and for a long while I lay upon the stone suffering the agonies of a hundred deaths, for I believed that it was determined to torture me <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> and that my slaughter had been stayed for this purpose.|$|R
60|$|As I {{sat quietly}} upon {{the floor of}} my prison, waiting for the end, my fingers by {{accident}} {{came in contact with}} the bit of paper in which the things had been wrapped; and as I idly played with it, my mind roaming far back into the past, that I might live again for a few brief moments <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died</b> some of the many happy moments of a long and happy life, I became aware of strange protuberances upon the smooth surface of the parchment-like substance in my hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad--glad," [...] {{continued}} Ujarak, [...] "that {{you have}} come <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die.</b> I thank God for sending you. I have prayed for this." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The swine {{think it}} is a great joke," [...] growled Obergatz, [...] "that the {{afternoon}} <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die</b> I go out and hunt meat for them." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently I saw the ten battleships {{that had}} been ordered to hold the shaft of Omean. They were {{returning}} at full speed, firing their stern batteries almost continuously. There could be but one explanation. They were being pursued by another hostile fleet. Well, the situation could be no worse. The expedition already was doomed. No man that had embarked upon it would return across that dreary ice cap. How I wished that I might face Zat Arrras with my longsword for just an instant <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died!</b> It was he who had caused our failure.|$|R
6000|$|Out of {{the rolling}} ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me, [...] Whispering <b>I</b> love you, <b>before</b> long <b>I</b> <b>die,</b> [...] <b>I</b> have travel'd a long way merely to look on you to touch you, [...] For <b>I</b> could not <b>die</b> till <b>I</b> once look'd on you, [...] For I fear'd I might {{afterward}} lose you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Once <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> {{it was all}} I wanted. Just to {{have heard}} her speak, to have seen my little girl grown into a woman, and the sea was always there, and Oom Sam would always come with that cursed rum. Then one day came Trent and talked of money and spoke of England, and when he went away it rang for ever in my ears, and at night I heard her calling for me across the sea. So I stole out, and the great steamer was lying there with red fires at her funnel, and I was mad. She was crying for me across the sea, so I took the money!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Gawd bless this world! Whatever she 'ath done-- [...] Excep' when awful long--I've {{found it}} good. [...] So write, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>die,</b> [...] "'E liked it all!" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{told him}} if those were all his {{objections}} I would soon remove them, and {{convince him that}} there was not the least room for any difficulty; for that, first, as for suspecting him, if ever I should do it, {{now is the time to}} suspect him, and not put the trust into his hands, and whenever I did suspect him, he could but throw it up then and refuse to go any further. Then, as to executors, I assured him I had no heirs, nor any relations in England, and I should alter my condition <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> and then his trust and trouble should cease together, which, however, I had no prospect of yet; but I told him if <b>I</b> <b>died</b> as <b>I</b> was, it should be all his own, and he would deserve it by being so faithful to me as I was satisfied he would be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Adam softly, [...] "I {{often think}} about it too; the old house among the ash trees, and the Herdwicks feeding on the long slope behind. The red heath on the fell-top and the beck {{bubbling}} in the ghyll. Everything's clean and cool in the quiet dale, and the folk are calm and Slow." [...] He paused and resumed with a curious smile: [...] "Once I reckoned I'd go back when I got rich and make things hum, but when I had the money I saw that plan wouldn't work. Those quiet folk would have beaten me with their unchanging ways, and Ashness is too good to spoil. For all that, I allowed I'd see it again <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died,</b> but now <b>I</b> don't know." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{hours were}} long, {{the work was}} arduous, {{despite the fact that}} we became past masters in the art of {{eliminating}} waste motion. And I was receiving thirty dollars a month and board--a slight increase over my coal-shovelling and cannery days, at least to the extent of board, which cost my employer little (we ate in the kitchen), but which was to me the equivalent of twenty dollars a month. My robuster strength of added years, my increased skill, and all I had learned from the books, were responsible for this increase of twenty dollars. Judging by my rate of development, <b>I</b> might hope <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>died</b> to be a night watchman for sixty dollars a month, or a policeman actually receiving a hundred dollars with pickings.|$|R
