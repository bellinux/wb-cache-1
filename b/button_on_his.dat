25|$|When Beria finally {{realized}} {{what was happening and}} plaintively appealed to Malenkov to speak for him, his old friend and crony silently hung his head and refused to meet his gaze. Malenkov pressed a <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> desk as the pre-arranged signal to Marshal Georgy Zhukov and a group of armed officers in a nearby room who burst in and arrested Beria.|$|E
500|$|Some players used [...] "standbying" [...] to cheat, {{in which}} the player hosting the game {{intentionally}} presses the standby <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her modem; this results in all players except the cheaters freezing in place. This way, the cheater would be given time to accomplish an objective in the game. [...] "Dummying" [...] involves using an Elite character and a vehicle, exploiting a glitch which would cause a doppelganger of the player to appear. Cheating also includes softmodding, in which a player uses devices such as Action Replay and computer programs to gain unfair advantages, and bridging, which uses computer programs to give a player [...] "host" [...] status, and therefore the ability to disconnect other players from the game session. A game exploitation called [...] "superbouncing" [...] or [...] "superjumping" [...] is labeled cheating {{by many in the}} Xbox Live community, and Bungie employees have described it as cheating when used in matchmaking. Another exploit called [...] "BXR" [...] allowed players to melee, cancel the animation, and quickly attack for an instant kill; this exploit and many others were removed from the game's sequel.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the Soviet Army began {{development}} of the Shtora-1 electro-optical jammer. [...] It was first mounted on a T-80U in 1989, and later showcased on a T-72B (renamed T-72BM and later T-90). [...] Shtora-1 is designed to jam incoming anti-tank missiles using a one-kilowatt infrared radiator. [...] In 1995, it was fitted on a Ukrainian T-84. [...] The Shtora-1 system consists of an infra-red radiator interface station, composed of the jammer, modulator and control panel, a number of forward-firing grenade discharges capable of producing a smoke screen, a laser-warning system and a general control panel. [...] Shtora offers 360 degree all-around protection, between the elevations of −5 and 25 degrees. [...] The system is activated when the laser warning system alerts the tank commander, who responds by pressing a <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> control panel which automatically orients the turret towards the threat. [...] This triggers the grenade launch, creating a smoke screen to reduce {{the ability of the}} missile to lock-on the vehicle. [...] The jammers are designed to jam the infra-red seekers on the inbound missiles. [...] According to the manufacturers, Shtora decreases the chances of a tank being hit by an anti-tank missile, such as the Dragon, by a factor of 4–5:1.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, the night of September 4, North Korean troops established a bridgehead across the Naktong River and were using it to advance across the river and attack Taegu, where the UN's Eighth United States Army was headquartered in defense of the perimeter. On September 5, a T-6 Mosquito forward air controller spotted a North Korea column advancing through the village of Hamchang. Sebille was ordered to lead a flight of three F-51's on an airstrike against the North Korean troops advancing there. Sebille flew a P-51 (tail number 44-74394) loaded with two [...] bombs, six rockets, and six M2 Browning [...]50 caliber machine guns. He and his wingmen, Captain Martin Johnson and Lieutenant Charles Morehouse, approached the village at an altitude of [...] and spotted a North Korean armored column crossing the river in a shallow area. Sebille positioned himself for a medium-angle dive bomb run, planning to drop both of his bombs on his first attack. Diving, he held steady until about [...] When he spotted a target column of trucks, artillery guns and armored cars, led by a North Korean Armored Personnel Carrier, he hit the bomb release <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> control stick, and then made a sharp pull-up to the left to stay away from his bomb blast. However, only one of his bombs had released, and the [...] of unbalanced weight under his left wing may have contributed to his near miss on the first run.|$|E

2500|$|Button has {{at least}} three tattoos: a black coat <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> right forearm; a large tribal design {{encompassing}} his left shoulder and upper chest; and Japanese kanji-characters on his ankle which says this was done before he won the world title, and {{is the name of}} Button's triathlon team. Since mid-2010, the same legend has appeared on Button's race helmet. Button is also a brand ambassador for Head & Shoulders, and has appeared in advertising campaigns for the company.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ford {{said this}} {{with such an}} air of {{conviction}} and such a sober face that the Captain smiled. And {{at the same time}} he glanced down nervously at the new line of <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chest.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, I went {{to buy the}} Oclawaha tickets, while Rectus staid home to pack up our handbags, and, I believe, to sew some <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> clothes.

60|$|Mr. Lincoln {{glanced at}} Stephen, {{and then again}} at the Judge's letter. He took up his silk hat and thrust that, too, into the worn lining, which was already filled with papers. He clapped the hat <b>on</b> <b>his</b> head, and <b>buttoned</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> collar.|$|R
2500|$|Button and Vettel took {{fifth and}} sixth. Button {{was able to}} secure the {{position}} on his first timed lap but did not improve on the following attempt. It allowed Vettel to challenge him but was 0.080 seconds slower than <b>Button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> second timed lap. Magnussen did not feel the soft compound tyres were working in his favour {{and was unable to}} improve on his fastest time, restricting him to seventh. The two Ferrari cars were eighth and tenth (with Alonso ahead of Räikkönen); they were separated by Ricciardo, who made small fine-tuning adjustments to his car before qualifying and believed it affected his Red Bull's balance. Gutiérrez, considered as [...] "one of the standout performers" [...] of qualifying, was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap of one minute and 11.591 seconds was nearly 1.3 seconds slower than Rosberg's pace in the second session. Nico Hülkenberg had difficulty finding a rhythm and took 12th. He was ahead of Adrian Sutil in the slower of the two Sauber cars. Kvyat qualified in 14th after electing not to record a lap time {{in the second part of}} qualifying and was demoted ten places on the starting grid after carrying over an engine penalty from the previous race of the season. As a result, Romain Grosjean inherited the position, after his team made overnight adjustments to his car. Vergne had difficulty driving his car and had an incorrect set-up which caused him to qualify 15th. Pérez originally took 16th but a seven-place grid penalty was applied after causing an avoidable accident with Sutil in the previous race and Maldonado inherited the place.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Anders {{had begun to}} wear message <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{cardigan}}, {{all of which were}} given to him by fans.

60|$|First {{walked a}} {{gingerbread}} man, neatly formed and baked to a lovely brown tint. He wore a silk hat {{and carried a}} candy cane prettily striped with red and yellow. His shirt-front and cuffs were white frosting, and the <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coat were licorice drops.|$|R
60|$|We {{went to see}} John Knox's house, and {{although}} Mr. Knox was pretty hard on vanities and frivolities, he didn't mind having a good house over his head, with woodwork {{on the walls and}} ceilings that wasn't any more necessary than the back <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coat.|$|R

60|$|AFTER losing them, he ran on {{four legs}} and went faster, so that I {{think he might}} have got away {{altogether}} {{if he had not}} unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.|$|R
60|$|Cliffe, in the meanwhile, {{had come}} out in search of her and, seeing how she was engaged, had strolled into the hotel bar.

6000|$|A September afternoon. The sixteen-year-old Carl was tipped {{back in a}} {{chair at}} Eddie Klemm's, one foot on a rung, while he {{discussed}} village scandals and told outrageous stories with Eddie Klemm, a brisk money-maker and vulgarian aged twenty-three, who wore a [...] "fancy vest" [...] and celluloid <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> lapels. Ben Rusk hesitatingly poked his head through the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose the}} mails are all upset, {{on account of}} the war," [...] put in Cal Vincent, who sat nearby, sewing a <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shirt. [...] "If you'll remember, Nagasaki was in a big state of {{excitement}} while we were there last." ...|$|E
60|$|She stood {{gazing at}} him, {{but she was}} as one of whom he took no account.

6000|$|... 'We {{found him}} {{lying on the}} road when we came from Daddy Mycroft's,' {{said one of the}} new-comers, who were the same men who had led away my horse. 'He must have passed just after you left, and the rope caught him under the chin and threw him a dozen paces. We saw the revenue <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coat, so we brought him down. Body o' me, but he kicked and plunged for all that he was three-quarters stunned.' ...|$|E
50|$|Binion styled {{himself a}} cowboy {{throughout}} his life. He almost never wore a necktie, and used gold coins as <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> cowboy shirts. Despite being technically barred from owning guns, he carried {{at least one}} pistol all his life, and kept a sawed-off shotgun close by. His office was a booth in the downstairs restaurant, and he knew many of his customers by name.|$|R
60|$|He tore {{open his}} collar and opened vest and shirt. He plunged into his {{interior}} {{and for an}} instant it seemed he was plucking forth his liver. Then as he struggled with <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder they perceived this flattened horror was in fact a terribly dirty flannel chest-protector. In an other moment Bert, in a state of irregular decolletage, was standing over the table displaying a sheaf of papers.|$|R

6000|$|Slade was a matchless {{marksman}} with a navy revolver.

[...] Which he did. The bystanders all admired it. And they all attended the funeral, too.|$|E
60|$|And yet {{all this}} was quite a secret. Mr Nadgett kept it to himself, and kept it close. Jonas had no more idea that Mr Nadgett's {{eyes were fixed on}} him, than he had that he was living under the daily {{inspection}} and report of a whole order of Jesuits. Indeed Mr Nadgett's eyes were seldom fixed on any other objects than the ground, the clock, or the fire; but every <b>button</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coat might have been an eye, he saw so much.|$|E
5000|$|During a war scene, {{the show}} {{featured}} a lengthy [...] "Button Song," [...] in which General Lasky, {{head of the}} Polish Infantry, insisted that his troops sing a military cadence involving an increasingly large number of <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> jacket. During the American Repertory Theater production run, audience members routinely threw programs, bottles of water, food, and other items at the actors during this scene (angering Lasky and leading him to restart at one button).|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I'm {{behind the}} time, you understand,' he {{observed}} in apology, passing his hand nervously {{down the whole}} row of bright <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> coat, and then up again, {{as if they were}} beads and he were telling them twice over: 'and I would rather have my dear boy here. It's an old-fashioned notion, I daresay. He was always fond of the sea He's'--and he looked wistfully at Walter--'he's glad to go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{and there}} are his buttons," [...] said Mary, much amused and delighted with these relics of her beloved Harry. [...] "Don't you {{remember}} one day last holidays, papa desired Harry to write and ask Mr. Ernescliffe what clothes {{he ought to have}} for the naval school, and all the time he was writing the letter, he was drawing sailors' <b>buttons</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> blotting-paper. I wonder how ever it got into Mr. Harrison's book!" ...|$|R
