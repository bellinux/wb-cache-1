50|$|The British term {{people mover}} {{is also used}} in Australian English to {{describe}} a passenger van. The American usage of van to mean a cargo <b>box</b> <b>trailer</b> or semi-trailer is used rarely, if ever, in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Refrigerator <b>trailers</b> are <b>box</b> <b>trailers</b> with a heating/cooling unit (reefer) attached, {{used for}} hauling produce, frozen foods, meat, flowers, etc.|$|R
50|$|Mascus is an {{electronic}} marketplace for used machinery and related spares and accessories around the world. Product ranges include tractors for sale, trailers for sale, used trucks for sale, diggers, <b>box</b> <b>trailers,</b> mini diggers and excavators, etc. The company {{was founded in}} 2000 and is owned by Mascus International BV Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{are often}} {{specialized}} to deliver {{different types of}} goods. On land, semi-trailers are outfitted with various <b>trailers</b> such as <b>box</b> <b>trailers,</b> flatbeds, car carriers, tanks and other specialized trailers, while railroad trains include similarly specialized cars. Armored cars, dump trucks and concrete mixers are examples of vehicles specialized for delivery of specific types of goods. On the sea, merchant ships come in various forms, such as cargo ships, oil tankers and fishing boats. Freight aircraft are used to deliver cargo.|$|R
50|$|Curtain siders {{are similar}} to box {{trailers}} except the sides are movable curtains made of reinforced fabric coated with a waterproof coating. The purpose of a curtain sider is to combine the security and weather resistance of a <b>box</b> <b>trailer</b> with the ease of loading of a flatbed.|$|E
50|$|The {{tractor-trailer}} combination distributes a load {{across multiple}} axles while being more maneuverable than an equivalently sized rigid truck. The most common trailer attachment {{system is a}} fifth wheel coupling, allowing rapid shift between trailers performing different functions, such as a bulk tipper and <b>box</b> <b>trailer.</b> Trailers containing differing cargos can be rapidly swapped between tractors, eliminating downtime while a trailer is unloaded or loaded.|$|E
50|$|By 2010, {{many new}} liveries had been {{produced}} to the specifications of many new clients. Examples are Allied Van Lines, Price Chopper, Kelly Tires, Sorrento, RPS, Ashland Oil, and Clover Farms Milk. Whereas one generic <b>box</b> <b>trailer</b> type {{was available in}} the 1970s, at least 16 different trailer and truck types are now manufactured by Winross, including package haulers, beverage haulers, dairy, oil, cryogenic, and propane tankers, a flatbed trailer, moving van trailer, drop pup, double pup, and triple pups, {{and a couple of}} straight frame non-articulated trucks. Occasionally, special models have been made, like the special late 1950s Sunoco trailer, or the Charles' Chips delivery van.|$|E
40|$|New {{concepts}} and components for green cane harvesting were evaluated in field trials. A sticker chain assembly and tined detrashing rotors were fitted to a modified tractor. Cane was topped and base-cut and, while being conveyed to the bin by the sticker chain, the trash {{was removed from}} the canes by the rotors. The clean canes were deposited into a collecting bin which stored about 200 kg cane. The bundles were then deposited on the ground ready to be loaded with a grab loader onto <b>box</b> <b>trailers...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{livestock}} is transported to market in small <b>box</b> <b>trailers.</b> The welfare of animals transported {{in this way is}} now assuming greater importance with the onset of tougher EU legislation. This paper presents the first study into the ventilation of small livestock trailers using experimental and computational methods. Wind tunnel studies, using a 1 / 7 th scale model, highlight the important influence of the towing vehicle and trailer design on the airflow within the trailer. Detailed CFD analysis agrees well with the wind tunnel data and offers the ability {{to assess the impact of}} design changes...|$|R
50|$|Double deckers or deckers {{have either}} a fixed, hinged, or {{moveable}} second floor {{to enable them}} to carry more palletised goods. In general, a double decker can carry 40 pallets, as opposed to 26 for a standard trailer. Double deck trailers are generally a step-frame construction with the majority being either box or curtain siders, with <b>box</b> <b>trailers</b> having either a fixed or movable (floating) deck, and curtain sides having either a fixed or hinged second deck; this hinged second deck generally swings into a position {{down the length of the}} trailer, and can be divided into two or three sections to allow greater load flexibility.|$|R
50|$|Like other semi-trailers, most {{commercial}} car carrier trailers {{attach to the}} tractor using a fifth wheel coupling. Trailers can either be enclosed, possessing walls like a conventional <b>box</b> <b>trailer,</b> which affords the shipped vehicles more protection {{at the cost of}} lower capacity; or open, as in the commonly seen skeletal tube steel design, which exposes the vehicles to the elements but allows for greater carrying capacity. An American {{commercial car}} carrier typically fits between 5 and 9 cars, depending on the car size and trailer model (capacity is limited by an 80,000 lb weight cap that a road vehicle is subject to under U.S. law.). Significantly higher-capacity vehicles have been observed around the world, such as a side-by-side loading Chinese model.|$|E
50|$|A new {{cab unit}} was {{introduced}} in September 1965. The Ford H Cab and Detachable Trailer (1137) was an American truck produced by Corgi {{to appeal to the}} lucrative US market and featured a forward tilting cab revealing a highly detailed engine, realistic moveable door mirrors and die-cast metal air horns and side ladders. The large <b>box</b> <b>trailer</b> featured sliding side doors, opening rear doors and was finished in the blue and silver 'Express Services' livery. The leap in quality of this model proved that the Major range had entered a new era, and it continued to sell well until 1972. The new Ford cab was used again in April 1966 with {{a new version of the}} Carrimore Car Transporter (1138) which had been re-designed to carry up to six Corgi cars, and which also featured in Gift Set 41 along with six cars; Ford Cortina Estate (440), Rover 2000 (252), Hillman Imp (251), Mini Cooper De-Luxe (249), Austin Seven (225) and Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1966 (321). This gift set was initially only available by mail order but was finally issued in time for Christmas in December 1967.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, {{the site}} housed a {{research}} group that used radar to scan approaching thunder storms {{as far away}} as western New York State, as part of an inquiry into the causes of lightning. Findings by this group were instrumental {{in the development of the}} US weather radar program. The installation consisted of a steel tower supporting a second-hand military radar set, several Quonset huts and <b>box</b> <b>trailers,</b> surrounded by a chain-link fence. Group members were on call to monitor the radar whenever severe storms could be observed. Data were also collected from a network of amateur co-operative observers who corresponded by mail. This era coincided with the end of the long career of the famous Director of the Observatory, Dr. Charles Brooks, said to be one of the few who accurately forecast the path of the destructive Hurricane of September, 1938.|$|R
50|$|<b>Box</b> or van <b>trailers</b> are {{the most}} common type. Standard lengths in North America are 28 ft, 32 ft, 34 ft, 36 ft, 40 ft, 45 ft, 48 ft, 53 ft and 57 ft.|$|R
50|$|Dark Model is an {{electronic}} music project founded by music producer Tatsuya Oe, {{based in the}} United States and Japan. The project focuses on orchestral-electronic and storytelling-themed instrumental music. The project has released two full albums so far, and its music has been licensed and featured in many media projects, from <b>box</b> office film <b>trailers</b> to advertising campaigns.|$|R
50|$|Since 2003, {{nearly all}} of Astro's {{satellite}} television channels feature break bumpers that are placed before and after breaks. These bumpers consist of the logo of the aforementioned channels, {{as well as a}} slide promoting the current programme being broadcast and the next programme scheduled to air. Bumpers based on the subscription information sequence seen at the end of Astro <b>Box</b> Office promotional <b>trailers</b> from 2003 to 2006, appear in-between commercials and immediately before the program break ends, but not {{at the beginning of the}} block of replaced commercials.|$|R
5000|$|During the July 2006 Electronic Arts press conference, Valve {{revealed}} that Team Fortress 2 would ship as the multiplayer component of The Orange <b>Box.</b> A conference <b>trailer</b> showcasing all {{nine of the}} classes demonstrated {{for the first time}} the game's whimsical new visual style. Managing director of Valve Gabe Newell said that the company's goal was to create [...] "the best looking and best-playing class-based multiplayer game". A beta release of the entire game was made on Steam on September 17, 2007 for customers who had pre-purchased The Orange Box, who had activated their Black Box coupon, which was included with the ATI HD 2900XT Graphics cards, and for members of Valve's Cyber Caf√© Program. The beta continued until the game's final release.|$|R
5000|$|On September 12, 2007, Essex Terminal Railway had {{its second}} {{accident}} when a transport truck tried to race a slow moving ETR train across the Weaver Road at-grade crossing. ADM and Morterm Terminal are accessed by Weaver Rd. The SW-1200 locomotive clipped {{the rear of}} the trailer, tipping the transport truck onto its right side (the truck was heading west at the time and the locomotive was headed northbound) and ripped the axles off the <b>trailer's</b> <b>box</b> and frame. Aside from damage to the transport truck, the locomotive also sustained some damage to one of its couplers, which had impacted the trailer. The driver (who was from Ohio) was uninjured and cooperated with Essex Terminal Railway officials and Windsor Police. Essex Terminal Railway later said in The Windsor Star that, [...] "This is a reason why people should never try to beat a train." ...|$|R
2500|$|Still, {{the film}} {{did not perform}} as well at the <b>box</b> office. The <b>trailer</b> {{introduced}} the film to audiences by displaying a surface of water intercut with scenes from the original. A narrator goes over the rules regarding how to safely handle mogwai. After the narrator says, [...] "You didn't listen ," [...] scenes from the sequel are shown, revealing the gremlins morphing into strange new creatures and then ending with the Brain Gremlin speaking. Gremlins 2 was released into US theatres on June 15, 1990, {{the same day as}} Dick Tracy. In its first weekend it made $9,702,804, and it ultimately made $41,482,207. It was thus only the thirty-first highest-grossing film of the year, behind a few other films in the comedy, horror or fantasy genre, such as Back to the Future Part III ($87,727,583), Edward Scissorhands ($56,362,352), and Arachnophobia ($53,208,180). It did, however, outperform Predator 2 ($30,669,413), Child's Play 2 ($28,501,605) and The Exorcist III ($26,098,824).|$|R
40|$|Large-eddy {{simulation}} (LES) is used {{to study}} the flow around a simplified tractor-trailer model. The model consists of two boxes placed in tandem. The front box represents the cab of a tractor-trailer road vehicle and the rear <b>box</b> represents the <b>trailer.</b> The LES was made at the Reynolds number of 0. 51 √ó 106 based on {{the height of the}} rear box and the inlet air velocity. Two variants of the model were studied, one where the leading edges on the front box are sharp and one where the edges are rounded. One small and one large gap width between the two boxes were studied for both variants. Two computational grids were used in the LES simulations and a comparison was made with available experimental force measurements. The results of the LES simulations were used to analyze the flow field around the cab and in the gap between the two boxes of the tractor-trailer model. Large vortical structures around the front box and in the gap were identified. The flow field analysis showed how these large vortical structures are responsible for the difference in the drag force for the model that arises when the leading edges on the front box are rounded and the gap width is varied...|$|R
