These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: waviness and roughness of disc surface, misalignment of axis (runout), elastic deflection, wear and friction material transfers.Either type could potentially fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface {{on either side of the}} brake disc between the wheel hub and brake disc hub before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage.

40|$|The wide-spread {{application}} of fluidisation technologies {{is due to}} their well-known advantages, however, certain material characteristics such as large particle sizes, tendency to adhere, etc. inhibit {{the formation of the}} fluidised state, or because of anomalousness of such features (formation of bubbles, channelling, nodulizing, etc.) occurs in the bulk and they damage the regularity of the processes taking place in the operation. The fluidisation anomalies can be eliminated or at least reduced by improving the vibratory features of the dryer or by means of mechanical energy transfer (Szabó et al., 2002, Toledo 1994). One possible way of mechanical energy input is the vibratory driving of the porous material, i. e., preparation of the so-called vibro-fluidised <b>bed.</b> <b>In</b> practice this <b>procedure</b> is used to complement gas-fluidisation <b>procedures,</b> <b>in</b> which the mechanical energy transferred to the fluidised material is affected by the vibration of the gas-distribution grid that conveys the material, thus the air-vibro-fluidised bed is formed. The <b>procedures</b> carried out <b>in</b> the air-vibro-fluidised <b>bed,</b> e. g., drying, agglomeration, instantisation, etc., have the following considerable advantages in food engineering: • The pulse-transmitted vibration energy propagates in the granulous product equally, whic...|$|R

40|$|Objective: the judicialization {{of health}} is {{incorporated}} into the daily work of health institutions in Brazil through the court orders for access. In this study, the objective was to describe {{the contents of the}} social representations of access, through judicialization, for the health professionals. Method: qualitative study based on Social Representations Theory, involving 40 professionals, at a teaching hospital and at the center for the regulation of <b>beds</b> and <b>procedures</b> <b>in</b> Rio de Janeiro. Forty semistructured interviews were held, to which the thematic-categorical content analysis technique was applied. Results: the health professionals' attitude towards the reality the judicialization imposes is negative, but they acknowledge this resource as necessary in view of the public health crisis. Judicialization is considered a strategy to exercise citizenship that superimposes individual on collective law, increases social inequalities in access and compromises the efficacy of health policies. Conclusion: considering social representation as a determinant of practices, the representations that emerged can contribute to the change of the professionals' practices. Improvements in user care should be promoted, characterized as one of the main challenges to advance in universal access to health...|$|R
