Design Randomised, double blind, double dummy, parallel trial. Setting Secondary care in Denmark between 2003 and 2006. Participants Non-obese patients (BMI <= 27) with preserved beta cell function. Interventions After a four month run-in period with repaglinide plus metformin combination therapy, patients with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1 c)) concentration of 6. 5 % or more were randomised to repaglinide 6 mg or metformin 2000 mg. All patients also received <b>biphasic</b> <b>insulin</b> aspart 70 / 30 (30 % soluble insulin aspart and 70 % intermediate acting insulin aspart) 6 units once a day before dinner for 12 months. Insulin dose was adjusted aiming for a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 4. 0 - 6. 0 mmol/l. The target of HbA(1 c) concentration was less than 6. 5 %. Treatment was intensified {{to two or three}} <b>insulin</b> <b>injections</b> a day if glycaemic targets were not reached. Main outcome measure HbA(1 c) concentration. Results Of the 459 patients who were eligible, 102 were randomised, and 97 completed the trial. Patients had had type 2 diabetes for approximately 10 years. At the end of treatment, HbA(1 c) concentration was reduced by a similar amount in the two treatment groups (insulin plus metformin: mean (standard deviation) HbA(1 c) 8. 15 % (1. 32) v 6. 72 % (0. 66); insulin plus repaglinide: 8. 07 % (1. 49) v 6. 90 % (0. 68); P= 0. 177). Total daily insulin dose and risk of hypoglycaemia were also similar in the two treatment groups.

40|$|Abstract Background The large {{clinical}} trials proved that Basal-Bolus (BB) insulin therapy {{was effective in}} the prevention of diabetic complications and their progression. However, BB therapy needs multiple <b>insulin</b> <b>injections</b> per a day. In this regard, a <b>biphasic</b> <b>insulin</b> analogue needs only twice-daily injections, and is able to correct postprandial hyperglycemia. Therefore it may achieve the blood glucose control as same as that of BB therapy and prevent the diabetic complications including macroangiopathy. Methods In PROBE (Prospective, Randomized, Open, Blinded-Endpoint) design, forty-two type 2 diabetic patients (male: 73. 8 %, median(inter quartile range) age: 64. 5 (56. 8 ~ 71. 0) years) with secondary failure of sulfonylurea (SU) were randomly assigned to BB therapy with a thrice-daily insulin aspart and once-daily basal insulin (BB group) or to conventional therapy with a twice-daily <b>biphasic</b> <b>insulin</b> analogue (30 Mix group), and were followed up for 6 months to compare changes in HbA 1 c, daily glycemic profile, intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid artery, adiponectin levels, amounts of insulin used, and QOL between the two groups. Results After 6 months, HbA 1 c was significantly reduced in both groups compared to baseline (30 Mix; 9. 3 (8. 1 ~ 11. 3) → 7. 4 (6. 9 ~ 8. 7) %, p Conclusion Both BB and 30 mix group produced comparable reductions in HbA 1 c in type 2 diabetic patients with secondary failure. There was no significant change in IMT as an indicator of early atherosclerotic changes between the two groups. The basal-bolus insulin therapy may not be necessarily needed if the type 2 diabetic patients have become secondary failure.

40|$|Glucose induces <b>biphasic</b> <b>insulin</b> {{secretion}} by the islet �-cell. Based {{on recent}} knowledge on glucose signaling in the �-cell, {{the underlying mechanisms}} for this biphasicity could be envisaged as follows. Glucose-induced elevation of cytosolic free Ca 2 � concentration, {{which is due to}} the electrophysiological events that originate in closure of the ATP-sensitive K � (KATP) channel, most likely triggers the first phase. The second phase is produced by gradual augmentation and potentiation of Ca 2 �-triggered insulin release by the KATP channel– independent, nonionic signals. Protein acylation may be involved in the nonionic signaling. In patients lacking functional KATP channels, however, the first phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion is clearly retained, casting doubt on the simplistic view outlined above. In this pathological condition, the KATP channel–independent, most likely nonionic, glucose action alone is sufficient for the first-phase response. Diabetes 51 (Suppl. 1) :S 96 –S 98, 2002 <b>Biphasic</b> <b>insulin</b> release by the islet �-cell upon glucose stimulation has long been recognized (1).

Four males and three females with IDDM (X age = 20. 14 yrs) performed three 18 min submaximal stairclimbing tests at 50 % of their predicted V 02 max on a Stairmaster 4000 PT exercise device. Subjects injected 80 % of their usual pre-breakfast dose of insulin (NPH + R) subcutaneously into the thigh, arm, or abdomen, 5 min prior to each exercise bout. Blood samples were collected before <b>insulin</b> <b>injection</b> (fasting baseline) and every 3 min during exercise via the fingerstick method. Blood samples were then analyzed for blood glucose.

40|$|Recently, the {{prevalence}} of type 2 diabetes has reached pandemic levels all over the world, {{and the problem is}} still growing. Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, in which insulin resistance and decrease in beta cell function accompany obesity. Early disorder, which ensues in clinical progression of the disease, is the defect of early phase insulin secretion. Patients have already lost approximately half of their beta cell reserve at the time of diagnosis. Aims of type 2 diabetes treatment are to eliminate hyperglycemia caused by insufficient insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance, to slow down beta cell destruction/depletion, to improve concomitant metabolic problems and to prevent complications. In treatment algorithms, insulin is evaluated as a replacement therapy at the following stage after life style changes (medical nutrition therapy, exercise) and oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) options. Since beta cell depletion is present at initial stages of the disease, it transforms insulin therapy into an earlier approach in treatment stages. Premixed insulin forms are one of the proposed treatment options in patients with hyperglycemia that is not controlled by OADs. These types of insulins are developed to meet both basal and postprandial insulin requirements of patients. Currently, premixed human insulin forms are replaced by analogue insulin forms, which can mimic the physiological secretion in more acceptable manner. <b>Biphasic</b> analogue <b>insulin</b> is one of the readily available pre-mixed analogue insulin forms, an example of this, <b>Biphasic</b> <b>Insulin</b> aspart 30 which is the one of the premixed analoge insulin forms, contains 30 % insulin aspart and 70 % protaminated insulin aspart. Consensus recommending the individualized approach in insulin therapy implies that physicians should have more detailed information about the use of different insulin forms. Although a global consensus report about initiation, titration and intensification and the use of <b>Biphasic</b> <b>Insulin</b> Aspart 30 treatment has been published recently, these types of guidelines cannot always respond to all of the local requirements. Therefore, it is aimed to prepare a guideline to facilitate the use of <b>Biphasic</b> <b>Insulin</b> Aspart 30 in the right patient, at the right time and in the right manner, as well as to help the physicians. A guideline, aiming to contain current evidences and to meet local requirements, was developed in May and June 2010 by an expert panel composed of experienced endocrinologists working at different parts of Turkey. The guideline includes initial treatment, optimization of initiation dose, and intensification of <b>Biphasic</b> <b>Insulin</b> Aspart 30 during the disease progression. Although previously published global guidelines about initiation, intensification, dose division, dose addition and combination of <b>Biphasic</b> <b>Insulin</b> Aspart 30 with OADs is in applicable situation in general, the content is enlarged by adding some special conditions. Administration information presented in this article forms simply a suggestion rather than a strict recommendation. Since the treatment of every diabetic patient should be individualized, suggestions of this guideline do not have any obligatory power on physicians. Turk Jem 2011; 15 : 65 - 7...|$|R
