40|$|The load {{carrying}} capacity of the existing bridges mostly depends {{on the value of}} traffic load. During last year’s the heavy traffic flow on the Latvian highways had considerably increased, therefore it is critical to determine the possibility of nowadays carrying traffic loads for bridges and overpasses built in different times, by using different design codes and characteristic of design loads. This paper presents simple bridge {{load carrying}} capacity rating method, based on the classification of traffic loads and load bearing capacity of bridge structures. The proposed method will assist in assessment and management of the existing <b>bridges</b> and ensure <b>safe</b> <b>load</b> transportation...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Safe</b> <b>Load</b> Indicator (SLI) or an Automatic <b>Safe</b> <b>Load</b> Indicator (ASLI) is {{a device}} which is {{installed}} on mobile or portal cranes {{to alert the}} operator if the lift is exceeding the safe operating range of the machinery. In some cases, the device will physically lock the machinery in circumstances it determines to be unsafe. SLI systems are usually composed of a microprocessor connected to various sensors on the crane itself. The SLI measures the angle and extension of the boom along with the load weight and compares this with the manufacturer's specifications {{to determine if the}} lift is safe.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the creep-stability analysis of viscoelastic cylindrical shells under axial compression. The mechanical {{properties of the}} material are described by the constitutive equations of the linear viscoelastic theory in terms of convolution integral operators. The approximate analytical {{solution to the problem}} is obtained by means of a modification of the quasi-elastic method. As a result, the instability condition for the shell is formulated. It is shown that for viscoelastic materials with limited creep, there is a <b>safe</b> <b>load</b> limit below which the structure is asymptotically stable. Any <b>load</b> above the <b>safe</b> <b>load</b> limit leads to buckling at the corresponding critical time...|$|R

50|$|Whether someone's {{belief is}} true {{is not a}} {{prerequisite}} for (its) belief. On the other hand, if something is actually known, then it categorically cannot be false. For example, if a person believes that a <b>bridge</b> is <b>safe</b> enough to support him, and attempts to cross it, but the bridge then collapses under his weight, {{it could be said}} that he believed that the <b>bridge</b> was <b>safe</b> but that his belief was mistaken. It would not be accurate to say that he knew that the <b>bridge</b> was <b>safe,</b> because plainly it was not. By contrast, if the bridge actually supported his weight, then he might say that he had believed that the <b>bridge</b> was <b>safe,</b> whereas now, after proving it to himself (by crossing it), he knows it was safe.|$|R

40|$|This talk {{focuses on}} the {{minimization}} of 1 dimensional free discontinuity problem with second order energy dependent on jump integrals {{but not on the}} cardinality of the discontinuity set. Related energies, describing loaded elastic-plastic beams, are not lower semi continuous in BH (the space of displacements with second derivatives which are measures). Nevertheless we show that if a <b>safe</b> <b>load</b> condition is fulfilled then minimizers exist and they belong actually to SBH; say their second derivative has no Cantor part. If in addition a stronger condition on load is fulfilled then minimizer is unique and belongs to the Sobolev space H 2. Moreover we can always select one minimizer whose number of plastic hinges does not exceed 2 and is the limit of minimizers of penalized problems. When the load stays in the gap between <b>safe</b> <b>load</b> and regularity condition then minimizers with hinges are allowed; if in addition the load is symmetric and strictly positive then there is uniqueness of minimizer, the hinges of such minimizer are exactly two and they are located at the endpoints. If the beam is under the action of a skew-symmetric <b>load</b> then the <b>safe</b> <b>load</b> condition is less stringent than in the general case...|$|R
