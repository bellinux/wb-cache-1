25|$|The {{transport}} layer establishes <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes process-to-process connectivity, meaning it provides end-to-end {{services that are}} independent {{of the structure of}} user data and the logistics of exchanging information for any particular specific purpose. Its responsibility includes end-to-end message transfer independent of the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers). End-to-end message transmission or connecting applications at the {{transport layer}} can be categorized as either connection-oriented, implemented in TCP, or connectionless, implemented in UDP.|$|E
25|$|Most {{operations}} on the GPU {{operate in a}} vectorized fashion: one operation can be performed on up to four values at once. For example, if one color , G1, B1> is to be modulated by another color , G2, B2>, the GPU can produce the resulting color *R2, G1*G2, B1*B2> in one operation. This functionality is useful in graphics because almost every <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> type is a vector (either 2-, 3-, or 4-dimensional). Examples include vertices, colors, normal vectors, and texture coordinates. Many other applications can put this to good use, and because of their higher performance, vector instructions, termed single instruction, multiple data (SIMD), have long been available on CPUs.|$|E
25|$|The spiral and helical scan systems {{produced}} {{very different}} displays {{from the same}} <b>basic</b> <b>data.</b> With the helical-scan system, the radar dish was moving horizontally, producing a series of stripes across the screen while scanning up and down so subsequent lines were above or below the last pass. This created a raster scan display, not unlike a television. Echoes caused the signal to brighten, producing a spot, or blip on the display. The blip's location indicated the direction to the target relative {{the nose of the}} fighter, represented by the centre point of the display. The further the blip was from the centre of the screen, the further away the target was from the centreline. The range was not directly indicated in this sort of display.|$|E

2500|$|The Principal Triangulation of Great Britain was {{initiated}} by the Board of Ordnance in 1791 and carried out {{under the direction of}} William Mudge and Thomas Frederick Colby. The field work was completed in 1853, just as Clark joined the Board. The methods of analysis had been planned in outline by William Yolland, his predecessor {{at the head of the}} Trigonometric Section, but it fell to Clarke to finalize the methods and carry them through to completion. This he achieved in the four years from 1854 to 1858: the report was published as [...] but it is entirely Clarke's work. The <b>basic</b> <b>data</b> was the collection of angle bearings taken from each of the 289 stations towards a number of other stations, typically from three to ten in number. The multiple observations were first subjected to a least squares error analysis to extract the most likely angles and then the triangles formed by the corrected bearings were adjusted simultaneously, again by least squares methods, to find the most likely geometry for the whole mesh. This was an immense undertaking which involved the solution of 920 equations without the aid of matrix methods or digital computers. The only available computers were the living personnel of the Trigonometric Section, twenty one of them. Once the triangles had been fixed it was then possible to calculate all the sides of the mesh in terms of the length of either of the bases, one by Lough Foyle in Ireland and the other on Salisbury plain. The accuracy of the survey was such that when the length of the Lough Foyle base was calculated through the triangulation mesh from the Salisbury base the error was only 5 inches when compared with its measured length (of 41,640.887 feet or about 8 miles). The final step was to use the distances and angles to work out the latitude and longitude of each triangulation point on the Airy ellipsoid.|$|E
