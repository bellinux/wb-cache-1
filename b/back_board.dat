500|$|After WrestleMania XIX, Lesnar {{turned his}} {{attention}} to John Cena, who had returned from injury in February 2003 after an F-5 into a ringpost, with Cena claiming Lesnar nearly ended his career and even named his new finishing move the [...] "F.U." [...] as a jab at the new champion. The feud ended in a match at Backlash on April 27, where Lesnar defeated Cena to retained the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, Lesnar returned to his rivalry with Big Show after, in the storyline, he injured Rey Mysterio badly during their match at Backlash. Show's attack resulted in Mysterio being carried out on a stretcher and <b>back</b> <b>board,</b> and Show took Mysterio off the stretcher and swung the <b>back</b> <b>board</b> into the ringpost, compounding the injury. Lesnar called out Show, who demanded that Lesnar put his title on the line against him. This led to a stretcher match for the title at Judgment Day on May 18, which Lesnar successfully retained. During the scripted rivalry on the June 12 episode of SmackDown!, Lesnar lifted Big Show off the top-rope in a superplex which caused the ring to collapse on impact. As Lesnar and Big Show continued their rivalry, Kurt Angle returned from his neck surgery and he and Lesnar began to form a more friendly rivalry, as the two were allies yet contenders for the title. At the first ever SmackDown! brand-exclusive pay-per-view in July named Vengeance, Lesnar defended the title against Angle and Show in a triple threat match, which Angle won by pinning Lesnar to regain the title.|$|E

40|$|Fluorescent {{retroreflective}} materials {{increase the}} brightness of traffic signs. In construction work zones a benefit is expected from the increased conspicuity of fluorescent retroreflective signs. Fluorescent material can be used instead of non-fluorescent materials both for the advance warning signs that indicate {{the configuration of the}} upcoming work zone and for additional <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> behind traffic signs, e. g. to attract attention to a posted speed limit sign. In a field experiment at a construction work zone on a motorway, conspicuity measurements during daytime showed that fluorescent retroreflective material doubled the conspicuity with respect to non-fluorescent material, corresponding to a daytime luminance which was twice as high. Driver behaviour in the approach area of a construction work zone was observed via video recordings during dusk, daylight and nighttime conditions. On consecutive days, three types of signing were installed in the approach area of the work zone: non-fluorescent signing (High Intensity Grade (HIG)), fluorescent signing (Diamond Grade (DG)) and the combination of fluorescent signing and <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> (DG+BB). Driver behaviour was analysed in terms of speed (average speeds and percentage of vehicles entering the work zone at excessive speeds), Time-To-Collision (TTC), and lane changes. Results showed that fluorescent retroreflective material reduced the (very high) speeds during dusk conditions (especially during low ambient light conditions, fluorescent materials have a very bright appearance). At night, speeds increased with fluorescent signing. <b>Backing</b> <b>boards</b> behind the posted speed signs reduced average speeds and excessive speeds at the entry of the work zone during daytime. Without fluorescent <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> more than 25 % of the cars drove faster than 100 km/h during daylight at the work zone entry, while with fluorescent <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> only 10 % drove that fast. With respect to the interaction between vehicles, a decrease of the proportion of small TTCs during night showed that DG and DG+BB signing caused a shift into a safer direction, even though a speed increase was recorded at night in the condition with DG signing. Furthermore, during dusk and night, fluorescent <b>backing</b> <b>boards</b> reduced last minute lane changes. In daylight the opposite was found...|$|R

50|$|Using good {{protective}} {{measures such as}} attaching a rigid backing to a painting on canvas provides several protections. It reduces the effects of rapid changes in relative humidity around the painting, provides some protection from pressure or direct contact against the canvas back, and protects from vibrations caused by handling or moving. <b>Backing</b> <b>boards</b> also serve to protect from dust and dirt, cracks and deformations from handling, and insect activity.

50|$|This section {{deals with}} the {{traditional}} cowls found on oasts, with particular reference to the South East. From the outside, a cowl appears to just sit {{on the roof of}} the kiln. High in the roof of the kiln is a beam spanning the centre, called the sprattle beam, this carries a bearing which the pintle on the bottom of the centre post sits in. At the top of the kiln, the centre post passes through a two or three armed top stay iron. At the top of the centre post is carried the <b>back</b> <b>board</b> which carries an elm curb ring at the bottom, and one or two curb rings higher up on all except the smallest of cowls. A tie beam could also be carried, either at each curb level, or just the bottom curb level, spanning the width of the cowl. The top of the backboard carries a shaped top plate to which the weatherboards were affixed. The whole is covered in tapered weatherboards, widest at the bottom and narrowest at the top. Slotted through the centre post and attached to the <b>back</b> <b>board</b> is the distinctive finger which sometimes carried a motif. The finger assisted the turning of the cowl in light winds. Weatherboards would be attached to the cowl with nails made from copper. Cowls were usually painted white, although some were cream. The cowl is constructed so that when looking down vertically on a kiln, it covers the whole of the opening. It also covers some ⅔ to ¾ of the circumference of the kiln opening, the remaining section being open to allow air to vent from the kiln. An illustration of a cowl and the cross-section of a kiln can be seen here.|$|E
5000|$|The final {{was also}} a rematch of sorts - England having {{defeated}} Australia in the Olympic third-place play-off, the Aussies were out for revenge. England started slowly, and Terry Walsh scored an early goal to put Australia into a deserved lead. England soon began to find their feet, with some typically mazy dribbles by Imran Sherwani threatening the Australian lines: but another goal soon followed for the Australians, this time against the run of play, from a penalty corner. This goal was in fact briefly disputed by England, who claimed that the shot had flown too high, above the <b>back</b> <b>board</b> of the net: but the referee ruled that it had brushed the goalkeeper's glove on the way, so the [...] "too high" [...] was counted as a deflection off an English player rather than a straight hit from the Australian scorer, and England were 2-0 behind at half-time. The second half was a more scrappy affair - England by and large having the greater amount of possession, but unable to create any significant chances against a well-drilled Australian defensive line. Late on in the game, a defensive error finally allowed Jon Potter in to score, {{but it was too}} little, too late: Australia hung on for a 2-1 victory.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York, he {{attended}} Madison High School, where he initially {{was interested in}} playing baseball. He was a pitcher, but was advised that he had become too tall to remain competitive in that sport. His initial introduction to basketball did not go well, but he eventually made the adjustment to the new game. His ability to play basketball came from his frequent participation in street basketball games. He played with some of New York's finest street players such as World B. Free and Earl [...] "the Goat" [...] Manigault. When the games eventually ended, he would go out in search of more opportunities to play basketball. Williams dominated the sport of basketball at Madison High School in the early 1970s.
