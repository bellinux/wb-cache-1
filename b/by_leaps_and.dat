Amidst standoff during the first few days of the rebellion in Zaragoza Comín travelled twice to Pamplona to secure reinforcements and came back with some 1,200 Navarrese requetés. The Carlist militiamen helped to overwhelm pockets of workers' resistance in the city, overran the surrounding province and met the Anarchist column advancing from Barcelona some 22km East of the Aragon capital. As a result, Zaragoza, one of the national anarchist strongholds, remained firmly in Nationalists' hands.|$|E

During the later stages of the advance, the battalion headquarters formed an ad-hoc group (Task Force Hail) to screen the southern flank of the division, commanding the battalion reconnaissance company and an infantry company from the division. They reached the Rhine on 25 March, and crossed the same night; the advance continued unbroken for several days.

40|$|Low-energy anti-fibrillation pacing (LEAP) {{has been}} {{suggested}} as an alternative treatment in symptomatic fibrillation patients. It significantly lowers the energy required compared with standard 1 -shock defibrillation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the mechanism of arrhythmia termination <b>by</b> <b>LEAP</b> <b>and</b> systematically analyzed the influence of shock period and timing on the success rate of LEAP. METHODS: We induced atrial and ventricular fibrillation in isolated canine hearts <b>and</b> applied <b>LEAP</b> <b>and</b> standard 1 -shock defibrillation to terminate the arrhythmia. We simulated the arrhythmia <b>and</b> <b>LEAP</b> using a 2 -dimensional bidomain human atrial model. RESULTS: The ex vivo experiments showed successful termination of atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation using LEAP, with an average 88 % and 81 % energy reduction, respectively, and both experiments and simulations verified that synchronization from virtual electrodes is the key mechanism for termination of arrhythmia <b>by</b> <b>LEAP</b> using modified Kuramoto phase plots and fraction of tissue excited (FTE) plots. We also observed in simulations that LEAP is more effective when the shock period {{is close to the}} dominant period and the first shock is delivered when FTE is decreasing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support synchronization as the mechanism for arrhythmia termination <b>by</b> <b>LEAP,</b> <b>and</b> its effectiveness can be improved by adjusting shock period and timing...|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} advance made in {{the early}} 19th century was developing a technique to remove the sediment caused by dead yeast after the secondary fermentation. Early Champagne producers chose not to remove the sediment, which left the wine cloudy and prone to off flavors if the sediment was shaken up or poured into the glass. At royal courts and banquets, servers would pour new serving of Champagne into a fresh glass to avoid the residue of sediment left over in the previous glass. To remove the sediments, some producers would decant the wine by pouring it a new bottle. However this process caused {{a considerable amount of}} carbon dioxide gas to escape and the resulting wine was noticeably less bubbly. With the aid of her cellar master, Madame Clicquot of the Champagne house Veuve Cliquot developed the process of riddling in the early 19th century {{to solve the problem of}} sediments without losing much gas. This technique, which involves collecting the sediment in the neck of the bottle and using the pressure of the wine to eject just the sediment, led to the popularity of adding sugar-sweet dosage to replace the wine lost during riddling. The Russians, in particular, were fans of very sweet Champagne and Veuve Cliquot was able to tailor the sweetness level of their wines for their customers by the composition of their dosage. At first the house of Veuve Cliquot tried to keep this technique of riddling a secret but by the late 1820s the secret was out and Champagne houses were settling up production lines for riddling. In 1854, the French national railroad system linked Reims with the rest of the country, including its coastal ports. From that point on, Champagne was connected to its worldwide market and sales grew <b>by</b> <b>leaps</b> <b>and</b> bounds. During the 1850s production was averaging 20 million bottles a year.|$|E

In {{response}} to critics who refused to accept that Java Man was a [...] "missing link", in 1932 Dubois published a paper arguing that the Trinil bones looked {{like those of a}} [...] "giant gibbon". Dubois's use of the phrase has been widely misinterpreted as a retraction, but it was intended an argument to support his claim that Pithecanthropus was a transitional form. According to Dubois, evolution occurred <b>by</b> <b>leaps,</b> <b>and</b> the ancestors of humanity had doubled their brain-to-body ratio on each leap. To prove that Java Man was the [...] "missing link" [...] between apes and humans, he therefore had to show that its brain-to-body ratio was double that of apes and half that of humans.
