40|$|Setting a <b>baseline</b> {{for carbon}} stock changes in forest {{and land use}} sector {{mitigation}} projects is an essential step for assessing additionality of the project. There are two approaches for setting <b>baselines</b> namely, project-specific and regional <b>baseline.</b> This paper presents the methodology adopted for estimating the land available for mitigation, for developing a regional <b>baseline,</b> transaction cost involved and a comparison of project-specific and regional <b>baseline.</b> The study showed {{that it is possible}} to estimate the potential land and its suitability for afforestation and reforestation mitigation projects, using existing maps and data, in the dry zone of Karnataka, southern India. The study adopted a three-step approach for developing a regional <b>baseline,</b> namely: i) identification of likely <b>baseline</b> options for land use, ii) estimation of <b>baseline</b> rates of land-use change, and iii) quantification of <b>baseline</b> carbon profile over time. The analysis showed that carbon stock estimates made for wastelands and fallow lands for project-specific as well as the regional <b>baseline</b> are comparable. The ratio of wasteland Carbon stocks of a project to regional <b>baseline</b> is 1. 02, and that of fallow lands in the project to regional <b>baseline</b> is 0. 97. The cost of conducting field studies for determination of regional <b>baseline</b> is about a quarter of the cost of developing a project-specific <b>baseline</b> on a per hectare basis.

40|$|Abstract—In {{distributed}} satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar (DS-SAR), along-track and cross-track <b>baselines</b> couple {{with each other and}} change dynamically due to formation flying, which makes it difficult to estimate interferometric <b>baseline</b> accurately. To solve the problem, a novel high-precision <b>baseline</b> estimation approach based on interferometric phase is proposed. By modeling accurate relationship between coupling <b>baselines</b> and two-dimensional (azimuth and range) inteferometric fringe frequency under the ellipsoid earth model, the along-track and cross-track <b>baseline</b> can be estimated separately by interferometric phase decoupling. By selecting several segments from interferometric phase during the whole data-take time and estimating instantaneous <b>baseline</b> of each segment, the dynamic <b>baseline</b> can be obtained via a linear filtering. Besides, to improve the <b>baseline</b> estimation accuracy, Semi-Newton iterative method is applied to acquire high-precision fringe frequency estimation, which can make the <b>baseline</b> estimation achieve centimeter level precision. The simulation validates the approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|Background: Self-reported {{physical}} activity (PA) and sleep duration (SLP) change markedly throughout adolescence. We sought to quantify changes in objectively-measured PA, sedentary time (ST) and SLP through adolescence, and to investigate <b>baseline</b> body composition and <b>baseline</b> activity levels as determinants of change. Methods: Individually calibrated combined {{heart rate and}} movement sensing was used to estimate PA energy expenditure (PAEE), SLP, daily ST and time in light (LPA), moderate (MPA), vigorous (VPA), and moderate-to-vigorous {{physical activity}} (MVPA) in 144 adolescents (50 % boys) of mean age 15. 1 (± 0. 3) y at <b>baseline</b> and 17. 5 (± 0. 3) y at follow-up. Changes in PA (ΔPA), ST (ΔST) and SLP (ΔSLP) were calculated as follow-up minus <b>baseline</b> values. Waist circumference (WC) was measured at <b>baseline</b> and follow-up, as was fat mass index (FMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) by a pooled estimation method including bio-impedance. Comparison of <b>baseline</b> and follow-up activity was made by mixed-model ANOVA. Linear regression adjusted for <b>baseline</b> demographics, total and weekend hours of monitor wear time and the seasons of activity measurements, was used to investigate <b>baseline</b> body composition as determinants of ΔPA, ΔST and ΔSLP. A further model adjusted for <b>baseline</b> of the outcome assessed <b>baseline</b> activity {{as a predictor of}} behaviour change, and investigated associations for <b>baseline</b> body composition independent of the <b>baseline</b> level of the outcome. Results: From <b>baseline</b> to follow-up levels of MPA and VPA declined (p[*]≤[*] 0. 039). The annual decline in MVPA was equivalent to - 4. 5 and - 3. 0 min/d in boys and girls, respectively. <b>Baseline</b> FMI, FFMI and WC were positively associated with ΔLPA and negatively associated with ΔST in boys when adjusted for <b>baseline</b> of the outcome (p[*]≤[*] 0. 037 for all). SLP increased from <b>baseline</b> to follow-up (p[*]=[*] 0. 004) but ΔSLP was not associated with <b>baseline</b> body composition (p[*]≥[*] 0. 13). For all variables, higher <b>baseline</b> levels were associated with greater declines over time (p[*]≤[*] 0. 003). Conclusions: Levels of higher-intensity PA decline from mid-to-late adolescence, whereas the duration of sleep increases. Changes in LPA and ST may be associated with <b>baseline</b> body composition, but the <b>baseline</b> level of the outcome is consistently the strongest predictor of changes in adolescent activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{randomized}} trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at <b>baseline</b> and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between <b>baseline</b> and post-treatment; percentage change between <b>baseline</b> and post-treatment {{and analysis of}} covariance (ANCOVA) with <b>baseline</b> score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between <b>baseline</b> and post-treatment scores. Results ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from <b>baseline</b> has acceptable power when correlation between <b>baseline</b> and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from <b>baseline</b> has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from <b>baseline</b> will also fail to protect from bias {{in the case of}} <b>baseline</b> imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data. Conclusions Percentage change from <b>baseline</b> should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean <b>baseline</b> scores. </p...|$|R
