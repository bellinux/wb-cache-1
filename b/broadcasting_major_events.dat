The examined period starts in 1923 as the beginning of the existence of Radiojournal - the first radio station in Czechoslovakia and is defined by the year 1948. The thesis is systematically divided into five periods in which I describe the first signs of the interest in the sport in a regular radio <b>broadcasting,</b> first <b>major</b> sports <b>events</b> broadcasted by Radiojournal, organizational, personnel and technical background, marginal sports. Selected sport events with greater or minor importance are also described, as they were gradually transmitted by Radiojournal or Czechoslovak Radio in different periods. The thesis also mentions the occupation of the Czechoslovak Republic during the World War II, when has the interest in the sports radio broadcasting decreased but not vanished completely. There are outlined the activities of Josef Laufer during this period too. Laufer was Czechoslovak icon of the sports radio broadcasting. There is described the personnel expansion and {{the development of the}} independent sports redaction in the postwar period. This thesis is based on the practical research in the archive of the Czech Radio, the most beneficial information was provided [...] ...|$|R

This study follows the major sport of auto racing across 2012 and 2013.

IETs and locals each self-segregate themselves into one of seven behavioural attendance motive groups - each with different spending patterns. Economic impact equations are generated. Economic impacts of individual IETs and local behavioural groups at destination and at the <b>major</b> <b>event</b> show how destination managers (and researchers) can support a <b>major</b> <b>event</b> and focus their regional tourism activities...|$|R

40|$|<b>Major</b> <b>events,</b> {{such as the}} Olympics and Glastonbury music festival, attract {{tourists}} and result in increased consumer spending in host economies. The {{purpose of this study}} is to gain insights into the key determinants driving future intentions of travel consumers to participate in group-based travel to <b>major</b> <b>events.</b> An integrated theoretical model is empirically tested with 424 travel consumers who have had prior experience travelling in a group to a <b>major</b> <b>event.</b> The results substantiate the model showing that customer value perceptions of a past group-travel consumption experience conceptualised with multiple benefit dimensions has the largest relative effect on future intentions to engage in group-travel behaviour to <b>major</b> <b>events,</b> followed by attitude towards the host destination and enduring event involvement. The results provide managers with holistic insights into components that are used as the basis upon which group-travel consumers develop their choice behaviour which can be used to effectively cultivate more attendees to <b>major</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{lifestyle}} {{concept of}} Personal <b>Major</b> <b>Events</b> is proposed {{as a measure}} to predict an individual's reactions to retirement. The personal <b>major</b> <b>events</b> of 44 retired professional men were categorized into the mutually-exclusive categories of work events, family events, and leisure events. Preliminary findings suggest a siginificant negative relationship be-tween the work proportion of personal <b>major</b> <b>events</b> and adjustment to and enjoyment of retirement. A significant positive relationship {{was found between the}} family proportion of personal <b>major</b> <b>events</b> and enjoyment of and prior attitudes to retirement. Implications of these findings suggest that the concept of personal <b>major</b> <b>events</b> is relevant for pre- retire-ment planners and as a research area in social gerontology.

We are considering a special jump-diffusion model first described by Samuelson (1973) while using traditional geometric Brownian motion. This paper seeks to accurately show the innovative project valuation when unexpected <b>major</b> <b>events</b> occur and get the analytical results of the project option value. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of multistaged financing; results indicated that both sources of uncertainty positively impact the project option value; particularly, the option price when considering unexpected <b>major</b> <b>events</b> occurrence {{is larger than the}} option price without unexpected <b>major</b> <b>events.</b> Based on a comparative-static analysis, new propositions for optimal amount of investment and optimal level of project are derived from simulations...|$|R
