40|$|We used {{simulations}} from a biophysical {{model that}} integrates interlinked exchanges {{of energy and}} water between frogs and their environments to address questions about the limits to thermoregulation and about adaptations for arboreality. Body size and cutaneous resistance (Rc) both significantly affected body temperature (Tb) and the time to desiccate to 70 % of <b>standard</b> <b>mass</b> (an ecologically relevant metric of desiccation). Cutaneous resistances < 25 s/cm allow basking frogs to elevate their Tb several degrees above ambient, but Rc above 25 had little additional effect on Tb. Small frogs (< 10 g) are able to elevate their Tb above ambient while basking, even with small Rc.

Our literature survey indicates that frogs with a combination of Rc and body size that would result in long times to desiccate to 70 % of <b>standard</b> <b>mass</b> tend to be arboreal, suggesting that those species may be selectively favored in a niche that often requires frogs to be away from water sources for extended periods of time...|$|R
