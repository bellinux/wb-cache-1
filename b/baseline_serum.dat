40|$|Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is {{typically}} suspected {{in patients with}} cutaneous mastocytosis (CM). In recent years, the presence of clonal mast cells (MCs) in a subset of patients with systemic symptoms associated with MC activation {{in the absence of}} CM has been reported and termed monoclonal MC activation syndromes or clonal systemic MC activation syndromes. In these cases, bone marrow (BM) MC numbers are usually lower than in SM with CM, there are no detectable BM MC aggregates, and <b>serum</b> <b>baseline</b> tryptase is often < 20 μg/l; thus, diagnosis of SM in these patients should be based on careful evaluation of other minor WHO criteria for SM in reference centers, where highly sensitive techniques for immunophenotypic analysis and investigation of KIT mutations on fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified BM MCs are routinely performed. The prevalence of hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis (HVA) among SM patients is higher than among the normal population and it has been reported to be approximately 5 %. In SM patients with IgE-mediated HVA, venom immunotherapy is safe and effective and it should be prescribed lifelong. Severe adverse reactions to hymenoptera stings or venom immunotherapy have been associated with increased <b>serum</b> <b>baseline</b> tryptase; however, presence of clonal MC has not been ruled out in most reports and thus both SM and clonal MC activation syndrome might be underdiagnosed in such patients. In fact, clonal BM MC appears to be a relevant risk factor for both HVA and severe reactions to venom immunotherapy, while the increase in <b>serum</b> <b>baseline</b> tryptase by itself should be considered as a powerful surrogate marker for anaphylaxis.

The relationship between <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> creatinine and the risk for a composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death was examined using Cox regression models. To adjust for heterogeneity between studies and treatment groups, these factors were included as strata when applicable.

Here we investigated prospectively whether <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> FGF 21 levels could predict incident CHD in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and no known cardiovascular diseases. METHODS AND RESULTS: <b>Baseline</b> <b>serum</b> FGF 21 levels were measured in 3528 Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus recruited from the Hong Kong West Diabetes Registry. The role of <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> FGF 21 levels in predicting incident CHD over a median follow-up of 3. 8 years was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Among 3528 recruited subjects without known cardiovascular diseases, 147 (4. 2 %) developed CHD over a mean follow-up of 4 years. <b>Baseline</b> <b>serum</b> log-transformed FGF 21 levels were significantly higher in those who had incident CHD {{than those who did}} not (222. 7 pg/mL [92. 8 - 438. 4] versus 151. 1 pg/mL [75. 6 - 274. 6]; P< 0. 001). On multivariable Cox regression analysis, <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> FGF 21 levels, using an optimal cutoff of 206. 22 pg/mL derived from our study, independently predicted incident CHD (hazard ratio, 1. 55; 95 % CI, 1. 10 - 2. 19; P= 0. 013) and significantly improved net reclassification index and integrated discrimination improvement after adjustment for conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

Serum levels of KL- 6 and CCL 18 were measured by ELISA. The correlation between <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> levels of the markers and the incidence of AE was evaluated. ResultsThirteen (17 %) patients experienced AE during follow-up. <b>Baseline</b> <b>serum</b> KL- 6 levels were significantly higher in patients who developed AE than in patients with stable IPF (p <  0. 0001), whereas serum CCL 18 levels showed no difference between these groups (p =  0. 13). At a cut-off level of 1300  U/mL for KL- 6, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and likelihood ratio to predict AE were 92 %, 61 %, 66 % and 2. 36, respectively. In the Kaplan–Meier analysis, patients with <b>baseline</b> <b>serum</b> KL- 6 level ≥ 1300  U/mL experienced earlier onset of AE (p =  0. 002), whereas CCL 18 showed no predictive value (p =  0. 11).

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether baseline characteristics and clinical events associate with mortality in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PAH) due to congenital heart disease (CHD). In total 91 consecutive adults (42 ± 14 year) with CHD-PAH were referred for therapy between January 2005 and June 2013. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to identify determinants of mortality, including clinical events as time dependent covariates. Twenty-four patients (nine with Down) died during the median follow-up of 4. 7 (range 0. 1 - 7. 9) years. The one and eight year mortality rates were 7. 3 % and 37. 3 %, respectively. Clinical events included admission for heart failure (n= 9), arrhythmias (n= 9), haemoptysis (n= 5), change to a worse NYHA class (n= 16), vascular events (n= 1), syncope (n= 1) and need for red blood cell depletion (n= 4).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with CHD-PAH have {{a limited}} prognosis. In daily practice, {{combination}} therapy is often initiated after a clinical event. Although clinical events {{have been associated with}} a poor prognosis in idiopathic PAH, data on this association are limited in CHD-PAH. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether baseline characteristics and clinical events associate with mortality in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PAH) due to congenital heart disease (CHD). METHODS: In total 91 consecutive adults (42 +/- 14 year) with CHD-PAH were referred for therapy between January 2005 and June 2013. Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to identify determinants of mortality, including clinical events as time dependent covariates. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (nine with Down) died during the median follow-up of 4. 7 (range 0. 1 - 7. 9) years. The one and eight year mortality rates were 7. 3 % and 37. 3 %, respectively. Clinical events included admission for heart failure (n= 9), arrhythmias (n= 9), haemoptysis (n= 5), change to a worse NYHA class (n= 16), vascular events (n= 1), syncope (n= 1) and need for red blood cell depletion (n= 4). In univariate analysis, both baseline characteristics and clinical events were associated with mortality. In multivariate analysis, only <b>baseline</b> NT-pro-BNP <b>serum</b> level >/= 500 ng/L and TAPSE/= 500 ng/L and TAPSE< 15 mm at echocardiography have a nine fold higher mortality rate than patients without both risk factors. CONCLUSION: Prognosis is still poor in contemporary patients with CHD-PAH. Both <b>baseline</b> NT-pro-BNP <b>serum</b> level and right ventricular function are superior to clinical events in prognostication. These two baseline characteristics should have a major impact on therapeutic management in patients with CHD-PAH, such as initiation of combination therapy...|$|R
