The main purpose of the paper is, on one hand, to gauge {{the importance of these}} external imbalances in regional economies, with that concept being confined to the trade (goods and services) account. Notwithstanding the limited data available, empirical evidence for EU regions is put forward to supporting the idea that regions meet more frequently trade imbalances of relevant size than those faced by countries. Discussion centers as well on why regions can run wider trade deficits than nations and it is argued that as regions avoid sustainability constraints they may even benefit from those imbalances.

40|$|The {{notion that}} trade and capital flows drive {{exchange}} rates is {{widespread in the}} financial press but receives scant attention in economic research. The flow market model of the exchange rate has fallen out of fashion in the 1970 s, {{at a time when}} stock-oriented approaches, such as monetary and portfolio balance models, gained prominence. However, given the limited empirical success of mainstream exchange rate models over the past decades, it may be time for a reassessment of the flow market approach. The aim of this work is to demonstrate how <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> <b>imbalances</b> influence the demands for different currencies in the foreign exchange markets over time. A dynamical system approach is used to assess how international payments evolve for different sets of assumptions regarding the joint dynamic behaviour of various balance of payments components. An important finding is that while the different components of the balance of payments affect international payment flows directly in a given country, they also determine the accumulation of foreign assets and liabilities in that country, or its international investment position. However, the international investment position itself gives rise to international payments, for instance when foreign debt becomes due and is repaid or when interest payments on the existing debt stock are made. The dynamical system approach is further applied to topics such as currency crises and the exchange rate performance of commodity exporters. Two empirical essays on the important case of Japan confirm the above hypotheses. The first essay builds a vector error correction model for the nominal exchange rate and the current account in Japan. The model allows for a Markov-switching stochastic trend in the current account. The model is capable of producing the strong cycles of the current account and the gradual adjustment of the exchange rate, which can both be observed in the Japanese data. Bayesian estimation proceeds using an innovative Gibbs sampling procedure. The second essay estimates the maturity structure of Japan's foreign lending. It constructs an explicit measure of cross-border payment flows across Japanese borders, based on the estimated maturity structure of Japan's foreign lending. The simulated cross-border payment flows are shown to closely follow the movements of the Japanese exchange rate. An additional empirical essay considers the reverse question of how the current account is influenced by exchange rate fluctuations. Based on German and Japanese data, it is shown that strong exchange rate movements have tended to influence the trend of the current account, rather than its level as is typically assumed in the literature...|$|E

The present paper addresses {{the important question}} of whether these noticeable budget deficits have come {{to bear on the}} current account component <b>of</b> the Egyptian <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> thus creating <b>imbalances</b> therein as well. We thus examine the familiar so called twin deficit hypothesis. Our findings elucidate the existence of a short and long run relationship linking budgetary deficits to their current account counterparts. Thus a Granger causality test reveals that while budget deficits lead to one lag current account deficits, the latter in turn have arguably been the source of two lags deficits in the government budget, which gives a plausible testimony confirming the reverse hypothesis. Indeed, notwithstanding the strong causal effect whereby budget deficits resulted in four to nine year lagged current account deficits; a remarkably significant counter-effect exists, thus signifying a bi-directional causal relationship between the two types of deficits. The ECM analysis of our results indicates that a 10 percent increase in the government budget deficit will accentuate itself by a further 7 percent increase in the first lag but will also cause a one lag increase of 8. 7 percent in the current account deficit. These findings lend strong support to the twin deficit hypothesis in the Egyptian case. Barring the presence of strong shocks, it can plausibly be claimed that there is a reasonably stron...|$|R
