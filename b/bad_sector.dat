Typically a DSP in the electronics inside the HDD takes the raw analog voltages from the read head and uses PRML and Reed–Solomon error correction to decode the sector boundaries and sector data, then sends that data out the standard interface. That DSP also watches the error rate detected by error detection and correction, and performs <b>bad</b> <b>sector</b> remapping, data collection for Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, and other internal tasks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{two types}} of <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> are [...] "physical" [...] and [...] "logical" [...] <b>bad</b> <b>sectors,</b> or [...] "hard" [...] and [...] "soft" [...] <b>bad</b> <b>sectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Soft <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> can {{potentially}} be fixed by either data recovery software or hardware, {{depending on the}} damaged condition. Some amount of <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> can be skipped using software, while a severely corrupted disk with a large area of <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> may potentially only be repaired. [...] <b>Bad</b> <b>sectors</b> are areas on the hard drive that cannot be read. Even new hardrives sometimes contain <b>bad</b> <b>sectors.</b> Since manufacturers intensely compete to cram more space into disks, systems operate close to the limit of that generation of technology.|$|R
5000|$|Earlier drives had a {{tendency}} toward developing <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> with use and wear; these <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> could be [...] "mapped out" [...] so they were not used and did not affect operation of a drive, and this was considered normal unless many <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> developed {{in a short period}} of time. Some early drives even had a table attached to a drive's case on which <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> were to be listed as they appeared. Later drives map out <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> automatically, in a way invisible to the user; a drive with remapped sectors may continue to be used. Statistics and logs available through S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) provide information about the remapping.|$|R

50|$|Bad {{sectors that}} are found during normal usage of the disk are not capable of having the sector {{slipping}} algorithm applied. Instead a linear reallocation, or sector forwarding, is used where a <b>bad</b> <b>sector</b> is replaced with a sector from a spare area. Doing this does affect access times as the disk will need to seek to the spare sector since all further lookups of the <b>bad</b> <b>sector</b> will redirect to the new sector.|$|E

5000|$|Internal hard-drive defect {{management}} {{is a system}} present in hard drives for handling of <b>bad</b> <b>sectors.</b> The systems are generally proprietary and vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, but typically consist of a [...] "P" [...] (for [...] "permanent" [...] or [...] "primary") list of <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> detected in the manufacturing stage and a [...] "G" [...] (for [...] "growth") list of <b>bad</b> <b>sectors</b> that crop up after manufacturing. Many disk/controller subsystems reserve storage to remap defective disk sectors. The drive automatically creates its initial remapping information and has the additional ability to dynamically remap [...] "grown" [...] defects.

50|$|If any of {{the files}} uses a sector which is marked as 'bad' by a disk utility then the <b>bad</b> <b>sector</b> of the file is remapped to a free sector and any {{unreadable}} data is lost.

To resolve this, software is used to correct the logical sectors of the media drive. If this is not enough, the hardware containing the logical bad sectors must be replaced.|$|E
50|$|ARccOS (Advanced Regional Copy Control Operating Solution) is a copy-protection system made by Sony {{that is used}} on some DVDs.

5000|$|A {{sector was}} {{deliberately}} made [...] "bad" [...] {{so that the}} disk controller would attempt to read it several times, generally requiring one complete revolution of the media ("spin") for each attempt.

50|$|A <b>bad</b> <b>sector</b> is {{a sector}} on a computer's disk drive or flash memory that is either {{inaccessible}} or unwriteable due to permanent damage, such as physical {{damage to the}} disk surface or failed flash memory transistors. Bad sectors are usually detected by a disk utility software such as CHKDSK or SCANDISK on Microsoft systems, or badblocks on Unix-like systems. When found, these programs may mark the sectors unusable (most file systems contain provisions for bad-sector marks) and the operating system skips them in the future.|$|E

50|$|By convention, all {{the control}} {{structures}} were organized to fit inside the first track, thus avoiding head movement during {{read and write}} operations, although this varied depending on the manufacturer and physical format of the disk. A limitation which was not addressed until much later (with FAT32) was that any <b>bad</b> <b>sector</b> in the control structures area, track 0, could prevent the disk from being usable. The DOS formatting tool rejected such disks completely. Bad sectors were allowed only in the file data area and (since DOS 2.0) were marked with the reserved value 0xFF7 in the FAT. They made the entire containing cluster unusable.|$|E

5000|$|Data {{recovery}} imaging {{must have}} the ability to pre-configure drives by disabling certain attributes (such as SMART and G-List re-mapping) and the ability to work with unstable drives (drive instability/read instability can be caused by minute mechanical wear and other issues). Data recovery imaging {{must have the}} ability to read data from [...] "bad sectors." [...] Read instability is a major factor when working with drives in operating systems such as Windows. A typical operating system is limited in its ability to deal with drives that {{take a long time to}} read. For these reasons, software that relies on the BIOS and operating system to communicate with the hard drive is often unsuccessful in data recovery imaging; separate hardware control of the source hard drive is required to achieve the full spectrum of data recovery imaging. This is because the operating system (through the BIOS) has a certain set of protocols or rules for communication with the drive that cannot be violated (such as when the hard drive detects a <b>bad</b> <b>sector).</b> A hard drive's protocols may not allow [...] "bad" [...] data to be propagated through to the operating system; firmware on the drive may compensate by rereading sectors until checksums, CRCs, or ECCs pass, or use ECC data to recreate damaged data.|$|E

50|$|Data erasure may {{not work}} {{completely}} on flash based media, such as Solid State Drives and USB Flash Drives, as these devices can store remnant data which is inaccessible to the erasure technique, and data can be retrieved from the individual flash memory chips inside the device.Data erasure through overwriting only works on hard drives that are functioning and writing to all <b>sectors.</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>sectors</b> cannot usually be overwritten, but may contain recoverable information. <b>Bad</b> <b>sectors,</b> however, may be invisible to the host system and thus to the erasing software. Disk encryption before use prevents this problem. Software-driven data erasure could also be compromised by malicious code.|$|R
