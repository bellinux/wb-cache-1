5|$|Burgoyne's failed campaign, as may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{titles of}} some of the books that cover it in detail, marked a major turning point in the war. After the battle, he withdrew his men 10–15 miles north, near present-day Schuylerville, New York. General Burgoyne {{returned}} to England and was never given another commanding position in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{cause of the}} distortions of the spiral pattern {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} with galaxy satellites M32 and M110. This can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars.|$|E
5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the walls as can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> positioning of arrowslits.|$|E

5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, as can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of}} the 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E
5|$|On 9 April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. This {{operation}} preempted Britain's own {{plans to}} invade Norway. Denmark surrendered immediately, and, after a short-lived {{attempt by the}} British to make a stand {{in the northern part}} of the country, Norway also fell. The invasion of Norway was a combined forces operation in which the German war machine projected its power across the sea; this German success would come to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British as a dire portent.|$|E
5|$|The Galilean moons were {{discovered}} in either 1609 or 1610 when Galileo made improvements to his telescope, which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever. Galileo's discovery showed {{the importance of the}} telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> naked eye. More importantly, the incontrovertible discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, or the geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth.|$|E

5|$|The sport enjoyed an {{unprecedented}} surge in popularity during the Regency period {{when it was}} openly patronised by the Prince Regent (later George IV) and his brothers. Championship boxing matches acquired a louche reputation as the places to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wealthy upper classes. Thus a match would often be attended by thousands of people, {{many of whom had}} wagered money on the outcome. The Duke of Cumberland (an uncle of King George III) was reported to have bet thousands of pounds on Jack Broughton, who was the English champion for 18years.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the Sheffield economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study {{revealed}} that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> current surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield economy grew from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Heroes of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures and enemies. Unlike prior {{games in the}} series, which are typically action role-playing games, Heroes is a real-time strategy game (RTS), in which the player controls up to 25 units in battles on fixed maps. Units are controlled via the Nintendo DS touch screen, selected by tapping on them and sent to destinations or to attack by tapping on their target. The game world is divided into an isometric grid, with one unit allowed per space. The Nintendo DS's second screen shows {{a map of the}} current mission, including which parts of the map can currently <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> player's units and which parts are covered by fog of war. Individual units and enemies are shown on the map in the visible areas.|$|E

5|$|More recent historians, such as Michael Hicks and A. J. Pollard, {{have tried}} to see Warwick {{in light of the}} {{standards}} of his own age, rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals. The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward – including Edward's secret marriage, and the refusal of the French diplomatic channel – were significant. His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of illusions of grandeur; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent. Furthermore, Warwick's cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries, which can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> earl's popularity exceeding that of the king {{at the time of his}} first rebellion in 1469. On the other hand, while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king, it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl's presence on the political scene. As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was, Edward could not fully assert his royal authority, and eventual confrontation became inevitable.|$|E
5|$|Since 1879, {{more than}} 300 Victoria Crosses have been {{publicly}} auctioned or advertised. Others have been privately sold. The {{value of the}} VC can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increasing sums that the medals reach at auction. In 1955 the set of medals awarded to Edmund Barron Hartley was bought at Sotheby's for the then record price of £300 (approximately £ in present-day terms). In October 1966 the Middlesex Regiment paid a new record figure of £900 (approximately £ in present-day terms) for a VC awarded after the Battle of the Somme. In January 1969, the record reached £1700 (£) for the medal set of William Rennie. In April 2004 the VC awarded in 1944 to Sergeant Norman Jackson, RAF, was sold at auction for £235,250. On 24 July 2006, an auction at Bonhams in Sydney of the VC awarded to Captain Alfred Shout fetched a world record hammer price of A$1 million (approximately £410,000 at then exchange rates).|$|E
5|$|The Triangulum Galaxy, {{also known}} as Messier 33, was {{discovered}} by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in the 17th century. A distant member of the Local Group, it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough to <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> naked eye under the darkest skies. Under light-polluted skies, it is challenging or invisible even in a small telescope or binoculars. Because of its low surface brightness, low power is required. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller than both the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis {{that it is a}} satellite of the larger galaxy. Within the constellation, it lies near the border of Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of Beta Andromedae. Within the galaxy, NGC 604 is an H II region where star formation takes place.|$|E

5|$|The tomb of Ramesses IX, KV6, {{has been}} open since antiquity, as can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{graffiti}} left on its walls by Roman and Coptic visitors. Located {{in the central}} part of the valley, it is between and slightly above KV5 and KV55. The tomb extends a total distance of 105 metres into the hillside, including extensive side chambers that were neither decorated nor finished. The hasty and incomplete nature of the rock-cutting and decorations (it is only decorated for a little over half its length) within the tomb indicate that the tomb was not completed by the time of Ramesses' death, with the completed hall of pillars serving as the burial chamber.|$|E
5|$|At 3pm, the Cabildo {{began its}} routine work, but was {{interrupted}} by 600armed men named the Infernal Legion, who occupied the Plaza de la Victoria and loudly demanded the convening of an open cabildo and the resignation of Viceroy Cisneros. They carried a portrait of FerdinandVII and the lapels of their jackets bore a white ribbon that symbolized criollo–Spanish unity. Domingo French, the mail carrier of the city, and Antonio Beruti, {{an employee of the}} treasury, led the rioters. It was rumored that Cisneros had been killed, and that Saavedra would take control of the government. Saavedra was at the barracks at that moment, concerned about the demonstration. He thought the violence should be stopped and that radical measures such as the assassination of Cisneros should be prevented, but he also thought that the troops would mutiny if the demonstrations were suppressed. The people in the Plaza did not believe that Cisneros would allow the open cabildo the next day. Leiva left the Cabildo, and Belgrano, who was representing the crowd, requested a definitive commitment. Leiva explained that everything would go ahead as planned, but the Cabildo needed time to prepare. He asked Belgrano to help the Cabildo with the work, as his intervention would <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> crowd as a guarantee that their demands would not be ignored. The crowd left the main hall but stayed in the Plaza. Belgrano protested about the guest list, which consisted of the wealthiest citizens, and thought that if the poor people were left outside there would be further unrest. The members of the Cabildo tried to convince him to give his support, but he left.|$|E
