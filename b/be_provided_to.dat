5|$|A new organ was {{supplied}} to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops spread over four manuals and pedals, and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console {{standing on the}} floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.|$|E
5|$|In November 1899, the BS {{announced}} {{a bill for}} the 1900 session. Again, an extension was proposed from Marylebone to Paddington, this time terminating {{to the east of}} the mainline station at the junction of Bishop's Road (now Bishop's Bridge Road) and Gloucester Terrace. A station was planned under Bishop's Road, linked to the mainline station by a subway under Eastbourne Terrace. From Waterloo, an extension was planned to run under Westminster Bridge Road and St George's Road to terminate at Elephant and Castle. The BS would connect there with the C's station as the NC planned two years earlier.

5|$|Many German radio {{messages}} were encoded using the Enigma machine and other enciphering techniques and the codes were changed frequently. A team of code breakers stationed at Bletchley Park worked to break codes {{as quickly as}} possible to provide advance information on German plans and troop movements. British military intelligence code-named this information Ultra intelligence as it could only <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> the top level of commanders. The Enigma code used by Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, Oberbefehlshaber West (Supreme Commander West; OB West), commander of the Western Front, was broken by the end of March. German intelligence changed the Enigma codes right after the Allied landings of 6 June but by 17 June the Allies were again consistently able to read them.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{began at}} the end of 1942 when the Department of Post-War Reconstruction was formed. The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' entitlements and the assistance which would <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. This included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available. An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced. In order to achieve this, it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as price controls in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were most needed.|$|E
5|$|Several relief {{agencies}} were already positioned {{in the region}} {{in response to a}} magnitude 6.9 earthquake in January of that year that killed over 20,000 people. Additional disaster relief teams were deployed to the region to further prepare residents for the cyclone. Food, water and other necessities were stored and ready to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> victims of the storm. Large swells produced by the storm affected {{a large portion of the}} western Indian coastline, especially in the city of Bombay. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. Offshore, between 1,500 and 2,000 fishing vessels had lost contact with the mainland. Later reports indicated that between 120 and 900 fishermen had gone missing as a result of the cyclone.|$|E

5|$|The {{early stages}} of the {{organization}} were characterized by a focus on Marxist–Leninist ideology. The CPC viewed the women’s movement {{as a part of the}} larger Chinese revolution against the feudal past, but some leaders in the CPC argued that because most of the women continued to do domestic work, and did not actively participate in the revolution, this contradicted the Marxist–Leninist ideology. The ACWF contested this assertion, stating that the economic conditions were not at the point where jobs could <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> all women. Therefore, housekeepers, wives and mothers who were dedicated to their work could indeed be seen as contributing to socialism.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1941 and the {{beginning}} of 1942, approximately 7,000 Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with a further 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children. Most of these people were from the outlying Serbian towns, primarily Niš, Smederevo and Šabac. Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated, and whose windows were shattered due to German bombing raids carried out during the invasion of Yugoslavia. Originally constructed as fair pavilions, the largest of these barracks held up to 5,000 prisoners. Inmates suffered during numerous influenza epidemics, slept on wet straw or bare floorboards, and were provided with inadequate amounts of food. Starvation was widespread, and Jewish inmates appealed unsuccessfully to Serbian authorities for more food to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> the camp. Consequently, a high number of detainees, especially children, died in late 1941 and early 1942, with many inmates freezing to death in one of the coldest winters on record. The Romani inmates were kept in far more miserable conditions than their Jewish counterparts. They also slept on straw in an unheated hall, but were kept separate from non-Romani prisoners. The majority of Romani inmates were released after six weeks of detention. Most Jewish inmates remained detained, with the exception of ten Jewish women who were married to Christian men.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route {{was given}} its own {{identity}} {{on the tube}} map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the reversing bay track {{was taken out of}} use and the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) were taken out of use in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During service disruption or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944 5MWS {{became part}} of a force of RAAF and United States Army {{aviation}} engineer units which were selected to build airfields at Aitape in New Guinea from which air support would <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> Allied operations around Hollandia after US Army forces landed there on 22April. 5MWS departed Melbourne on 15February, and eventually joined up with {{the main body of}} the airfield engineer force at Lae on 1April where it received training in infantry tactics. The Landing at Aitape took place on 22April, and 5MWS came ashore the next day. The airfield at Aitape was ready to be used from 25April and was later expanded by the aviation engineers. On 6July 5MWS landed on Noemfoor Island where it again formed part of an aviation engineer force tasked with repairing and expanding the island's airfields. Allied forces had first landed on the island on 2July, and it was still not secure when construction work began. As a result, 5MWS personnel were required to man perimeter defences, during which they captured 12 Japanese personnel. While at Noemfoor 5MWS was redesignated No.5 Airfield Construction Squadron (5ACS) on 18July. As at 25November, No. 4 Airfield Construction Squadron and 5ACS were the main units of No. 62 Wing. This wing formed part of the Australian First Tactical Air Force, which was the RAAF's main mobile force.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 4th Armoured Brigade {{was formed}} in January 1943 to provide {{armoured}} support for Australian Army units operating in the South West Pacific Area. The brigade was never intended {{to serve as a}} single formation, rather its role was to provide a pool of armoured units from which units and sub-units could <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> augment infantry forces. The brigade was also responsible for developing doctrine and specialised armoured vehicles for armoured warfare in tropical terrain. In keeping with the brigade's task of providing armoured units to other formations, its armoured regiments were organised into self-supporting regimental groups and the brigade did not possess the reconnaissance, infantry and other supporting elements which were common in World War II-era armoured brigades. Elements of the brigade saw action in the Huon Peninsula campaign of 1943–44 and attached to the Australian 6th Division during the Aitape–Wewak campaign from October 1944 {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was to be}} {{built as}} a two-lane {{alternative}} to Route31 defining {{the border of the}} suburban and rural portions of Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local street network was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would <b>be</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds to put together the survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the survey were originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.|$|E
