50|$|Magnetic {{intensity}} as {{a component}} of the navigational ‘map’ of pigeons had been discussed since the late nineteenth century. One of the earliest publications to prove that birds use magnetic information was a 1972 study on the compass of European robins by Wolfgang Wiltschko. A 2014 double <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> showed that European robins exposed to low level electromagnetic noise between about 20 kz and 20 MHz,could not orient themselves with their magnetic compass. When they entered aluminium-screened huts, which attenuated electromagnetic noise in the frequency range from 50 kHz to 5 MHz by approximately two orders of magnitude, their orientation reappeared.|$|E
50|$|Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty {{are similar}} medical spinal {{procedures}} in which bone cement is injected {{through a small}} hole in the skin (percutaneously) into a fractured vertebra {{with the goal of}} relieving back pain caused by vertebral compression fractures. It was found not to be effective in treating osteoporosis-related compression fractures of the spine in the only two placebo controlled and randomized clinical trials that have been conducted. The people in both the experimental and placebo groups of the <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> reported improvement in their pain, suggesting that the benefit noted in unblinded trials is related to the placebo effect.|$|E

50|$|Evidence {{does not}} support a benefit of kyphoplasty over vertebroplasty with respect to pain, but the {{procedures}} may differ in restoring lost vertebral height, and in safety issues like cement extravasation (leakage). As with vertebroplasty, several unblinded studies have suggested a benefit from balloon kyphoplasty. , no <b>blinded</b> <b>studies</b> have been performed, and since the procedure is a derivative of vertebroplasty, the unsuccessful results of these <b>blinded</b> <b>studies</b> have cast doubt upon the benefit of kyphoplasty generally.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Seventy-eight {{dogs with}} pain from hip {{dysplasia}} {{participated in a}} six-month placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of gold bead implantation. In the present, non-blinded study, 73 of these dogs were followed for an additional 18 months to evaluate the long-term pain-relieving effect of gold bead implantation. The recently-published results of the six month period revealed that 30 of the 36 dogs (83 %) in the gold implantation group showed significant improvement (p = 0. 02), included improved mobility and reduction in the signs of pain, compared to the placebo group (60 % improvement). In the long-term two-year follow-up study, 66 of the 73 dogs had gold implantation and seven dogs continued as a control group. The 32 dogs in the original placebo group had gold beads implanted and were followed for a further 18 months. A certified veterinary acupuncturist used the same procedure to insert the gold beads as in the <b>blinded</b> <b>study,</b> and the owners completed {{the same type of}} detailed questionnaires. As in the <b>blinded</b> <b>study,</b> one investigator was responsible for all the assessments of each dog. The present study revealed that the pain-relieving effect of gold bead implantation observed in the <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> continued throughout the two-year follow-up period. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{sought to}} assess the {{occurrence}} of events after <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> drug discontinuation and transition to open-label vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in ARISTOTLE. METHODS: At the end of ARISTOTLE, <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> drug was stopped, and open-label VKA was recommended. For patients completing the trial on <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> drug, a 2 -day bridging period with apixaban or apixaban placebo was recommended (while beginning open-label VKA). Outcomes were assessed during the 30 days after stopping <b>blinded</b> <b>study</b> drug. RESULTS: Of the 6, 809 patients in the apixaban group and 6, 588 in the warfarin group who completed the trial on study drug, there were 21 strokes or systemic emboli (4. 02 %/year) and 26 major bleeding (4. 97 %/year) events in the apixaban group (transitioning to VKA) and 5 strokes or systemic emboli (0. 99 %/year) and 10 major bleeding (1. 97 %/year) events in the warfarin group (continuing on VKA), {{with most of the}} imbalance between groups being after the first week. Similar results were seen in the first 30 days of the trial where warfarin-naive patients starting warfarin had a higher rate of stroke or systemic emboli (5. 41 %/year) than warfarin-experienced patients (1. 42 %/year), a pattern not seen when starting apixaban. No similar increase in events with apixaban versus warfarin was seen during temporary or permanent study drug discontinuation during the trial. CONCLUSIONS: The excess in thrombotic and bleeding events in the apixaban group after study drug discontinuation appears to be related to an increased risk associated with the initiation of a VKA rather than a direct effect of apixaban. Whether >/= 2 days of apixaban bridging improves outcomes during VKA transition is unknown and deserves further evaluation...|$|E

Methods: In a single blind (raters were <b>blind)</b> <b>study</b> (N= 12, duration 33 weeks) OTD was treated with Botulinum Toxin A in three consecutive sessions with increasing dosages. The severity was measured with the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Results: Overall there was a non-significant reduction in the severity of OTD (p= 0. 15). However, in the patients with no change in their anti psychotic medication (N= 8) the reduction was significant (p= 0. 035). After the study, 50 % of the patients preferred to continue the Botulinum Toxin A treatment. Conclusion: BTA was well tolerated and showed a non-significant improvement for OTD.

Here we show how instrumental variables can be used to quantify and disentangle treatment and placebo effects in randomized clinical trials comparing control and active treatments in the presence of confounders. The key idea is to use randomization to separately manipulate treatment assignment and psychological encouragement messages that increase the participants' desire for improved symptoms. The proposed approach is able to improve the estimation of treatment effects in <b>blinded</b> <b>studies</b> and, most importantly, opens the doors to account for placebo effects in unblinded trials.
