Hughes recognised {{that such a}} clause would {{be a threat to}} White Australia and made it clear to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted. When the proposal failed, Hughes reported in the Australian parliament:The White Australia is yours.

500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{you would have to}} beat them down or you lose the respect of your crew, which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime. So we have to give [...] a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they don't know Trek, to say the {{things that need to be}} said in order to get people onto our side." ...|$|E
500|$|Hunger {{and desperation}} {{eventually}} forced Sitting Bull, and 186 {{of his family}} and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford, Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, [...] "I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle." [...] To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, [...] "to surrender my rifle" [...] in this context meant [...] "We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> for Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather Great Mystery) will use a different way to help us overcome the white man." [...] In the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.|$|E

Her story of deliverance from physical slavery also symbolizes {{all those who}} find meaning and inspiration in her life for their own deliverance from spiritual slavery. In May 1992 news of her beatification was banned by Khartoum which Pope John Paul II then personally visited only nine months later. On 10 February 1993, he solemnly honoured Bakhita on her own soil. [...] "Rejoice, all of Africa! Bakhita has come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> The daughter of Sudan sold into slavery as a living piece of merchandise and yet still free.

2500|$|There is a {{specific}} Classical influence in Chrétien's romances {{the likes of which}} (The Iliad, The Aeneid, Metamorphoses) were [...] "translated into the Old French vernacular during the 1150s". Foster Guyer argues that specifically Yvain, the Knight of the Lion contains definite Ovidian influence: [...] "Yvain was filled with grief and showed the Ovidian love symptoms of weeping and sighing so bitterly that he could scarcely speak. He declared that he would never stay away a full year. [...] Using words like those of Leander in the seventeenth of Ovid's Epistles he said: 'If only I had the wings of a dove/to fly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at will/Many and many a time I would come'." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 31, 2008, while paddleboarding {{with his}} then-wife Camille in Hawaii, Grammer {{experienced}} {{symptoms of a}} heart attack. After being hospitalized, {{it was confirmed that}} he had experienced a heart attack. He was discharged on June 4, 2008, and was said to be [...] "resting comfortably" [...] at his Hawaiian residence. Seven weeks after the attack, Grammer told Entertainment Tonight that, although at the time his spokesman described the attack as mild, it was in fact more severe, almost leading to his death, as his heart had stopped. Grammer thought Fox's decision to cancel his TV sitcom <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> contributed to his health problems, stating that [...] "It was a very stressful time for me, and a surprise that it was cancelled. But you know, everything that doesn't kill us—which it almost did—makes us stronger!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 87% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 67 reviews the website collected. Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel {{placed it in}} the top five films released that year. BBC film critic Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made saying [...] "There's a theory that great films give <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> whatever it is you bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist—it reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and life after death. He couldn't see why people thought it was scary. I've seen it about 200 times and every time I see something I haven't seen before." ...|$|E

2500|$|Days {{before the}} decree {{absolute}} of divorce, letters patent were issued with general rules to regulate royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style Her Royal Highness {{because she was}} no longer married to the Prince of Wales and instead was styled Diana, Princess of Wales. The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style after her divorce, but Charles had insisted on removing it. As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne, she was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage. Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: [...] "Don't worry, Mummy, I will give it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> one day when I am King." [...] Almost a year before, according to Tina Brown, the Duke of Edinburgh had warned the Princess of Wales: [...] "If you don't behave, my girl, we'll take your title away." [...] She is said to have replied: [...] "My title is a lot older than yours, Philip." [...] Diana and her mother quarrelled in May 1997 after she told Hello! magazine that Diana was happy to lose her title of Her Royal Highness following her controversial divorce from Prince Charles. They were reportedly not on speaking terms with each other by the time of Diana's death.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the pregame hype {{surrounded}} {{the conflict between}} Parcells and Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Kraft {{took control of the}} team after Parcells was hired, {{and the two of them}} had different ideas on how to run the organization. Six days before the Super Bowl, in an article by Will McDonough, the Boston Globe reported Parcells would leave the Patriots after the Super Bowl to become the coach of the New York Jets. The book Patriot Reign alleges the Patriots have cell phone records showing Parcells was in constant contact with the Jets during the week. Then-Patriots defensive coordinator (and now head coach) Bill Belichick is quoted as saying Parcells' plans to leave for the Jets were a distraction, [...] "Yeah, I'd say it was a little bit of a distraction all the way around. I can tell you first-hand, there was a lot of stuff going on prior to the game. I mean, him talking to other teams. He was trying to make up his mind about what he was going to do. Which, honestly, I felt [...] totally inappropriate. How many chances do you get to play for the Super Bowl? Tell them to get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in a couple of days. I'm not saying it was disrespectful to me, but it was in terms of the overall commitment to the team." [...] Parcells even refused to travel back with the rest of the Patriots after the game, and was eventually hired by the rival Jets.|$|E
