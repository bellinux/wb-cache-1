Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the <b>bubble,</b> and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the <b>bubble</b> and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through.

40|$|Abstract Background Micro <b>bubbles</b> were {{initially}} introduced as contrast agents for ultrasound examinations {{as they are}} able to modify the signal-to-noise ratio in imaging, thus improving the assessment of clinical information on human tissue. Recent developments have demonstrated the feasibility of using these <b>bubbles</b> as drug carriers in localized delivery. In micro fluidics devices for generation of micro <b>bubbles,</b> the <b>bubbles</b> are formed at interface of liquid gas through a strangulation process. A device that uses these features can produce micro <b>bubbles</b> with small size dispersion in a single step. Methods A T-junction micro fluidic device constructed using 3 D prototyping was made for the production of mono dispersed micro <b>bubbles.</b> These micro <b>bubbles</b> use sunflower oil as a lipid layer. Stability studies for micro <b>bubbles</b> with diameters different generated from a liquid phase of the same viscosity were conducted to evaluate whether micro <b>bubbles</b> can be used as drug carriers. The biocompatibility of coating layer, the ability to withstand environmental pressure variations combined with echogenicity, are key factors that they can safely play the role of drug transporters. Results The normal distribution curve with small dispersion of the diameter of <b>bubbles</b> validates the process of generating micro <b>bubbles</b> with low value of variation coefficient, i. e., 0. 381 at 1. 90 %. The results also showed the feasibility of using sunflower oil as the lipid matrix with stable population of <b>bubbles</b> over 217 minutes for micro <b>bubbles</b> with an average diameter of 313. 04 μm and 121 minutes for micro <b>bubbles</b> with an average diameter of 73. 74 μm, considering <b>bubbles</b> with air as gaseous phase. Conclusion The results indicate that the micro fluidic device designed can be used for producing micro <b>bubbles</b> with low variation coefficient using sunflower oil as a coating of micro <b>bubbles.</b> These carriers were stable for periods of time that are long enough for clinical applications even when regular air is used as the gas phase. Improved stability can be achieved when biocompatible gas with lower permeability is used. </p...|$|R
