500|$|In early March 2010, U.S. Army <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>expert</b> Master Sergeant Jeffrey Sarver filed {{a multimillion-dollar}} lawsuit against The Hurt Locker. [...] Sarver's lawsuit claimed {{he used the}} term [...] "hurt locker" [...] and the phrase [...] "war is a drug" [...] around Boal, that his {{likeness}} was used to create the character William James, and that the portrayal of William James defames Sarver. Sarver said he felt [...] "just a little bit hurt, a little bit felt left out" [...] and cheated out of [...] "financial participation" [...] in the film. Sarver claimed he originated {{the title of the}} film; however, the title is a decades-old colloquialism for being injured, as in [...] "they sent him to the hurt locker." [...] It dates back to the Vietnam War where it was one of several phrases meaning [...] "in trouble or at a disadvantage; in bad shape." [...] Boal defended himself to the press, saying [...] "the film is a work of fiction inspired by many people's stories." [...] He said he talked to more than 100 soldiers during his research. Jody Simon, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, noted that [...] "soldiers don't have privacy", and that when the military embedded Boal they gave him full permission to use his observations as he saw fit. Summit Entertainment, the producers of the film, said in early March that they hoped for a quick resolution to the suit. In the December 8, 2011, issue of The Hollywood Reporter, it was announced that Master Sergeant Sarver's lawsuit was thrown out by the court, and a federal judge ordered him to pay more than $180,000 in attorney fees.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1891 a Conservative MP, Henry Richard Farquharson, {{the member}} for West Dorset, was telling people in London {{that he knew}} the murderer {{to have been a}} surgeon's son who had {{committed}} suicide. This story leaked to the press, though it never became a sensation. Like Macnaghten, Farquahson {{was a member of the}} upper classes who had attended Eton College and owned estates in the Far East. Macnaghten also had a potentially personal conduit of accurate information about Druitt – a close friend at the Home Office, Colonel Vivian Majendie (knighted in 1895). Colonel Majendie was also from a very distinguished family, was Chief Inspector of Munitions (1871–1898) and was justly acclaimed for his persistent bravery as a <b>bomb</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>expert.</b> Majendie was also related by the marriage of his first cousin's daughter, Isabel Majendie Hill, to the alleged Ripper (in 1888 Isabel had married Reverend Charles Druitt, the first cousin of Montague). According to Macnaghten, Druitt's own family [...] "believed" [...] he was Jack the Ripper. Due to speculation in the press about another madman, Macnaghten wrote a confidential report dated 23 February 1894 naming Druitt as a Ripper suspect and placed it on file. This document, in its entirety, was not publicly available until 1975 (the section mentioning only the suspects had been published in 1966). The alternate version of this same document, believed by many to be a draft, has never been sighted by a researcher and is thought to be lost. Instead a copy of this second version was made by Macnaghten's daughter Lady Christabel Aberconway, who allowed some of its contents to be publicly broadcast by television presenter Daniel Farson in 1959. The name of the chief suspect was not revealed until 1965, by the American journalist and author Tom Cullen. Why Macnaghten composed two versions remains the subject of controversy, speculation and historical debate among writers on the Ripper mystery (some have argued that the so-called Aberconway version is a rewrite of the 1894 original). This report proved influential for Jack the Ripper research, for it popularised the idea that the Ripper only had five true victims and also named three possible suspects.|$|E
