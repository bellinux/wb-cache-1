We compared the potencies of the enantiomers of <b>bupranolol</b> and examined the possible effects of seven <b>bupranolol</b> analogues including bevantolol (BEV) at this receptor in pithed and vagotomized rats. CGP 12177, an agonist of the atypical β-adrenoceptor, increased heart rate dose-dependently. Its dose–response curve was shifted to the right by S-(−) -bupranolol 10 μmol kg− 1 {{by a factor of}} 8. 4, but not affected by the same dose of R-(+) -bupranolol. Desmethylbupranolol and compounds BK- 21, BK- 22, BK- 23 and BK- 25 also increased heart rate dose-dependently. The β 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 given in combination with the β 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118, 551 (0. 1 μmol kg− 1 each) reduced the positive chronotropic action of the five <b>bupranolol</b> analogues without affecting that of CGP 12177. The potencies of the <b>bupranolol</b> analogues to increase heart rate were correlated (r= 0. 91, P< 0. 05) with their affinities for β 1 -adrenoceptor binding sites in rat brain cortex membranes labelled with [3 H]CGP 12177 (in the presence of ICI 118, 551). BK- 26 and BEV, 10 μmol kg− 1 each, had only minor effects on heart rate by themselves and did not antagonize the effect of CGP 12177. However, at 1 μmol kg− 1, they antagonized the increase in heart rate elicited by the β 1 -adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol. In conclusion, <b>bupranolol</b> is a stereoselective antagonist at the atypical cardiostimulant β-adrenoceptor. The effects of the <b>bupranolol</b> analogues are related to the activation or blockade of β 1 -adrenoceptors, but not of atypical β-adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBovine iris {{sphincter}} {{in vitro}} responded to β-adrenergic stimulation with pronounced relaxation (EC 50 of isoproterenol= 0. 3 nM), which was potentiated by the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine, and mimicked by the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin.

Arterial blood samples were drawn at 1 -minute intervals for 120 minutes from fasted, conscious dogs (n = 7) during the infusion of saline or <b>bupranolol</b> (1. 5 μg/kg/min), a high-affinity β 3 -blocker. FFA and glycerol time series were analyzed and deconvolution analysis was applied to estimate the rate of FFA release.

Deconvolution analysis showed bursts of lipolysis (nine pulses/hour) with time-dependent variation in burst frequency. <b>Bupranolol</b> completely removed rapid FFA and glycerol oscillations. Despite removal of lipolytic bursts, plasma FFAs (0. 31 mM) and glycerol (0. 06 mM) were not totally suppressed and deconvolution analysis revealed persistent non-oscillatory lipolysis (0. 064 mM/min). These results show that lipolysis in the fasting state consists of an oscillatory component, {{which appears to be}} entirely dependent upon sympathetic innervation of the adipose tissue, and a non-oscillatory, constitutive component, which persists despite β 3 -blockade.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether β 3 - and/or atypical β-adrenoceptors {{relax the}} rat isolated mesenteric artery. Mesenteric arteries precontracted with phenylephrine were relaxed by β-agonists {{with the following}} potencies (pD 2) : nonselective agonist isoprenaline (6. 00) >nonconventional partial agonist cyanopindolol (5. 45) >β 2 -agonist fenoterol (4. 98) >nonconventional partial agonist CGP 12177 (4. 19) >β 3 -agonist ZD 2079 (3. 72). The β 3 -agonist CL 316243 1 mM relaxed the vessel only marginally. The concentration–response curves (CRCs) for cyanopindolol, CGP 12177 and ZD 2079 were not affected by the nonselective β-antagonist propranolol 0. 3 μM, the β 2 -antagonist ICI 118551 1 μM and by CL 316243 60 μM, but shifted to the right by <b>bupranolol</b> (pA 2 5. 3 – 5. 7), CGP 20712 (5. 4) and SR 59230 A (6. 5 – 6. 7) (the latter three drugs block atypical and/or β 3 -adrenoceptors at high concentrations). The CRC for isoprenaline was shifted to the right by propranolol (pA 2 7. 0) but, {{in the presence of}} propranolol 0. 3 μM, not affected by SR 59230 A 1 μM. The CRC for fenoterol was shifted to the right by propranolol (pA 2 6. 9) and ICI 118551 (6. 8). Removal of endothelium diminished the vasorelaxant effects of cyanopindolol, CGP 12177 and ZD 2079. Fenoterol and cyanopindolol also relaxed (endothelium-intact) mesenteric arteries precontracted with serotonin. The relaxant effect of cyanopindolol was antagonized by <b>bupranolol</b> to about the same degree as in phenylephrine-contracted vessels.

Relaxant responses to isoprenaline, selective β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists (BRL 37344, SR 58611 A, CL 316243) and non-conventional partial agonists (CGP 12177 A, cyanopindolol, pindolol) were obtained. In phenylephrine-constricted, but not PGF 2 α-constricted rings, relaxations to isoprenaline showed a propranolol-resistant component. In phenylephrine-constricted rings, relaxations to BRL 37344 (pEC 50, 4. 64) and SR 58611 A (pEC 50, 4. 94) were not antagonized by the selective β 3 -adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59230 A (⩽ 1 μM). CL 316243 (⩽ 100 μM) failed to produce relaxation. In PGF 2 α-constricted rings only SR 58611 A produced relaxation, which was not affected by SR 59230 A (⩽ 3 μM). Non-conventional partial agonists produced relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted but not PGF 2 α-constricted rings. The relaxation to CGP 12177 A was unaffected by SR 59230 A (⩽ 1 μM) or by CGP 20712 A (10 μM), reported to block the low affinity state of the β 1 -adrenoceptor. β-adrenoceptor antagonists also produced relaxation in phenylephrine-constricted rings with an order of potency of (pEC 50 values) : <b>bupranolol</b> (5. 5) ≈ 38;SR 59230 A (5. 47) ≈ 38;cyanopindolol (5. 47) >pindolol (5. 30) >alprenolol (5. 10) >propranolol (4. 83) >ICI 118551 (4. 60) >CGP 12177 A (4. 38) ≈ 38;CGP 20712 A (4. 35). <b>Bupranolol</b> (100 μM), alprenolol (30 μM), propranolol (100 μM) and SR 59230 A (10 μM) produced no relaxation in PGF 2 α-constricted rings.

CGP 12177 (0. 1 – 100 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1) and cyanopindolol (1 – 1000 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1) dose-dependently enhanced all cardiac parameters.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} endogenously generated nitric oxide (NO) in the relaxation of bovine iris sphincter. METHODS. Isolated bovine sphincters were mounted on an isometric tension apparatus. Contraction–relaxation response was elicited by electrical field stimulation (ES; 12 Hz, 50 -msec duration, 70 – 80 V). Relaxation was arbitrarily defined as maximal decrease of tension below prestimulation baseline after cessation of ES. We also determined the tissue levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS. ES produced a biphasic response: contraction followed by relaxation. After cessation of ES, the muscle relaxed to below the initial baseline tension. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) abolished most of the contraction and all the relaxation response. Atropine blocked most of the contraction component, leaving the relaxation component unchanged. Prazosin and <b>bupranolol</b> (� 1 -adrenergic and �-adrenergic antagonists, respectively) also {{did not affect the}} relaxation component of the response.

40|$|Abstract Ps-Adrenoceptors are {{involved}} in the control of catecholamine-induced lipolysis in rodent adipose tissues. The expression and function of human Ps-adrenoceptors were investigated in subcutaneous white adipocytes of young healthy women. In these cells, Ps-adrenoceptor mRNAs rep resent 20 % of total amount of P-adrenoceptor transcripts and less than half of PI-adrenoceptor transcripts. Among psagonists known to stimulate Ps-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolysis in rodent fat cells, only CGP 12177 was able to mediate such activity in human fat cells. In in vitro lipolysis experiments and in situ microdialysis studies, CGP 12177 had a 4 to 5 -times lower lipolytic efficacy than isoprenaline, a nonselective badrenoceptor agonist. CGP 121774 nduced lipolysis was antagonized in vitro by <b>bupranolol,</b> a p-adrenergic antagonist potent on rodent Ps-adrenoceptors but not by nadolol, a PIand Peadrenoceptor antagonist. The in vitro blockade of isoprenaline-stimulated lipolysis by nadolol showed that the agonist acted solely via PI- and P 2 -adrenoceptors.

In rat fat cells, the rank order of potency of agonists was: CL 316, 243 >isoprenaline>SR 58, 611 A>CGP 12, 177. The three former agents were full agonists whereas CGP 12, 177 was a partial agonist (intrinsic activity of 0. 70). In human fat cells, the lipolytic effect of CGP 12, 177 reached 25 % of isoprenaline effect. CL 316, 243 was a poor inducer of lipolysis and SR 58, 611 A was ineffective. In rat fat cells, lipolysis induced by CL 316, 243 and SR 58, 611 A was competitively antagonized by SR 59, 230 A. Schild plots were linear with pA 2 values of 6. 89 and 6. 37, respectively. Conversely, 0. 1, 0. 5 and 1 [*]μM SR 59, 230 A did not modify the concentration-response curve of CGP 12, 177. A rightward shift of the curve was however observed with 10 and 100 [*]μM of SR 59, 230 A. The apparent pA 2 value was 5. 65. The non-selective β-adrenergic antagonist, <b>bupranolol,</b> competitively displaced the concentration-response curve of CGP 12, 177 and CL 316, 243. Schild plots were linear with pA 2 values of 6. 70 and 7. 59, respectively. CL 316, 243 -mediated lipolytic effect was not antagonized by CGP 20, 712 A. In human fat cells, CGP 12, 177 -mediated lipolytic effect was antagonized by <b>bupranolol</b> and CGP 20, 712 A.

In the presence of nadolol, a beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, isoprenaline produced consistent negative inotropic effects. Similar negative inotropic effects also resulted from the action of beta 3 -adrenoceptor agonists with an order of potency: BRL 37344 > SR 58611 approximately CL 316243 > CGP 12177.

40|$|Background—The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} nonspecific -blockers {{are limited by}} vasoconstriction, thus justifying the interest in molecules with ancillary vasodilating properties. Nebivolol is a selective 1 -adrenoreceptor antagonist that releases nitric oxide (NO) through incompletely characterized mechanisms. We identified endothelial 3 -adrenoreceptors in human coronary microarteries that mediate endothelium- and NO-dependent relaxation and hypothesized that nebivolol activates these 3 -adrenoreceptors. Methods and Results—Nebivolol dose-dependently relaxed rodent coronary resistance microarteries studied by videomi-croscopy (10 mol/L, 866 % of prostaglandin F 2 contraction); this was sensitive to NO synthase (NOS) inhibition, unaffected by the 1 - 2 -blocker nadolol, and prevented by the 1 - 2 - 3 -blocker <b>bupranolol</b> (P 0. 05; n 3 to 8). Importantly, nebivolol failed to relax microarteries from 3 -adrenoreceptor–deficient mice. Nebivolol (10 mol/L) also relaxed human coronary microvessels (715 % of KCl contraction); this was dependent on a functional endothelium and NO synthase but insensitive to 1 - 2 -blockade (all P 0. 05). In a mouse aortic ring assay of neoangiogenesis, nebivolol induced neocapillary tube formation in rings from wild-type but not 3 -adrenoreceptor – or endothelial NOS–deficient mice.

Heart rate was dose-dependently increased by CGP 12177 and cyanopindolol by maximally 150 and 100 beats min− 1, yielding pED 50 values of 8. 0 and 7. 3, respectively (pED 50, −log 10 of the dose in mol kg− 1 body weight i. v. causing the half-maximum effect), but not affected by the selective β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist CL 316243 (pED 50 > 6. 0). CGP 12177, cyanopindolol and CL 316243 increased temperature in the brown adipose tissue by maximally 1 °C (pED 50 values 7. 4, 6. 3 and 8. 6, respectively). The β 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 10 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, attenuated the cardiostimulatory effect of CGP 12177 and, at a still higher dose (30 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1), also antagonized its thermogenic effect. The −log 10 values of the doses causing a two[*]fold shift of the dose-response curves (DRCs) of CGP 12177 to the right were 6. 1 and 5. 2, respectively, and were {{much lower than the}} corresponding value for the antagonism of CGP 20712 against the β 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect which was 8. 6. The cardiostimulant and the thermogenic effect of CGP 12177 were not affected by the β 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 10 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1. The β 3 -adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59230 A (which, by itself, caused a β 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated increase in heart rate and, for this reason, was studied after administration of a low dose of CGP 20712) attenuated the cardiostimulant and the thermogenic effect of CGP 12177 to a similar extent. The −log 10 values of the doses causing two fold rightward shifts of the DRCs of CGP 12177 were 5. 9 and 5. 7, respectively. The non-selective β-adrenoceptor antagonist <b>bupranolol</b> diminished the cardiostimulant and thermogenic response to a very similar extent. The −log 10 values causing two[*]fold rightward shifts of the DRCs of CGP 12177 were 5. 6 and 5. 7, respectively, and were much lower than the corresponding values for the antagonism of <b>bupranolol</b> against the β 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated positive chronotropic effect and the β 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in diastolic blood pressure which were 7. 6 and 8. 3, respectively. The rank order of agonistic potencies for the cardiostimulant effect (CGP 12177 >cyanopindolol > CL 316243) differs from that for the thermogenic response in the brown adipose tissue (CL 316243 >CGP 12177 >cyanopindolol); furthermore, there is a difference with respect to the rank orders of antagonistic potencies for cardiostimulation (CGP 20712 ⩾SR 59230 A⩾bupranolol>ICI 118551) and thermogenesis (SR 59230 A=bupranolol>CGP 20712 >ICI 118551).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} nonspecific beta-blockers {{are limited by}} vasoconstriction, thus justifying the interest in molecules with ancillary vasodilating properties. Nebivolol is a selective beta 1 -adrenoreceptor antagonist that releases nitric oxide (NO) through incompletely characterized mechanisms. We identified endothelial beta 3 -adrenoreceptors in human coronary microarteries that mediate endothelium- and NO-dependent relaxation and hypothesized that nebivolol activates these beta 3 -adrenoreceptors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nebivolol dose-dependently relaxed rodent coronary resistance microarteries studied by videomicroscopy (10 micromol/L, - 86 +/- 6 % of prostaglandin F 2 alpha contraction); this was sensitive to NO synthase (NOS) inhibition, unaffected by the beta(1 - 2) -blocker nadolol, and prevented by the beta(1 - 2 - 3) -blocker <b>bupranolol</b> (P< 0. 05; n= 3 to 8). Importantly, nebivolol failed to relax microarteries from beta 3 -adrenoreceptor-deficient mice. Nebivolol (10 micromol/L) also relaxed human coronary microvessels (- 71 +/- 5 % of KCl contraction); this was dependent on a functional endothelium and NO synthase but insensitive to beta(1 - 2) -blockade (all P< 0. 05). In a mouse aortic ring assay of neoangiogenesis, nebivolol induced neocapillary tube formation in rings from wild-type but not beta 3 -adrenoreceptor- or endothelial NOS-deficient mice. In cultured endothelial cells, 10 micromol/L nebivolol increased NO release by 200 % as measured by electron paramagnetic spin trapping, which was also reversed by NOS inhibition. In parallel, endothelial NOS was dephosphorylated on threonine(495), and fura- 2 calcium fluorescence increased by 91. 8 +/- 23. 7 %; this effect was unaffected by beta(1 - 2) -blockade but abrogated by beta(1 - 2 - 3) -blockade (all P< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Nebivolol dilates human and rodent coronary resistance microarteries through an agonist effect on endothelial beta 3 -adrenoreceptors to release NO and promote neoangiogenesis. These properties may prove particularly beneficial {{for the treatment of}} ischemic and cardiac failure diseases through preservation of coronary reserve...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Coronary vessel tone is {{modulated}} {{in part by}} beta-adrenergic relaxation. However, {{the implication}} of specific beta-adrenoceptor subtypes and their downstream vasorelaxing mechanism(s) in human coronary resistance arteries is poorly defined. beta 3 -Adrenoceptors were recently shown to vasodilate animal vessels and are expressed in human hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the expression and functional role of beta 3 -adrenoceptors in human coronary microarteries and their coupling to vasodilating nitric oxide (NO) and/or hyperpolarization mechanisms. The expression of beta 3 -adrenoceptor mRNA and protein was demonstrated in extracts of human coronary microarteries. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed their exclusive localization in the endothelium, with no staining of vascular smooth muscle. In contractility experiments in which videomicroscopy was used, the nonspecific beta-agonist isoproterenol and the beta 3 -preferential agonist BRL 37344 evoked an approximately 50 % relaxation of endothelin- 1 -preconstricted human coronary microarteries. Relaxations were blocked by the beta 1 /beta 2 /beta 3 -adrenoceptor antagonist <b>bupranolol</b> but were insensitive to the beta 1 /beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol, confirming a beta 3 -adrenoceptor-mediated pathway. Relaxation in response to BRL 37344 was absent in human coronary microarteries devoid of functional endothelium. When human coronary microarteries were precontracted with KCl (thereby preventing vessel hyperpolarization), the relaxation to BRL 37344 was reduced to 15. 5 % and totally abrogated by the NO synthase inhibitor L-omega-nitroarginine, confirming the participation of a NO synthase-mediated relaxation. The NO synthase-independent relaxation was completely inhibited by the Ca 2 +-activated K+ channel inhibitors apamin and charybdotoxin, consistent with an additional endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-like response. Accordingly, membrane potential recordings demonstrated vessel hyperpolarization in response to beta 3 -adrenoceptor stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Beta 3 -adrenoceptors are expressed in the endothelium of human coronary resistance arteries and mediate adrenergic vasodilatation through both NO and vessel hyperpolarization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Altered {{expression}} and functional responses to cardiac b 3 -adrenergic receptors (ARs) {{may contribute to}} progressive cardiac dysfunction in heart failure (CHF). We compared myocyte b 3 -AR mRNA and protein levels and myocyte contractile, [Ca 21] i transient, and Ca 21 current (ICa,L) responses to BRL- 37344 (BRL, 1028 mol/L), a selective b 3 -AR agonist, in 9 instrumented dogs before and after pacing-induced CHF. Myocytes were isolated from left ventricular myocardium biopsy tissues. Using reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, we detected b 3 -AR mRNA from myocyte total RNA in each animal. Using a cloned canine b 3 -AR cDNA probe and myocyte poly A 1 RNA, we detected a single band about 3. 4 kb in normal and CHF myocytes. b 3 -AR protein was detected by Western blot. b 3 -AR mRNA and protein levels were significantly greater in CHF myocytes than in normal myocytes. Importantly, these changes were associated with enhanced b 3 -AR–mediated negative modulation on myocyte contractile response and [Ca 21]i regulation. Compared with normal myocytes, CHF myocytes had much greater decreases in the velocity of shortening and relengthening with BRL accompanied by larger reductions in the peak systolic [Ca 21]i transient and ICa,L. These responses were not modified by pretreating myocytes with metoprolol (a b 1 -AR antagonist) or nadolol (a b 1 - and b 2 -AR antagonist), but were nearly prevented by <b>bupranolol</b> or L- 748, 337 (b 3 -AR antagonists). We conclude that in dogs with pacing-induced CHF, b 3 -AR gene {{expression and}} protein levels are upregulated, and the functional response to b 3 -AR stimulation is increased. This may contribute to progression of cardiac dysfunction in CHF. (Circ Res. 2001...|$|E

We have adenovirally overexpressed β 1 -adrenoceptors in isolated, cultured adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and observed the inotropic potency of isoprenaline and CGP 12177 A ({{in the presence of}} 1 μM propranolol). Isoprenaline was a full inotropic agonist at rat ventricular myocytes (pD 2 7. 69 ± 0. 12). CGP 12177 A was a nonconventional partial agonist (pD 2 6. 34 ± 0. 09), increasing inotropy and lusitropy, with an intrinsic activity of 0. 34 and antagonised by <b>bupranolol.</b> β 1 -adrenoceptor overexpression enhanced the inotropic potency of isoprenaline by 11. 7 -fold (pD 2 8. 76 ± 0. 14) and CGP 12177 A by 5. 9 -fold (7. 11 ± 0. 10), respectively. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) overexpression did not alter the potency of isoprenaline or CGP 12177 A (pD 2 7. 41 ± 0. 24 and pD 2 6. 60 ± 0. 50, respectively). The cardiostimulant effects of CGP 12177 A were enhanced by IBMX (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and decreased by Rp-cAMPS (cAMP antagonist). CGP 12177 A also increased cAMP levels. CGP 12177 A but not isoprenaline initiated arrhythmias at lower concentrations following β 1 -adrenoceptor overexpression. 125 I-Cyanopindolol saturation binding in Adv. β 1 myocytes demonstrated ∼ 18 -fold increase in β 1 -adrenoceptors. 3 H-CGP 12177 A saturation binding, in the presence of propranolol, increased ∼ 5 -fold following overexpression of β 1 -adrenoceptors. This study demonstrates enhanced cardiostimulation by CGP 12177 A (in the presence of propranolol) in rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing β 1 -adrenoceptors, mediated by a Gs/cAMP signalling pathway. ‘Putative' β 4 -adrenoceptor pharmacology appears to be mediated by {{activation of}} a novel affinity state of the β 1 -adrenoceptor...|$|E

In addition, binding affinities of other β-adrenoceptor ligands were measured to investigate any correlation between α 1 -adrenoceptor affinity and relaxant potency in phenylephrine-constricted rings. In functional studies, CGP 12177 A produced parallel rightward shifts of the phenylephrine CRC with no reduction in the maximum responses. Schild regression analysis gave a straight line with a slope of 0. 95 (95 % CL: 0. 87 – 1. 04), suggesting reversible competitive antagonism, and gave a pKB value of 5. 26. In contrast, CGP 12177 A (⩽ 300 μM) {{had no effect on}} contraction induced by the thromboxane-mimetic, U 46619. In binding studies, CGP 12177 A competed monophasically with [3 H]prazosin binding (Hill slope, 0. 95, 95 % CL: 0. 76 – 1. 13), giving a pKi value of 5. 48, in good agreement with the pKB from functional studies. Competition experiments with various other β-adrenoceptor ligands showed that they all displaced [3 H]prazosin {{in a manner consistent with}} one-site competition. pKi values were as follows: SR 59230 A, 6. 25; cyanopindolol, 6. 33; <b>bupranolol,</b> 6. 35; alprenolol, 5. 90; propranolol, 5. 80; BRL 37344, 5. 50; ICI 118551, 5. 55; CGP 20712 A, 5. 26. The pKi values correlated well with the pEC 50 values for relaxation of phenylephrine-constricted rat aorta obtained previously (r 2 = 0. 984, P< 0. 0001). In conclusion, relaxant effects of CGP 12177 A and other β-adrenoceptor ligands in phenylephrine-constricted rat aorta can be attributed to α 1 -adrenoceptor blockade and are unrelated to effects at β 3 -adrenoceptors or atypical β-adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies in}} animal and human models have {{revealed}} that free fatty acid (FFA) release from adipose tissue is oscillatory.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of pulsatile vs. constant infusion of FFA on glucose homeostasis in the canine model. Euglycemic clamps with basal insulin replacement (0. 1 mU·kg− 1 ·min− 1 insulin) were performed in dogs (n = 8) during infusion of saline (SAL) or the medium-chain fatty acid octanoate, which was given by either pulsatile infusion (PUL: 10 mmol over 2 min every 10 min) or continuous infusion (C-INF: 1 mmol/min) designed to achieve equivalent total FFA mass. Endogenous lipolytic pulses were suppressed with the β 3 -specific adrenergic receptor antagonist <b>bupranolol.</b> PUL infusion elicited a pulsatile pattern of FFA in circulation with average maximum pulse height of 0. 82 ± 0. 04 mM, whereas C-INF FFA levels reached 0. 47 ± 0. 03 mM (fasting levels) and were maintained throughout. Glucose uptake was not affected by PUL; however, C-INF significantly reduced glucose uptake compared with both SAL and PUL. Steady-state EGP increased by > 90 % from basal steady state during PUL but did not change during either SAL or C-INF. Thus, pulsatile FFA infusion led to an increase in EGP while preserving glucose disposal. These data suggest that the pattern of FFA may have a role in regulation of glucose homeostasis, which may have consequences in the obese or insulin-resistant state where the SNS is known to be altered...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether any naturally occurring amine can stimulate selectively b 3 -ARs. Since activation of lipo-lysis is a well-known b-adrenergic function, the efficacy and potency of various biogenic amines were compared with those of noradrenaline, isoprenaline, and b 3 -AR ago-nists 4 -(-{[2 -hydroxy-(3 -chlorophenyl) ethyl]-amino}pro-pyl) phenoxyacetate (BRL 37, 344) and (R,R) - 5 -(2 -{[2 -(3 -chlorophenyl) - 2 -hydroxyethyl]-amino}propyl) - 1, 3 -benzo-dioxole- 2, 2 -dicarboxylate (CL 316, 243) by testing their li-polytic action in white fat cells. Five mammalian species were studied: rat, hamster and dog, in which selective b 3 -AR agonists act as full lipolytic agents, and guinea-pigs and humans, in which b 3 -AR agonists are less potent acti-vators of lipolysis. Several biogenic amines were inefficient (e. g. dopam-ine, tyramine and b-phenylethylamine) while others (syn-ephrine, phenylethanolamine, epinine) were partially active in stimulating lipolysis in all species studied. Their actions were inhibited by all the b-AR antagonists tested, including those selective for b 1 - or b 2 -ARs. Octopamine was the only amine fully stimulating lipolysis in rat, hamster and dog fat cells, while inefficient in guinea-pig or human fat cells, like the b 3 -AR agonists. In rat white fat cells, b-AR antagonists inhibited the lipolytic effect of octopamine with a relative order of potency very similar to that observed against CL 316, 243.

The antianginal effects of once-daily isosorbide mononitrate IR-SR increased with increasing dosages, were generally larger than those of either placebo or equipotent doses of conventional ISMN/ISDN, and were somewhat larger than those of the beta blocker <b>bupranolol.</b> The effects were generally similar to those of sustained release nifedipine. 3. Patients showed significantly greater improvement in some quality-of-life indices with once-daily isosorbide mononitrate IR-SR than with twice or three times daily regimens of conventional ISMN/ISDN.

Objective: This study was designed to investigate the potential involvement of BKCa channel function in the response of human myometrium to beta(3) -adrenoceptor activation. Design: Single and whole-cell electrophysiological BKCa channel recordings from freshly dispersed myocytes were obtained in the presence and absence of BRL 37344, a specific beta(3) -adrenoreceptor agonist. The in vitro effects of BRL 37344 on isolated myometrial contractions, in the presence and absence of the specific BKCa channel blocker, iberiotoxin (IbTX), were investigated. Setting: The study was carried out at the Clinical Science Institute. Patients orOther Participants: Myometrial biopsies were obtained at elective cesarean delivery. Intervention: No intervention was applied. Main Outcome Measures: Open state probability of single channel recordings, whole cell currents, and myometrial contractile activity were measured. Results: Single-channel recordings identified the BKCa channel as a target of BRL 37344. BRL 37344 significantly increased the open state probability of this channel in a concentration-dependent manner (control 0. 031 +/- 0. 004; 50 mu M BRL 37344 0. 073 +/- 0. 005 (P < 0. 001); and 100 mu M BRL 37344 0. 101 +/- 0. 005 (P < 0. 001). This effect was completely blocked after preincubation of the cells with 1 mu M <b>bupranolol,</b> a nonspecific - adrenoreceptor blocker, or 100 nM SR 59230 a, a specific beta(3) - adrenoreceptor antagonist. In addition, BRL 37344 increased whole- cell currents over a range of membrane potentials, and this effect was reversed by 100 nM IbTX. In vitro isometric tension studies demonstrated that BRL 37344 exerted a significant concentrationdependent relaxant effect on human myometrial tissue (P < 0. 05), and preincubation of these strips with IbTX attenuated this effect on both spontaneous and oxytocin- induced contractions (44. 44 and 57. 84 % at 10 (- 5) M, respectively).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In protocol 1, SR 58611 was infused in normal dogs after placebo, after beta 1 /beta 2 blockade with nadolol, after beta 1 /beta 2 /beta 3 blockade with <b>bupranolol</b> and after combined autonomic blockade (CAB). In protocol 2, perinephritic hypertension was produced in dogs, which received SR 58611 at 3 and 6 weeks of hypertension. Effects of SR 58611 were evaluated at 7 weeks of hypertension after CAB. RESULTS: In normal dogs, SR 58611 produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean aortic pressure (AOP) (from 116 +/- 19 to 100 +/- 19 mmHg, - 14 %; P < 0. 05) that was accompanied by baroreflex activation (heart rate increased by 70 %; P < 0. 01). This hypotensive effect resulting from peripheral vasodilation persisted after nadolol or CAB while baroreflex activation was blunted or abolished. A biphasic response of cardiac output, characterized by a rise and a decline (P < 0. 05) reflected a reduction in after- and pre-load. After CAB, SR 58611 did not modify cardiac contractility. SR 58611 stimulated lipolysis as reflected by a 4 -fold increase in blood free fatty acids (FFA) (P < 0. 0005). Under CAB, the rise of FFA was reduced (P < 0. 01). In hypertensive dogs, SR 58611 produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean AOP (from 168 +/- 32 to 125 +/- 35 mmHg; - 26 %, P < 0. 0001), that was greater than in normal dogs (P < 0. 05). Reflex-mediated tachycardia also occurred but at higher blood pressure values. Blood FFA rose similarly (P < 0. 0001).

Dobutamine did not produce relaxation of the detrusors at concentrations that are selective for β 1 -AR.

ICI- 118, 551, a selective β 2 -AR antagonist, antagonized the isoprenaline-induced relaxation in rabbits (pA 2 9. 45) and rats (pA 2 9. 05), but not in dogs. <b>Bupranolol,</b> a non-selective β-AR antagonist, caused a rightward shift of the concentration-relaxation curve for isoprenaline in the rabbit (pA 2 9. 32) and rat (pA 2 8. 98).

The maximum chronotropic responses to isoprenaline, RO 363 and CGP 12177 A in RA were unaffected. Pertussis toxin treatment (10 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) restored the maximum inotropic response and sensitivity to isoprenaline (sham 3. 5 ± 0. 5 [*]mN, n= 9; MI 3. 2 ± 0. 6 [*]mN, n= 11, P= 0. 702) and CGP 12177 A (sham 1. 6 ± 0. 3 [*]mN, n= 6; MI 1. 9 ± 0. 4 [*]mN, n= 7, P= 0. 537) in MI animals to levels {{similar to those in}} the sham group. CGP 20712 A (pKB: LA 6. 7 ± 0. 2, n= 6; RA 7. 1 ± 0. 1, n= 4), ICI 118, 551 (pKB: LA 6. 4 ± 0. 1, n= 5; RA 6. 3 ± 0. 1, n= 6), propranolol (pKB: LA 6. 6 ± 0. 1, n= 5; RA 6. 8 ± 0. 1, n= 6) and <b>bupranolol</b> (pKB: LA 7. 2 ± 0. 1, n= 6; RA 7. 7 ± 0. 1, n= 8), showed moderate affinity for the putative β 4 -adrenoceptor. Desensitization after MI and resensitization (after pertussis toxin treatment) to isoprenaline and CGP 12177 A therefore occur in parallel, suggesting that the β 1 - and putative β 4 -adrenoceptor use the same signalling pathway. Antagonist affinity studies confirmed that drugs acting at β 1 -adrenoceptors also interact with putative β 4 -adrenoceptors with approximately 100 times lower affinity. We suggest that CGP 12177 A produces its cardiac effects by interacting with a low affinity state of the β 1 -adrenoceptor...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{the most}} common form of cardiac dysrhythmia in the world. According to the British Heart Foundation, about 1 million people in the UK are currently living with this condition and they are up to five times more likely to suffer a stroke than the rest of the population. Atrial fibrillation is the result of irregular spontaneous contractions of the atrial chambers of the heart separate to the contractions generated by the sino-atrial node activity. At a cellular level, pro-arrhythmogenic calcium handling has been observed upon the stimulation of atrial cells with the partial agonist CGP 12177 at a novel low affinity beta 1 -AR (beta 1 L-AR). The aim of this thesis is to characterise the relationship between the morphology of the left and right atrial myocytes and the initial calcium release sites, and alterations in calcium handling protein phosphorylation state during cardiomyocyte contraction. We study how this relates to atrial arrhythmias via spontaneous calcium release activity in quiescent rat atrial myocytes by stimulating the propranolol-insensitive beta 1 -ARs using CGP 12177. We aim to contribute towards understanding specific alterations at the cellular level in atrial myocytes during arrhythmias and heart failure (HF). Quiescent WKY rat left and right atrial cells were obtained from Langendorff perfusion of the whole heart and subsequent atrial cell isolation. Left atrial cells (13. 6 [plus or minus] 0. 3 urn) were wider on average compared to right atrial cells (9. 9 [plus or minus] 0. 25 um). Di- 8 ANEPPS stained cells confirmed networks of t-tubules in left atrial myocytes that facilitate t-tubular transportation of calcium during excitation contraction coupling. However no t-tubules were reported for right atrial myocytes presumably due to their narrower widths which are sufficient for calcium diffusion. Cardiac dysfunction results in cardiac proteins (sarco(endo) plasmic calcium ATP-ase (SERCA 2 a) protein, phospholamban (PLB) and ryanodine receptors (RyR 2) having abnormal expressions. Western blotting studies have demonstrated high abundance of PLB and a tendency for lower abundance of SERCA 2 a in hypertensive and volume overload HF tissues as a result of the increased the workload on the heart and prolonged calcium release from the calcium store. Phosphorylated proteins of PLB in hypertensive tissues have lower population of beta-ARs and hence there is a reduction in the stimulation of these receptors in the heart. On the other hand, a deterioration of RyR 2 of the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to a reduced amount of calcium being stored in the calcium store and consequently contributes to a contractile deficit. This may eventually result in arrhythmias, commonly observed in people with HF. A pharmacological study of spontaneous calcium release (calcium sparks, wavelets and waves) using a series of cardioactive agents suggests pathways of pro-arrhythmogenic calcium release via the low affinity beta 1 -ARs. In particular, CGP 12177 stimulating the ß 1 L-ARs of quiescent rat atrial myocytes has revealed that there may be a pro-arrhythmogenic pool of calcium in these atrial cells and a beta-blocker such as <b>bupranolol</b> may be efficient in supressing such stimulation as a therapeutic solution...|$|E
