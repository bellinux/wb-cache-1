40|$|The {{flow field}} in {{two-phase}} boiling and gas-liquid Stirred Tank Reactors, STR, was examined {{in relation to}} cavity formation and the associated Relative Power Demand, RPD. The cavitation process has been classified in various stages for both radial and axial impellers operating in boiling water. Experiments done in a <b>boiling</b> <b>reactor</b> of 0. 45 m diameter agitated by radial and axial impellers showed that the Relative Power Demand, RPD, can be correlated well {{with the help of}} a new formulation of Cavitation number named the Cavagitation number. Differences in RPD between gas-sparged and boiling reactors detected during the experiments imply that there are differences in the mechanism of cavity formation in the two systems. These differences are explained by a consistent physical model. The model was shown to be adequate for most of the features of both boiling and sparged reactors reported in the literature. The flow field in a two-phase <b>boiling</b> <b>reactor</b> has been investigated for the first time in the open literature using Laser Doppler Velocimetry, LDV, in conditions where the RPD was as low as 0. 55. Measurements gave important data of the way the flow field is changed by the presence of the second phase which forms stable cavities behind impeller blades. The results also quantified the associated flow field changes in the impeller discharge stream and in the bulk of the reactor. The two-phase flow field was quantitatively described {{with the help of a}} simple model derived on the basis of energy balances calculated around the impeller. The model estimates liquid flow rates and mean liquid velocities in the two-phase system using data of the corresponding single-phase system coupled with information about the RPD. Knowledge of the void fraction seems to improve the model predictions which were shown to be in fairly good agreement with the data of mean flow rates that exist in the literature. LDV measurements done in a boiling stirred tank of 0. 45 m diameter showed that flow rates can be predicted within an accuracy of around 10 % and mean liquid velocities with an accuracy better than 25 %, even without taking into account void fraction. Model predictions can be used as input values for numerical codes available for the calculation of flows in two-phase stirred tank reactors.

40|$|The {{formulation}} of an adequate description of neutron {{populations in the}} presence of boiling moderator or coolant is attempted. Starting from a framework of comprehensive stochastic descriptions we concentrate on the special requirements of the boiling system {{such as the use of}} transport theory and the retention of heterogeneity in our model. Working equations are derived which show how adequate corrections for boiling can be made to the approximate models currently used. The detailed distribution of bubbles in a boiling system should be accounted for in accurate evaluations of criticality, especially where the bubbles are large. Evaluations of leakage, resonance escape probability and thermal absorption are modified by the detailed bubble distribution. Explicit corrections are given for simple examples, while inclusion of the effects into a practical criticality code, such as WIMS, is discussed. The second moments of the neutron population {{in the presence of}} boiling media are also described. The power spectral density arising from the fission process is evaluated, showing how this spectrum is affected by the boiling. Usually more important sources of neutron noise in a <b>boiling</b> <b>reactor</b> are the fluctuations in cross-sections and collision probabilities arising directly from random local void ages. This 'bubble noise' is evaluated with particular emphasis on the detection of onset of boiling in a channel or change in boiling regime. The use of Monte Carlo techniques in calculating neutron transport in boiling media is discussed in some detail. The applicability of the analyses of neutron means and variances to fast reactor situations is considered. The bulk of the work treats critical reactors. However, a treatment of transients and feedback effects is also included. A new analysis is suggested whereby means and variances throughout the transient can be evaluated without extreme difficulty. The concepts of stochastic stability are discussed...|$|E

This work extends the FIBOR concept to aqueous mixtures of ethylene glycol to explore if the FIBOR is capable of promoting steam reforming chemistry. The results show that the FIBOR has the potential to support both catalytic and thermal decomposition of aqueous ethylene glycol mixtures. Diluting ethylene glycol with water decreases the reaction of ethylene glycol but it also reduces the effects of carbon deposition or "coking. " Peak product yields for thermal decomposition of pure ethylene glycol and aqueous mixtures of 90 % (vol) and 80 % (vol) ethylene glycol reached 4. 5, 1. 8 and 0. 8 LPM/min[MIDDLE DOT]m 2 respectively at an operating temperature of 1475 K. Results for platinum and nickel based coatings converting an 80 % (vol) ethylene glycol aqueous mixture achieved product yields approximately 3 - 4 times higher than the case for a bare tube, however platinum showed slightly better overall performance with respect to product yields and resistance to deactivation. Thermochemical and gas chromatography analysis revealed the FIBOR's capability to convert organic aqueous mixtures through steam reforming. An upward shift in the boiling curve for the catalyst coated tubes was determined to be due to the endothermic nature of the chemical mechanism. Conversion of aqueous mixtures with a bare tube produced synthesis gas (syngas) with a lower ratio of H 2 :CO (1 : 1) compared to catalytic conversion which resulted in a significant enrichment of syngas products with hydrogen (H 2 :CO= 3). This difference is attributed to the FIBOR's ability to promote steam reforming of ethylene glycol...|$|E

The fully ribbed {{and rigid}} Mark III loading of EBR-I {{was found to}} be govenned by {{feedback}} processes which guarantee safe and stable operation under normal operating conditions and to give a large radial contribution to the power coefficient. Nonlinearities in the power coefficient were investigated and found to be no problem. If the stabilizing ribs are removed from the fuel rode, a strong positive effect appears which is associated with the inward bowing of fuel rods. The prompt positive coefficient obseved in Mark II is discussed from the standpoint of Mark III tests. A 800 -Mwh irradiation run was made on a number of samples, and some bric cladding failures are reported. Data are given for the dimensional changes in EBR-I, Mark III fuel rods used for a total of 2, 682 Mwh operating time; the fuel rods usually increased in diameter and decreased in length, and some bowing was obseved. The growth and temperature profiles of the fuel rode are compared, and the effects of radial restraint on the rod growth are discussed. The EBR-I, Mark FV core design is then discussed. The fuel rod will incorporate four plutonium- 10 at. % aluminum fuel slugs with two depleted uranium blanket slugs. Calculations were made on the critical mass of Mark IV, which is shown to be 28. 3 kg of total plutonium. Zero-power Reactor III (ZPR-III). A mockup of EBR-II was studied in ZPR-III, and the wonth of the mockup control rods was evaluated with tantalum and B/sub 4 / C followers. An EBR-II B/sub 4 /C oscillator rod experiment was made in which the excess reactivity was measured {{as a function of the}} angular position of the oscillator. The worths of sodium, aluminum, and stainless steel were mapped throughout the core and blanket. From substitution experiments, there appears to be some spectral differences at the center of the clean cores, depending on whether the core is filled with sodium or aluminum. A two-dimensional mapping of the worth of U/sup 235 / and U/sup 238 / was also performed, and their fission rates were determined. Since the EBR-II shields and thimble holes have been redesigned, new mockups were made and their counter responses studied. Transient Reactor Test Facil 1 ty. The equipment and procedures used to obtain constant power or flat top pulse burats for transient testing of fuel elements are described. The poison sections of the control rode were modified by mixing epoxy resin with graded boron carbide to prevent poison movement. The radiation effects of pulsed bursts on pressure transducers were studied, and it was found that the extraneous pressure signal following the instantaneous power, but not that following the integrated power, can be eliminated. <b>Boiling</b> <b>Reactor</b> Experiment V (Borax V).
