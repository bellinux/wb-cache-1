40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} cleaning process of fresh market tomatoes DÃ©bora {{in relation to}} the efficiency cleaning and fruit quality. First, the efficiency cleaning was carried, with rubber spheres, changing the types of bristles (nylon, sisal fiber, PET and coconut fiber) as well as the rotation (40, 80, 120 and 160 rpm) of rotary brushes. Afterwards, with the best results, the studies were carried out with fresh market tomatoes to evaluate cleaning efficiency and fruit quality measured by weight loss (%), respiratory activity (CO 2) and ethylene evolution. In the first case, the nylon and sisal fiber were more efficient at higher rotations. PET bristles at 40 rpm rotation were inefficient, presenting a cleaning index (CI) lower than 50 %. The nylon <b>brush</b> <b>treatment</b> at 120 rpm was the most efficient cleaning process (CI= 91 %). However, nylon brushes at 160 rpm treatment showed the lowest CI (88 %). These results were probably associated to the fact that, at higher speeds, fruits tended to jump, causing a poor contact between bristles and fruits. The lowest CI was observed on coconut fiber at 80 and 120 rpm treatments. In general, cleaned fruits with nylon and sisal fiber at 120 rpm demonstrated higher post-harvest quality alterations when compared to cleaned fruits in these brushes at 160 rpm. More bristles flexibility provides better contact fruit/bristles increasing cleaning efficiency, however, it can cause changes on post-harvest fruit quality, but no significant...|$|E

For a drug to be delivered passively via the skin it needs to have a suitable lipophilicity and a molecular weight 500 Da. In contrast active methods, normally involving physical or mechanical methods of enhancing delivery {{have been shown to be}} generally superior. The delivery of drugs of differing lipophilicity and molecular weight including proteins, peptides, and oligonucletides has been shown to be improved by active methods such as iontophoresis, electroporation, mechanical perturbation, and other energy-related techniques such as ultrasound and needless injection. This chapter details one practical example of an active skin abrasion device to demonstrate the success of such active methods. The enhanced in vitro permeation of acyclovir through human epidermal membrane using a rotating brush abrasion device was compared to acyclovir delivery using iontophoresis. It was found that application of <b>brush</b> <b>treatment</b> for 10 seconds at a pressure of 300 Nm- 2 was comparable to 10 minutes of iontophoresis. The observed enhancement of permeability observed using the rotating brush was as a result of disruption of the cells of the stratum corneum causing a reduction of the barrier function of the skin. However, for these novel delivery methods to succeed and compete with those already on the market, the prime issues that require consideration include device design and safety, efficacy, ease of handling, and cost-effectiveness.

A systematic comparison of different sized graphite and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as carbon precursors of SiC nanofibers revealed Ni catalyst concentration significantly affected the quality of growth. The size of the carbon precursor affected the kinetics and diffusion, which effect the SiC nanofiber growth as observed in electron microscopy. Allylamine plasma surface treated MWNTs and SiC nanofibers enhanced dispersion and interfacial adhesion in an epoxy matrix. All composite samples without plasma treatment lowered in tensile strength, but after plasma treatment all samples increased the tensile strength by 40 %. Nanomaterial settling and aggregation were observed with composites using untreated samples and was believed to negatively affect the mechanical properties.

Landsat 7 satellite imagery {{was used to}} classify land use, and the 1 : 24, 000 scale digital elevation model (DEM) was used to delineate watershed boundaries and subbasins. SWAT was calibrated to measured stream gauge flow and reservoir storage. Brush removal was simulated by converting all heavy and moderate categories of brush (except oak) to open range (native grass). Simulated changes in water yield due to <b>brush</b> <b>treatment</b> varied by subbasin, with all subbasins showing increased water yield as a result of removing brush. Average annual water yield increases ranged from about 111, 000 gallons per treated acre in the Fort Phantom Hill watershed to about 178, 000 gallons per treated acre in the Palo Pinto watershed. Water yield increases per treated acre were similar to a previous study (COE, 2002), but higher than TAES (2000). As in previous studies, there was a strong, positive correlation between water yield increase and precipitation. BACKGROUND Increases in brush area and density may contribute to a decrease in water yield, possibly due to increased evapotranspiration (ET) on watersheds with brush as compared to those with grass (Thurow, 1998; Dugas et al., 1998). Previous modeling studies of watersheds in Texas (Upper Colorado River Authority, 1998; TAES, 2000) indicated that removing brush might result in a significant increase in water yield. During the 2000 - 2001 legislative session, the Texas Legislature appropriated funds to study the effects of brush removal on water yield in watersheds above Lake Arrowhead, Lake Brownwood, Lake Fort Phantom Hill, and Lake Palo Pinto (Figure 1 - 1).

This study has four objectives: (1) Evaluate the economic effectiveness of using prescribed extreme burns as a rangeland restoration tool compared to other rangeland restoration strategies. (2) Provide economic research results that will facilitate {{a review of the}} technical standards, specification, and potential policy changes by the NRCS with respect to the use of prescribed extreme burning. (3) Assess economic effects of extreme fire when used in combination with other treatment practices over a 20 year planning horizon. (4) Through modeling, forecasting, and simulation assess the risk {{associated with the use of}} extreme prescribed fire, with respect to weather (rainfall) conditions. The research covers four contiguous counties in each of three eco-regions in Texas: Rolling Plains, Edwards Plateau, and the South Texas Plains. Focus group meetings with landowners and NRCS/Extension personnel were held in each region to obtain preliminary information including common rangeland uses, most problematic invasive brush species, and the most commonly used treatment methods and associated costs. The primary invasive species in each region include: Rolling Plains ? Prickly Pear (Opuntia phaecantha); Edwards Plateau ? Redberry and Ashe Juniper (Juniperus ashei Buchh. And J. pinchotii Sudw., respectively); South Texas Plains ? Huisache (Acacia smallii Isely). Mesquite (Prosopis glandulsa Torr.) was identified as a common invasive brush species across all three regions. When extreme fire was compared to the most commonly used invasive brush treatments, assuming the treatment was instituted in year one, it was economically superior in all cases and feasible (Net Present Value > 0 and Benefit/Cost Ratio > 1) in all but two cases. The inclusion of forecasted rainfall figures with the combination of using the most commonly used <b>brush</b> <b>treatment</b> with extreme fire proved to substantially reduce the risk of instituting the treatment regimes.

The specimens were divided into seven groups and subjected to a daily cycling regimen with <b>brushing</b> <b>treatments,</b> demineralization and remineralization in artificial saliva. The surface microhardness (SMH) was calculated from the mean values obtained from six indentations (Vickers hardness number (VHN)) on the enamel surface at baseline and after 12 days. pH of the dentifrices was determined in a slurry with deionized water (1 : 3).

Alternative {{forms of}} mechano-stimulation {{were applied to}} seedlings in effort to obtain uniform growth reduction compared with undisturbed controls in both greenhouse and controlled growth environments. Arabidopsis grown under low photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) artificial light grew upright with limited leaf expansion, which enhanced mechano-responsiveness {{compared to that of}} rosette-growing plants under filtered sunlight or high PPF artificial light. Hypocotyls of seedlings grown at PPFs > 60 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 elongated less and had 6 % less sensitivity to mechanical stress than seedlings grown at PPFs < 60 micromoles m- 2 s- 1. Fluorescent lamps alone (F) or fluorescent plus incandescent (F+I) lamps were compared for seedling responses to mechanical stress. Under F lighting, hypocotyl elongation was reduced 25 % to 40 % by twice-daily <b>brush</b> or plate <b>treatments,</b> and <b>brushed</b> seedlings exhibited more growth reduction than did plate treatments. Seedlings grown under F+I lamps exhibited similar stress-induced growth reduction compared to seedlings grown under F only, but stressed F+I seedlings lodged to a greater extent due to excessive hypocotyl elongation. Temperature-response studies using standardized F-only lighting indicated increased hypocotyl elongation but decreased leaf expansion, and decreased mechano-responsivity to brushing over the temperature range from 20 to 28 degrees C. Daylength studies indicated similar degrees of mechano-inhibition of hypocotyl elongation over the daylength range of 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours, whereas fresh weight of stressed seedling shoots declined compared to controls.

40|$|Rangelands {{are a major}} type of land {{found on}} all continents. Though they {{comprise}} around 70 % of the world's land area, knowledge of rangelands is limited and immature. Rangelands supply humans with food and fiber at very low energy costs compared to cultivated lands. They are inherently heterogeneous, highly variable in time and space. Rangeland management needs to consider the impacts of long-term vegetation transition. It needs a conceptual framework defining potential vegetation communities, describing the management induced transition of one vegetation community to another, and documenting the expected benefits provided by the various potential vegetation communities. The most widely used conceptual unit in the rangeland discipline is the "ecological site". Ecological sites {{can be an effective}} unit that should respond to management consistently and can help managers understand the site's potential to meet human needs. A state and transition model (STM) brings ecological sites and their potential vegetative states together to build a conceptual framework showing the major causes of transitions between states of an ecological site and thus helping make adaptive management decisions. Within the STM {{there is a need for}} an indicator of ecosystem health. Ecosystem services can be important to evaluate alternative states. Ecosystem services do not pass through a market for valuation, though often the cost would be very high if, through mismanagement, the ecosystem is no longer capable of providing those services. Vegetation communities are constantly facing reversible or irreversible transitions triggered by natural events and/or management actions. The framework generated in this study is significant in using remote sensing to generate state and transition models for a large area and in using ecosystem services to evaluate natural and/or management induced transitions as described in the STM. This dissertation addresses the improvement of public rangelands management in the West. It applies geospatial technologies to map ecological sites and states on those sites, characterizes transitions between states and selects a desired state to manage towards based on a systematic assessment of the value of flows of environmental services. The results from this study are an evaluation of improved draft ecological site maps for a larger area using remote sensing images, a simplified state-and-transition model adapted to remote sensing capabilities to study transitions due to climatic events and management practices, and a constrained optimization model that incorporates ecosystem services and the simplified STM to evaluate management costs and conservation benefits. The study showed that <b>brush</b> <b>treatment</b> is the most effective management practice to cause state transitions. The highest increase in the high cover state was by 24 %.

Brushing with toothpaste, with or without fluoride gave no additional effect other than leaving a fluffy-grainy material on the surface. A very obvious modulating effect of brushing on etched enamel was observed. After brushing with fluoride paste individual crystals tended to be more obvious compared to brushing without paste and brushing with nonfluoridated paste, but the sample size is not large enough to conclude any further with regards to this subject. On the molars it was observed a coating over the enamel. It varied in thickness, but was generally in the order of about 10 - 40 Î¼m. The nature of the coating observed on molars is not clear, but it is suggested that it may in part be of an odontogenic origin...|$|R
40|$|Recurrent aphthous {{stomatitis}} (RAS) is {{a painful}} condition, often leading to impairment {{of the basic}} functions such as mastication, speech, and <b>brushing.</b> Several <b>treatment</b> modalities have been advocated in the past, but none hasve been proven efficacious. A novel treatment modality {{in the form of}} low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has evolved in recent years. LLLT also known as "cold laser" works on the principle of biostimulation. This biomodulatory effect plays a pivotal role in accelerating the healing process and provides analgesia. Hence, it constitutes an alternative to processes that present pain and inflammatory reaction. The present series of cases throw light regarding the use of diode laser for LLLT as an effective and quick tool in the painless management of recurrent aphthous ulcers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: Mechanical {{perturbation}} {{is known}} to inhibit elongation of the inflorescence stem of Arabidopsis thaliana. The phenomenon has been reported widely for both herbaceous and woody plants, and has implications for how plants adjust their size and form to survive in mechanically perturbed environments. While this response is {{an important aspect of}} the plant's architecture, little is known about how mechanical properties of the inflorescence stem are modified or how its primary and secondary tissues respond to mechanical perturbation. Methods: Plants of the Columbia- 0 ecotype were exposed to controlled <b>brushing</b> <b>treatments</b> and then submitted to three-point bending tests to determine stem rigidity and stiffness. Contributions of different tissues to the inflorescence stem geometry were analysed. Key Results: Perturbed plants showed little difference in stem diameter, were 50 % shorter, 75 % less rigid and 70 % less stiff than controls. Changes in mechanical properties were linked to significant changes in tissue geometry â size and position of the pith, lignified interfascicular tissue and cortex â as well as a reduction in density of lignified cells. Stem mechanical properties were modified by changes in primary tissues and thus differ from changes observed in most woody plants tested with indeterminate growth â even though a vascular cambium is present in the inflorescence axis. Conclusions: The study suggests that delayed development of key primary developmental features of the stem in this ecotype of Arabidopsis results in a âshort and flexible' rather than a âshort and rigid' strategy for maintaining upright axes in conditions of severe mechanical perturbation. The mechanism is comparable with more general phenomena in plants where changes in developmental rate can significantly affect the overall growth form of the plant in both ecological and evolutionary context...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims This study aims to {{determine}} the role that both direct effects of fire and subsequent daily temperature fluctuations play in the seed bank dynamics of obligate seeders from the Mediterranean Basin. The short yet high soil temperatures experienced due to passage of fire are conflated with the lower, but longer, temperatures experienced by daily fluctuations which occur after removing vegetation. These germination cues are able to break seed dormancy, {{but it is difficult}} to assess their specific level of influence because they occur consecutively after summer fires, just before the flush of germination in the wet season (autumn). Methods By applying experimental fires, seed treatments were imposed that combined fire exposure/non-fire exposure with exposure to microhabitats under a gradient of disturbance (i. e. gaps opened by fire, mechanical brushing and intact vegetation). The seeds used were representative of the main families of obligate seeders (Ulex parviflorus, Cistus albidus and Rosmarinus officinalis). Specifically, an assessment was made of (1) the proportion of seeds killed by fire, (2) seedling emergence under field conditions and (3) seeds which remained ungerminated in soil. Key Results For the three species studied, the factors that most influenced seedling emergence and seeds remaining ungerminated were microhabitats with higher temperature fluctuations after fire (gaps opened by fire and <b>brushing</b> <b>treatments).</b> The direct effect of fire decreased the seedling emergence of U. parviflorus and reduced the proportion of seeds of R. officinalis remaining ungerminated. Conclusions The relevance of depleting vegetation (and subsequent daily temperature fluctuation in summer) suggests that studies focusing on lower temperature thresholds for breaking seed dormancy are required. This fact also supports the hypothesis that the seeding capacity in Mediterranean Basin obligate seeders may have evolved as a response to a wide range of disturbances, and not exclusively to fire.

40|$|In {{ecosystems}} {{with alternative}} stable states, restoration {{success can be}} thought of as overcoming the resilience of an undesirable state to promote an alternative state that yields greater ecosystem services. Since greater resilience of undesirable states translates into reduced restoration potential, quantifying differences in resilience can enhance restoration planning. In the context of shrub- encroached rangeland restoration, shrubland resilience is the capacity of a woody vegetated state to absorb management interventions designed to produce a more desirable grass- dominated state, and remain within its current regime. Therefore, differences in the resilience of a state can be quantifi ed in a relative sense by measuring whether a state switches to an alternate state following perturbation or remains in its current stability domain. Here we designed an experimental manipulation to assess the contribution of soils to differences in the relative resilience of a shrub- invaded state. In this large- scale experiment, we repeated perturbations across a gradient of soil textures to inform restoration practitioners of differences in the relative resilience of shrubland occurring on different soil types to common rangeland restoration practices. On each soil type, we compared the relative ability of the shrubland state to withstand chemical and mechanical <b>brush</b> control <b>treatments,</b> commonly employed in this study region, to untreated controls. While the shrubland community composition did not differ prior to the study, its capacity to absorb and recover from <b>brush</b> removal <b>treatments</b> depended on soil type. Shrubland resilience to chemical and mechanical brush removal was highest on coarse soils. On these soils, brush removal temporarily restored grassland dominance, but woody plants quickly regained pretreatment levels of dominance. However, shrublands on fi ne soils did not recover following treatments, continuing to be grass- dominated for the duration of the study. This study highlights a simple approach for prioritizing restoration actions by mapping the locations of different soil attributes that support shrub- dominated states with differing levels of resilience to brush control. This experimental approach provides a basis for operationalizing resilience in restoration and prioritizing management actions across a range of environmental conditions, which is critical given the economic constraints associated with broad- scale mechanical and chemical interventions for rangeland restoration...|$|R

40|$|Whitebark pine is an {{important}} reforestation species in the northern Rocky Mountains for enhancement of wildlife habitat. Production of container-grown whitebark pine seedlings at the USDA Forest Service Nursery in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho has been increasing the past several years. Diseases continue to be {{an important}} limiting factor in seedling production. Recent evaluations implicated Fusarium solani and F. proliferatum as important pathogens of young germinants and seedlings. Both fungal species commonly contaminated whitebark pine seed prior to sowing. Pathogen spread during stratification resulted in very high levels of seed contamination. Fusarium spp. adversely affected seed germination as well as initiated high seedling disease levels. Not all seedlots were equally affected by diseases, even though most seeds were contaminated. Seedling vigor, probably related to seed germinative energy, may have been an important factor affecting disease severity. Efforts to reduce contamination by mechanical <b>brushing</b> or <b>treatments</b> with hydrogen peroxide or bleach solutions were ineffective. Seed-borne inoculum is important in disease epidemiology. Improved techniques to reduce level of pathogen contamination and spread during seed processing are required...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} five <b>brush</b> management <b>treatments</b> using the herbicides tebuthiuron and triclopyr, with or without prescribed burning, on the gastrointestinal helminths of white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations on the Cross Timbers Experimental Range in Payne County, Oklahoma. We recovered three helminth species (Syphacia peromysci, Nippostrongylus muris, and one unidentified species of Trichuris) in 99 white-footed mice collected in March and June 1986. Overall prevalence of infection for S. peromysci (61. 6 %) and N. muris (14. 2 %) was not significantly influenced by month of collection. Prevalence of N. muris infection was significantly greater on untreated control pastures (40. 0 %) than those subjected to brush removal (7. 6 %). Prevalence of N. muris infections was greater on untreated pastures (40 %) than on those treated with herbicide (7. 6 %). Mean abundances for S. peromysci were significantly greater on pastures receiving tebuthiuron than triclopyr treatments. Type of herbicide applied could have influenced S. peromysci populations indirectly by altering feeding and habitat use patterns of white-footed mice. Microclimate changes resulting from herbicide applications probably influenced the survival of eggs and infective larvae of N. muris...|$|R
40|$|Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) cv. âFeng xiang â {{was treated}} with hot water rinsing and {{brushing}} (HWRB) at 20 C (control), 55 C (HWRB- 55), 60 C (HWRB- 60) and 65 C (HWRB- 65) for 20 s. The effect of these heat treatments on fruit decay and quality was investigated after either ambient temperature storage (20 C) for 3 days or cold storage (0 C) for 12 days. Results showed that HWRB treatments could significantly reduce the epiphytic microbial population on fruit surface, decay development and weight loss. Fruits treated with HWRB- 65 had the lowest decay incidence and decay index, but about 60 % of the treated fruits showed heat damage and became commercially unacceptable. Fruits treated with HWRB- 60 showed less decay than the control fruits, and cold storage could enhance the effect of HWRB treatments. There were no negative effects of HWRB- 60 on fruit surface color, firmness, soluble solids content and titratable acidity.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of woody vegetation management using herbicide and fire on condition and diet quality of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the cross timbers of central Oklahoma. Condition of deer was assessed seasonally (1987 - 1989) on an area containing a mosaic of habitat types created by various <b>brush</b> removal <b>treatments</b> and on a control area not exposed to any such treatments. Five treatments were used on the Cross Timbers Experimental Range (CTER) : tebuthiuron, tebuthiuron with an annual spring burn, triclopyr, triclopyr with an annual spring burn, and untreated habitat. Deer carcass weights were significantly higher on the CTER than on untreated areas; no differences were detected in any morphological or reproductive parameters examined. Concentrations of nitrogen in postmortem feces and rumen digesta of animals collected in spring were higher on untreated control than CTER study areas. Concentrations of nitrogen and acid detergent fiber in feces differed significantly among seasons and study areas, reflecting higher-quality diets on the CTER than on untreated control areas. Differences among study areas were also noted for concentrations of insoluble and soluble nitrogen in feces. Variable herbicide patterning positively influenced the quality of diets available to white-tailed deer, but had minimal influence on physical condition...|$|R
50|$|Brushing {{preservatives}} is a long-practised {{method and}} {{often used in}} today's carpentry workshops. Technological developments mean {{it is also possible}} to spray preservative over the surface of the timber. Some of the liquid is drawn into the wood as the result of capillary action before the spray runs off or evaporates, but unless puddling occurs penetration is limited and may not be suitable for long-term weathering. By using the spray method, coal-tar creosote, oil-borne solutions and water-borne salts (to some extent) can also be applied. A thorough <b>brush</b> or spray <b>treatment</b> with coal-tar creosote can add 1 to 3 years to the lifespan of poles or posts. Two or more coats provide better protection than one, but the successive coats should not be applied until the prior coat has dried or soaked into the wood.
