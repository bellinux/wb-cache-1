30|$|Language is {{a system}} of {{arbitrary}} symbols for human beings’ communication (Knight, 1992). English being the official language occupies an important position in Pakistan (Khushi & Talaat, 2011). This is also the language of teacher education in Pakistan (Rahman, 2006). A language has four basic skills: reading, writing, listening and speaking. Learning a language needs to learn these four <b>basic</b> <b>skills.</b> <b>Learning</b> in Pakistani universities is assessment driven (Ali et al. 2009). Instead of assessing four basic skills only writing skills are assessed {{in the public sector}} educational institutions including universities in Pakistan (Alam, 2012; Coleman, 2010). The assessment of writing skills alone gives high grades and students work hard for mastery in writing excellent pieces. English Speaking Skills (ESS) have rarely been assessed. That is why students do not pay attention to English speaking skills. Consequently, the level of English speaking proficiency is very low in outgoing graduates of higher education in Pakistan (Alam, 2012; Bilal et al. 2013; Coleman, 2010; Shahzad et al. 2011). Not to talk about the weak students even bright students who get high scores in written examinations are unable to speak English language properly (Bilal et al., 2013; Karim, 2012). Speaking skills empower human to create new ways of speaking to others about any topic or experience (Honig, 2007; Huang, 2012; Wu, 2012). To speak fluently, correctly with proper intonation and pronunciation especially in the second or foreign language adds to credit of the speaker (Lindblad, 20112011). The excellence {{in the use of the}} ability to speak in second language makes the speaker a skilful communicator (Sarwar et al. 2012). Effective Communication skill is one of the standards for the teachers in many countries of world (Aslam, 2011; Cammarata, 2010; Government-of-Pakistan, 2009).|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{recognised}} {{that one}} of the major difficulties in performing laparoscopic surgery is the translation of two-dimensional video image information to a three-dimensional working area. However, research has tended to ignore the gaze and eye-hand coordination strategies employed by laparoscopic surgeons as they attempt to overcome these perceptual constraints. This study sought to examine if measures related to tool movements, gaze strategy, and eye-hand coordination (the quiet eye) differentiate between experienced and novice operators performing a two-handed manoeuvres task on a virtual reality laparoscopic surgical simulator (LAP Mentor™). Methods: Twenty-five right-handed surgeons were categorised as being either experienced (having led more than 60 laparoscopic procedures) or novice (having performed fewer than 10 procedures) operators. The 10 experienced and 15 novice surgeons completed the "two-hand manoeuvres" task from the LAP Mentor <b>basic</b> <b>skills</b> <b>learning</b> environment while wearing a gaze registration system. Performance, movement, gaze, and eye-hand coordination parameters were recorded and compared between groups. Results: The experienced surgeons completed the task significantly more quickly than the novices, used significantly fewer movements, and displayed shorter tool paths. Gaze analyses revealed that experienced surgeons spent significantly more time fixating the target locations than novices, who split their time between focusing on the targets and tracking the tools. A more detailed analysis of a difficult subcomponent of the task revealed that experienced operators used a significantly longer aiming fixation (the quiet eye period) to guide precision grasping movements and hence needed fewer grasp attempts. Conclusion: The findings of the study provide further support for the utility of examining strategic gaze behaviour and eye-hand coordination measures to help further our understanding of how experienced surgeons attempt to overcome the perceptual difficulties inherent in the laparoscopic environment. © 2011 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 21 Feb 201...|$|E

40|$|Deep {{reinforcement}} learning has greatly improved {{the performance of}} learning agent by combining the strong generalization and extraction ability of deep learning models with the bootstrapping nature of {{reinforcement learning}}. Many works have achieved unprecedented results, especially on discrete action control tasks. However, much less {{work has been done}} to deal with robotic control in a continuous action space. All single-thread based algorithms in this domain can only control the robot to solve basic tasks, and only one task at a time. This thesis aims to make up for these limitations. We first proposed a novel deep reinforcement learning network architecture that can reduce the number of parameters needed for <b>learning</b> a single <b>basic</b> <b>skill</b> in a continuous action space by more than 70 %. We then proposed a novel multi-task deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn multiple basic tasks simultaneously. It makes use of the proposed network architecture {{to reduce the number of}} parameters needed for learning multiple tasks by more than 80 %. Finally, we proposed a novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning algorithm which consists of two levels of hierarchy. It adapted the proposed multi-task learning algorithm in its first level of hierarchy to <b>learn</b> multiple <b>basic</b> <b>skills</b> and then <b>learn</b> to reuse these skills in its second level of hierarchy to solve compound tasks. We conducted several sets of experiments to test both the proposed network architecture and the algorithms with a simulated Pioneer 3 AT robot in Gazebo 2 in a ROS Indigo environment. Results show that agents built with the proposed network architecture can <b>learn</b> <b>skills</b> that are as good as the ones learned by agents built with traditional convolutional neural networks. Also, all <b>basic</b> <b>skills</b> <b>learned</b> by the proposed multi-task learning algorithm achieve comparable performance to the <b>skills</b> <b>learned</b> independently by single-task learning algorithm. Results also show that the proposed hierarchical learning algorithm can learn both high performance <b>basic</b> <b>skills</b> and compound skills within the same learning process. The performance of the proposed algorithm on solving compound tasks has outperforms both a state-of-the-art single-thread based continuous action control algorithm and a well-known discrete action control algorithm...|$|R

Nevertheless, medical graduates’ performance of <b>basic</b> <b>skills</b> is often below the expected level. This review aims to identify and summarize teaching approaches of <b>basic</b> practical <b>skills</b> in undergraduate medical education which provide evidence with respect to effective students’ <b>learning</b> of these <b>skills.</b> Methods: <b>Basic</b> practical <b>skills</b> were defined as <b>basic</b> physical examination <b>skills,</b> routine skills which get better with practice, and skills which are also performed by nurses. We searched PubMed with different terms describing these <b>basic</b> practical <b>skills.</b> In total, 3467 identified publications were screened and 205 articles were eventually reviewed for eligibility. Results: 43 studies that included at least one <b>basic</b> practical <b>skill,</b> a comparison of two groups of undergraduate medical students and effects on students’ performance were analyzed. Seven <b>basic</b> practical <b>skills</b> and 15 different teaching methods could be identified. The most consistent results with respect to effective teaching and acquisition of <b>basic</b> practical <b>skills</b> were found for structured skills training, feedback, and self-directed learning.
