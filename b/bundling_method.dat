40|$|Dynamic graphs are {{increasingly}} pervasive in modern information systems. However, understanding how a graph changes in time is difficult. We present here two techniques for simplified visualization of dynamic graphs using edge bundles. The first technique uses a recent image-based graph <b>bundling</b> <b>method</b> to create smoothly changing bundles from streaming graphs. The second technique incorporates additional edge-correspondence data and is thereby suited to visualize discrete graph sequences. We illustrate our methods with examples from real-world large dynamic graph datasets. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{class of}} proximal minimization algorithms in which the objective function of the underlying convex program is approximated by cutting planes. This class includes algorithms such as cutting plane, cutting plane with line search and <b>bundle</b> <b>methods.</b> Among these algorithms, the <b>bundle</b> <b>methods</b> {{can be viewed as}} a quadratic counterpart of the cutting plane algorithm with line search, for they both attempt to decrease the true objective function at every iteration. On the other hand, the cutting plane algorithm does not explicitly and/or directly attempt to decrease the true objective function. However, it relies on the monotonicity of the approximating function to guarantee convergence to an optimal solution. This prompts the question of whether there exists a quadratic counterpart for the cutting plane algorithm.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} <b>bundle</b> <b>method</b> for {{minimizing}} nonsmooth convex functions that combines both {{the level and}} the proximal stabilizations. Most bundle algorithms use a cutting-plane model of the objective function to formulate a subproblem whose solution gives the next iterate. Proximal <b>bundle</b> <b>methods</b> employ the model in the objective function of the subproblem, while level methods put the model in the subproblem’s constraints. The proposed algorithm defines new iterates by solving a subproblem that employs the model in both the objective function and in the constraints. One advantage {{when compared to the}} proximal approach is that the level set constraint provides a certain Lagrange multiplier, which is used to update the proximal parameter in a novel manner. We also show {{that in the case of}} inexact function and subgradient evaluations, no additional procedure needs to be performed by our variant to deal with inexactness (as opposed to the proximal <b>bundle</b> <b>methods</b> that require special modifications). Numerical experiments on almost one thousand instances of different types of problems are presented.

40|$|Graphs {{are often}} used to {{encapsulate}} relationships between objects. Node-link diagrams, commonly used to visualize graphs, suffer from visual clutter on large graphs. Edge bundling is an effective technique for alleviating clutter and revealing high-level edge patterns. Previous methods for general graph layouts either require a control mesh to guide the bundling process, which can introduce high variation in curvature along the bundles, or all-to-all force and compatibility calculations, which is not scalable. We propose a multilevel agglomerative edge <b>bundling</b> <b>method</b> based on a principled approach of minimizing ink needed to represent edges, with additional constraints on the curvature of the resulting splines. The proposed method is much faster than previous ones, able to bundle {{hundreds of thousands of}} edges in seconds, and one million edges in a few minutes. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNumerous {{information}} visualization {{techniques are}} available for utilizing and analyzing large data. Among these techniques, network visualization, which employs node-link diagrams, can determine the relationship among multi-dimensional data. However, when data become extremely large, visualization becomes obscure because of visual clutter. To address this problem, many edge bundling techniques have been proposed. However, although graphs present several edge types, previous techniques do not reflect these edges. In this paper, we propose a new edge <b>bundling</b> <b>method</b> for multi-type co-occurring graphs. In this method, electro-static forces work between each pair of edges; however, if the edges are of different types, then repulsion works between pairs. By bundling edges of the same type, a graph can more clearly show relationships among data.
