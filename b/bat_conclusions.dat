40|$|Coke plants, {{which produce}} {{various types of}} coke (metallurgical, foundry or heating), at {{temperatures}} between 600 and 1200 °C, with limited access to oxygen, are major emitters of particulates and gaseous pollutants to air, water and soils. Primarily, the process of wet quenching should be mentioned, {{as one of the}} most cumbersome. Atmospheric pollutants include particulates, tar substances, organic pollutants including B(a) P and many others. Pollutants are also formed from the decomposition of water used to quench coke (CO, phenol, HCN, H 2 S, NH 3, cresol) and decomposition of hot coke in the first phase of quenching (CO, H 2 S, SO 2) [1]. The development of the coke oven technology has resulted in the changes made to different types of technological installations, such as the use of baffles in quench towers, the removal of nitrogen oxides by selective NOx reduction, and the introduction of fabric filters for particulates removal. The <b>BAT</b> <b>conclusions</b> for coke plants [2] provide a methodology for the measurement of particulate emission from a wet, low-emission technology using Mohrhauer probes. The conclusions define the emission level for wet quenching process as 25 g/Mgcoke. The conducted research was aimed at verification of the presented method. For two of three quench towers (A and C) the requirements included in the <b>BAT</b> <b>conclusions</b> are not met and emissions amount to 87. 34 and 61. 35 g/Mgcoke respectively. The lowest particulates emission was recorded on the quench tower B and amounted to 22. 5 g/Mgcoke, therefore not exceeding the requirements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Active transposable {{elements}} (TEs) can {{be passed}} between genomes of different species by horizontal transfer (HT). This may help them to avoid vertical extinction due to elimination by natural selection or silencing. HT is relatively frequent within eukaryotic taxa, but rare between distant species. Findings Closely related Mariner -type DNA transposon families, collectively named as Mariner- 1 _Tbel families, {{are present in the}} genomes of two ants and two mammalian genomes. Consensus sequences of the four families show pairwise identities greater than 95 %. In addition, mammalian Mariner 1 _BT family shows a close evolutionary relationship with some insect Mariner families. Mammalian Mariner 1 _BT type sequences are present only in species from three groups including ruminants, tooth whales (Odontoceti), and New World leaf-nosed <b>bats</b> (Phyllostomidae). <b>Conclusions</b> Horizontal transfer accounts for the presence of Mariner_Tbel and Mariner 1 _BT families in mammals. Mariner_Tbel family was introduced into hedgehog and tree shrew genomes approximately 100 to 69 million years ago (MYA). Most likely, these TE families were transferred from insects to mammals, but details of the transfer remain unknown. </p...|$|R

40|$|Activation {{of brown}} adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans {{increase}} glucose and fatty acid clearance {{as well as}} resting metabolic rate, whereas a prolonged elevation of BAT activity improves insulin sensitivity. However, substantial reductions in body weight following BAT activation {{has not yet been}} shown in humans. This observation raise the possibility for feedback mechanisms in adult humans in terms of a brown fat-brain crosstalk, possibly mediated by batokines, factors produced by and secreted from brown fat. Batokines also seems to be involved in BAT recruitment by stimulating proliferation and differentiation of brown fat progenitors. Increasing human BAT capacity could thus include inducing brown fat biogenesis as well as identifying novel batokines. Another attractive approach would be to induce a brown fat phenotype, the so-called brite or beige fat, within the white fat depots. In adult humans, white fat tissue transformation into beige has been observed in patients with pheochromocytoma, a norepinephrine-producing tumor. Interestingly, human beige fat is predominantly induced in regions that were BAT during early childhood, possibly reflecting that a presence of human beige progenitors is depot specific and originating from <b>BAT.</b> In <b>conclusion,</b> to utilize the anti-obesity potential of human BAT focus should be directed towards identifying novel regulators of brown and beige fat progenitor cells, as well as feedback mechanisms of BAT activation.

40|$|Abstract Background Brown {{and white}} adipose tissues (BAT and WAT) play {{critical}} roles in controlling energy homeostasis {{and in the}} development of obesity and diabetes. The mouse Fat-Specific protein 27 (FSP 27), a member of the cell death-inducing DFF 45 -like effector (CIDE) family, is expressed in both BAT and WAT and is associated with lipid droplets. Over-expression of FSP 27 promotes lipid storage, whereas FSP 27 deficient mice have improved insulin sensitivity and are resistant to diet-induced obesity. In addition, FSP 27 -deficient white adipocytes have reduced lipid storage, smaller lipid droplets, increased mitochondrial activity and a higher expression of several BAT-selective genes. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which FSP 27 controls lipid storage and gene expression in WAT and BAT, we systematically analyzed the gene expression profile of FSP 27 - deficient WAT by microarray analysis and compared the expression levels of a specific set of genes in WAT and BAT by semi-quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Results BAT-selective genes were significantly up-regulated, whereas WAT-selective genes were down-regulated in the WAT of FSP 27 - deficient mice. The expression of the BAT-selective genes was also dramatically up-regulated in the WAT of leptin/FSP 27 double deficient mice. In addition, the expression levels of genes involved in multiple metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation, were increased in the FSP 27 - deficient WAT. In contrast, the expression levels for genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, the classic complement pathway and TGF-β signaling were down-regulated in the FSP 27 - deficient WAT. Most importantly, the expression levels of regulatory factors that determine BAT identity, such as CEBPα/β, PRDM 16 and major components of the cAMP pathway, were markedly up-regulated in the WAT of FSP 27 - deficient mice. The expression levels of these regulatory factors were also up-regulated in leptin/FSP 27 double deficient mice. Interestingly, distinct gene expression profiles were observed in the BAT of FSP 27 - deficient mice. Taken together, these data suggest that the WAT of FSP 27 - deficient mice have a gene expression profile similar to that of <b>BAT.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> FSP 27 acts as a molecular determinant that controls gene expression for a diversity of metabolic and signaling pathways and, in particular, the expression of regulatory factors, including CEBPα/β, PRDM 16 and components of the cAMP signaling pathway, that control the identity of WAT and BAT. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{excessive}} abundance of the urban pigeon Columba livia population {{in the city of}} Modena has been solved thanks to the cooperation between the Modena Municipal authority and the Local Veterinary Service (AUSL). They have followed an integrated program that contains the following points: use of an oral veterinary licensed drug (Ovistop®, ACME, 1997 - 2002) in order to limit the pigeons fertility; use of architectural devices in order to limit the access of the pigeons in private and public structures, periodic monitoring of the colonies of pigeons and public information regarding the treatments and the integrated program. In the year 2008 Modena Municipality started the restoration of the Ghirlandina Tower. The above-mentioned authorities decided to exclude the pigeon population from the many scaffold holes existent on the tower.

40|$|SummaryWe {{investigated}} the metabolism of human brown adipose tissue (BAT) in healthy subjects by determining its cold-induced and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and blood flow (perfusion) using {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) combined with computed tomography (CT). Second, we assessed gene expression in human BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT). Glucose uptake was induced 12 -fold in BAT by cold, accompanied by doubling of perfusion. We found a positive association between whole-body energy expenditure and BAT perfusion. Insulin enhanced glucose uptake 5 -fold in BAT independently of its perfusion, while the effect on WAT was weaker. The gene expression level of insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT 4 was also higher in BAT as compared to WAT. In <b>conclusion,</b> <b>BAT</b> appears to be differently activated by insulin and cold; in response to insulin, BAT displays high glucose uptake without increased perfusion, but when activated by cold, it dissipates energy in a perfusion-dependent manner...|$|R

We report a case of immediate allergic reaction induced by intravenous methylprednisolone given before operation for surgical repair of an arm contracture as a sequel of burns, which the child had tolerated a month before. Six weeks later the patient repeated the anaphylactic reaction during skin testing to methylprednisolone. In addition, basophile activation test with methylprednisolone (<b>BAT)</b> was positive. <b>Conclusion.</b> This case report describes a patient who experienced intraoperative anaphylaxis and anaphylactic reaction induced by skin testing. This is the first report on induction of both anaphylactic reactions by methylprednisolone in the same child. Clinical findings, positive BAT and positive skin tests with methylprednisolone imply that the child developed type-I hypersensitivity.

40|$|Abstract Background Leptospires lack {{many of the}} homologs for {{oxidative}} defense {{present in}} other bacteria, but do encode homologs of the Bacteriodes aerotolerance (Bat) proteins, which have been proposed to fulfill this function. Bat homologs {{have been identified in}} all families of the phylum Spirochaetes, yet a specific function for these proteins has not been experimentally demonstrated. Results We investigated the contribution of the Bat proteins in the model organism Leptospira biflexa for their potential contributions to growth rate, morphology and protection against oxidative challenges. A genetically engineered mutant strain in which all bat ORFs were deleted did not exhibit altered growth rate or morphology, relative to the wild-type strain. Nor could we demonstrate a protective role for the Bat proteins in coping with various oxidative stresses. Further, pre-exposing L. biflexa to sublethal levels of reactive oxygen species did not appear to induce a general oxidative stress response, in contrast to what has been shown in other bacterial species. Differential proteomic analysis of the wild-type and mutant strains detected changes in the abundance of a single protein only – HtpG, which is encoded by the gene immediately downstream of the <b>bat</b> loci. <b>Conclusion</b> The data presented here do not support a protective role for the Leptospira Bat proteins in directly coping with oxidative stress as previously proposed. L. biflexa is relatively sensitive to reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and H 2 O 2, suggesting that this spirochete lacks a strong, protective defense against oxidative damage despite being a strict aerobe. </p...|$|R

40|$|Retrospective {{studies have}} shown that outdoor {{temperature}} influences the prevalence of detectable brown adipose tissue (BAT). Prospective studies use acute cold exposure to activate BAT. In prospective studies, BAT might be preconditioned in winter months leading to an increased BAT response to various stimuli. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether outdoor temperatures and other weather characteristics modulate the response of BAT to acute cold. To assess metabolic BAT activity and sympathetic outflow to BAT, 64 (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and 56 additional (123) I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123) I-mIBG) single-photon emission computed tomography-CT (SPECT-CT) scans, respectively, of subjects participating in previously executed trials were retrospectively included. BAT activity was measured in subjects after an overnight fast, following 2 h of cold exposure (∼ 17 °C). The average daytime outdoor temperatures and other weather characteristics were obtained from the Dutch Royal Weather Institute. Forty-nine subjects were BAT positive. One week prior to the scan, outdoor temperature was significantly lower in the BAT-positive group compared with the BAT-negative group. Higher outdoor temperatures on preceding days resulted in lower stimulated metabolic BAT activity and volume (all P < 0. 01). Outdoor temperatures did not correlate with sympathetic outflow to <b>BAT.</b> In <b>conclusion,</b> outdoor temperatures influence metabolic BAT activity and volume, but not sympathetic outflow to BAT, in subjects exposed to acute cold. To improve the consistency of the findings of future BAT studies in humans and to exclude bias introduced by outdoor temperatures, these studies should be planned in periods of similar outdoor temperature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Venom {{immunotherapy}} (VIT) is {{the only}} effective treatment for prevention of serious allergic reactions to bee and wasp stings in sensitized individuals. However, {{there are still many}} questions and controversies regarding immunotherapy, like selection of the appropriate allergen, safety and long term efficacy. Methods Literature review was performed to address the role of basophil activation test (BAT) in diagnosis of venom allergy. Results In patients with positive skin tests or specific IgE to both honeybee and wasp venom, IgE inhibition test can identify sensitizing allergen only in around 15 % and basophil activation test increases the identification rate to around one third of double positive patients. BAT is also diagnostic in majority of patients with systemic reactions after insect stings and no detectable IgE. High basophil sensitivity to allergen is associated with a risk of side effects during VIT. Persistence of high basophil sensitivity also predicts a treatment failure of VIT. <b>Conclusion</b> <b>BAT</b> is a useful tool for better selection of allergen for immunotherapy, for identification of patients prone to side effects and patients who might be treatment failures. However, long term studies are needed to evaluate the accuracy of the test. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since the Jurassic, bats {{have been}} very {{successful}} in their evolutionary strategy. More than 1200 species of bats have occupied all habitats in the Earth except glaciers. Flight and echolocation have been necessary to conquer the night, but is the night a prison or a paradise for bats? Three hypotheses are discussed {{in order to understand}} why bats are nocturnal animals. Bat wings are made of thin skin that is full of capillary terminations that are especially sensitive to water loss. It would therefore be reasonable to think that bats take refuge {{in the darkness of the}} night in order to avoid overheating and dehydration. Birds coexisted with bats in the Jurassic, so bats may have moved to the darkness of night to avoid competition from birds. They may also have done so to avoid falcons. All these hypotheses are reasonable, but it is known that few bird species were insectivorous when bat species originated, so competition was not a great problem for bats. On the other hand, falcons are very efficient flying hunters of bats, and some researchers have reported that in oceanic islands bats fly during daylight when falcons are absent. In <b>conclusion,</b> <b>bats</b> are nocturnal creatures that used confinement to develop their inherent mammal capabilities. Predation risks confined bats to darkness and gave them the opportunity to become one of the most successful evolutionary beings on Earth...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{understand}} how British American Tobacco (BAT) and Philip Morris (PM) researched {{the role and}} popularity of cigarette gifting in forming relationships among Chinese customs and how they exploited the practice to promote their brands State Express 555 and Marlboro. Methods Searches and analysis of industry documents from the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library complemented by searches on LexisNexis Academic news, online search engines and information from the tobacco industry trade press. Results From 1980 e 1999, BAT and PM employed Chinese market research firms to gather consumer information about perceptions of foreign cigarettes and the companies discovered that cigarettes, especially prestigious ones, were gifted and smoked purposely for building relationships and social status in China. BAT and PM promoted their brands as gifts by enhancing cigarette cartons and promoting culturally themed packages, particularly during the gifting festivals of Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival to tie their brands in to festival values such as warmth, friendship and celebration. They used similar marketing in Chinese communities outside China. <b>Conclusions</b> <b>BAT</b> and PM tied their brands to Chinese cigarette gifting customs by appealing to social and cultural values of respect and personal honour. Decoupling cigarettes from their social significance in China and removing their appeal would probably reduce cigarette gifting and promote a decline in smoking. Tobacco control efforts in counter marketing, large graphic warnings and plain packaging to make cigarette packages less attractive as gifts could contribute to denormalising cigarette gifting. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

To establish an effective surveillance to monitor transboundary spread of bat viruses between Myanmar and China, complete organs from the thorax and abdomen from 853 bats of six species from two Myanmar counties close to Yunnan province, China, were collected and tested for their virome through metagenomics by Solexa sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. In total, 3, 742, 314 reads of 114 bases were generated, and over 86 % were assembled into 1, 649, 512 contigs with an average length of 114 bp, of which 26, 698 (2 %) contigs were recognizable viral sequences belonging to 24 viral families. Of the viral contigs 45 % (12, 086 / 26, 698) were related to vertebrate viruses, 28 % (7, 443 / 26, 698) to insect viruses, 27 % (7, 074 / 26, 698) to phages and 95 contigs to plant viruses.

In this work, in vitro reac-tions to M. phaseolina in the cotyledons of 100 F 2 plants {{derived from the}} cross BAT 477 (resistant) x Pinto UI- 114 (susceptible) and the parents were measured, and AFLP molecular markers associated with BAT 477 M. phaseolina resistance were found. The AFLP analysis consisted of selective amplification using 20 EcoRI + 3 /MseI + 3 selective oligonucleotides. Charcoal rot re-sistance is controlled by two dominant genes with dou-ble recessive epistatic effects. AFLP analysis produced 294 polymorphic amplified products. Using the 130 least distorted loci a linkage map was produced that included eight LG where 30 loci were mapped. A possible quanti-tative trait locus (QTL) was found at linkage group 1 (LG 1) showing logarithm of odds (LOD) = 5. 11 (critical LOD for genomic amplitude level = 7. 23 and critical LOD for chromosomal amplitude = 5. 5 based on per-mutation tests).

40|$|Background There is {{need for}} an {{accurate}} diagnostic test in mastocytosis patients with wasp venom allergy (WVA) and monitoring of these patients during immunotherapy (IT). In this study, we aimed to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the Basophil Activation Test (BAT) as a diagnostic and monitoring test in patients with mastocytosis and WVA. Methods Seventeen patients with mastocytosis and WVA and six mastocytosis patients without WVA were included. BAT was performed {{before the start of}} IT (first visit) and at 6 weeks (second visit) and 1 year (third visit), after reaching the maintenance dose. Of 17 patients included, 11 completed the third visit. In mastocytosis patients with WVA, dose-dependent wasp-venom induced upregulation of CD 63 and CD 203 c expression on basophils was observed compared with mastocytosis patients without WVA. Serum specific IgE, IgG 4, and tryptase levels were measured in all patients. Results BAT had a sensitivity of 87 % and specificity of 100 % in diagnosing WVA in mastocytosis patients. Basophil allergen threshold sensitivity with respect to CD 63 and CD 203 c was significantly decreased in the second visit compared with the first visit and increased significantly in the third visit compared with the second visit. Specific IgE levels increased significantly in the second visit compared with first and decreased significantly in the third visit compared with the second. Specific IgG 4 levels rose significantly in the second visit compared with the first and on the third visit compared with the second. Tryptase levels did not change significantly during the study. <b>Conclusions</b> <b>BAT</b> represents a diagnostic test with 100 % specificity in allergic patients with mastocytosis and these patients are better to be monitored for a longer period during IT.

40|$|In the {{previous}} paper(Hiraiwa and Uchida, 2 ̆ 755) we experimentally studied that the spermatozoa {{introduced into the}} uterus of the bat, PiPistrellus abramus abramus(Temminck) in the autumn are able to retain their fertilizing capacity for 118 days and fertilize the ova which have been discharged from the ovary in the spring. In this case, how are the spermatozoa stored in the uterus? Looking over the literatures one notes that most former workers generally believed that the spermatozoa stored in the bat uterus in the winter {{are in a very}} active state. We have some doubts, however, whether the semen stored in the uterus during such a long period retain similar conditions in their properties such as the viscosity of semen, percentage and index of motile sperm, and sperm concentration. On the otherhand, winter and spring copulations have been observed in the cave-dwelling bat Myoiis, though not noticed in Pipistrellus except the ordinary autumnal copulations. If winter or sprlng copulations occur also in some individuals of the bat, large difference may exist between the properties of semen stored in the uterus since autumn and that introduced into the uterus by the later supplementary copulations. Accordingly if there is a great disparity in the properties of semen, {{we may be able to}} admit that copulations occur again in the winter or spring. In order to solve these two problems above mentioned, studies on the properties of semen were made quantitatively. The results may be summarized as follows: 1. The stored semen are classified into three types by their properties. The semen contained in the uterus of bats captured in the autumn belong to only the first type(Fig. 2), but the semen in the spring consist of the first, second and third types(Figs. 3, 4 and 5), and large differences in properties exist among three types(Tables 2 and 3). And the index of motile sperm is shown in inverse proportion to the sperm concentration of semen(Fig. 1). Although our results disagree with those of previous workers and Wimsatt 2 ̆ 7 s observations(2 ̆ 742, 2 ̆ 744,), it is obvious that the spermatozoa found in the uterus in the spring are not always in a active state, because in about half individuals the majority of spermatozoa lose their activity, very few being surviving. 2. Judging from the histological observations, the large difference in the properties of stored semen has never been based on the endogenous factor, i. e., the influence of estrous or preovulatory conditions of female genital organs. It is, accordingly, believed that the exogenous factor, i. e., the disparity in length of passage of days after copulations gives rise to such a large difference in the properties of semen. In the spring, On the other hand, the existence of such abundant active spermatozoa as are found in the first type semen introduced into the uterus is never found anywhere except the cauda epididymis of male <b>bat.</b> In <b>conclusion,</b> then, it appears that the supplementary copulations take place at relatively high percentages in the winter or spring. 3. In the third type semen, the spermatozoa shown histologically with their heads towards the uterine. epithelium(Fig. 7), corresponds to the motile sperm seen by direct observations. 4. The third type semen, together with the first and second type semen, may be capable of fertilizing the ova, and even a small volume of semen(+) is enough for fertilization(Table 1) 1. 子宮内精液は 3 つの型に大別され, それらの性状には著しい差異が認められる. われわれの観察は多くの先進者の確信と一致しないが, 春の子宮内精子のすべてが必ずしも高い活力を保持しているのではなく, むしろ約半数の個体では子宮内精子の大部分は死滅し, 極く僅かの率の精子が生存しているのみであることを知つた. 2. 組織学的観察によれば, 上述した子宮内精液の性状における差異は内的要因, 即ち雌性生殖器官の発情ないし排卵現象の影響に基づいて生じたものではない. 従つて, 交尾の時期の差異に由来する交尾後の経過日数の長短が子宮内精液の性状にかかる差異を生ぜしめることが考えられる. 一方, 春の第I型子宮内精液にみられるような活力の高い多量の精子の存在は, 春には雄の副睾丸尾部を除いては何処にも見出されない. これらのことから, 基本的な秋の交尾後に, 冬及び春にも比較的高い割合で交尾が再び行われることを推論する. 3. 第III型精液において, 生体観察による僅かの率の生存精子は組織学的には子宮壁に沿うてその頭部を上皮に接し尾部を膣に向けて規則正しく一列に並んでいる精子に相当すると考えられる. 4. 第I･II型はもちろん, 第III型精液も受精可能であり, 受精には僅かの子宮内精液量(+) で十分である...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{genetics}} of hoary <b>bats</b> produced differing <b>conclusions</b> on {{the timing of}} their colonization of the Hawaiian Islands {{and whether or not}} North American (Aeorestes cinereus) and Hawaiian (A. semotus) hoary bats are distinct species. One study, using mtDNA COI and nuclear Rag 2 and CMA 1, concluded that hoary bats colonized the Hawaiian Islands no more than 10, 000 years ago based on indications of population expansion at that time using Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots. The other study, using 3 mtDNA and 1 Y-chromosome locus, concluded that the Hawaiian Islands were colonized about 1 million years ago. To address the marked inconsistencies between those studies, we examined DNA sequences from 4 mitochondrial and 2 nuclear loci in lasiurine bats to investigate the timing of colonization of the Hawaiian Islands by hoary bats, test the hypothesis that Hawaiian and North American hoary bats belong to different species, and further investigate the generic level taxonomy within the tribe. Phylogenetic analysis and dating of the nodes of mtDNA haplotypes and of nuclear CMA 1 alleles show that A. semotus invaded the Hawaiian Islands approximately 1. 35 Ma and that multiple arrivals of A. cinereus occurred much more recently. Extended Bayesian Skyline plots show population expansion at about 20, 000 years ago in the Hawaiian Islands, which we conclude does not represent the timing of colonization of the Hawaiian Islands given the high degree of genetic differentiation among A. cinereus and A. semotus (4. 2 % divergence at mtDNA Cytb) and the high degree of genetic diversity within A. semotus. Rather, population expansion 20, 000 years ago could have resulted from colonization of additional islands, expansion after a bottleneck, or other factors. New genetic data also support the recognition of A. semotus and A. cinereus as distinct species, a finding consistent with previous morphological and behavioral studies. The phylogenetic analysis of CMA 1 alleles shows the presence of 2 clades that are primarily associated with A. semotus mtDNA haplotypes, and are unique to the Hawaiian Islands. There is evidence for low levels of hybridization between A. semotus and A. cinereus on the Hawaiian Islands, but it is not extensive (< 15 % of individuals are of hybrid origin), and clearly each species is able to maintain its own genetic distinctiveness. Both mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequences show deep divergence between the 3 groups (genera) of lasiurine bats that correspond to the previously recognized morphological differences between them. We show that the Tribe Lasiurini contains the genera Aeorestes (hoary bats), Lasiurus (red bats), and Dasypterus (yellow bats) ...|$|R
40|$|Research {{findings}} have supported {{a relationship between}} psychological characteristics and optimal performance states, indicating that elite and successful sports participants are more motivated, committed, self-confident, focused and able to peak under pressure compared to non-elite and less successful participants. The {{reason for this is}} that a human being’s biomechanical and physiological harmonisation of movement is mediated by various aspects of psychological involvement. The psychological components of physical-skills execution in sport can be enhanced by the corrective application of mental-skills training. Personalised mental-skills training enables participants to understand their cognitions in order to allow a degree of flow in the coordination and execution of task-related skills through the various mood states of participation. A participant’s ability to control the mental and emotional aspects associated with competition not only facilitates task performance but also serves as a psychological keystone of self-belief and wellbeing. Sports psychology has recently directed its focus to identifying psychological skills relevant to different types of individual and team sports for the purpose of providing on-the-field psychological support. Investigations in South Africa, addressing the psychological constructs conducive to performance in cricket are limited, at both the professional and the amateur levels of competition. At this stage, there are no documented findings available in which the relationship between mental skills and skilled performance in cricket is addressed. Therefore, research questions for this study are formulated as: “Are there significant differences in the psychological background information on cricket players from different levels of cricket competition?” “Is there a significant relationship between mental skills and the level of cricket player participation?” “Is there a significant relationship between mental skills and the specialised roles played in cricket?” “Is there is a significant relationship between mental skills and batting order in cricket?” The study was approached from a quantitative (descriptive) perspective since it was the perceptions and mental skills relative to cricket players’ levels of participation that were assessed. A questionnaire assessing the general perspectives on psychology of respondents, and three other standardised psychometric measures (Competitive Anxiety Inventory- 2 [Martens et al., 1990]; The Athletic Coping Skills Inventory- 28 [Smith et al., 1995], and Bull’s Mental Skills Questionnaire [Bull et al., 1996]) with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient ranging between 0. 79 and 0. 90, were used as research instruments. These Likert-type scale questionnaires were administered to 127 cricket players (30. 7 % Junior Academy; 53. 6 % Premier League/Senior Academy and 15. 7 % Senior Provincial players) to explore their general psychological background information and the mental skills differences between three progressive levels of cricket participation established and recognised by the Northerns Cricket Union (NCU) in the Pretoria Gauteng region of South Africa. Other aims were to investigate the relationship between mental skills and the different tasks (e. g. batting, bowling, wicket keeping) performed in cricket and as well as to investigate the relationship between mental skills and batting order. Overall results obtained from the respondents’ general psychological background information revealed that cricket players, regardless of level of participation, have insufficient exposure to, training in and knowledge of the psychological aspects associated with cricket performance. It is evident from the results that cricket players spent limited time on psychological-skills training and that they exercise only the physiological and skills-related aspects of the game. One-way analysis of variance (one-way Anova) indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the three levels of participating respondents in terms of their performance in the various mental-skills and coping-skills subscales. Analysis of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory- 2 subscales indicated no statistically significant differences in the cognitive and somatic anxiety scores between the three levels of participation. However, a statistically significant difference was found in terms of self-confidence in the senior provincial players whose scores were higher on this construct than those of the other two levels of cricket participants. A comparison of the performance of the various specialised roles in cricket on the mental skills questionnaire indicated that the all-rounders had significantly higher imagery ability and motivation scores than batsmen and bowlers. The various specialised roles showed a very similar outcome on the cognitive, somatic and state self-confidence levels. A significant difference in batting order was revealed in top-order batsmen scoring the highest on motivation and lower-order batsmen scoring the highest on coachability. No other mental-skills difference existed between the different groups of <b>batting</b> order. The <b>conclusion</b> was that, in essence, there are no mental-skills differences between cricket players from various levels of participation in the one-day cricket format. A definite psychological-skills profile did come to the fore, indicating that successful cricket participants, regardless of what level of competition they compete in, express high proficiencies in motivation, self-confidence, coachability, imagery ability, concentration ability and peaking under pressure. The study concludes with recommendations for expanding knowledge on the direction and intensity of mental skills in contributing to cricket performance. A more holistic view on the psychological differences between successful and less successful cricket participants at the same level of participation is recommended as well as a comparison between the mental skills of one-day and multiple-day cricket players. Sports psychologists and cricket coaches are also encouraged to collate their experience and expertise in developing and implementing individualised psychological-skills-training (PST) programmes to satisfy the players’ psychological needs when dealing with the performance demands of the game. Implications for further investigations are listed since there were several aspects that did not fall within the aims of this investigation.
