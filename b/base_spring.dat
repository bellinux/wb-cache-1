50|$|The {{lampholder}} must {{be located}} far {{enough from the}} filament that the metals with the lowest melting point will remain solid. Historically this metal was a tin/lead solder whose melting point might be as low as 180 °C (360 °F). Due to the thermal changes from ambient temperature to full operating temperature, {{the design of a}} socket must allow for a considerable amount of expansion and contraction. Spring elements are required to accommodate these dimensional changes. However - the temperature at which a metal loses its spring is far below the melting point. This is why some older sockets that no longer work can be restored by prying up the <b>base</b> <b>spring</b> slightly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{the present}} study focuses on soil {{structure}} interaction analysis of 3 D 2 x 4 bay 4 story RC frame plan and vertical irregular building resting on isolated footing supporting on soil medium with different zones and soil types subjected to normal loads and seismic loads. There are 3 linear-elastic and isotropic models of the soil beneath the structure such as fixed <b>base,</b> <b>spring</b> model and soil continuum. The dynamic analysis is carryout on RC frame irregular structure using time history analysis by the fem software sap 2000. Based on the results, comparing with 3 models it conclude that the soil structure interaction investigate effect are lateral displacement, natural frequency, story drift and base shear increases and natural period is decreases...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design {{concept of a}} bio-botanic robot which demonstrates its behavior based on plant growth. Besides, it can reflect the different phases of plant growth depending on the proportional amounts of light, temperature and water. The mechanism design {{is made up of}} a processed aluminum <b>base,</b> <b>spring,</b> polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and actuator to constitute the plant base and plant body. The control system consists of two micro-controllers and a self-designed embedded development board where the main controller transmits the values of the environmental sensing module within the embedded board to a sub-controller. The sub-controller determines the growth stage, growth height, and time and transmits its decision value to the main controller. Finally, based on the data transmitted by the sub-controller, the main controller controls the growth phase of the bio-botanic robot using a servo motor and leaf actuator. The research result not only helps children realize the variation of plant growth but also is entertainment-educational through its demonstration of the growth process of the bio-botanic robot in a short time...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} grazing {{intensity}} (to approximately 150 (H), 450 (M) and > 750 (L) kg lamina DM/ha at a 14 day rotation length, i. e. H 14, M 14 and L 14) and grazing frequency (at 7 14, 21 and 28 day rotation lengths at the M level of intensity, i. e. M 7 M 14, M 21 and M 28) on the sward {{characteristics of a}} perennial ryegrass-white clover sward was examined over 24 weeks in spring, summer and early autumn. The grazing treatments were imposed over a 12 week (treatment) period (mid-Sept to mid-Dec) in {{spring and early summer}} to determine a) whether or not pasture 'control' (or some intermediate state) resulted and b) why differences between managements arose. It was found that treatments H 14, M 7 and M 14 could be considered 'controlled' but treatments L 14, M 21 and M 28 could not. This was largely because in the latter, the proportion and mass of ryegrass reproductive stubble, green and total herbage masses, sward height and emerged inflorescence density were much greater; and Leaf:Stem ratio, tiller density and lamina accumulation were much lower, than in the former. The individual mass of reproductive tillers was the most important factor determining differences in ryegrass reproductive stubble mass, rather than reproductive tiller density. Over the following 12 week (post-treatment) period (mid-Dec to early-Mar) subsequent pasture production on these swards was measured under a common grazing regime. It was concluded that a greater 'risk' of poor lamina accumulation was associated with lack of pasture 'control' and this was largely influenced by the recovery of tiller density. During this period ryegrass reproductive stubble died and 'uncontrolled' swards had higher herbage mass due to a greater mass of dead herbage. The proportion of white clover in herbage mass and lamina accumulation was greater on M 7 swards during the treatment period and on both M 7 and H 14 swards during the post-treatment period. In practice, herbage mass and sward height probably the best criteria on which to <b>base</b> <b>spring</b> grazing decisions because both are highly correlated with individual ryegrass reproductive tiller mass. Pasture 'control' may be maintained on a ryegrass-white clover sward by grazing to a sward by grazing to a sward height of 6 - 9 cm (1400 - 1600 kg green DM/ha) from a pregrazing sward height of less than 20 cm (2700 - 3000 kg green DM/ha).
