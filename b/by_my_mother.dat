They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E

I took it to look at. [...] There was a trail nearby and I followed it. [...] It led to water. [...] I went into the water. There the trail ended and I sat down in the water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and when I came out I was born <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How happy <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> side When some {{dear friend}} became a bride! To shine beyond the rest I was [...] In gay {{embroidery}} drest. Vain of my drapery's rich brocade, I held my flowing locks to braid." [...] ANSTICE (from the Greek).|$|R
6000|$|... "May I inquire, my dear sir," [...] Paul asked, with a {{timidity}} of {{manner that}} betrayed how tenderly {{he felt it}} necessary to touch on the subject at all--"may I inquire, my dear sir, what course was taken <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> relatives?" ...|$|R

60|$|I {{have reason}} to believe that my exodus from home was, on the whole, favorably viewed <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> as tending to remove any {{possibility}} of my bad character and conduct interfering with my sister's advancement in life.|$|E

6000|$|Anne knew it, but {{the thought}} of that widowed home {{depressed}} her. It might, she thought, be as dull as Oakwood, and there would be infinite chances of preferment at Court.

60|$|My throat ached with pity {{whenever}} I {{received a}} letter from <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> for she never failed to express a growing longing for her sons, neither of whom could be with her.

60|$|Up to {{this time}} I had never owned an {{overcoat}} nor a suit that fitted me. My shirts {{had always been}} made <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and had no real cuffs.

6000|$|They were {{conveyed}} to me <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> who was, I really believe, even more {{shocked by the}} grossness of my social insubordination than Lady Drew.

[...] "You must go up to young Mr. Garvell, and beg his pardon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have endeavoured {{to do my}} duty by you, sir, always; and <b>by</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother.</b> You {{can treat}} me in this way, if you please, {{but it will not}} have any effect on my conduct.
