5|$|Many Indonesian batik {{patterns}} are symbolic.

Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pattern of the batik he or she wore. Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian batik showed the applicability of fractal geometry in traditional designs.|$|E
5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, the value would <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{supply and demand}} in {{relation}} to new goods. The price differential/margins between used and new goods would stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.

5|$|When Léon Théry won the 1904 {{race for}} the French {{manufacturer}} Richard-Brasier, the French automobile industry proposed to the ACF that they modify {{the format of the}} 1905 Gordon Bennett race and run it simultaneously with an event which did not limit entries by nation. The ACF accepted the proposal, but decided that instead of removing limits to entries by nation, the limits would remain but would <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> size of each country's industry.

5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds.

He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E

5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} unemployment will <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2012, the Public Service Division of the Prime Minister's Office {{announced}} that the fixed component of the salary of a political appointment holder would be 13 months {{of his or her}} monthly salary.

The targets for the four indicators making up the national bonus were 2–3% for real median income growth of citizens and real median income growth for the lowest 20th percentile of citizens, 3–5% for real GDP growth, and not more than 4.5% for the unemployment rate of citizens.
