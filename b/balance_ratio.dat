The ICF is formally defined [...] as the <b>balance</b> (<b>ratio)</b> between the raw stock correlations that include the index effect and the residual stock correlations (or partial correlations) after subtraction of the index effect. [...] Defined this way, the ICF provides a means to identify structural changes in the market, which can render it prone to systemic collapses: High values of the ICF characterize a state in which the index predominantly affects the market dynamics while it shades the effect of other degrees of freedom that {{can contribute to the}} market flexibility. Thus high values of the ICF correspond to a state in which the market index dominates the behavior of the market, thus making it stiff and hence during such state the market is highly prone to systematic collapses, even due to relatively small external perturbations, leaving it incapable of coping with crises.|$|E

40|$|A graph has {{growth rate}} k {{if the number}} of nodes in any {{subgraph}} with diameter r is bounded by O(r k). The communication graphs of wireless networks and peer-to-peer networks often have small growth rate. In this paper we study the tradeoff between two quality measures for routing in growth restricted graphs. The two measures we consider are the stretch factor, which measures the lengths of the routing paths, and the load <b>balancing</b> <b>ratio,</b> which measures how evenly the traffic is distributed. We show that if the routing algorithm is required to use paths with stretch factor c, then its load <b>balancing</b> <b>ratio</b> is bounded by O((n/c) 1 − 1 /k), where k is the graph’s growth rate. We illustrate our results by focusing on the unit disk graph for modeling wireless networks in which two nodes have direct communication if their distance is under certain threshold. We show that if the maximum density of the nodes is bounded by ρ, there exists routing scheme such that the stretch factor of routing paths is at most c, and the maximum load on the nodes is at most O(min (� ρn/c, n/c)) times the optimum. In addition, the bound on the load <b>balancing</b> <b>ratio</b> is tight in the worst case. As a special case, when the density is bounded by a constant, the shortest path routing has a load <b>balancing</b> <b>ratio</b> of O (√ n). The result extends to k-dimensional unit ball graphs and graphs with growth rate k. We also discuss algorithmic issues for load balanced short path routing and for load balanced routing in spanner graphs.

40|$|Lecturepg. 17 It is {{well known}} that the fluid {{pressure}} distribution between the faces of a mechanical seal greatly affects seal performance. In cases where a sealed fluid changes phase from liquid to vapor as it leaks across the seal faces, the load support derived from fluid pressure can be considerably greater than for the all liquid case. Furthermore, unlike for all liquid seals, this load support changes with seal temperature. Thus, using seals with balance ratios selected based on liquid applications can result in excessive leakage. On the other hand, the selection of <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> at too high a level can cause excessive wear of the seal faces by forcing all vapor operation. Thus, <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> selection is critical to the successful operation of a two phase seal. The question of how to select <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> for two-phase applications has not been clearly resolved. A simplified method of <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> selection for two phase applications is presented herein. By assuming isothermal faces, it is shown how the equilibrium face temperature can be calculated by iterative methods. Equations are presented which are used to calculate critical <b>balance</b> <b>ratio.</b> There is a minimum critical <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> and maximum critical <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> corresponding to the two undesirable operating conditions above. The method is applied first for the case of water where it is shown how a <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> selection graph can be constructed which relates critical <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> to pressure and temperature. One graph covers applications over all temperatures and several pressure values. The technique is then extended to a more typical refinery product stream, a two component solution of propane and methane. The behavior of this solution in a two phase seal application is somewhat different than the single component. Studies are made which show how critical <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> is affected by changes in design, specifically face width, temperature coefficient, secondary seal type, and radial taper. The results illustrate the sensitivity of critical <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> to both design parameters and to operating conditions. In conclusion, it is shown that knowledge of the product stream, coupled with calculations of critical <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> as outlined herein, can lead to a rational choice for seal <b>balance</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E

Specifically, the trade <b>balance</b> <b>ratio</b> is more negatively correlated with output in emerging economies than in developed economies, suggesting that the trade balance is more sensitive to output changes in the former group. This paper explores whether this difference is caused by international borrowing constraints imposed on emerging economies. By modeling the borrowing constraints as conditional on macroeconomic performance, the paper shows that when a positive shock takes place in emerging economies, $GDP$ increases and the borrowing constraint becomes less binding, which results in less incentive to accumulate foreign assets. When a negative shock is present, in contrast, $GDP$ decreases, and the representative household has to increase the trade balance to avoid the possibly binding borrowing constraints. ...|$|E
