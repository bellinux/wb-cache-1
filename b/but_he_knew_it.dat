500|$|Alanguilan did {{not expect}} Elmer to be as {{successful}} as it later became, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> {{was good enough to}} pay for professional printing. He self-published it in the Philippines between 2006 and 2008 as a four-issue miniseries under the name [...] "Komikero Publishing." [...] The second and third issues had twice as many pages as a standard comic book. In 2006, he sent copies of the first issue to online columnists, reviewers, retailers, and industry insiders to let people know it existed. This self-promotion led the book to get good reviews from well-known writers like Steven Grant and Neil Gaiman and a widely read interview with Tom Spurgeon on [...] "The Comics Reporter." [...] The Spurgeon interview led the entertainment megastore Forbidden Planet to order copies directly from Alanguilan and promote it with special offers.|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} Wanamaker's Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a {{colleague}} {{who had seen}} him dance, of {{a role in the}} upcoming production Every Sailor. A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled Every Woman. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while waiting to go on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: [...] "For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within the Assembly, the {{republicans}} were gaining {{at the expense of}} the constitutional monarchists, but they were also divided into several factions, with Thiers usually among the moderate republicans while Leon Gambetta lead the far left. The right was also divided into factions, some wishing a constitutional monarchy under the Orleanist Count of Paris, others under the Bourbon Count of Chambord. It was a very unstable mixture. Early in his Presidency, Thiers declared, [...] "In general, the country is wise, but the political parties are not. It is these, and only these, that we have to fear. It is only these which we have to guard against." [...] Thiers wrote late in his memoirs that he would have preferred a constitutional monarchy, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was impossible at that moment, given the strong majority of republicans, and supporting a monarchy would have been [...] "a violation of my duties toward France; [...] I had as my mission to pacify and to prevent the conflicts of parties." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{visiting a}} couple of mines in search of Quadratus, he finally catches up with him. It turns out that Laeta did not have as much control over the Quinctii as he thought, {{and some of the}} killings were Quadratus’ idea. Quadratus tries to bluff, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it’s</b> too late to recover the dream of all that control. Ignoring Falco, he descends a ladder, slips and falls to his death. Falco can only wonder how much of an {{accident}} it was.|$|R
50|$|As the war {{comes to}} an end, Nicholas returns to his home on Hong Kong Island, and when he returned, {{everything}} is ruined, his home is badly damaged. As he walks through the house he finds his mother. Nicholas does not recognise her, she seems much older and exhausted, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is his mother. It is nearly four years since he was last at home. At first he introduces himself as Wing Ming, then he remembers that he is Nicholas Holford.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Navy sailor Alex Winkley (Bill Williams) {{wakes up}} from a night of {{drinking}} in New York City and finds he has a wad of cash. His memory is hazy, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>he</b> got <b>it</b> from a woman he had visited earlier in the evening, Edna Bartelli (Lola Lane).|$|R
60|$|No doubt {{had ever}} crossed Philip's {{mind on the}} subject, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was not a thing to state of oneself.|$|E
6000|$|London wakened and he, imperturbable, [...] Passed from waking {{to hurry}} after shadows ... Busied upon shows of no earthly importance? [...] Yes, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she assented. [...] "But {{you might}} be sorry again that you had said it." [...] It sounded like coquetry, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was not coquetry.|$|E
5000|$|At his point, [...] is unknown, {{but it is}} {{the same}} for each equation. Rejewski does not <b>know</b> , <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is one of the rotors (I, II, and III), and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> the wiring for each of those rotors. There were only three rotors and 26 {{possible}} initial rotations. Consequently, there are only 84 possible values for [...] Rejewski can look at each possible value to see if the [...] permutation is consistent. If there were no steckers ( [...] were the identity), then each equation would produce the same [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; we've got one bully {{all right}} enough," [...] {{answered}} Spouter. [...] "Slogwell Brown is his name, but everybody calls him Slugger. He's from the country, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> thinks <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> all {{and is very}} overbearing. You've got to keep your eye open for Slugger or you'll get into trouble sure." ...|$|R
60|$|TANNER. Yes; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> won't <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> poor devil. <b>He</b> is a {{thousand}} times too good for you. That's why {{he is going to}} make the mistake of his life about you.|$|R
60|$|Blake {{laughed as}} {{he found a}} seat. He {{imagined}} that their appearance must have been somewhat startling, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> takes a good deal to disturb the equanimity of a Hudson Bay Scot.|$|E
6000|$|He said [...] "No," [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> {{was every}} word of it true, because his aunt had seen it herself. Whereupon we covered him over with the tablecloth, {{and he went to}} sleep.|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not know}} the tune, which was 'Home, Sweet Home,' <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was saying, 'Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy'; and he cried exultantly, 'You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Derek was now fermenting. What {{she ought}} to have said, <b>he</b> did not <b>know,</b> <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>it</b> was not [...] "Yes?" [...] "Yes?" [...] in the {{circumstances}} was almost as bad as [...] "Really?" ...|$|R
60|$|CRICHTON (after {{turning to}} LADY MARY, who whispers to him). As {{soon as the}} bridal skirt can be prepared. (His manner has been most indulgent, and without the {{slightest}} suggestion of patronage. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is best for all that he should keep his place, and that his presence hampers them.) My friends, I {{thank you for your}} good wishes, I thank you all. And now, perhaps you would like me to leave you to yourselves. Be joyous. Let there be song and dance to-night. Polly, I shall take my coffee in the parlour--you understand.|$|R
50|$|Marcus now realizes what {{is going}} on and understands why it was {{necessary}} to kill Sara and Carmen. They had seen the statue, which is why the villagers had to kill them, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> himself hasn't. The cultists weren't sacrificing anyone; they were trying to prevent demonic possession from taking place. Knowing this, Marcus assists Henryk and the others by holding Carmen's head still. With the mask now in place, Henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. Carmen returns to normal and asks Marcus for help <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is just a trick. Henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on Carmen, killing her.|$|R
60|$|My under-study sighed, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> {{was of no}} use to {{make any}} objections. He did not fail, however, to {{endeavor}} to impress upon me the importance of consulting my watch while listening to Miss Laniston's communication.|$|E
60|$|Thirlwell frowned. He {{had made}} no {{plans for the future}} and {{certainly}} did not mean to trade upon Agatha's gratitude, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would hurt him, so to speak, to drop out and let her look for other help.|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not know}} the tune, which was [...] "Home, Sweet Home," [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was saying, [...] "Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy"; and he cried exultantly, [...] "You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!" ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Matt and Lohan {{have arrived}} in Brazil and Matt is {{encouraging}} Lohan {{to sell him}} for money. He sells him to a drug lord, then they both get wound up in mining. Matt visits the dreamworld in the library where the Librarian gets the book of Matt's life out for him to read all the way through. Matt does and is shocked at his future which reveals him being betrayed then tortured and killed. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is destiny so he goes along with it, knowing that it will work. First, {{he needs to get}} to Antarctica and to do this he needs to find one of the doors.|$|R
5000|$|After {{leaving the}} hospital, Mr. Magorium asks Molly {{how she is}} doing with the Congreve Cube and asks {{what would happen if}} she {{believed}} in it. Molly does not understand but attempts to prevent Mr. Magorium's departure by showing him the joys of life, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is time for his story to end. Utilizing the stage notes of Shakespeare's King Lear to make the point about the importance of death, Magorium states the last lines {{of one of the most}} important pieces of dramatic literature are simply [...] " [...] he dies" [...] before his death. Molly, Eric, all the children and their parents have a funeral for him.|$|R
5000|$|In anger {{the brother}} smashes Mi-sun's head hard four times {{against the window}} causing her to {{collapse}} with bleeding to the head <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is true as his sister regresses to a little girl again. Mi-sun's (dead) father comes into the driver's cabin and pilots the train harmlessly through the train that {{it was on a}} collision with and the crazy man reverts to a scared child comforting his sister. As the trains, natural and supernatural begin to part, things start getting back to normal on the train with the ghosts disassembling, the old carriages becoming normal again and the human passengers start coming out of hiding.|$|R
60|$|When Dave awoke all {{was still}} dark around him. How long he had slept he could not tell, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> must have been for some time, for he felt wonderfully refreshed. Getting up, he {{stretched}} himself, and his eyes roved around the chamber.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice gave Harding a {{sympathetic}} glance, and unconsciously {{he set his}} lips tight. She looked cool and somehow ethereal in her thin white dress {{and her eyes were}} gentle. It was horrible to think that he might have to give her up; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> might come to this.|$|E
60|$|Inkspot did not {{understand}} all this, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was a threat, and he well understood the language of a blow in the face. After a while he went to sleep, but, if he smelt again the odor {{of the contents of}} the bottle, he had no more heavenly dreams.|$|E
50|$|God's foreknowledge of {{the future}} is {{exhaustive}} and complete, and therefore the future is certain and not contingent on human action. God does not determine the future, <b>but</b> <b>He</b> does <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> God's certainty and human contingency are compatible.|$|R
5000|$|Boldizsár, {{the other}} {{important}} mason, {{he is also}} committed to the building. He {{is the one who}} comes up with the human sacrifice idea, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>it's</b> only important because it's giving faith to the people - Kelemen knows that beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{no doubt}} true," [...] Bernard agreed. None of his {{relations}} had so far disputed his firm rule, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> when <b>it</b> was prudent not to exercise his power. [...] "You are a philosopher," [...] he went on. [...] "It is sometimes an advantage to use a light hand." ...|$|R
60|$|Pretty soon Reddy Fox heard a voice. It {{was very}} faint, for you know Reddy {{was in his}} bedroom way underground, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> He pricked up his ears and listened. It {{was the voice of}} Bowser the Hound, and Reddy knew by the sound that Bowser was chasing Granny Fox.|$|E
6000|$|Mar. [...] I have {{informed}} him, not so gently, [...] 260 [...] Doubtless, as your nice feelings would prescribe, [...] The indulgence of your colleagues; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> [...] If {{you come}} for our thanks, take them, and hence! [...] The dungeon gloom is deep enough without you, [...] And full of reptiles, not less loathsome, though [...] Their sting is honester.|$|E
6000|$|He {{wanted to}} ask her to go with him down to Cedarville to the Methodist camp-meeting, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was impossible. He could not even say [...] "good day" [...] when she took pains to pass near him after church. He nodded like a great idiot, all ease and dignity lost, his throat too dry and hot to utter a sound.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so. I fancy myself {{that not one}} of them does a wrong thing, <b>but</b> what <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> to be wrong just as well as you do, and is much more ashamed and frightened about it already, than you can ever make him by preaching at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Inga {{was sorry}} for the poor child, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> how {{important}} <b>it</b> was that he regain possession of the Magic Pearls. So he said, pleadingly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} very {{persistent}} even before I left Vienna. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> must <b>know</b> that <b>it</b> is hopeless. I have never encouraged him." ...|$|R
