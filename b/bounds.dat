It is natural to ask (1) whether an order <b>bounded</b> subset is topologically <b>bounded</b> and (2) whether a topologically <b>bounded</b> subset is order <b>bounded.</b> A {{classical}} result gives a partial answer to (1) by saying that an order <b>bounded</b> subset of a locally solid Riesz space is topologically <b>bounded.</b> This paper attempts to further investigate these two questions. In particular, we show that (i) there exists a non-locally solid topological Riesz space in which every order <b>bounded</b> subset is topologically bounded; (ii) if a topological Riesz space is not locally solid, an order <b>bounded</b> subset need not be topologically bounded; (iii) a topologically <b>bounded</b> subset need not be order <b>bounded</b> even in a locally convex-solid Riesz space. Next, we show that (iv) if a locally solid Riesz space has an order <b>bounded</b> topological neighborhood of zero, then every topologically <b>bounded</b> subset is order bounded; (v) however, a locally convex-solid Riesz space may not possess an order <b>bounded</b> topological neighborhood of zero even if every topologically <b>bounded</b> subset is order bounded; (vi) a pseudometrizable locally solid Riesz space need not have an order <b>bounded</b> topological neighborhood of zero.
