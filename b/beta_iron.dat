40|$|Aluminium oxide {{thin films}} were {{deposited}} by metal-organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD) on stainless steel substrates, (AISI 304). The deposition was studied systematically in a hot-wall CVD reactor (HWR) at atmospheric pressure. The used precursors were aluminium acetylacetonate (Al(acac) 3) and synthetic air, which are nontoxic and easy to handle. The phase composition, surface morphology and chemical composition of the films were studied by XRD, SEM and EDX, respectively. The deposition starts at 350 °C and the maximum growth rate occurs at a substrate temperature of 475 °C. Increasing the furnace temperature beyond 500 °C leads to depletion of the precursor and thus the maximum deposition rate is shifted towards the gas inlet. Films deposited at 500 °C were transparent and amorphous. They consist mainly of Al and O, although the existence of aluminium hydroxides can not be excluded. Annealing at higher temperatures leads to crystallization and phase transformations: at 800 °C γ-Al 2 O 3 films are obtained and at 1115 °C α-Al 2 O 3 is formed. The films are stable up to 800 °C, at higher temperature they are spalling. <b>Beta</b> <b>iron</b> disilicide thin films (β-FeSi 2) were successfully deposited by low pressure metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on silicon substrates, Si(100) using ferrocene (Fe(C 5 H 5) 2) and TMS (Si(CH 3) 4) as precursors. These CVD experiments were performed {{for the first time}} in a Halogen Lamp CVD Reactor (HLR) designed for this investigation. By this design, a maximum set point temperature of 800 °C and any temperature down to room temperature can be easily achieved and controlled. This control allows possible deposition of different films at different deposition temperature within the same experimental run. Preparation of iron disilicide films by using a direct deposition technique (DDT) and a step deposition technique (SDT) with later annealing were studied. In DDT ferrocene and TMS were supplied into the CVD chamber at the same time. For SDT each precursor was supplied separately in order to deposit an iron film followed by a silicon film, finally the iron silicide is formed in an annealing step. The phase composition, surface morphology and chemical composition of the films were studied by XRD, SEM and EDX, respectively. Films deposited by DDT at 785 - 800 °C and 30 mbar were transparent, amorphous, and well adhesive. EDX analysis shows that the films consist of silicon and very small amount of iron. The films prepared by SDT were formed from crystalline iron films deposited on the substrate at 700 °C and amorphous silicon films deposited on the surface of the iron films at 800 °C. Also, iron films and silicon films were deposited separately on silicon and steel substrates respectively before performing the SDT. It was found that the iron films can not be deposited directly from ferrocene because of the presence of high level of carbon in the film. Therefore, the carbon containing films were treated with hydrogen in order to produce pure films. After purification XRD analyses show that the films are crystalline (α-Fe). Amorphous silicon films were deposited at 800 °C and 30 mbar. A mixture of iron disilicide phases, FeSi, FeSi 2 and β-FeSi 2 can be prepared by annealing the SDT deposited films 2 hr at 900 - 950 °C...|$|E

The iron overload can be removed by Deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, which has a dose- dependent effect on iron burden. Every unit of transfused blood contains 200–250mg of iron and the body has no natural mechanism to remove excess iron Deferasirox is a vital part in the patients health after blood transfusions. During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to transferrin, but with an iron overload, the ability for transferrin to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received Deferasirox experienced no drug-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which was present with other iron chelators. Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation. Cardiac failure is a main cause of illness from transfusional iron overload but deferasirox demonstrated the ability to remove iron from iron-loaded myocardial cells protecting beta thalassemia patients from effects of required blood transfusions.|$|R

Ferrihydrite is {{a poorly}} ordered iron (oxyhydr) oxide, {{ubiquitous}} in near-surface environments, {{where it is}} an important scavenger of numerous toxic metals and metalloids (Cornell & Schwertmann 2003). Being metastable, ferrihydrite transforms with time into stable phases, usually goethite and/or hematite. The latter is also a final product of ferrihydrite thermal conversion via both, hydrothermal and dry-heating pathways. The transformation course is affected by many factors and for this reason its details are still under debate. Pure ferrihydrite practically does not exist in nature. The admixtures present in its composition affect many properties of the oxyhydroxide, including surface chemistry, sorption effectiveness, crystallinity, magnetic ordering and solubility. Silicate, probably the most important natural impurity, was shown to hamper thermal transformation of ferrihydrite. The process was studied in detail only for relatively low-Si samples (Campbell et al. 2002). In some environments, such as modern seafloor hydrothermal vents, higher Si/Fe proportion have been found (Sun et al. 2013). The objective of this work was to determine if (and if so, how) the high silicate content in ferrihydrite modifies its thermal transformation. Ferrihydrite samples of high Si/Fe molar ratios (0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 00, and 1. 50) were obtained by reaction of Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 with NaOH in the presence of Na 2 SiO 3 at pH 8. 2 (Vempati & Loeppert 1989). The products were characterized using X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Simultaneous thermal analyses, including differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetry (TG) and quadrupole mass spectrometry of evolved gases (QMS) were also performed. All of the ferrihydrites were heated from 30 °C • min− 1 to 1000 °C • min− 1, at 10 °C • min− 1 in flowing air, using preheated sample as an inert material. The samples were also heated to various temperatures, chosen {{on the basis of the}} analysis of their thermal patterns. The heating was stopped immediately when reaching the desired temperature. The sample was removed, rapidly cooled in air and characterized again by XRD, FTIR and SEM. The thermal patterns revealed that the presence of Si in ferrihydrite hampers its conversion to hematite, which is reflected by shifting of the hematite crystallization exotherm to temperature as high as ca. 920 °C, in comparison to 350 – 460 °C when Si-free ferrihydrite is annealed (Pieczara et al. 2014). XRD patterns and FTIR spectra of the samples heated to 1000 °C show the presence of hematite and cristobalite. It was observed that the higher molar Si-to-Fe ratio in initial mineral results in the higher cristobalite concentration in the product. SEM observation showed that hematite crystallites, embedded in cryptocrystalline silica, are distinctly smaller than those produced from pure ferrihydrite. They also exhibit wider range of crystal habits – isometric grains, plates, rods and even needles were encountered. Elongated crystallites (rods and needles) appear to be more common in the highest-Si products. Moreover, whilst during transformation of pure ferrihydrite into hematite no distinct intermediate phase is formed, the conversion of high-Si ferrihydrite proceeds by much more complex pathway. After low-temperature dehydration, the material still exhibits two-peak ferrihydrite-like XRD pattern, but a gradual amorphisation is observed up to ca. 600 °C. Then, at 650 °C amorphous silica emerges which is followed by the formation of nanocrystalline maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3) between 700 °C and 800 °C. Subsequently, maghemite is transformed to orthorhombic ε-Fe 2 O 3 phase at 800 – 850 °C. In the samples of 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 0 Si/Fe ratios, further increase of temperature results in ε-Fe 2 O 3 conversion to hematite and crystallization of cristobalite-like phase. However, XRD patterns of annealed the highest-Si sample (Si/Fe = 1. 5) show also the presence of β-Fe 2 O 3 between 907 °C and 930 °C. At 907 °C hematite appears and ε-Fe 2 O 3 vanishes by 930 °C, so at the latter temperature two Fe 2 O 3 polymorphs (α and β) are present. At 1000 °C hematite is the sole iron oxide in all the products. Thus siliceous ferrihydrites transform into hematite via γ–ε or γ–ε–β pathway, depending on the Si/Fe ratio. Formation of rare epsilon and <b>beta</b> <b>iron</b> oxide polymorphs from high-Si ferrihydrites can be explained by emerging of amorphous SiO 2 during annealing, which subsequently acts as antisintering agent stabilizing maghemite precursor against its direct thermal conversion to hematite. Our results show that high silicate content causes not only the retarding of ferrihydrite conversion to hematite but also affects crystallinity of the product and complicates the transformation pathway. In the authors’ opinion the formation of rare epsilon and beta Fe 2 O 3 is noteworthy for at least two reasons. Firstly, β- and, especially, ε-Fe 2 O 3 have been recently found to exhibit many interesting physical properties, which make them attractive nanomaterials for use in a wide range of applications (Machala et al. 2011). Annealing of Si-ferrihydrites might offer an alternative method of obtaining these oxides. Secondly, both these oxides have not been found in nature yet. This work suggests that their formation is possible in places where siliceous ferrihydrites or other Si-Fe amorphous sediments have been heated to high temperature, as in e. g. hydrothermal systems of mid-ocean ridges.

This {{study investigated the}} possible correlation among the erythrocyte indices of oxidative stress, the leukocyte panels of antioxidant proteins (metallothioneins), the serum biochemical parameters and the liver steatosis grade. METHODS: A total of 118 cases including 60 alcoholic subjects and 58 controls were enrolled. All the alcoholic subjects were screened for body mass index (BMI), liver steatosis, and blood chemistry and serology. The level of oxidative stress and oxidative stress-related parameters were measured in the blood and correlated with clinical findings. RESULTS: Alcoholic subjects showed higher BMI, moderate/severe hepatic steatosis, increase in the levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, alpha 1 and <b>beta</b> 2 globulins, <b>iron</b> {{and a decrease in}} the levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and beta 1 globulin with respect to the reference values.

We found that the spectrum consists of a thermal plasma, a hard power-law tail, and two Gaussian lines. The plasma component (kT~ 2. 2 keV) is established from the presence of CaXIX and FeXXV K alpha lines as well as the absence of FeXXVI K alpha line. The two Gaussian lines represent the K alpha and <b>beta</b> lines from <b>iron</b> at lower ionization stages. Both the line centers and the intensity ratio of these two lines are consistent with the neutral iron. The hard power-law tail (index~ 0. 7) was found to have no pronounced iron K edge feature. In comparison with the published Chandra spectra, we conclude that the thermal component is from the ensemble of point-like sources plus thermal diffuse emission concentrated at the cluster center, while the Gaussian and the hard tail components are from the non-thermal diffuse emission extended in a larger scale. In the band-limited XIS images, the distribution of the 7. 5 - 10. 0 keV emission resembles that of the 6. 4 keV emission. This strongly suggests that the power-law emission is related to the 6. 4 and 7. 1 keV lines in the underlying physics. We discuss two ideas to explain both the hard continuum and the lines: (1) X-ray photoionization that produces fluorescence lines and the Thomson scattering continuum and (2) non-thermal electron impact ionization of iron atoms and bremsstrahlung continuum. But whichever scenario is adopted, the photon or particle flux from the Arches cluster is too low to account for the observed line and continuum intensity. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, PASJ in press.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} project involved {{laboratory experiments}} to investigate three hypotheses: (H 1) Physics-based modeling of low-frequency dispersions (henceforth {{referred to as}} alpha) measured in broadband dielectric spectroscopy (DS) data can quantify pore-scale geometric changes impacting contaminant transport resulting from biomineralization; (H 2) Physics-based modeling of high-frequency dispersions (henceforth referred to as beta) measured in broadband dielectric spectroscopy data can quantify rates of mineral growth in/on the cell wall; (H 3) Application of this measurement and modeling approach can enhance geophysical interpretation of bioremediation experiments conducted at the RIFLE IFC by providing constraints on bioremediation efficiency (biomass concentration, mineral uptake within the cell wall, biomineralization rate). We tested H 1 by performing DS measurements (alpha and <b>beta</b> range) on <b>iron</b> (Fe) particles of dimensions similar to microbial cells, dispersed within agar gels over a range of Fe concentrations. We have tested {{the ability of the}} physics-based modeling to predict volume concentrations of the Fe particles by assuming that the Fe particles are polarizable inclusions within an otherwise nonpolarizable medium. We evaluated the smallest volume concentration that can be detected with the DS method. Similar experiments and modeling have been performed on the sulfate-reducing bacteria D. vulgaris. Synchrotron x-ray absorption measurements were conducted to determine the local structure of biominerals coatings on D. vulgaris which were grown in the presence of different Fe concentrations. We imaged the mineral growth on cell wall using SEM. We used dielectric spectroscopy to differentiate between iron sulfide precipitates of biotic and abiotic nature. Biotic measurements were made on D. vulgaris bacteria grown in the presence of different concentrations of iron to form different thicknesses of iron sulfide precipitates around themselves and abiotic measurements were made on different concentrations of pyrrhotite particles suspended in agar. Results show a decrease in dielectric permittivity as a function of frequency for biotic minerals and an opposite trend is observed for abiotic minerals. Our results suggest that dielectric spectroscopy offers a noninvasive and fast approach for distinguishing between abiotic and biotic mineral precipitates...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional {{benefits}} of neglected, traditional vegetables Judith Kimiywe Kenyatta University, Kenya Suggested introduction Many African meals now include exotic vegetables like carrot, tomato, onion and cabbage. These are crops that were introduced {{here and have}} really taken off. But all over Africa, there are nutritionists, scientists and researchers {{who are trying to}} convince us to kick out the carrots, turn down the tomatoes and welcome back indigenous leafy vegetables onto our plates instead. In Kenya no one is more enthusiastic in this message than Judith Kimiywe from Kenyatta University. As Winnie Onyimbo found out when she met her, Dr. Kimiywe?s love of traditional but neglected crops began when she was a very small child. Track 4 In	?When did you discover? Out	? treatment of certain diseases. Duration	 6 ? 12 ? Suggested closing announcement: That was Dr Judith Kimiywe from Kenya explaining to Winnie Onyimbo how traditional leafy vegetables are slowly making their way into our farms, markets and eventually onto our plates. Contact details: Dr Judith Kimiywe Nutritionist, Kenyatta University Department of Foods, Nutrition and Dietetics, P. O Box 43844, Nairobi, Kenya Email: jokimiywe@yahoo. com Website: www. ku. ac. ke Transcript Onyimbo	When did you discover that traditional vegetables have special health benefits? Kimiywe	I have always known about the {{benefits of}} traditional vegetables right from my early childhood when I was exposed to them by my grandparents. And this is because I was a sickly child and we thought the only remedy was to eat certain vegetables which they associated with the healing of some of the elements that I was suffering from, like stomach aches, tonsils and even later in life, ulcers. My background as a nutritionist has actually triggered my interest in the traditional foods as the best source for availing the micronutrient deficiencies which have been with us for a long, long time, particularly of interest are foods that are rich in vitamin A or <b>beta</b> carotene, <b>iron</b> and iodine and zinc, which have featured prominently in our health programmes. Those {{are some of the things}} that also triggered my interest in promoting traditional foods which I know have got a high potential for those nutrients. Onyimbo	You talked of iodine and you talked of vitamins. How does this help in the body? Kimiywe	Well one of the key things about micronutrients is that they provide preventative measure against very many key health conditions that people may suffer from. Onyimbo	Give us two examples of out-of-fashion vegetables that are good for us to eat. Kimiywe	There is a whole wide range of traditional vegetables but the most common ones that are on the market now are easily available and accessible to people and acceptable for the majority of the people that have had exposure to indigenous vegetables, include vegetables like the spider weed or the sweet potato leaves, cassava leaves and a whole range of other vegetables that are picked from the wild. Onyimbo	I have a carrot and a tomato in my hands. What special benefits will I get from the traditional vegetables we have been talking about in comparison to the tomato and the carrot? Kimiywe	These ones do not contain the green colour, the green matter which the vegetables have which also carry with it other nutrients that are not necessarily in the carrot and the tomato. Because of the nature of their composition as green leafy vegetables, they are carrying other substances that are also important in contributing towards the health of the individual, in different ways. Green leafy vegetables will contain a higher level of minerals such as iron and calcium and zinc compared to the carrot and the tomato. Onyimbo	What is a proper way to cook the underutilised vegetables? I understand you can lose the nutrients by boiling them. How should someone cook them so that you don?t lose any nutrients? Kimiywe	We do not want prolonged cooking because too long a period of cooking beyond ten minutes usually interferes with the amount of available nutrients in that vegetable. And particularly if the vegetable is cooked in water and the water is thrown away. So what we are trying to do right now is to come up with recipes, agreeable recipes based on the traditional recipes but a little bit modified in terms of retention of nutrients. The other thing we are building on is the indigenous knowledge of what people used to do with these vegetables. One of the things they used to do was to combine different types of vegetables. And that way they make a mixture of vegetables. Now it is a good thing to do because each vegetable has got its own strength as far as the nutrient content is concerned. The other good thing was that traditionally in some communities they add coconut milk to the vegetables, or they add pounded groundnut powder or sesame powder, and some communities they add avocado pear that is mashed into the vegetables and that helps to enhance the vegetables in two ways. These additives provide a fat medium which is very important for the absorption and utilisation of the vitamin A. Essential fatty acids from the oil-based product are very important for protecting the body, for growth, for the smooth skin, for good eyes and for children for growth generally. These fat mediums are also good carriers of vitamin E, which is a key anti-oxidant in the body. Onyimbo	In your opinion do you think these underutilised vegetables or neglected vegetables will be back in fashion? Back on our plates, back in our markets? Kimiywe	The promotion of these vegetables has created a very high demand, particularly in this area of going natural. Because of the very many diseases that have come up, cancer, is threatening right now, diabetes is another health condition that has made people look towards using natural foods. Things like TB, HIV/AIDS and many other illnesses, health conditions that have made people go back to use of traditional foods as a way of managing, controlling or preventing these illnesses. Thanks to the traditional medicine people, they are also emphasising the use of these foods when they are giving the remedies for treatment of certain diseases. End of track. Judith Kimiywe, a nutritionist from Kenyatta University, believes that traditional vegetables are an ideal solution for the micronutrient deficiencies that are a common cause of poor health. Leafy vegetables like spider weed, sweet potato and cassava leaves, and other food plants picked from the wild are high in vitamin A, iron, zinc and iodine. Mixing different types of vegetables helps to achieve a good balance of nutrients, which protect the body from many kinds of illness and can help to manage conditions such as diabetes, HIV and TB...|$|R
