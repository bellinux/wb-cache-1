25|$|Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{distinguished}} {{heat transfer}} by thermal radiation (radiant heat) from that by convection and conduction in 1777. In 1791, Pierre Prévost showed that all bodies radiate heat, {{no matter how}} hot or cold they are. In 1804, Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation.</b> Though it had become to be suspected even from Scheele's work, in 1831 Macedonio Melloni demonstrated that <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation</b> could be reflected, refracted and polarised {{in the same way}} as light.|$|E
25|$|In physics, a photon gas is a {{gas-like}} {{collection of}} photons, which has {{many of the}} same properties of a conventional gas like hydrogen or neon – including pressure, temperature, and entropy. The most common example of a photon gas in equilibrium is <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{planets and}} stars are neither in thermal {{equilibrium}} with their surroundings nor perfect <b>black</b> <b>bodies,</b> black-body <b>radiation</b> {{is used as}} a first approximation for the energy they emit.Black holes are near-perfect <b>black</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{in the sense that they}} absorb all the radiation that falls on them. It has been proposed that they emit black-body radiation (called Hawking radiation), with a temperature that depends on the mass of the black hole.|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to merge the {{microscopic}} with the macroscopic worlds, we present a brief study about a force which depends on the Planck force and on the coupling constant that in turn depends {{on the size of}} a particle in a particular direction (space dimension). We then apply this force to <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiations</b> from which we deduce Hawking Radiations, Stefan radiation law and the level at which the profound theories of physics are consistent. In conclusion, it true that the world exists in both macro and microscopic situations, in away that, the higher the value of the space dimension the smaller the size of the particles we are studying and the smaller the value of the space dimension the larger the size of the particle.

25|$|The {{advantage}} of alkyl aluminium and similar compounds {{is the high}} content of carbon and hydrogen, resulting in bright emission lines similar to spectral signature of burning jet fuel. Controlled content of solid combustion products, generating continuous <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation,</b> allows further matching of emission characteristics to the net infrared emissions of fuel exhaust and hot engine components.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, Oliver Heaviside {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} the Kennelly–Heaviside layer of the ionosphere which bears his name. Heaviside's proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the Earth's curvature. Heaviside's proposal, coupled with Planck's law of <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation,</b> may have hampered the growth of radio astronomy for the detection of electromagnetic waves from celestial bodies until 1932 (and the development of high-frequency radio transceivers). Also in 1902, Arthur Edwin Kennelly discovered some of the ionosphere's radio-electrical properties.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{difference between the}} black hole radiation as computed by Hawking and thermal radiation emitted from a black body is that the latter is statistical in nature, and only its average satisfies {{what is known as}} Planck's law of <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation,</b> while the former fits the data better. Thus thermal radiation contains information about the body that emitted it, while Hawking radiation seems to contain no such information, and depends only on the mass, angular momentum, and charge of the black hole (the no-hair theorem). This leads to the black hole information paradox.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Light source {{temperature}} measurement {{has been an}} important aspect in many industrial applications. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the temperature of different sources like flames, incandescent lamps. The sensor installation is difficult in these sources. Imaging these sources to correlate with the temperature is attempted. A digital still camera is used to capture the source images. The optical characteristics of CCD sensor are not mentioned in the camera specifications. It is desired that the device bandwidth should be greater than the source bandwidth. Hence, the optical characteristics of the camera are also obtained. As Incandescent lamp is the most familiar light source its photographs are taken. The images are taken at known excitation voltages in a dark room with camera settings unaltered. Filament temperature is a function of intensity. Intensity difference of two consecutive images is found out by image subtraction. Unwanted part of image, like reflection from the shell is removed by thresholding and segmentation. The colour temperature of the filament can be found out with reference to <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiations.</b> If these values are compared with standard temperatures, source temperature values can be predicted...|$|R
25|$|In 1901, Max Planck {{published}} an analysis that succeeded in reproducing the observed spectrum of light emitted by a glowing object. To accomplish this, Planck {{had to make}} an ad hoc mathematical assumption of quantized energy of the oscillators (atoms of the <b>black</b> <b>body)</b> that emit <b>radiation.</b> Einstein later proposed that electromagnetic radiation itself is quantized, not the energy of radiating atoms.|$|R
2500|$|Heating {{it further}} causes the colour {{to change from}} red to yellow, white, and blue, as light at shorter {{wavelengths}} (higher frequencies) begins to be emitted. A perfect emitter is also a perfect absorber: [...] when it is cold, such an object looks perfectly black, because it absorbs all the light that falls on it and emits none. Consequently, an ideal thermal emitter {{is known as a}} <b>black</b> <b>body,</b> and the <b>radiation</b> it emits is called black-body radiation.|$|R
25|$|Temperature {{measurement}} {{was initially}} done by Basset using an optical pyrometer {{to measure the}} intensity of the incandescent light from the sample. Colleagues at UC Berkeley were better able to utilize the <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation</b> and more accurately measure the temperature. The hot spot produced by the laser also created large thermal gradients in between the portions of sample that were hit by the focused laser and those that were not. The solution to this problem is ongoing but advances have been made with the introduction of a double-sided approach.|$|E
25|$|Black {{holes are}} sites of immense {{gravitational}} attraction. Classically, the gravitation {{is so powerful}} that nothing, not even electromagnetic radiation, can escape from the black hole. It is yet unknown how gravity {{can be incorporated into}} quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, far from the black hole the gravitational effects can be weak enough for calculations to be reliably performed in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Hawking showed that quantum effects allow black holes to emit exact <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation.</b> The electromagnetic radiation is produced as if emitted by a black body with a temperature inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Freeman Dyson {{observed}} that every developing human civilization constantly increases its energy consumption, and, he conjectured, a civilization {{might try to}} harness {{a large part of}} the energy produced by a star. He proposed that a Dyson sphere could be a possible means: a shell or cloud of objects enclosing a star to absorb and utilize as much radiant energy as possible. Such a feat of astroengineering would drastically alter the observed spectrum of the star involved, changing it at least partly from the normal emission lines of a natural stellar atmosphere to those of <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation,</b> probably with a peak in the infrared. Dyson speculated that advanced alien civilizations might be detected by examining the spectra of stars and searching for such an altered spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|Consider a spherical {{star and}} a spherical planet. The star {{and the planet}} are {{considered}} to be perfect <b>black</b> <b>bodies.</b> The planet has an albedo and only absorbs a fraction of radiation, depending on its surface characteristics. The star emits radiation isotropically according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law which travels a distance equal to the orbital distance of the planet, D. The planet absorbs the radiation that isn't reflected by the albedo of the surface, and heats up. Since the planet is also a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> which emits <b>radiation</b> according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, it will emit radiation and lose energy. Thermal equilibrium exists when the power supplied by the star is equal to the power emitted by the planet. The temperature at which this balance occurs is the planetary equilibrium temperature and is equal to: ...|$|R
40|$|After a short introduction, the observing {{capabilities}} {{in the near}} [...] infrared bands of the camera/spectrograph NICS designed for the TNG are discussed, along with the expected performance in term of limiting magnitudes. The {{second part of the}} paper describes some technical details of the project, such as cryogenics, mechanics, and the system which executes data acquisition and control with the related software. 1.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, we {{obtained}} exact solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model of gravitational collapse, employing a lattice regularization. In this paper, we derive Hawking radiation in non-marginally bound models from our exact solutions. We {{show that a}} non-vanishing energy function does not spoil the (approximate) Planck spectrum near the horizon. We can also reliably compute corrections to the Bogoliubov coefficient because our solutions are exact. The corrections are obtained by going beyond the near horizon region and are shown to introduce additional greybody factors, which modify the <b>black</b> <b>body</b> spectrum of <b>radiation</b> from the black hole.

25|$|Similar {{considerations}} apply {{whenever the}} energy level spacing {{is much larger}} than the thermal energy. For example, this reasoning was used by Max Planck and Albert Einstein to resolve the ultraviolet catastrophe of blackbody radiation. The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the electromagnetic field in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy kBT, there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container. However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ν goes to infinity; moreover, Planck's law of <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation,</b> which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.|$|E
25|$|A very {{important}} {{difference between a}} gas of massive particles and a photon gas with a black body distribution is {{that the number of}} photons in the system is not conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This electron may drop back to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an individual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the photon energies of the emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons will vary. It can be shown that, {{as a result of this}} lack of constraint on the number of photons in the system, the chemical potential of the photons must be zero for <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{experiments}} with laser heating, temperature {{came from a}} calibration of laser power made with known melting points of various materials. When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known <b>black</b> <b>body</b> <b>radiation</b> spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – According to {{generally}} accepted physical model, {{the synthesis of}} the heavy elements may happen in the supernova explosions {{at a very high}} temperature. As a consequence of nuclear fusion, the supernova stars emit a very strong electromagnetic (EM) radiation dominantly in form of gamma rays and X-rays. The intensive EM radiation drastically decreases the masses of the exploding stars, directly causing mass defects of the nuclei. The general description of the <b>black</b> <b>body</b> EM <b>radiation</b> is based on the Planck’s famous radiation theory, which supposes the existence of independent quantum oscillators inside the <b>black</b> <b>body.</b> In this paper, it is supposed that in exploding supernova stars, the EM radiating oscillators can be identified with the nascent heavy elements loosing their specific yields of own masses in the radiation process. The final binding energy of the nuclei is determined additionally by the strong neutrino radiation, which also follows the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in extremely high temperature. Extending to very high temperatures of the Planck’s EM radiation law for discrete radiation energies, a very simple formula has been obtained for the description of the measured neutral atomic masses. Keywords: atomic mass, Planck’s radiation law, the origin of the elements, nuclei binding energy, nuclear synthesis model. 1...|$|R
40|$|Temperature can be {{measured}} via emitted thermal radiation of the measured object using Max Planck’s law of thermal radiation, which describes the emission of thermal radiation {{as a function of}} temperature of an ideal <b>black</b> <b>body.</b> However, thermal <b>radiation</b> measurement requires accurately calibrated detectors. The calibration of such detectors has been significantly improved in the last years, yielding calibration uncertainties of the spectral responsivity of detectors down to 10 - 4 in National Metrology Institutes. The paper briefly reviews the experimental and physical principles of optical temperature measurement via emitted thermal radiation and then covers recent developments in calibration technologies. Finally, practical methods for transferring these low uncertainties already achieved in the National Metrological Institutes to industry are outlined...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{light was}} thought to consist of waves of {{electromagnetic}} fields which propagated according to Maxwell's equations, while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See history of wave and particle viewpoints). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of <b>black</b> <b>body</b> thermal <b>radiation,</b> Max Planck proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the photoelectric effect, Albert Einstein proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called photons. These quanta would have an energy given by the Planck-Einstein relation:and a momentumwhere [...] (lowercase Greek letter nu) and [...] (lowercase Greek letter lambda) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, [...] the speed of light, and [...] the Planck constant.

40|$|Considerations of the {{collision}} losses for protons traversing the 2. 7 K <b>black</b> <b>body</b> microwave <b>radiation</b> field {{have led to}} the conclusion that the highest energy cosmic rays, those observed at ≥ 10 ^ 20 eV, must come from sources within the present epoch. In light of this constraint, it is here suggested that these particles may be accelerated near the event horizons of spinning supermassive black holes associated with presently inactive quasar remnants. The required emf is generated by the black hole induced rotation of externally supplied magnetic field lines threading the horizon. Producing the observed flux of the highest energy cosmic rays would constitute a negligible drain on the black hole dynamo. Observations with upcoming air shower arrays and space missions may lead to the identification of candidate dormant galaxies which harbor such black holes. Although the highest energy events observed so far are accounted for within the context of this scenario, a spectral upper bound at ∼ 10 ^ 21 eV is expected since the acceleration to higher energies appears to be precluded, on general grounds.

50|$|Louis Lliboutry {{noted that}} the key climatic {{condition}} for the differential ablation {{that leads to the}} formation of penitentes is that the dew point is always below freezing. Thus, snow will sublimate. Once the process of differential ablation starts, the surface geometry of the evolving penitente produces a positive feedback mechanism, and radiation is trapped by multiple reflections between the walls. The hollows become almost a <b>black</b> <b>body</b> for <b>radiation,</b> while decreased wind leads to air saturation, increasing dew point temperature and the onset of melting. In this way peaks, where mass loss is due only to sublimation, will remain, as well as the steep walls, which intercept only a minimum of solar radiation. In the troughs, the ablation is enhanced, leading to a downward growth of penitentes. A mathematical model of the process has been developed by Betterton, although the physical processes at the initial stage of penitente growth, from granular snow to micropenitentes, still remain unclear. The effect of penitentes on the energy balance of the snow surface, and therefore their effect on snow melt and water resources has also been studied.|$|R
25|$|A star or planet {{often is}} modeled as a <b>black</b> <b>body,</b> and {{electromagnetic}} <b>radiation</b> emitted from these <b>bodies</b> as black-body <b>radiation.</b> The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section {{to illustrate the}} idea. The photosphere of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature T that is maintained {{over a long period}} of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.|$|R
