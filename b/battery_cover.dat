5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette <b>battery</b> <b>cover</b> were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E

25|$|To {{make the}} PSP slimmer, the {{capacity}} of the battery was reduced by 1/3. However, due to more efficient power usage, the run time of the PSP is still the same as the previous model. Older model batteries will work which extends the amount of playing time. However, the <b>battery</b> <b>cover</b> on the newer model does not fit over the older battery due to its bulkier size. The batteries take about one and a half hour to charge and last roughly 4.5–7 hours depending on factors such as screen brightness settings, WLAN and volume levels.|$|E

50|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>cover</b> - It {{has been}} stated in some {{official}} and unofficial reviews that the <b>battery</b> <b>cover</b> {{is very difficult}} to open. The User's Manual shows that you only have to push out the <b>battery</b> <b>cover,</b> yet this {{is very difficult to}} accomplish.An easy fix for this is to put an eraser on the cover and use it to slide the cover open. Furthermore, continued opening and closing of the <b>battery</b> <b>cover</b> causes it to lose its ability to stay on the phone, and instead needs to be taped or glued on. However, it's only stated that SOME of the phones have this particular issue, not all of the W300i series have this problem. Also it's noted that some of the batteries that are inserted into the phone swell up within a month or so.|$|E
