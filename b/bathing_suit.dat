5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E

25|$|As a child, Allen {{had been}} scalded badly on one arm, {{and she was}} {{extremely}} sensitive about the scarring. Throughout her life, she wore either full or three-quarter length sleeves to hide the scars. The half-forearm style became as much a Gracie Allen trademark as her many aprons and her illogical logic. When the couple moved to Beverly Hills and acquired a swimming pool, Gracie put on a <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> and swam {{the length of the}} pool to prove to her children that she could swim. (She fought a longtime fear of drowning by privately taking swimming lessons.) She never put on a <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> or entered the pool again.|$|E

25|$|Although {{it was not}} {{connected}} to the show, a 1976 poster of Farrah Fawcett sporting a red <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> became the biggest selling poster in history with 20 million copies sold. This poster also helped the burgeoning popularity of the series.|$|E
25|$|People {{entered the}} small room of the machine while {{it was on the}} beach, wearing their street clothing.

25|$|Starting in 1927, the {{character}} of Léger's work gradually changed as organic and irregular forms assumed greater importance. The figural style {{that emerged in the}} 1930s is fully displayed in the Two Sisters of 1935, and in several versions of Adam and Eve. With characteristic humor, he portrayed Adam in a striped <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> or sporting a tattoo.|$|E
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a close shot of Knowles face who's wearing a similar make-up to English model Twiggy. The video then shows shots of Knowles moving her arms like a clock and wearing a black T-shirt and black trousers. Scenes similar to 1957 film Funny Face follow with Knowles looking like Audrey Hepburn. Those shots are cut {{by a variety of}} brightly colored bathing suits and a {{black-and-white}} hat, set against a constantly changing background of colors which is similar to Vogue photo shoots. Knowles' baby bump is less visible in the <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> scenes but is featured prominently earlier in the video. The clip cuts quickly from the <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> sequence to shots of Knowles in an audition space similar to the 1980 film Fame. The sequence features choreographed moves from Knowles and her back-up dancers who snap with their fingers which is a reference to 1961 musical West Side Story.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before the}} 1930s, sun therapy became a popularly subscribed cure for almost every ailment from simple fatigue to tuberculosis. In the 1940s, {{advertisements}} started appearing in women’s magazines which encouraged sun bathing. At the same time, swimsuits' skin coverage began decreasing, with the bikini radically changing swimsuit style after {{it made its}} appearance in 1946. In the 1950s, many people used baby oil as a method to increase tanning. The first self-tanner came about in the same decade and was known as “Man-Tan,” although it often led to undesirable orange skin. Coppertone, in 1953, marketed its sunscreen with a drawing of a little blond girl and her cocker spaniel tugging on her <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> bottoms revealing her bare bottom and tan line; this advertisement was modified {{around the turn of}} the 21st century and now shows a little girl wearing a one-piece <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> or shorts. In the latter part of the 1950s, silver metallic reflectors were common to enhance one’s tan.|$|E
25|$|Germs, bacteria, {{and mold}} can grow very quickly on wet bathing suits. Medical {{professionals}} warn that wearing damp swimwear {{for long periods}} of time can cause a number of infections and rashes in children and adults, and warn against sharing bathing suits with others. They suggest that changing out of a wet <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> right away can help prevent vaginal infections and itching in females and Tinea Cruris ("Jock Itch") in males.|$|E
25|$|Others welcome {{everyone}} whether dressed or nude (subject {{to other}} miscellaneous rules and requirements). Some people have issues with body shame—especially the areas commonly {{covered by a}} <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> while in a mixed-gender nudist setting. A married couple might have one spouse who is comfortable being fully nude, but the other spouse is not. If a full nudity policy were in place, such a family would have to split up for the day, or find an alternative activity. A few resorts attempt a compromise by allowing females to wear minimal clothing, but not males.|$|E

50|$|Rockaway's famous {{amusement}} park, Rockaways' Playland, {{was built}} in 1901 and quickly became a major attraction for people around the region. With its growing popularity, concern over swimming etiquette became a problem and early in 1904, the Captain of the NYPD, Louis Kreuscher, issued rules for those using the beach, censoring the <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> to be worn, where photographs could be taken, and specifying that women in <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> {{were not allowed to}} leave the beachfront.|$|R

25|$|In 1976, after Pro Arts Inc. {{pitched the}} idea of a poster of Fawcett to her agent, a photo shoot was {{arranged}} with photographer Bruce McBroom, who was hired by the poster company. According to friend Nels Van Patten, Fawcett styled her own hair and did her makeup without the aid of a mirror. Her blonde highlights were further heightened by a squeeze of lemon juice. From 40 rolls of film, Fawcett herself selected her six favorite pictures, and eventually the choice was narrowed to the one that made her famous. The resulting image of Fawcett in a one-piece red <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> is the best-selling poster in history.|$|E
25|$|From {{their arrival}} in 1922, the Crosbys led {{the life of}} rich expatriates. They were {{attracted}} to the bohemian lifestyle of the artists gathering in Montparnasse. They settled in an apartment at 12, Quai d'Orléans on Île St-Louis, and Polly donned her red <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> and rowed Harry down the river to the Place de la Concorde, where he walked the last few blocks to the bank. Harry wore his dark business suit, formal hat, and carried his umbrella and briefcase. Caresse rowed home alone, and in her swim suit her generously endowed chest drew whistles, jeers, and waves from workmen. She later wrote that she thought the exercise was good for her breasts, and she enjoyed the attention.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{at the age}} of just 16, Taylor {{became the}} {{youngest}} person ever to be featured as one of People magazine's Most Beautiful People, wearing a bright-orange one-piece <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> with long lime-green gloves in the photo spread which accompanied the article, taken on a Miami beach. The following year, Taylor became the first spokesmodel younger than 18 to sign a major contract with CoverGirl, and she became a feature in their national advertising campaign. Some of her other ad campaigns have been for Thierry Mugler, Escada, Liz Claiborne, Jean Paul Gaultier, Versace, Versus, Anne Klein, L'Oréal, Gap, Lee Jeans, and Pantene. Taylor remains the only person to simultaneously have six enormous billboards in NYC's Times Square, three of displayed her image continuously throughout the entire year.|$|E

[...] "We don't define what <b>bathing</b> <b>suits</b> men should wear so it doesn't make much sense {{to do it for}} women.

25|$|On September 9, 1922, Crosby and Polly {{were married}} in the Municipal Building in New York City, and two days later they re-boarded the RMS Aquitania and moved with her {{children}} to Paris, France. There they joined the Lost Generation of expatriate Americans disillusioned {{by the loss of}} life in World War I and the moral and social values of their parents' generation. Crosby continued his work at Morgan, Harjes et Cie, the Morgan family’s bank in Paris. They found an apartment at 12, Quai d'Orléans overlooking the Seine, on the exclusive Île Saint-Louis, and Polly would don her red <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> and row Crosby down the Seine in his dark business suit, formal hat, umbrella and briefcase to the Place de la Concorde where he would walk the last few blocks to the bank on Place Vendôme. As she rowed back home, Polly, who was well endowed, would enjoy whistles, jeers and waves from workmen. She said the exercise was good for her breasts.|$|E
25|$|Schaefer served four {{terms as}} mayor, being re-elected in 1975, 1979 and 1983, each time {{receiving}} 85% {{or more of}} the vote. He was known for his attention to detail, taking notes of strewn garbage and other violations as he rode around, and ordering them fixed immediately. A famous photograph shows him dressed in an old-fashioned 19th century blue striped <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> with a straw boat hat, carrying a rubber duck into the outside seal pool at the then-new National Aquarium in Baltimore at the Inner Harbor, attracting wide national media attention, to settle a wager {{that it would not be}} opened in time in August 1981. In 1984, in a move to give the majority African-American population more power in the city of Baltimore, Schaefer named Bishop L. Robinson as the Baltimore City Police Department's first African-American police commissioner, a position previously dominated by Irish American and Italian American members of the city police department.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey walking down some {{steps onto the}} beach wearing a black <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> and high heel shoes, which she takes off when she gets {{to the bottom and}} walks onto the sand. Carey is seen in {{different}} shots standing next to a cliff-face {{as well as in the}} middle of the beach for the majority of the video. For the bridge, Carey is seen in multiple different shots as she walks along the shoreline, which changes as the last verse takes place, where her outfit changes from a black <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> to a different style white <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> whilst the sun sets in the background. As the video comes to an end, the scenery has changed to nighttime, and Carey is wearing another black <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> with a black jacket standing against a rock-face. Carey then inscribes into the sand [...] "H.A.T.E.U." [...] using her fingers, which she underlines as the video fades to black. The video is also inter-cut throughout with shots of the scenery on the beach. Rap-Up described the video as [...] "picturesque". Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that it is a [...] "slow-mo, beachwear fashion show". He continued, [...] "Equally depressed by the end of a relationship and inspired by the scenery, Mimi spends a few minutes suggestively touching herself and staring into the middle distance.
