50|$|In {{very dry}} climates, {{evaporative}} coolers, {{sometimes referred to}} as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water.

The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged.

If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.|$|E

He did not publish them but some of the extracts from his journals were published posthumously in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. These included notes on native steel manufacture and on Gond language. His ideas on geology were based on Werner, based on Neptunism, that rocks were formed under the oceans. He however decided that dykes or veins were produced by volcanic intrusion from below. He called laterite as [...] "iron-clay". He observed amethystine quartz veins at Mulkapur but did not follow them into the jungle for fear of tigers. He used Secunderabad as a base and worked with George Everest during this part of the survey. In 1819 he and Everest returned to the region and during free time in the rainy season would indulge in rolling granite boulders down the hills. The trip however resulted in both suffering from malaria. Voysey's knowledge of French allowed him to interact with Duvaucel when he was in Calcutta. He was also in touch with French research and when Everest wanted to measure humidity, it was Voysey who suggested the wet and dry <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer</b> approach invented by the French.|$|E

Litter residual contamination after cleaning and disinfection was also evaluated. A dry <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer,</b> a wet <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer,</b> and a black <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer</b> were placed inside each broiler house at bird height and outside the broiler house for data collection. Environmental data were collected at 3 h intervals from 00 : 00 to 24 : 00 hours during weeks 4, 5, and 6 of the grow-out. Based on the collected data, air relative humidity (RH) was determined, after which wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and Radiant Heat Load (RHL) were calculated. There were no differences in live performance parameters. However, total mortality and sudden death were higher in birds raised on dirt floor. On days 0, 14 and 35, litter pH was higher in the dirt floor as compared to the concrete floor, {{but at the end of}} the grow-out, this difference disappeared. There was a cubic effect of bird age on litter moisture, which increased up to day 28, and then stabilized or decreased.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from July 28, 2016 - January 28, 2017 Lower atmospheric flux measurements are a difficult subset of atmospheric data to accurately collect. The interplay of cost, precision, specialty, resolution and repeatability compound an already difficult experimental problem. In response to this, a new, novel instrumentation approach to measuring within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is introduced. The combination of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) technology are an unlikely pairing that show great potential for providing unprecedented levels of spatial and temporal resolution of the natural world. This pairing was deployed to the Oxbow Conservation Area near Bates, OR in July 2015 to measure vertically stratified temperature profiles. Additional modifications to the fiber optic cables were done in order to replicate the sling psychrometer approach to measuring humidity values by replicating a ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer</b> capable of measuring temperature gradients at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Out of 23 UAV flights conducted, thirteen provided usable data. Measurements and calculations were compared to a co-located Open Path Gas Analyzer and Sonic Anemometer (Irgason) for accuracy and precision. Four flights showed strong correlation to Eddy-Covariance calculations on sensible heat and evaporative flux.

This study, thus, studied the evaporative cooling efficiency and pressure drop of recycled High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and rice husk as a wetted pad in evaporative cooling system. Approach: The study was done by establishing the tested wetted pad with 25. 4 and 50. 8 mm of thickness. The velocity air flow through wetted pad was controlled at 1, 2 and 3 m sec− 1 respectively. In addition, the dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures of inlet air were controlled at 30. 1 ± 1. 0 °C and 23. 2 ± 1. 1 °C, respectively. The commercial wetted pad was also tested in order to compare results with rice husk and recycled HDPE. Results: It was found that rice husk wetted pad gave the average saturation efficiency of 55. 9 %, while HDPE gave the average saturation efficiency of 29. 1 %. However, the pressure drop across wetted pad of rice husk and recycled HDPE {{was significantly higher than}} that of commercial wetted pad. For the effect of air velocity on saturation efficiency and pressure drop, it was found that higher air velocity decreased saturation efficiency and increased pressure drop across wetted pad. Conclusion: Finally, the rice husk has a potential as wetted pad material. However, further study about optimum point between operation cost and materials cost of using rice husk wetted pad is needed.

The covered area floor space was 1. 5 × 1 m (excluding manger) for each animal and open paddock was 2 × 1 m. Height of shed at eaves was 2 meter.

I described some commercial solutions, up to some extent similar to the presented one and available on the market. The goal of the thesis is to elaborate a similar system, but cheaper and more adjusted to our problem domain. 	The entire system is divided into two sections. The first one is formed by electronic elements, required for the recollection and transmission of data from the temperature sensors DS 18 S 20 to the server. The second section is the software, compiled by open code software with the Digitemp program and own software which works as a linking particle of entire system to create a complete entity. The adjusted program Digitemp checks the availability of temperature sensors, inputs the data into the database and from the nearest weather station reads the data of the outside air humidity. Own software processes the data and changes it into a form, required for the situation of snowmaking – this is the temperature of a wet <b>bulb</b> <b>thermometer.</b> That form is used for the upgrading processes, such as suitable data display and, depending on the will of the user, updating and informing by the e-mail.
