5|$|Downtown Providence has {{numerous}} 19th-century mercantile {{buildings in}} the Federal and Victorian architectural styles, {{as well as several}} post-modern and modernist buildings located throughout the area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> the two.|$|E
50|$|The three {{anchor point}} {{milestones}} fit easily into the Rational Unified Process (RUP), with LCO marking the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> RUP's Inception and Elaboration phases, LCA marking the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Elaboration and Construction phases, and IOC marking the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Construction and Transition phases.|$|R
5000|$|The location: The River Sheaf on {{its western}} border {{used to be}} the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> the parishes of Sheffield and Norton; and {{formerly}} the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Yorkshire and Derbyshire; and before that, the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> the Anglo-Saxon states of Mercia and Northumbria. Woodland on such boundaries is often left undeveloped.|$|R

5|$|Hedgerows of {{hawthorn}} and blackthorn, {{which form}} the <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> the fields, {{are the principal}} habitat in these cultivated areas. They support many species of wild flowers, insects and birds, including dog rose, purple foxglove and wild violet as well as wrens, blackbirds and song thrushes.|$|E
5|$|In reaction–diffusion systems modeled by the Allen–Cahn equation, the {{limiting}} behavior for fast reaction, slow diffusion, {{and two or}} more local minima of energy with the same energy level as each other is for the system to settle into regions of different local minima, with the fronts delimiting <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> these regions evolving according to the curve-shortening flow.|$|E
5|$|The Camus Cross, {{otherwise}} known as the Camuston or Camustane Cross, is an Early Medieval Scottish standing stone located on the Panmure Estate near Carnoustie in Angus, Scotland. First recorded in the 15th century in a legal document describing the <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> Camuston and the barony of Downie, and described in the 17th century by Robert Maule, it is a freestanding cross, rare in Eastern Scotland.|$|E
50|$|South of Crediton the River Yeo forms {{part of the}} <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Crediton Civil Parish and Crediton Hamlets Civil Parish.

5|$|The {{brain is}} not fully understood, and {{research}} is ongoing. Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how the human brain works. The <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> the specialties of neuroscience, neurology and other disciplines such as psychiatry have faded as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience.|$|E
5|$|The {{computational}} {{complexity of}} finding a homomorphism between given graphs is prohibitive in general, but a lot is known about special cases that are solvable in polynomial time. <b>Boundaries</b> <b>between</b> tractable and intractable cases have been an active area of research.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{dynamics of}} this rule are complicated, including {{the existence of}} small stable structures. However, in the aggregate (when started with all cells in random states) it tends to form large regions of cells that {{are all in the}} same state as each other, with the <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> these regions evolving according to the curve-shortening flow.|$|E

5|$|For random initial conditions, the <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> {{the trees}} formed {{in this way}} {{themselves}} shift in a seemingly random pattern, and trees frequently die out altogether. But {{by means of the}} theory of shift registers he and others were able to find initial conditions in which the trees all remain alive forever, the pattern of growth repeats periodically, and all of the clearings can be guaranteed to remain bounded in size.|$|E
5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate {{the motion of the}} boundary, rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E

5|$|Paris {{continued}} to be a major destination for Scottish artists, with William Gear (1916–97) and Stephen Gilbert (1910–2007) encountering the linear abstract painting of the avant-garde COBRA group there in the 1940s. Their work was highly coloured and violent in execution. Also a visitor to Paris was Alan Davie (b. 1920-2014), who was influenced by jazz and Zen Buddhism, and moved further into abstract expressionism. Ian Hamilton Finlay's (1925–2006) work explored the <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> sculpture, print making, literature (especially concrete poetry) and landscape architecture. His most ambitious work, the garden of Little Sparta opened in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The inner German border {{originated}} from plans by the Second World War Allies to divide a defeated Germany into occupation zones. The <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> these zones were drawn along the territorial boundaries of 19th-century German states and provinces that had largely disappeared with {{the unification of}} Germany in 1871. Three zones were agreed on, each covering roughly a third of Germany's territories: a British zone in the north-west, an American zone {{in the south and}} a Soviet zone in the East. France was later given a zone in the far west of Germany, carved out of the British and American zones.|$|E
5|$|They {{may also}} serve as {{religious}} symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: יוֹנָה, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, {{as in the case}} of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India. In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> earthly and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.|$|E

5|$|Weather fronts are <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> two {{masses of}} air of {{different}} densities, or different temperature and moisture properties, which normally are convergence zones {{in the wind}} field and are the principal cause of significant weather. Within surface weather analyses, they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols. The air masses usually differ in temperature and may also differ in humidity. Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Women {{did much}} to {{establish}} the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city's pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national cultural and social trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> private and public life in Dallas by pushing their way into politics {{in the name of}} social issues.|$|E
5|$|A case {{in which}} {{developer}} control was asserted involved Blizzard Entertainment's action against Tristan Pope's Not Just Another Love Story. Blizzard's community managers encouraged users to post game movies and screenshots, but viewers complained that Pope's suggestion of sexual actions through creative camera and character positioning was pornographic. Citing the user license agreement, Blizzard closed discussion threads about the film and prohibited links to it. Although Pope accepted Blizzard's right to some control, he remained concerned about censorship of material that already existed in-game in some form. Discussion ensued about <b>boundaries</b> <b>between</b> MMORPG player and developer control. Lowood asserted that this controversy demonstrated that machinima could be a medium of negotiation for players.|$|E
50|$|The Genale Doria is {{historically}} {{important because it}} served as the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Sidamo and Bale Provinces. The confluence of the Ganale Doria with the Dawa is notable {{as the starting point}} for the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Ethiopia and Kenya to the west, and the starting point for the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Ethiopia and Somalia to the east. The Battle of Genale Doria was fought to the south of its course.|$|R

50|$|One {{problem that}} beset the sultanate {{of the four}} {{confederation}} of Lanao was the identification of ancestral land area (Kawali) of each state (Phangampong). They were consequently defined by Datu Pascan of Unayan, Datu Popawan of Bayabao, Amiyanon Simban of Masiu and Datu Dilion of Baloi. The agreement known as Kiatathamana-an delineated the areas as: Dalama, located in the municipality of Molondo, the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Bayabao and East Masiu; Sawer, Masiu municipality the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> East Masiu municipality and East Unayan to Madamba municipality, the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> West Unayan and West Masiu; and Bacayawan in Marantao municipality, the <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> west Masiu and Bayabao. Surprisingly, there is no identified <b>boundary</b> <b>between</b> Bayabao and Baloi but {{the reason is that}} both Pangampong lineage come from the same family tree. Under the Kiangginawai (friendship) their boundary need not be established.|$|R
