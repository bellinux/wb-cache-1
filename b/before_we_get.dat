He coaxed the guards to open one gate so they could discuss the problem and announced, [...] "This is the Indiana football team. We've been marching around this place long enough, and, suh, we are not wearying ourselves <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> our suits on".|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Ridley Scott {{revealed}} he {{was planning}} two sequels to Prometheus, which would lead into the first Alien film, adding, [...] "Maybe [...] even [...] a fourth film <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> back into the Alien franchise." [...] In November 2015, Scott confirmed that Alien: Covenant {{would be the first}} of three additional films in the Alien prequels series, before linking up with the original Alien and stated that the Prometheus sequels would reveal who created the xenomorph aliens. The screenplay for the third prequel film, called Alien: Awakening, was written during production of Alien: Covenant and was finished in 2017, with production scheduled to begin in 2018. In March 2017, Scott said, ”If you really want a franchise, i can keep cranking it for another six. I'm not going to close it down again. No way." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, after Marvel Studios was {{integrated}} into The Walt Disney Studios with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, {{it was reported}} that the studios' creative committee would have [...] "nominal" [...] input on the films moving forward, though would continue to consult on Marvel Television productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control. All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso. At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are [...] "broad strokes" [...] though sometime [...] "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to the culmination ... we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up. So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but really can live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves." [...] The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with Spider-Man.|$|E

500|$|... "To do {{this any}} other way would have been needlessly contentious," [...] Daley {{explained}} {{at a news conference}} Monday morning. Daley argued that the airport was a threat to Chicago's high-rise cityscape and its high-profile skyscrapers, such as the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Center. Daley criticized the Federal Aviation Administration, saying [...] "Now, think of that; Mickey and Minnie have it. I mean, I can't believe that. They get it first <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> it?", referring to the post-9/11 air space restrictions in place over Orlando, Florida. [...] "The signature act of Richard Daley's 22 years in office was the midnight bulldozing of Meigs Field," [...] according to Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn. [...] "He ruined Meigs because he wanted to, because he could," [...] Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass wrote of Daley. [...] "The issue is Daley's increasingly authoritarian style that brooks no disagreements, legal challenges, negotiations, compromise or any of that messy give-and-take normally associated with democratic government," [...] the Chicago Tribune editorialized. The Federal Aviation Administration cited the City for failure to comply with federal law requiring thirty-day advance notice to the FAA of plans for an airport closure. The city was fined $33,000, the maximum allowable. The city paid the fine and repaid $1 million in misspent federal airport development grants. Daley defended his actions by claiming that the airport was abandoned, {{in spite of the fact}} that the Chicago Fire Department had several helicopters based on the field at the time, in addition to the dozens of private aircraft left stranded.|$|E
2500|$|We can {{demonstrate}} {{there must be}} at least two people in London with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows. Since a typical human head has an average of around 150,000 hairs, {{it is reasonable to assume}} (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head [...] holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London ( [...] is bigger than 1million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person's head, and assign people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their head, there {{must be at least}} two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads) (or, [...] ). For the average case (...) with the constraint: fewest overlaps, there will be at most one person assigned to every pigeonhole and the 150,001st person assigned to the same pigeonhole as someone else. In the absence of this constraint, there may be empty pigeonholes because the [...] "collision" [...] happens <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to the 150,001st person. The principle just proves the existence of an overlap; it says nothing of the number of overlaps (which falls under the subject of probability distribution).|$|E
