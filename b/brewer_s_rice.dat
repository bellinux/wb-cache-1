40|$|Three {{issues are}} {{examined}} relating to U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> export promotion. First, the responsiveness of U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> export demand {{with respect to}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> export promotion is measured to determine the quantity impacts of these programs. Second, the overall effectiveness of the programs is examined {{in terms of whether}} the benefits exceed the cost. Finally, the optimality of U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> export promotion in terms of expenditure levels is investigated. A double logarithmic econometric export demand equation is estimated to compute the export promotion elasticity while controlling for other demand determinants such as own price, the export price of competing countries, incomes, and exchange rates. Average benefit-cost ratios are computed for U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> export promotion based on a range of excess supply own-price elasticities to compute the effectiveness of the programs. Finally, a marginal simulation analysis is conducted to explore the optimality of the investment in rice export promotion. [JEL Codes: Q 17, Q 18, Q 13 ]. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ...|$|R

By some measures announced by U. S. Congress, agriculture receives more federal support relative to importance than any other sector of the economy. Specially, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> industry is mostly influenced by the government policy because the rice industry is smaller than other grain industries;Export-oriented policies of Thailand can have dramatic consequences on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> industry. Thailand, as the largest exporter and competitor against the U.

40|$|A spatial, multiproduct {{equilibrium}} model featuring United States-Mexico {{long-grain rice}} trade is developed {{to determine the}} effect of removing Mexico's rice tariffs in 2003 on U.

Analysis considers rice milling costs and yields in the United States and Mexico, transportation costs associated with U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> exports to Mexico, mill by-product prices in Mexico and the United States and the changing tariff levels. Results show Mexico's graduated decline in rice tariffs over the 1997 to 2003 period to increase U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> exports to Mexico about 1 % per year or a total of 7 % over the 6 -year period. United States' long-grain rice price and production is modestly affected by the increased exports, while the impact on Mexico's rice production and price is comparatively large. Further, results show the historic incentive to export rough rice to Mexico will be replaced by an incentive to export milled rice, thus opportunities for the U. <b>S.</b> <b>rice</b> milling industry to form alliances with Mexican packers and increase direct relationships with large retailers in Mexico.

Moreover, the profitability of rice or grain crops per hectare or per labor day is obviously lower than vegetables, fruits and industrial crops. The comparative disadvantage in rice or grain production may bring about negative results on China 2 ̆ 7 s grain supply in the coming years. Policy efforts aimed to stabilize rice market and improve the incomes of farmers who is specialized in rice or grain production are necessary. 1998 年以降，保護価格の実行が年々強調されてきたが，生産費調査結果で示したように市場支えに果たした役割は極めて限定的なものであった．省，市段階での制度運営実際において，保護価格は国有食糧系統の在庫水準や市場実勢価格を基本に設定される場合が多く，何を，どこまで保護すべきかといった根拠は必ずしも明確にされているとは言えない．米価が 4 年間下がり続けた今日では，市場実勢価格は果たして保護価格設定の参考になれるのか．現在の市場実勢価格を前提に設定される保護価格は保護価格制度や優直証価制度の執行を実りあるものにすることができるのか，今後の米作生産力にどのような影響を及ぼすと予想されるかなど，検討すべき課題は多い．本稿では，これらの課題を価格論的視点から検討することを試みる．第 2 節では，農村経済改革以来の約 20 年間における米の生産変化と米価との関係を考察し，米価の果たす役割を明らかにする．第 3 節ではこれまでの米価水準を米作再生産や比較収益性の視点から分析し，政策米価の問題点を明らかにする．第 4 節では，第 2 ， 3 節の検討結果を踏まえて，構造調整段階における米価政策のあり方について吟味する...|$|R
