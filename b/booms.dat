5|$|By the 1940s, the Texas Railroad Commission, {{which had}} been given {{regulatory}} control of the Texas oil industry, managed to stabilize American oil production and eliminate most of the wild price swings that were common during the earlier years of the boom. Many small towns, such as Wortham, which had become boomtowns during the 1920s saw their <b>booms</b> end in the late 1920s and early 1930s as their local economies collapsed, resulting from their dependence on relatively limited petroleum reservoirs. As production peaked {{in some of these}} smaller fields and the Great Depression lowered demand, investors fled. In the major refining and manufacturing centers such as Beaumont, Houston, and Dallas, the boom continued to varying degrees until the end of World War II. By the end of the war, the economies of the major urban areas of the state had matured. Though Texas continued to prosper and grow, the extreme growth patterns and dramatic socioeconomic changes of the earlier years largely subsided as the cities settled into more sustainable patterns of growth. Localized <b>booms</b> in West Texas and other areas, however, continued to transform some small communities during the post-war period.|$|E

5|$|Downtown had short skyscraper-building <b>booms</b> {{beginning}} in the 1970s. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is {{the location of the}} Hmong Archives.|$|E

5|$|The cattle {{industry}} continued to thrive though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic <b>booms</b> in various {{regions of the}} state. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce between Texas {{and the rest of}} the U.S. ({{and the rest of the}} world) expanded. As with some other states before, the lumber industry quickly decimated the forests of Texas such that by the early 20th century the major of the forest population in Texas was gone (later conservation efforts restored some of it but never to the level it once was).|$|E
5|$|Unlike , {{a fellow}} American-Hawaiian ship that was plagued with labor difficulties, Kentuckian {{seems to have}} escaped much of the {{maritime}} labor turmoil of the mid-1930s. One incident was reported by the Los Angeles Times in August 1936. The news item reported that a portion of Kentuckians crew went on strike in protest against unsafe working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo <b>booms</b> after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these <b>booms</b> were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on current}} fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species {{seem to have}} led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved {{on the ground is}} key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic <b>booms</b> via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E
5|$|Dallas and Fort Worth {{experienced}} one {{of their}} greatest oil-related construction <b>booms</b> in 1930 and 1931, when {{the opening of the}} East Texas oil field helped establish Dallas as the financial center for the oil industry in Texas and Oklahoma. New business offices and municipal buildings appeared in the city, including the Highland Park Village shopping center, one of the nation's earliest shopping malls. The Depression slowed population growth in the Dallas area somewhat during the later 1930s, but rapid growth patterns returned again during the 1940s. By this time, though, Dallas had already begun to rediversify, becoming a center for aircraft manufacturing and electronics technology in addition to a variety of other industries.|$|E

In 1895 she was used to test a new system of laying mines by rails that had been invented by Lieutenant A. P. Ygrumov and also to evaluate the proper dimensions for anti-torpedo nets and their <b>booms.</b> For this last test torpedoes were fired at the ship with the anti-torpedo nets deployed. One gun, of an unknown calibre, burst in 1903, killing one man and wounding two others.|$|E
