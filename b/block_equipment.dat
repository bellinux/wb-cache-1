50|$|It is {{generally}} preferable to prevent hydrates from forming or blocking equipment. This is commonly achieved by removing water, {{or by the}} addition of ethylene glycol (MEG) or methanol, which act to depress the temperature at which hydrates will form (i.e. common antifreeze). In recent years, development of other forms of hydrate inhibitors have been developed, like Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitors (which by far slow the rate of hydrate formation) and anti-agglomerates, which do not prevent hydrates forming, but do prevent them sticking together to <b>block</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

Research of the power <b>block</b> <b>equipment</b> heat state in the presence and absence of external heat insulation of the converted gas-turbine engine case was performed by computational fluid dynamics methods. Based on the maximum permissible gas-turbine engine case temperature under the conditions of fire- and explosion safety, thickness of heat-insulating mats on the different gas-turbine engine case parts was calculated. Simulation results have shown essential decrease of the temperatures of the gasturbine engine case external surface and low-sized power <b>block</b> <b>equipment</b> under low reduction of turbine efficiency and gas-turbine engine power due to additional heat expansion of the case. Advisability of external heat insulation application on the cases of converted gas-turbine engines, working in turbocompressor unit power block enclosures, needs additional feasibility study. ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????????????????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????. ???????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??? ??????? ? ??? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ????????????????? ?????????????? ?????????. ??????? ????????????????? ?????, ??????????? ?? ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????, ??????????????, ?????? ?? ??????????? ?? ???????????, ??????????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ????????????????????????. ?????????? ????????, ??? ???????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ?????????, ??-?? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????. ???????????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????????, ?????????? ? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????, ??????? ??????????????? ???????-?????????????? ???????????...|$|E
40|$|Snow accumulating on {{offshore}} structures can reduce freeboard and stability, <b>block</b> <b>equipment</b> and valves, and reduce operability {{of the platform}} or ship. It is thus important to evaluate snow conditions before starting long term operations. However, offshore snow condtitions in the Barents Sea are largely unquantified. The present study investigates snow loads on {{offshore structures}} in the Barents Sea. We have implemented a model to establish time series of snow loads using a 10 -day snowfall model or an energy balance model, with or without snow transport by wind. Methods to estimate extreme value statistics have also been applied, specifically using the generalized extreme value distribution and the peak-over-threshold method. These models have been applied with meteorological data from NORA 10 hindcast grid points covering the entire Barents Sea to provide estimates of extreme snow loads. The results for a 10 -day snowfall model without drift show 100 -year return levels of snow load to be 70 ~kg/m$^ 2 $ (0. 68 ~kPa) to 120 ~kg/m$^ 2 $ (1. 18 ~kPa) in the area opened to petroleum activity in the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea. Indication of a declining trend in the extreme values has also {{been found in the}} southern Barents Sea. The hindcast archive NORA 10 was validated against observations to evaluate uncertainties in the hindcast. NORA 10 shows a wet bias at all locations, but the distribution of extreme precipitation is similar to the observations. Due to undercatch of snow in the observations, it is likely that NORA 10 underestimates extreme precipitation...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundMaintenance {{and repair}} work in mining is {{particularly}} hazardous and yet has received little focus in ergonomics research. PurposeIn this article, an attempt {{has been made}} to determine if patterns can be identified to categorize maintenance and repair fatalities in mining, to compare occurrence of fatalities between coal and metal/nonmetal sectors, and to use this information to identify safety deficiencies and associated proposed remedial measures. MethodsA classification scheme was developed to identify patterns in fatalities, including proximal causes, tasks, and contributing factors. This scheme was tested to ensure adequacy of the categories, and fatalities were categorized using the scheme. All testing and categorization were done by two of the authors to ensure reliability of the coding scheme. ResultsPatterns were successfully identified to categorize the fatalities, and these patterns were different between coal and metal/nonmetal mines. Coal mines had a greater proportion of electrical-related fatalities, while more fatalities related to potential energy occurred at metal/nonmetal mines. Most of the fatalities were caused by the victim coming into contact with an object or machine or the victim falling from height, and they occurred most often while the victim was performing maintenance or repair on equipment, cleaning, or removing blockages. The most frequent factors contributing to these incidents were failure to properly de-energize or lock out/tag out equipment, violation of work procedures, missing or inadequate safety equipment, and failure to <b>block</b> <b>equipment</b> properly. ConclusionsThe classification approach used was successful in identifying hazard patterns during maintenance and repair fatalities in mining. These patterns identify areas to focus attention when developing interventions to prevent the occurrence of future fatalities.

40|$|Thermal {{conversion}} of organic materials through gasification yields gaseous fuel. The fuel gas often requires cleaning and upgrading ahead of combustion in advanced {{technologies such as}} gas engines, fuel cells and turbines. Tar {{is one of the}} major impurities found in streams, and can foul and <b>block</b> <b>equipment.</b> This study focuses on catalytic destruction of tar in a hot gas stream, at different operating conditions to improve the gas yield and quality. Steam gasification and reforming of tar involves thermal decomposition of tar and the reaction of tar with steam and fuel gases. These processes contribute to complex kinetics of the overall process involving a series of reactions, including: CO + H 2 O ↔ CO 2 + H 2, CO + 3 H 2 → CH 4 + H 2 O, C + H 2 O → CO + H 2, CH 4 + 2 H 2 O → CO 2 + 4 H 2, CO 2 + 4 H 2 → CH 4 + 2 H 2 O, C + 2 H 2 O → 2 H 2 + CO 2, CO + 2 H 2 → CH 3 OH, C + CO 2 → 2 CO, 2 C + H 2 → C 2 H 2, & C + 2 H 2 → CH 4. The concentration of each component affects the rate of reaction for each product. Introducing a catalyst to these processes increases the rate reactions and hence the number of successful reactions. The operating temperature, residence time and type of feedstock are other factors that can also affect the gas yield and quality. In this work, a continuous fixed bed-reactor was developed and assembled at Imperial College London, and used to investigate the activity of Pt-, Rh- and Ni-based catalysts, provided by Johnson Matthey. Experiments were performed at temperatures from 700 oC to up to 950 oC. The carrier gas flow rate, the steam-to-carbon ratio and feed gas composition were also varied to investigate the reaction kinetics and reaction pathways. Rh- and Pt-based catalysts had a better activity, thermal durability and corrosion resistance than the Ni-based catalyst. The Rh-catalyst results at considered conditions and above 800 oC were just about the same as the equilibrium results. Rh- had a better longevity and a tar conversion to syngas as high as 98...|$|E

40|$|The {{investment}} and operating {{costs for the}} manufacturing and application of routine shielding techniques in patients receiving radiotherapy are described. It {{was found that the}} operating cost of a fixed block is lower than that of the other types of blocks. Non-fixed and individualised blocks have similar operating costs. Whereas the manufacturing costs are much lower for non-fixed blocks than for individualised blocks, their application costs (for daily placement) are much higher, implying that the cost per piece of both types of blocks is more or less identical. Departments that have all the equipment for the manufacturing of individual blocks available are recommended to use standard-fixed blocks in patients where there is no clear preference for a specific type of block. Individual blocks, because of their higher cost, should be used only when they are judged to be superior for the patient. Investment decisions for equipment can be based on a similar strategy. Only if one intends to use blocks in very few patients (less than 60 /year), are non-fixed blocks the cheapest alternative. If more blocks are used, it is sufficient to invest in standard-fixed <b>blocks</b> <b>equipment,</b> unless individual <b>blocks</b> are recommended for medical reasons. status: publishe...|$|R
