5|$|The prosecution's case {{continued}} on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that <b>Burton</b> {{had attempted to}} discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public. Cochran refused to discuss it. Reporter J.H. Aubere testified that he had interviewed <b>Burton</b> that day, and that <b>Burton</b> had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and <b>Burton,</b> where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with <b>Burton</b> took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, <b>Burton</b> {{had told him that}} he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by other Senators that such conduct was common and legal. <b>Burton</b> also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney testified that, on the day he personally paid <b>Burton</b> $500, <b>Burton</b> advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burton</b> filmed all the {{dramatic}} hospital scenes {{and most of}} those involving Finney first, before moving on to the McGregor section of Bloom's life. Although McGregor was on set from the beginning of filming, <b>Burton</b> chose to shoot all Finney's scenes first. Location filming in Alabama was delayed by inclement weather; during the Calloway circus scenes filming, a tornado watch was issued and flooding on the set interrupted filming for several weeks. Despite the delays, <b>Burton</b> delivered the film on budget and on schedule.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burton</b> {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. <b>Burton</b> enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). <b>Burton</b> also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with <b>Burton</b> on Planet of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

5|$|<b>Burton</b> {{remained}} a Senator while {{each of his}} appeals were pending. Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they would move to expel him if he appeared in the Senate. However, <b>Burton</b> did appear in the Senate after his conviction. On April 6, 1904, <b>Burton</b> appeared to push for appropriations for the acquisition {{of land in the}} Adirondacks and Catskills. On January 22, 1906, <b>Burton</b> appeared in the Senate chamber again, for 30 seconds, in order to be eligible for $1,000 in travel reimbursements from the federal government.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burton</b> was reindicted, {{still in}} the circuit court Eastern District of Missouri, on April 13, 1905, and arraigned on June 4 before Judge John Henry Rogers, of the Western District of Arkansas, sitting by designation. The new {{indictment}} had eight counts. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts charged that <b>Burton</b> had agreed to receive compensation from Rialto. The third, fifth, and seventh counts charged that <b>Burton</b> had actually received compensation from Rialto. The counts different only {{in the interest of}} the United States which was alleged to have been involved in the matter. Counts four and five were dismissed before trial. Unlike the first indictment, the second alleged that <b>Burton</b> had received $500 in person in St. Louis. The first indictment alleged only compensated representation, the second indictment also alleged an agreement to do so.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burton</b> was {{the first}} {{defendant}} convicted under § 1782 of the Revised Statutes, 40 years after its 1864 enactment. <b>Burton</b> and his supporters argued that he was selectively prosecuted, on the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, for political reasons. <b>Burton</b> also became {{the first member of}} the United States Senate to be convicted of public corruption, in fact the first member of the Senate to be convicted of any crime. The next year, Senator John H. Mitchell (R-OR) was convicted under the same statute {{for his role in the}} Oregon land fraud scandal.|$|E

5000|$|In his satirical {{preface to}} the reader, <b>Burtons</b> persona and {{pseudonym}} [...] "Democritus Junior" [...] explains, [...] "I write of melancholy by being busy to avoid melancholy." [...] This is characteristic of the authors style, which often supersedes the books strengths as a medical text or historical document as its main source of appeal to admirers. Both satirical and serious in tone, the Anatomy is [...] "vitalized by (<b>Burtons)</b> pervading humour", and <b>Burtons</b> digressive and inclusive style, often verging on a stream of consciousness, consistently informs and animates the text. In addition to the authors techniques, the Anatomys vast breadth - addressing topics such as digestion, goblins, the geography of America, and others - make it a valuable contribution to multiple research disciplines.|$|R
60|$|And now {{came this}} other news that this Apollo {{was to be}} an Apollo indeed! When the god first became a god again, {{there was still a}} cloud upon the minds of the elder <b>Burtons</b> as to the means by which the divinity was to be sustained. A god in truth, but a god with so very {{moderate}} an annual income--unless, indeed, those old <b>Burtons</b> made it up to an extent which seemed to them to be quite unnatural! There was joy among the <b>Burtons,</b> of course, but the joy was somewhat dimmed by these reflections as to the slight means of their Apollo. A lover who was not an Apollo might wait; but, as they had learned already, there was danger in keeping such a god as this suspended on the tenter-hooks of expectation.|$|R
