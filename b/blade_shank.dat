The research program involved a theoretical assessment of solutions previously proposed, followed by a systematic experimental study to supplement the existing data base.

These quantities were examined with attention to engineering parameters such as two spinner finess ratios, three <b>blade</b> <b>shank</b> forms, and two/three/four/six/eight blades. Consideration of the physics of the phenomena aided in the logical deduction of two individual interference quantities (cascade effects and spinner/shank juncture interference).

40|$|The {{problems}} of calculating the structural response of high-temperature space propulsion components such as turbine blades for the fuel turbopump are addressed. The first high-pressure-stage fuel turbine blade (HPFTB) in the liquid-hydrogen turbopump {{of the space}} shuttle main engine (SSME) was selected for this study. In the past these blades have cracked in the <b>blade</b> <b>shank</b> region and at the airfoil leading edge adjacent to the platform. To achieve the necessary durability, these blades are currently being cast by using directional solidification. Single-crystal alloys are also being investigated for future SSME applications. The study evaluated the utility of advanced structural analysis methods in assessing the low-cycle fatigue lives of these anisotropic components. The turbine blade airfoil of the high-pressure stage of the SSME fuel turbopump was analyzed because it has a history of rapid crack initiation...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} effectiveness of icing protection afforded by air-heating hollow steel unpartitioned propeller blades has been conducted In the NACA Cleveland icing research tunnel. The propeller used was a production model modified with <b>blade</b> <b>shank</b> and tip openings to permit internal passage of heated air. Blade-surface and heated-air temperatures were obtained and photographic observations of Ice formations were made with variations In icing intensity and heating rate to the blades. For the conditions of Icing to which the propeller was subjected, {{it was found that}} adequate ice protection was afforded with a heating rate of 40 1 000 Btu per hour per blade. With less than 40, 000 Btu per hour per blade, ice protection failed because of significant ice accretions on the leading edge. The chordwise distribution of heat was unsatisfactory with most of the available heat dissipated well back of the leading edge on both the thrust and camber face's instead of at the leading edge where it was most needed. A low utilization of available heat for icing protection is indicated by a beat-exchanger effectiveness of approximately 47 percent...|$|E

40|$|The icing {{protection}} afforded {{an internal}} air-heated propeller blade by radial partitioning at 50 -percent chord to confine the heated {{air to the}} forward half of the blade was determined in the NACA Cleveland icing research tunnel. A modified production-model hollow steel propeller, {{was used for the}} investigation. Temperatures of the blade surfaces for several heating rates were measured under various tunnel Icing' conditions. Photographic observations of ice formations on blade surfaces and blade heat-exchanger effectiveness were obtained. With 50 -percent partitioning of the blades, adequate icing protection at 1050 rpm was obtained with a heating rate of 26, 000 Btu per hour per blade at the <b>blade</b> <b>shank</b> using an air temperature of 400 F with a flow rate of 280 pounds per hour per blade, which is one-third less heat than was found necessary for similar Ice protection with unpartitioned blades. The chordwise distribution of the applied heat, as determined by surface temperature measurements, was considered unsatisfactory with much of the heat dissipated well back of the leading edge. Heat-exchanger effectiveness of approximately 56 percent also Indicated poor utilization of available heat.

40|$|The Large-scale Advanced Prop-fan (LAP) hub {{assembly}} forms a semi-rigid {{link between the}} blades, which provide the thrust, and the engine shaft, which provides the torque. The hub and tailshaft is a one piece partially forged part which is carburized, heat treated and machined. A single row ball bearing restrains {{each of the eight}} blades in the hub, while the tailshaft secures the propeller to the engine shaft with two cone seats that are preloaded against each other by the Prop-fan retaining nut. The hub also forms the support for the pitch change actuator system, the control and the spinner. The retention transmits the loads from the blades to the hub while allowing the changes in blade pitch. The single row ball bearing retention provides ease of maintenance by allowing individual blade replacement without dissassembly of the hub. It has a through hardened inner race which seats against the aluminum <b>blade</b> <b>shank</b> and an outer race which is integral with the barrel. The outer race area is carburized to achieve the hardness necessary to support the ball loads. The balls are kept from contact with each other by a separator. The rotational speed of the propeller keeps the retention submerged in the oil which is contained in the hub by a seal. Stress and strain analysis, material hardness requirements, weight predictions, and stiffness characteristics are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of oncospheral hook {{formation in}} the anoplocephalid cestode Mosgovoyia ctenoides (Railliet, 1890) Beveridge, 1978, is described. The hook morphogenesis takes place inside the six symmetrically arranged hook-forming cells, the oncoblasts. They show characteristic large nuclei of semilunar shape, localized at one pole of the embryo. At the begin-ning of the hook formation, the hook-forming centre appears in the cytoplasmic part of each oncoblast. It consists of numer-ous free ribosomes and polyribosomes surrounded by several mitochondria and Golgi complexes. The hook-forming centre is involved in synthesis of an electron-dense, undifferentiated hook primordium, which undergoes progressive differentiation and elongation into the fully developed hook. A fully formed oncospheral hook consists of the three parts: <b>blade,</b> <b>shank,</b> and base. Each hook, {{at the site of}} its protrusion from the oncosphere, is surrounded by two electron-dense rings interconnected by a circular septate junction. The hook material consists of two or three layers that differ in electron density: (1) a moderate-ly electron-dense core, (2) a middle layer of low electron density, and (3) a highly osmiophilic cortex. Wide bands of hook muscles are attached to the basal and collar parts of the hook. The hook blades project outside of the oncospheral body into a large cavity delimited by the hook region membrane attached at this pole directly to the oncospheral surface. In the fully devel-oped oncosphere of M. ctenoides, the three pairs of oncospheral hooks and their muscles form a complex hook muscle system...|$|E
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test was {{conducted}} to obtain data on several drag reduction methods for rotorcraft hubs. The objective of the test was to use small-scale models to develop the technology to substantially reduce hub drag. A helicopter test model, which did not incorporate a rotor, was used to study single-rotor fairing configurations. The rotor shaft assembly was modeled with nonrotating hardware. Drag trend data was obtained for the following fairing configuration changes: hub-fairing camber, hub-fairing thickness ratio, hub-fairing surface curvature, hub-fairing height {{with respect to the}} fuselage, inclusion of <b>blade</b> <b>shanks</b> in the hub fairings, hub- and pylon-fairing gaps, pylon-fairing cross-sectional geometry, pylon-fairing thickness ratio and camber. Substantial drag reductions could potentially result from application of the test results to helicopter hub- and pylon-fairing design...|$|R
40|$|The cooling {{arrangement}} of the Space Shuttle Main Engine High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump (HPOTP) incorporates two jet rings, each of which produces 19 high-velocity coolant jets. At some operating conditions, the frequency of excitation associated with the 19 jets coincides with the natural frequency of the turbine blades, contributing to fatigue cracking of <b>blade</b> <b>shanks.</b> In this paper, an alternate turbine disk cooling arrangement, applicable to disk faces of zero hub radius, is evaluated, which consists of a single coolant jet impinging {{at the center of}} the turbine disk. Results of the CFD analysis show that replacing the jet ring with a single central coolant jet in the HPOTP leads to an acceptable thermal environment at the disk rim. Based on the predictions of flow and temperature fields for operating conditions, the single central jet cooling system was recommended for implementation into the development program of the Technology Test Bed Engine at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center...|$|R
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the propulsive efficiency of three adjustable propellers of 10 -foot diameter operated in front of four body nose shapes, varying from streamline nose that continued through the propeller plane {{in the form of a}} large spinner to a conventional open-nose radial-engine cowling. One propeller had airfoil sections close to the hub, the second had conventional round <b>blade</b> <b>shanks,</b> and the third differed from the second only in pitch distribution. The blade-angle settings ranged from 20 degrees to 55 degrees at the 0. 75 radius. The effect of the body nose shape on propulsive efficiency may be divided into two parts: (1) the change in the body drag due to the propeller slipstream and (2) the change in propeller load distribution due to the change in velocity caused by the body. For the nose shape tested in the report, the first effect is shown to be very small; therefore, the chief emphasis of the report is confined to the second effect...|$|R
40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests are}} {{reported}} of five 3 -blade 10 -foot propellers operating {{in front of}} a radial and a liquid-cooled engine nacelle. The range of blade angles investigated extended from 15 degrees to 45 degrees. Two spinners were tested in conjunction with the liquid-cooled engine nacelle. Comparisons are made between propellers having different blade-shank shapes, blades of different thickness, and different airfoil sections. The results show that propellers operating in front of the liquid-cooled engine nacelle had higher take-off efficiencies than when operating in front of the radial engine nacelle; the peak efficiency was higher only when spinners were employed. One spinner increased the propulsive efficiency of the liquid-cooled unit 6 percent for the highest blade-angle setting investigated and less for lower blade angles. The propeller having airfoil sections extending into the hub was superior to one having round <b>blade</b> <b>shanks.</b> The thick propeller having a Clark y section had a higher take-off efficiency than the thinner one, but its maximum efficiency was possibly lower. Of the three blade sections tested, Clark y, R. A. F. 6, and NACA 2400 - 34, the Clark y was superior for the high-speed condition, but the R. A. F. 6 excelled for the take-off condition...|$|R
40|$|The T 56 Series III 1 st stage {{rotor blade}} is cooled using {{moderately}} preswirled air from 36 preswirl injection nozzles. The amount of swirl achieved by discrete preswirl coolant jets is generally unknown, due to mixing losses. A “frozen-rotor ” CFD analysis was therefore performed on a {{sector of the}} NGV support plate/ 1 st stage rotor disc cavity of the T 56 turboprop engine, including a preswirl injection hole and {{a section of the}} upstream plenum. It was found for this geometry that the mean tangential velocity of the coolant in the preswirl region of the rotor-stator cavity was about half the maximum tangential velocity in the preswirl jets (Cθmean/Cθmaxjet = 0. 5). This value was used in ICP, a one-dimensional coolant flow network program, to model coolant flow in the disc cavities. ICP was then iterated with the disc assembly conduction code DCOOL to obtain the temperature distribution in the disc assembly. The result was compared with the resultant temperature distribution for a Cθmean/Cθmaxjet value of unity. The temperature distribution in most of the 1 st disc remained largely insensitive to the value of Cθmean/Cθmaxjet, showing the spacer to play a greater role in heat conduction to the disc than the <b>blade</b> <b>shanks...</b>|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of renewable energy sources, Gas Turbines (GTs) are currently required to accomplish more flexible operations for supplying the back-up energy. As a result, thermo-mechanical fatigue issues in the GTs components are emphasized. In this paper, the design of a novel rig for assessing the fatigue behavior in the trailing edge of full scale GTs blades is presented. Based on a detailed Finite Element (FE) analysis of the blade response under thermo-mechanical loads, it is demonstrated that the stress and strain cycles arising in this area during a start-up/shut-down transient can be accurately reproduced by clamping the <b>blade</b> in the <b>shank</b> zone and applying a transversal load to the trailing edge. It is also shown that the stress/strain states can be obtained using a Test Article (TA) extracted from the actual blade. In this configuration, the load magnitude and direction, and the distance of the application point from the blade platform are the test control parameters. A FE model simulating the TA test is developed to determine the test parameters. A tooling for clamping and loading the TA is finally proposed along with a rig apparatus consisting of standard equipment used in material testing...|$|R
40|$|The icing {{protection}} {{obtained from}} an internally air-heated propeller blade partitioned to confine the heated air forward of 25 -percent chord {{was investigated in}} the NACA Cleveland icing research tunnel. A production-model hollow steel propeller was modified with an Internal radial partition at 25 -percent chord and with shank and tip openings to admit and exhaust the heated air. Temperatures were measured on the blade surfaces and in the heated-air system during tunnel icing conditions. Heat-exchanger effectiveness and photographs of Ice formations on the blades were obtained. Surface temperature measurements indicated that confining the heated air forward of the 25 -percent chord gave. a more economical distribution of the applied heat as compared with unpartitioned and 50 -percent partitioned blades, by dissipating {{a greater percentage of}} the available heat at the leading edge. At a propeller speed of 850 rpm, a heating rate of 7000 Btu per hour per <b>blade</b> at a <b>shank</b> air temperature of 400 F provided adequate Icing protection at ambient-air temperatures of 23 F but not at temperatures as low as 15 F.

50|$|The {{parts of}} a {{straight}} razor and their function are described as follows:The narrow end of the blade rotates on a pin called the pivot, between two protective pieces called the scales or handle. The upward curved metal end of the narrow part of the blade beyond the pivot is called the tang and acts as a lever to help raise the blade from the handle. One or two fingers resting on the tang also help stabilize the blade while shaving. The narrow support piece between the tang and the main blade is called the shank, but this reference is often avoided {{because it can be}} confusing since the shank is also referred to as tang. The shank sometimes features decorations and the stamp of the brand. The top side and the underside of the shank can sometimes exhibit indentations known as fluting, or jimps for a more secure grip. The curved lower part of the main <b>blade</b> from the <b>shank</b> to the cutting edge is called the shoulder. The point where the shoulder joins the cutting edge is called the heel. The endpoint of the cutting edge {{at the front of the}} blade, opposite to the heel, is called the toe.|$|R

Matrix equations are also derived which define the critical speeds end mode shapes for any excitation order and the relation between critical speed and blade angle. Reference is given to standard works on the numerical solution of matrix equations of the forms derived. The use of a segmented blade as an approximation to a continuous blade provides a simple means for obtaining the matrix solution from the integral equation of equilibrium, so that, in the numerical application of the method presented, the several matrix arrays of the basic physical characteristics of the propeller blade are of simple form, end their simplicity is preserved until, with the solution in sight, numerical manipulations well-known in matrix algebra yield the desired critical speeds and mode shapes frame which the vibration at any operating condition may be synthesized. A close correspondence between the familiar Stodola method and the matrix method is pointed out, indicating that any features of novelty are characteristic not of the analytical procedure but only of the abbreviation, condensation, and efficient organization of the numerical procedure {{made possible by the}} use of classical matrix theory...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of the meat yield {{breeding}} values of sires on highly valued parts of carcasses in their progeny. The study was carried out on Czech Fleckviehs, a breed dual purpose milk-beef production. Cutting parts evaluated were: round, strip loin and tender loin (first-class meat); rib, shoulder <b>blade</b> (boneless), fore <b>shank,</b> flank, chuck roll + neck (second-class meat) and separable fat. The correlation analysis showed significant negative relationships only for the relative breeding values of trading classes and the rib (r=− 0. 2079); relative breeding values of net daily gain with strip loin (r=− 0. 2433). Although strip loin is an important first-class meat cut, the correlation is rather low. Correlations between other meat cuts with breeding values were non-significant. The correlation between meat cuts and age showed the same pattern as correlations between meat cuts and weight at slaughter. Significant negative correlations were found between first-class meat and increasing age (r=− 0. 1979) and weight (r=− 0. 2884). In contrast, for second-class meat there were positive correlation with increasing age and weight (r= 0. 3489 for age, r= 0. 4495 for weight). This also corresponds with the correlation between age or weight and specific first-class meat cuts (tender loin r=− 0. 2804, r=− 0. 3413, strip loin r=− 0. 3710, r=− 0. 2012) and second-class meat (sep. fat r=+ 0. 2360, r=+ 0. 2951, r for correlation with age and weight respectively).
