5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular <b>bract</b> that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped {{around the base of}} the open flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally. Bracteoles are small or absent.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, hollow stem expands, topped by a <b>bract</b> protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and <b>bract</b> parts before tunneling into the rachis {{as they get}} older and boring into follicles and eating seeds. This tunneling itself damages the architecture of the spike and prevents seed development. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genus Cryptophasa, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa, Brachmia trinervis, Carposina hyperlopha and an unidentified weevil species.|$|E
40|$|The {{appearance}} of {{cauliflower and broccoli}} heads is of great importance for the commercial value of these crops. The <b>bracting</b> trait, in which <b>bracts</b> protrude through the cauliflower curd or broccoli head, is therefore, detrimental to their value. Association analysis between the allelic status of the BoAP 1 -a locus and the severity of <b>bracting</b> in populations segregating for this trait indicates that <b>bracting</b> may be suppressed by certain BoAP 1 -a alleles. In F 2 populations {{in which all the}} plants are homozygous for a recessive Boap 1 -a allele that does not suppress <b>bracting,</b> segregation ratios of ∼ 3 : 1 for bracty:non-bracty plants were observed, indicating the presence of a single dominant gene that promotes <b>bracting...</b>|$|R

25|$|Winter buds: Dark red, {{covered with}} a bloom, obtuse; scales {{becoming}} conspicuous stipules for the unfolding leaf, and persistent until the leaf is fully grown. Flower-bud enclosed in a two-valved, caducous <b>bract.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pollen strobili of Pinophyta {{are similar}} to those of cycads (although much smaller) and Ginkgoes in that they are {{composed}} of microsporophylls with microsporangia on the abaxial surface. Seed cones of many conifers are compound strobili. The central stem produces bracts and in the axil of each <b>bract</b> is a cone scale. Morphologically the cone scale is a reduced stem. Ovules are produced on the adaxial surface of the cone scales.|$|E
25|$|The Grevilleoideae grow as trees, shrubs or subshrubs. They {{are highly}} variable, making it {{impossible}} to provide a simple, diagnostic identification key for the subfamily. One common and fairly diagnostic character is the occurrence of flowers in pairs that share a common <b>bract.</b> However, a few Grevilleoideae taxa do not have this property, having solitary flowers or inflorescences of unpaired flowers. In most taxa the flowers occur in densely packed heads or spikes, and the fruit is a follicle.|$|E
2500|$|Glossy, {{overlapping}} <b>bracts</b> form {{a terminal}} inflorescence, that is spike-shaped to ovoid. The <b>bracts</b> are red to orange, usually becoming more orange at the apex, which curves outward. The inflorescence is quite variable in size, ranging from [...] long and [...] cm broad. During flowering, small, hermaphroditic yellow or orange tubular florets emerge among the <b>bracts.</b> They are usually {{about as long}} as the <b>bracts</b> but can be substantially longer.|$|R
50|$|If many <b>bracts</b> {{are present}} {{and they are}} {{strictly}} connected to the stem, like in the family Asteraceae, the <b>bracts</b> might collectively be called an involucre. If the inflorescence has a second unit of <b>bracts</b> further up the stem, they might be called an involucel.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} {{is made up}} of many purple- or pink-tipped greenish <b>bracts.</b> Between the <b>bracts</b> appear small yellowish flowers.|$|R
25|$|The {{terminal}} or lateral inflorescences are spike-like, {{made up of}} joint-like segments {{with tiny}} paired cymes emerging from the joints. Each cyme consists of three (rarely five) flowers completely embedded between the <b>bract</b> and immersed in the fleshy tissue of the axis. The flowers of a cyme are arranged in a transverse row, the central flower separating the lateral flowers, with tissue of the axis between them. The hermaphrodite or unisexual flowers {{are more or less}} radially symmetric, with a perianth of three or four fleshy tepals connate nearly to the apex, one or two stamens, and an ovary with two or three stigmas.|$|E
25|$|The foliage is a dull dark {{to light}} green color, with scale-like leaves 1-1.5mm long, with the leaf tips not spreading; {{seedlings}} bear needle-like leaves 8–10mm long. The cones are small, 11–24mm long, and almost spherical, with {{six or eight}} scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs, with the <b>bract</b> visible as {{no more than a}} small lump or short spine on the scale. The seeds are 3–5mm long, with a pair of small wings along the sides. The cones remain closed on the trees for many years, until the trees are killed by a forest fire; after the tree is dead, the cones open to release the seeds which can then germinate successfully on the bare fire-cleared ground.|$|E
25|$|Hornbeams {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} trees, Carpinus betulus reaching {{a height of}} 32m. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, and simple with a serrated margin, and typically vary from 3–10cm in length. The flowers are wind-pollinated pendulous catkins, produced in spring. The male and female flowers are on separate catkins, but on the same tree (monoecious). The fruit is a small nut about 3–6mm long, held in a leafy bract; the <b>bract</b> may be either trilobed or simple oval, and is slightly asymmetrical. The asymmetry of the seedwing makes it spin as it falls, improving wind dispersal. The shape of the wing {{is important in the}} identification of different hornbeam species. Typically, 10–30 seeds are on each seed catkin.|$|E
50|$|Flowers: Flower {{clusters}} {{are simple}} and flat-topped or rounded. Involucral <b>bracts</b> Inconspicuous <b>bracts</b> {{at the base}} of each flower. Indistinct sepals.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Papery (upper) and leafy <b>bracts</b> on hay rattle (Rhinanthus minor). All the [...] "leaves" [...] in {{this image}} are <b>bracts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The woolly {{inflorescence}} {{is made up}} {{of layers}} of dusty red or pink <b>bracts.</b> Between the <b>bracts</b> emerge pouched dull reddish flowers.|$|R
25|$|The stem divides into ten or more branches, each {{of which}} is topped by a {{compound}} spiny ovoid inflorescence of 4–8cm in diameter, which may be covered in dense arachnoid hairs. This inflorescence is unusual for members of the Asteraceae family, as each true flowerhead is so far reduced as to only contain one floret, which is surrounded by its own involucre. Five to seven of these monofloral flowerheads combine into secondary flowerheads, each subtended by a spiny <b>bract</b> hardly or substantially longer than the secondary flowerheads, with only the centre floret developing a cypsela, and the surrounding ones only producing pollen. These secondary flowerheads later break free from the globose assembly of flowerheads that sit on the end of each branch of the stem during the tumbleweed-stage. Remarkable for a member of the Cichorieae tribe are also the disk florets, a trait that is further only present in Warionia saharae.|$|E
25|$|The genus Wollemia shares {{morphological}} characteristics {{with the}} genera Araucaria and Agathis. Wollemia and Araucaria both have closely crowned sessile and amphistomatic leaves, and aristate <b>bract</b> scales, while Wollemia and Agathis both have fully fused bracts, ovuliferous scales, and winged seeds. Scrutiny of {{the fossil record}} likewise does not clarify Wollemia’s relationship to Araucaria or Agathis, since the former has similarly disparate leaf characters in its adult and juvenile forms, and the latter has similar cone characters. Further, the recent description of several extinct genera within the Araucariaceae points to complex relationships within the family and a significant loss of diversity since the Cretaceous. An early study of the rbcL gene sequence places Wollemia in the basal position of the Araucariaceae and as the sister group to Agathis and Araucaria. In contrast, another study of the rbcL sequence shows that Wollemia is the sister group to Agathis and Araucaria is basal. The different outgroup selection and genes used in previous studies are the reasons behind the discrepancy over the groupings of the three genera. Later genetic studies corroborate Wollemias placement in the Araucariaceae as sister to Agathis {{based on data from}} the 28s rRNA gene, a combination of rbcL and matK genes, and a comprehensive study encompassing nuclear ribosomal 18S and 26S rRNA, chloroplast 16S rRNA, rbcL, matK and rps4, and mitochondrial coxl and atp1 genes.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, UPLB {{researchers}} {{funded by}} the Department of Agriculture developed an abacá variety that is resistant to the abaca bunchy top virus. The virus, first detected in 1915 at Silang, Cavite, has since spread to various provinces in the country, and damaged more than [...] of abacá plantations in 2002 alone. The university is working further to make it resistant to mosaic and abacá <b>bract</b> mosaic viruses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inflorescence}} has three-lobed <b>bracts</b> {{with yellow}} or white tips. Between the <b>bracts</b> emerge fuzzy white flowers dotted with purple and yellow.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bracts</b> {{that appear}} in a whorl {{subtending}} an inflorescence are collectively called an involucre. An involucre is a common feature beneath the inflorescences of many Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Dipsacaceae and Polygonaceae. Each flower in an inflorescence may have its own whorl of <b>bracts,</b> in this case called an involucel. In this case they may be called chaff, paleas, or receptacular <b>bracts</b> and are usually minute scales or bristles. Many asteraceous plants have <b>bracts</b> {{at the base of}} each inflorescence.|$|R
50|$|Glossy, {{overlapping}} <b>bracts</b> form {{a terminal}} inflorescence, that is spike-shaped to ovoid. The <b>bracts</b> are red to orange, usually becoming more orange at the apex, which curves outward. The inflorescence is quite variable in size, ranging from 4 to 18 cm long and 3 to 9 cm cm broad. During flowering, small, hermaphroditic yellow or orange tubular florets emerge among the <b>bracts.</b> They are usually {{about as long}} as the <b>bracts</b> but can be substantially longer.|$|R
500|$|One {{field study}} found 30% of seeds were eaten by insects between bushfires. Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora arcuatalis), younger instars of which eat flower and <b>bract</b> parts before tunneling into the woody {{axis of the}} spike {{as they get older}} and boring into follicles and eating seeds. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genera Cryptophasa and Xylorycta, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa and an unidentified weevil species. [...] The fungal species Asterina systema-solare, Episphaerella banksiae and Lincostromea banksiae have been recorded on the leaves.|$|E
2500|$|A. mirabilis {{exhibits}} two characteristics shared only by A. bidwillii among extant Araucaria species. First is {{the separate}} {{origins of the}} vascular bundles of the <b>bract</b> and fertile scales; second is the highly vascularized [...] "ligule". They also both have dicotyledonous embryos. On this basis, A. mirabilis is classified as belonging to the section Bunya.|$|E
2500|$|Nepenthes mollis has a racemose {{inflorescence}}. The female inflorescence is unknown. The male inflorescence is densely {{covered with}} flowers and is described by Danser as [...] "not robust" [...] and [...] "at last seemingly lateral". The peduncle is approximately 7.5cm long, 4mm wide at the base, and 3mm wide at the top. The rachis is gradually [...] and 10 to 15cm long. Lower partial peduncles are about 12mm long, the upper ones being slightly shorter. All are two-flowered and do not possess a <b>bract.</b> Sepals are elliptic, obtuse, and approximately 4mm long. The staminal column is about 4.5mm long, including the singly [...] anthers. A study of 120 pollen samples taken from the type specimen (Endert 4282) found the mean pollen diameter to be 37.2μm (SE = 0.4; CV = 6.1%).|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{comparisons}} of the anatomy and morphology of the leaves, <b>bracts</b> and bracteoles within representatives of the order Brassicales indicate similarity of <b>bracts</b> and leaves, {{as well as the}} similarity between bracteoles and stipules. This is evidence in favor of homologous leaf and <b>bracts,</b> and stipules and bracteoles...|$|R
50|$|Formation of the syconium {{begins with}} the initial growth of <b>bracts,</b> which curve to form a receptacle. When the outer <b>bracts</b> meet, they form the ostiole by interlock. Syconia may also develop lateral, basal, or peduncular <b>bracts.</b> There is a {{relationship}} between the shape of the ostiole and the morphology of the pollinating wasp.|$|R
5000|$|On flowering, the {{inflorescence}} in male {{plants is}} branched to three orders, in females to one, rarely two. The prophyll is large, splitting and becoming tattered, and armed with pseudo-whorls of black spines. Peduncular <b>bracts</b> are {{not present in}} the genus, the first order branches bear distichous, unarmed tubular <b>bracts</b> with fibrous limbs which subtend or wholly enclose, in the staminate spike, the second order branch system. These are subtended by tubular, membranous <b>bracts,</b> the third order rachillae have similar <b>bracts</b> subtending solitary staminate flowers.|$|R
2500|$|Magnolia is {{an ancient}} genus. Appearing before bees did, the flowers are theorized to have evolved to {{encourage}} pollination by beetles. To avoid damage from pollinating beetles, the carpels of Magnolia flowers are extremely tough. [...] Fossilised specimens of M. acuminata have been found dating to 20 million years ago, and of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 million years ago. Another aspect of Magnolia considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a <b>bract</b> rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals. Magnolia shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near {{the base of the}} flowering plant lineage such as Amborella and Nymphaea (as well as with many more recently derived plants such as Lilium).|$|E
2500|$|Castilleja exserta {{is known}} {{by a handful}} of common names: exserted Indian paintbrush, {{sometimes}} red owl's clover, or purple Indian paintbrush. It is one of two secondary larval host plants of the butterfly that remains edible later in the season and acts as a back up when the dwarf plantain dries up. The plant can grow up to [...] in height. It prefers mesas, slopes and open areas in ponderosa pine forests and poppy fields at elevations from 1,500 to 4,500feet(1,370m). The flowers bloom from March to May and are about 1.25inches long (32mm) and formed in dense spikes, they are magenta or purple on the lower corolla lips and have yellow or white tips. The <b>bract,</b> modified leaves, are a reddish purple and hold five to seven lobes, each about one inch long (25mm). It ranges from middle to southern California, into southern Arizona and northern Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|Chives are a bulb-forming {{herbaceous}} perennial plant, {{growing to}} [...] tall. The bulbs are slender, conical, [...] long and [...] broad, and grow in dense clusters from the roots. The scapes (or stems) are hollow and tubular, up to [...] long and [...] across, {{with a soft}} texture, although, prior {{to the emergence of}} a flower, they may appear stiffer than usual. The leaves, which are shorter than the scapes, are also hollow and tubular, or terete, (round in cross-section) which distinguishes it at a glance from garlic chives (Allium tuberosum). The flowers are pale purple, and star-shaped with six petals, [...] wide, and produced in a dense inflorescence of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery <b>bract.</b> The seeds are produced in a small, three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.|$|E

40|$|The {{phytochemical}} {{composition in}} two Tunisian globe artichoke cultivars (<b>bracts,</b> leaves, and floral stems) was evaluated {{in the plant}} byproducts. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>bracts</b> contain the highest levels of total phenols, o-diphenols, and flavonoids, whereas tannins seem to be more abundant in the leaves. <b>Bracts</b> from the 'Violet d'Hyères' cultivar possessed more total phenols (160. 8 mg/g DW), flavonoids (64. 9 mg/g DW), and anthocyanins (15. 3 μg/g DW) than the 'Blanc d'Oran' <b>bracts</b> (134. 5 mg/g DW, 51. 2 mg/g DW, and 8. 3 μg/g DW, resp.). Sixty-four volatile compounds were identified in the headspace of globe artichoke material, particularly in the <b>bracts.</b> The volatile profile showed that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and non-terpene derivatives were the main volatiles emitted by the <b>bracts</b> in both cultivars. These results suggest that globe artichoke byproducts might represent a potential source of natural compounds, which could be used as nutraceuticals or as ingredients in the design of functional foods...|$|R
