40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} {{prevalence}} of congenital heart disease in <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> oesophageal atresia and its influence on outcome.  DESIGN—Retrospective analysis.  SETTING—The resident population of one health region.  RESULTS—A total of 153 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> oesophageal atresia were identified from 509 975 live births (0. 30 per 1000); 26 (17 %) had cardiac defects. Survival of <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> normal hearts was 97 %, 97 %, and 95 % at one week, one month, and one year. Survival of <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> congenital heart disease was 85 %, 85 %, and 67 % at one week, one month, and one year, but only one of ten deaths {{was the result of}} the congenital heart disease. The remaining deaths were due to other congenital malformations, respiratory disease, or chromosome abnormalities.  CONCLUSIONS—There is a high prevalence of congenital heart disease in <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> oesophageal atresia. Congenital heart disease is associated with a higher mortality in oesophageal atresia but it is not the cause of it. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Neonatal necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} [NEC], {{characterized by}} intestinal necrosis and pneumatosis intestinal, {{is the most}} common gastrointestinal emergency in the premature newborns[1]. The disease has an incidence rate of 2 to 5 % in premature infants. The incidence rate increases to 13 % in those weighing 1, 500 gram at birth. NEC has a mortality rate of 10 to 55 %. Objective: To determine the frequency of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm neonates along with their outcome during stay in hospital. Methods: All premature newborn with morbidity admitted at Neonatal Intensive Care Unit [NICU] the Children Hospital, PIMS, Islamabad were screened for enrolment. A total of 156 premature newborn who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the current study. The duration of study was 6 months. At the time of enrolment, demographic characteristics of all the enrolled babies were obtained and noted on the proforma specially designed for the study. Delivery complications, enteral feeding status and resuscitation at birth were also noted. Each baby was assessed for the diagnosis of NEC. Those who were diagnosed to have NEC where then followed for outcome. The outcome of study was either discharged [n= 35] or died [n= 12] during the hospital stay. Results: During the study period a total of 156 babies were enrolled. Out of 156 babies, 47 [30. 1 %] babies were diagnosed to have NEC. The mean [SD] age of <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC in this study was 7. 8 [± 4. 1] days. Out of 47, 29 [62. 0 %] babies were aged up to 8 days. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 27 [57. 0 %] babies were male. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 26 [55. 3 %] babies were residence of urban areas. The mean [SD] gestational age was 32. 1 [± 3. 4] weeks. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 30 [63. 8 %] <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC had gestational age of 32 weeks or more. The mean [SD] weight was 1, 813. 7 [± 283. 4] grams. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 29 [61. 7 %] babies had weight less than 2, 000 grams. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 28 [59. 6 %] <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC were fed on formula milk. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 36 [76. 6 %] mothers had complications during the time of delivery. Out of 47 babies, 28 [60 %] mothers had PROM. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 18 [38. 3 %] babies had hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 28 [59. 6 %] <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC were resuscitated at the time of birth. Out of 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 18 [38. 3 %] babies showed complete resolution, 11 [23. 4 %] babies showed partial resolution with residual disability, 6 [12. 8 %] <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC showed no improvement whereas 12 [25. 6 %] babied died during their stay in the hospital. Conclusions: Our study shows that out of 156 babies admitted and enrolled in our study, 47 [30. 1 %] were diagnosed to have NEC. Out of these 47 <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> NEC, 35 [74. 4 %] survived with 18, 11 and 6 babies showed complete resolution, partial resolution with residual disability, and no improvement respectively, while 12 [25. 6 %] were died during their hospital stay. However, {{there is a need to}} conduct further research including a multi-centre, large sample size study to investigate the burden of NEC in Pakistan...|$|R

40|$|Anorectal {{anomalies}} occurring {{with other}} anomalies or {{as part of}} syndromes were analyzed to determine how their epidemiological characteristics differed from those of isolated anal anomalies. Almost 15 % of cases were chromosomal, monogenic or teratogenic syndromes, whereas the rest were of unknown cause including sequences (9. 3 %), VACTERL associations (15. 4 %) and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) (60. 2 %). Almost half of <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> MCA had one or two VACTERL anomalies with distribution frequencies that did not differ significantly from those in <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> the full VACTERL association. There were considerable differences in the frequency of the VACTERL association among <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> different types of anorectal anomaly. <b>Babies</b> <b>with</b> anal anomalies occurring with sequences, VACTERL or MCA showed the same sex differences as <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> isolated anal anomalies, namely male predominance in anal atresia without fistula or cloaca, no sex difference in anal atresia with fistula, and female predominance in ectopic anus and congenital anal fistula. These anomalies, however, were associated with significantly lower mean gestational lengths and birth weights, and higher frequencies of fetal death and pregnancy termination than <b>babies</b> <b>with</b> isolated anal anomalies. Twins were more frequent in sequences, VACTERL and MCA than in isolated anomalies, monogenic syndromes or chromosome anomalies. Five cases were conjoined twins, representing 15 % of all cases of twin pregnancies with an anal anomaly.
