500|$|Thomas {{highlighted}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks the Castle member for showcasing the romantic ambiguity between Logan, Veronica, and Piz. Thomas counseled Lowell about his facial expression before filming, and he {{was pleased with the}} end result, stating that [...] "it <b>breaks</b> <b>my</b> heart". While editing the final script, Thomas and Ruggiero had to remove roughly seven minutes from the original draft, including a scene featuring dialogue between Veronica and Leo. Later, Thomas thought that removing this scene made one voiceover by Veronica too sudden.|$|E

Bryant actively campaigned to the Cuban community, telling them at a rally, [...] "You came here {{to get away from}} one sin ... and it <b>breaks</b> <b>my</b> heart that if Miami becomes another Sodom and Gomorrah you may have to leave here, too." [...] A Cuban social worker [...] suggested the cause was representative of an older generation of Cuban emigres, worried that their children were being lost in the depravity of Miami. Miami's archbishop wrote a letter against the gay rights ordinance, and ordered it to be read aloud in all Catholic churches.|$|E

[...] Anna Torv later commented that she wished for Olivia to [...] "lighten up" [...] during the first season, [...] "but every time she did, something would happen."

2500|$|On August 26, 2006, Harris's {{campaign}} {{released a}} [...] "Statement of Clarification", that stated, “In the interview, Harris {{was speaking to}} a Christian audience, addressing a common misperception that people of faith should not be actively involved in government. Addressing this Christian publication, Harris provided a statement that explains her deep grounding in Judeo-Christian values." [...] The press release went on to mention her past support of Israel and quoted her Jewish campaign manager Bryan G. Rudnick, who stated “As the grandson of Holocaust survivors, I know that she encourages people of all faiths to engage in government so that our country can continue to thrive on the principles set forth by our founding fathers, without malice towards anyone.” At an appearance at an Orlando gun show that same day, she said [...] "it <b>breaks</b> <b>my</b> heart" [...] to think people understood her comments as bigoted.

2500|$|Failures in {{both the}} East and the West began a tide of events that was to {{overwhelm}} Asquith's Liberal Government. Strategic setbacks combined with a shattering personal blow when, on 12 May 1915, Venetia Stanley announced her engagement to Edwin Montagu. Asquith's reply was immediate and brief, [...] "As you know well, this <b>breaks</b> <b>my</b> heart. I couldn't bear {{to come and see}} you. I can only pray God to bless you—and help me." [...] Venetia's importance to him is illustrated by a letter written in mid-1914; [...] "Keep close to me beloved in this most critical time of my life. I know you will not fail." [...] Her engagement; [...] "a very treacherous return after all the joy you've given me", left him devastated. Significant though the loss was personally, its impact on Asquith politically can be overstated. The historian Stephen Koss notes that Asquith [...] "was always able to divide his public and private lives into separate compartments (and) soon found new confidantes to whom he was writing with no less frequency, ardour and indiscretion." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It <b>breaks</b> <b>my</b> heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E
