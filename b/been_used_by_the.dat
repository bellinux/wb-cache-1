5|$|Auberge d'Italie was {{the third}} Italian auberge {{to be built in}} Malta. The first auberge was built in Birgu in the 1550s, on the site of an earlier {{building}} which had <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Langue of Italy. Following the transfer of the capital city from Birgu to Valletta, a second auberge was built in the centre of the new city in 1570–71.

5|$|Most Shogunate troops used Büchse (Gewehr) smoothbore guns, {{which had}} been {{imported}} in Japan since around 1840, initially from the Netherlands by Takashima Akiho.

The daimyō of Nagaoka however, an ally of the Shogun, possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles. The Shogunate {{is known to have}} placed an order for 30,000 modern Dreyse needle guns in 1866. Napoleon III provided Tokugawa Yoshinobu with 2,000 state-of-the-art Chassepot rifles, which he used to equip his personal guard.
