50|$|The {{analogue}} (or analog) switch, {{also called}} the <b>bilateral</b> <b>switch,</b> is an electronic component that behaves {{in a similar way}} to a relay, but has no moving parts. The switching element is normally a pair of MOSFET transistors, one an N-channel device, the other a P-channel device. The device can conduct analog or digital signals in either direction when on and isolates the switched terminals when off. Analogue switches are usually manufactured as integrated circuits in packages containing multiple switches (typically two, four or eight). These include the 4016 and 4066 from the 4000 series.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a <b>switching</b> <b>bilateral</b> filter (SBF) with a texture and noise {{detector}} for universal noise removal. Operation {{was carried out}} in two stages: detection followed by filtering. For detection, we propose the sorted quadrant median vector (SQMV) scheme, which includes important features such as edge or texture information. This information is utilized to allo-cate a reference median from SQMV, which is in turn compared with a current pixel to classify it as impulse noise, Gaussian noise, or noise-free. The SBF removes both Gaussian and impulse noise without adding another weighting function. The range filter in-side the <b>bilateral</b> filter <b>switches</b> between the Gaussian and impulse modes depending upon the noise classification result. Simulation results show that our noise detector has a high noise detection rate as well as a high classification rate for salt-and-pepper, uniform impulse noise and mixed impulse noise. Unlike most other impulse noise filters, the proposed SBF achieves high peak signal-to-noise ratio and great image quality by efficiently removing both types of mixed noise, salt-and-pepper with uniform noise and salt-and-pepper with Gaussian noise. In addition, the computational com-plexity of SBF is significantly less than that of other mixed noise filters.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>switching</b> patients from <b>bilateral</b> latanoprost to bimatoprost in 1 eye while maintaining latanoprost in the fellow eye. Patients and Methods: This prospective, open-label, multicenter, uniocular (within-eye control) study was conducted from March 2005 to February 2007; 105 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled. At baseline, patients using <b>bilateral</b> latanoprost were <b>switched</b> to bimatoprost treatment in 1 eye (study eye) and continued latanoprost treatment in the fellow eye (control eye). At 12 weeks, patients were offered bilateral bimatoprost for 12 additional weeks. Results: At week 12, the mean difference in intraocular pressure (IOP) from baseline was - 3. 0 mm Hg in study eyes and - 1. 6 mm Hg in control eyes, which equates to a further - 1. 4 mm Hg (95 % confidence limits: - 1. 9, - 0. 9) reduction in IOP in study eyes compared with control eyes (P =- 2. 5 mm Hg reduction in IOP than control eyes (P< 0001). At week 24, the mean difference in IOP from baseline was - 2. 8 mm Hg for study eyes and for control eyes that had switched to bimatoprost. Conjunctival hyperemia occurred more frequently and was more severe in bimatoprost-treated eyes at week 12 than at baseline (P< 0. 001). No patients withdrew from treatment because of conjunctival hyperemia.

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} effects of {{bilateral}} debt forgiveness on 32 low-income countries in Africa (1984 - 93). Asking whether {{it makes a difference}} for recipient countries to receive pure grants rather that official development assistance (ODA) debt relief, they focus on how one form of aid or the other affects the countries'import capacity. They conclude that: a) grants allowed recipient countries to significantly expand their import capacity for 1984 - 93 as grants and import capacity have been increasing since 1984. But the increasing share of concessional lending and debt relief in recent years has not allowed these countries to reduce total indebtedness nor solve debt overhang. b) the biggest recipients of debt relief also received the lion's share of the pure grants increase. Debt forgiveness and pure grants were allocated not entirely consistent with standard economic hierarchies. c) bilateral ODA debt forgiveness appears to be neutral in the sense of not having any significant impact on import capacity. During 1989 - 93, multilateral lending replaced the bilateral lending decrease caused by an increase in grants. d) private creditors have typically withdrawn money as grants increased. And debt relief has had a crowding-out effect on new lending. <b>Bilateral</b> donors are <b>switching</b> their development finance to Africa from concessional and non-concessional lending to a combination of pure grants and ODA relief.

40|$|Among {{the factors}} that {{contribute}} to the papilla formation and crestal bone preservation between contiguous implants, this animal study clinically and radiographically evaluated the interimplant distances (IDs) of 2 and 3 mm and the placement depths of Morse cone connection implants restored with platform <b>switch.</b> <b>Bilateral</b> mandibular premolars of 6 dogs were extracted, and after 12 weeks, the implants were placed. Four experimental groups were constituted: subcrestally with ID of 2 mm (2 SCL) and 3 mm (3 SCL) and crestally with ID of 2 mm (2 CL) and 3 mm (3 CL). Metallic crowns were immediately installed with a distance of 3 mm between the contact point and the bone crest. Eight weeks later, clinical measurements were performed to evaluate papilla formation, and radiographic images were taken to analyze the crestal bone remodeling. The subcrestal groups achieved better levels of papillae formation when compared with the crestal groups, with {{a significant difference between the}} 3 SCL and 3 CL groups (P =. 026). Radiographically, the crestal bone preservation was also better in the subcrestal groups, with statistically significant differences between the 2 SCL and 2 CL groups (P =. 002) and between the 3 SCL and 3 CL groups (P =. 008). With the present conditions, it could be concluded that subcrestal implant placement had a positive impact on papilla formation and crestal bone preservation, which could favor the esthetic of anterior regions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to contribute}} {{to our understanding of}} dynamic interaction in duopoly markets. Chapter 1 motivates the study and offers a brief overview of the results. In Chapter 2 I study the dynamic equilibrium of a market characterized by repeat purchases. Such markets exhibit two common features: customer recognition, which allows firms to price discriminate on the basis of purchase history, and consumer switching costs. Both features have implications for the competitiveness of the market and consumer welfare but are rarely studied together. I employ a dynamic framework to model a market with customer recognition and switching costs. In contrast to earlier studies of dynamic competition with switching costs, these costs are explicitly incorporated in the demand functions. Two sets of market equilibria are characterized {{depending on the size of}} the switching cost. For all values of the switching cost, customer recognition gives rise to a bargain-then-ripoff pattern in prices and switching costs amplify the loyalty price premium. When switching costs are low, there is incomplete customer lock-in in steady state, firm profits increase in the magnitude of the switching cost and introductory offers do not fall below cost. When switching costs are high, there is complete customer lock-in in steady state, firm profits are independent of switching costs and introductory prices may fall below cost. Under incomplete lock-in and <b>bilateral</b> poaching, <b>switching</b> costs do not affect the speed of convergence to steady state; under complete customer lock-in and no poaching from either firm, convergence to steady state occurs in just one period. The model also suggests that imperfect customer recognition leads to lower profits relative to both uniform pricing and perfect customer recognition. In Chapter 3 I use the market framework developed in Chapter 2 to examine the perception that imperfect competition hinders information sharing among rivals in games of random matching. In contrast to previous studies of information sharing, I propose a new channel through which competition may deter information sharing. This approach reveals a key role for firm liquidity by showing that information sharing among rivals is more likely to arise in markets populated by more liquid firms. Employing a dynamic duopoly framework, in which competition intensity varies with the degree of product differentiation, consumer switching costs and consumer patience, I show that more intense market competition can weaken the disincentives associated with disclosing information to a rival. I test the model's predictions using firm-level data on the information-sharing practices of agricultural traders in Madagascar. As predicted by the model, traders operating in liquid markets are shown to be more likely to share information about delinquent customers. This result is robust to the use of two alternative measures of liquidity, of which one is credibly exogenous, and two alternative ways of defining market liquidity. Furthermore, traders who report more intense competition in their market are found to be significantly more likely to share information...|$|R
40|$|The {{abnormality}} of the dorsolateral {{prefrontal cortex}} (DLPFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) function during working memory (WM) in schizophrenic patients has been observed in numerous neuroimaging studies. So far {{little is known about}} the influence of medication on the dysfunctional DLPFC and PPC activation. The goal of this study was to explore the effects of the atypical antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine and aripiprazole on the modulation of DLPFC and PPC activation in schizophrenic patients as well as the influence of psychopathology and performance on the activation. We used fMRI to measure the activation of DLPFC and PPC during the n-back working memory task at two different time points. The study was made on 26 schizophrenic patients and in a control group of 26 healthy subjects matched for age, smoking habits, handedness and gender. Before the first time point schizophrenic patients have been treated with a conventional antipsychotic drug for about 2 weeks. After this they were switched to one of the atypical antipsychotics risperidone (10 patients), olanzapine (10 patients) or aripiprazole (6 patients) and were measured at a second time point after about 3 weeks. Patient group and control group were compared by using a 2 × 2 design (group×session) with “smoking habits” as covariate, the three different medication groups were compared by using a 3 x 2 design (group×session). Both analysis was made with the 2 -back > 0 -back contrast. Further we calculated the correlation of psychopathology and performance with the activation in the DLPFC and the PPC. The activation in these areas was also compared in responders and nonresponders regarding psychopathology and in the good and worst performer by using a t-test. The fMRI data revealed a significant reduced activation in the patient group in the bilateral DLPFC and the <b>bilateral</b> PPC. <b>Switching</b> to risperidone, olanzapine or aripiprazole schizophrenic patients did not lead to display a significant change in the activation neither in the DLPFC nor in the PPC. Also, no differences were found between the three atypical medication groups. However, the patient group captured aripiprazole showed a significant increased activation in the DLPFC and the PPC at the second time point compared with the patient groups captured risperidone and olanzapine. Although, there were no significant differences between those three groups at the first time point. Furthermore a significant correlation of psychopathology and activation could be shown. There was no correlation between performance and activation. This study shows that schizophrenic patients have a significant reduced activation in the DLPFC and in the PPC. Also it indicates that switching patients from conventional neuroleptics to risperidone, olanzapine and aripiprazole does not significantly alter the frontal or parietal activation during working memory task. However, the various effects of risperidone, olanzapine and aripiprazole on the DLPFC and PPC activation probably cause the absence of significance. Apparently aripiprazole increase DLPFC and PPC activation, while risperidone and olanzapine reduce DLPFC and PPC activation. Further it seems that psychopathology does correlate with the activation in DLPFC and in PPC, while there is no correlation between performance and activation...|$|R
40|$|The nature, and timing, of the {{cerebral}} {{processes that are}} active when attention is switched between different tasks are not understood. The purpose {{of this research was}} to establish electrophysiological evidence for a two-stage, posterior-anterior cerebral processing model for the control of attention switching. Reaction Times (RTs) and Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 22 healthy young adults as attention was cued to switch between two visuomotor tasks. One task ("horizontal") involved determining whether a circle in one of the four boxes of a 2 x 2 grid was in the left or right half of the grid whereas the other task ("vertical") involved determining whether it was in the upper or lower half. Cues designating the appropriate task occurred 200, 1200 or 1500 ms before a target. Cues were either letters (H & V) at the center of ocular fixation, or arrows (⇕&⇔) at the periphery. The identity of the letters, and spatial location of the arrows, informed subjects what task to perform, what hand to respond with, and whether the task was the same (repeat) or different (switch) from the previous trial. The RT was longer for switch than repeat trials but only during short (200 ms) cue-target intervals. This demonstrates that subjects are able to completely switch attention prior to target stimuli when the cue-target interval was 1200 or 1500 ms. The cues evoked a sequence of potentials that were larger in the switch trials than in the repeat trials: an occipital N 200, a parietal P 390, and a mid-frontal negative wave with a latency between 400 and 800 ms. The N 200 probably represents processing of the stimulus in the extrastriate cortex. The P 390 peak was larger for arrow than letter cues at centroparietal electrodes (CP 1, CP 2), and the inverse was true at temporal-parietal sites (P 7, P 8). The P 390 was also 55 to 59 ms earlier for the dorsal than ventral waveform. This demonstrates that at least two separate neurophysiological events contribute to the amplitude and latency characteristics of the scalp recorded P 390. These processes are specific for the physical features of the cues and may correspond to the dorsal "where" and ventral "what" visual streams. Only the mid-frontal negative wave was found to be specifically with the switch in task. This wave may represent activity in the supplementary motor area or anterior cingulate as response rules are changed for the new task. The readiness potential (RP) showed complex relations to switching or repeating the task. In general, this potential was larger over the hemisphere contralateral to the hand that was being prepared for response. When there was some urgency in the task, the readiness potential was <b>bilateral</b> on <b>switch</b> trials, perhaps because the previous hand was automatically activated in case it might be needed. Left and right lateral pre-frontal slow waves occurred throughout each trial. These may represent task monitoring and/or working memory processes. These results suggest that both posterior and anterior brain regions participate in attention switching. Posterior ERPs seem to be associated with identifying the physical features of stimuli that signal the need to switch attention between tasks, whereas the mid-frontal negativity appears to be related to carrying out the switch once the need to switch has been identified. The RP indicates the preparation of a hand for response. The strategy of this preparation varies with the urgency of the switch. Other anterior processes may monitor task performance...|$|R
