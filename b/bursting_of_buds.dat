The organogenic callus, developed by intense cell division within axillary buds, resulted in irregular swelling and eventual <b>bursting</b> <b>of</b> <b>buds.</b> New shoot primordia differentiated in superficial cell layers of swollen tissues and specifically in regions with an epidermis. The epidermis formed part of the primordium. Older cultures displayed principally an increase of amorphous callus through swelling occurring in newly formed buds, as well as differentiation of super-numerary buds. The granular or nodular texture was due to aggregates of hard callus interspersed with buds in all stages of development. Although adventitious, the buds were not derived from single cells...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the role for diacylglycerol (DAG) in membrane bud formation in the Golgi apparatus.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the depth <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> dormancy in peach tree cultivars and evaluate the efficiency of the tetrazolium test for dormancy and comparing with biological test. Branches of the cultivars Aurora 1, Chimarrita, Chiripá, Coral, Eldorado, Granada, Leonense, Maciel, Marli, Premier, and Vanguard were collected between May and August 2008 at two locations: Curitiba and Lapa. The evaluation of dormancy was performed using a biological test of single node cuttings through the parameters: average time for <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> velocity <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst,</b> final rate <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and rate <b>of</b> vigorous <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> For the tetrazolium test, 300 mg <b>of</b> <b>buds</b> was used and the color intensity readings were obtained using a spectrophotometer.

One-year-old shoots of walnut (Juglans regia L. cv.

At the end of April (beginning <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> break), a higher xylem sap sucrose concentration and a higher active sucrose uptake by xylem parenchyma cells {{were found in the}} apical portion (bearing buds able to burst) than in the basal portion (bearing <b>buds</b> unable to <b>burst)</b> <b>of</b> the sample shoots. At the same time, xylem parenchyma cells of the apical portion of the shoots exhibited greater amounts of both transcripts and proteins of JrSUT 1 (Juglans regia putative sucrose transporter 1) than those of the basal stem segment.

We determined whether angiotensin II, an inducer <b>of</b> ureteric <b>bud</b> branching in vitro, influences the GDNF/c-Ret/Wnt 11 pathway. Mouse metanephroi were grown in {{the presence or absence}} of angiotensin II or an angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) antagonist and gene expression was measured by whole mount in situ hybridization. Angiotensin II induced the expression of c-Ret and Wnt 11 in ureteric bud tip cells. GDNF, a Wnt 11 -regulated gene expressed in the mesenchyme, was also upregulated by angiotensin II but this downregulated Spry 1, an endogenous inhibitor of Ret tyrosine kinase activity in an AT 1 R-dependent manner. Angiotensin II also decreased Spry 1 mRNA levels in cultured ureteric bud cells. Exogenous angiotensin II preferentially stimulated ureteric bud tip cell proliferation in vivo while AT 1 R blockade increased cell apoptosis.

40|$|Summary We {{examined}} {{effects of}} elevated CO 2 and tem-perature on cold hardiness and <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings. Two-year-old seedlings were grown for 2. 5 years in semi-closed, sunlit chambers at either ambient or elevated (ambient + » 4 °C) air {{temperature in the}} presence of an ambient or elevated (ambient + » 200 ppm) CO 2 concentration. The elevated temperature treatment delayed needle cold hardening in the autumn and slowed dehardening in the spring. At maximum hardiness, trees in the elevated temperature treatment were less hardy by about 7 °C than trees in the ambient temperature treatment. In gen-eral, trees exposed to elevated CO 2 were slightly less hardy during hardening and dehardening than trees exposed to ambi-ent CO 2. For trees in the elevated temperature treatments, date to 30 % <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> branch terminal <b>buds</b> was advanced by about 6 and 15 days {{in the presence of}} elevated CO 2 and ambient CO 2, respectively. After bud burst started, however, the rate of in-crease in % bud burst was slower in the elevated temperature treatments than in the ambient temperature treatments. Time <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> was more synchronous and bud burst was completed within a shorter period in trees at ambient temperature (with and without elevated CO 2) than in trees at elevated temperature. Exposure to elevated temperature reduced final % <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> both leader and branch terminal buds and reduced growth of the leader shoot.

40|$|Summary According to {{prevailing}} theory, {{air temperature}} {{is the main}} environmental factor regulating the timing <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> boreal and temperate trees. Air temperature has a dual role in this regulation. First, after the cessation of growth in au-tumn, prolonged exposure to chilling causes rest completion, i. e., removes the physiological growth-arresting conditions in-side the bud. After rest completion, prolonged exposure to warm conditions causes ontogenetic development leading to bud burst or flowering. During the past three decades, several simulation models based on chilling and forcing have been de-veloped and tested. In recent modeling studies of the timing <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in mature trees, the simpler thermal-time models that assume forcing starts on a fixed date in the spring have outper-formed the chilling-forcing models. We hypothesize that this discrepancy {{may be due to}} some element missing from the chilling-forcing models. We tested two new model formulations by introducing re-versing, temperature-driven elements that precede forcing and by fitting the models to seven historical time series of data of flowering and leaf <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> common boreal tree species. In these tests, both of the new models were generally more accu-rate in predicting the timing <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> than a classical chill-ing-forcing model, but less accurate than the simple thermal-time model. We therefore conclude that besides chilling, other environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the tim-ing <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Further work is needed to determine if the regulatory factors derive from air temperature or from some other environmental condition such as changes in light condi-tions, like day length or night length...|$|R

Samples were examined {{for the presence of}} overwintering structures of Ampelomyces, common mycoparasites of powdery mildews. Pycnidia and resting hyphae resembling those of Ampelomyces were found on six plant species, including apple. Their viability and subsequent mycoparasitic activity of the hyphae emerging from the overwintered fungal structures were studied in vitro to determine whether they can serve as sources of primary inocula of Ampelomyces in the spring. Overwintered pycnidia of Ampelomyces collected in the spring, and produced in both the ascomata and the conidiophores of powdery mildews during the previous season, initiated the life cycle of these mycoparasites when placed close to fresh powdery mildew colonies in vitro. Similarly, thick-walled resting hyphae, found in the dried powdery mildew mycelia which covered the overwintered aerial parts of the host plants, also germinated and gave rise to new intracellular pycnidia of Ampelomyces when powdery mildew colonies were inoculated with them in vitro. On apple trees, Ampelomyces mycoparasites overwintered as resting hyphae in the dried powdery mildew mycelia covering the shoots and in the parasitized ascomata of Podosphaera leucotricha on the bark and the scales <b>of</b> the <b>buds.</b> Approximately 31 % of the field samples collected from apple trees in spring between 1998 and 2003 contained overwintered structures <b>of</b> Ampelomyces.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Yeast cells polarize, bud, {{and divide}} {{in either of}} two genetically {{programmed}} patterns: axial or bipolar. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene BUD 1 (also known as RSR 1) encodes a Ras-related GTPase critical for selection <b>of</b> a <b>bud</b> sites in these patterns. To distinguish between possible mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>Bud</b> 1 p action, we have examined the function and subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>Bud</b> 1 p {{in a variety of}} mutant situations. Results Bud 1 p has 57  % identity to H-ras, except for an 81 amino-acid insertion near the carboxyl terminus. Mutation <b>of</b> the proposed <b>BUD</b> 1 effector domain produces a protein which can neither support normal patterns <b>of</b> <b>budding</b> nor interact with CDC 24, which encodes a likely Bud 1 p effector. A version <b>of</b> <b>Bud</b> 1 p deleted for the 81 amino-acid unique region is essentially wild-type. Immunofluorescence and cell fractionation indicate that Bud 1 p remains associated with the membrane throughout its GTPase cycle. Both potential effectors <b>of</b> <b>Bud</b> 1 p, Bem 1 p and Cdc 24 p, are also membrane associated even in the absence <b>of</b> <b>Bud</b> 1 p, suggesting that Bud 1 p is not required to dock these proteins from the cytosol but may couple these proteins and others within the plane of the plasma membrane.

40|$|Summary We tested three {{theories}} {{predicting the}} timing <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> in mature birch (Betula pendula Roth) trees utilizing a 60 -year phenological time series together with meteorological temperature observations. Predictions {{of the timing}} <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> based on light conditions in addition to temperature were more accurate than predictions based on dormancy development and temperature (prediction standard error of 2. 4 days versus 4. 3 days). The signal from light conditions, represented by fixed calendar date, determined the start <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> ontogenesis rather than dormancy release. We suggest that models developed to predict the timing <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> be utilized {{in the analysis of}} plant responses to climate change and of climate change itself...|$|R
40|$|Main {{conclusion}} Epigenetic memory {{affects the}} timing <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> phenology and the expression <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> burstrelated genes in genetically identical Norway spruce epitypes {{in a manner}} usually associated with ecotypes. In Norway spruce, a temperature-dependent epigenetic memory established during embryogenesis affects the timing <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst</b> and bud set in a reproducible and predictable manner. We hypothesize that the clinal variation in these phenological traits, which is associated with adaptation to growth under frost-free conditions, has an epigenetic component. In Norway spruce, dehydrins (DHNs) {{have been associated with}} extreme frost tolerance. DHN transcript levels decrease gradually prior to flushing, a time when trees are highly sensitive to frost. Furthermore, EARLY BUD BREAK 1 genes (EBB 1) and the FT-TFL 1 - LIKE 2 -gene (PaFTL 2) were previously suggested to be implied in control <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> phenology. Here we report an analysis of transcript levels of 12 DHNs, 3 EBB 1 genes and FTL 2 in epitypes of the same genotype generated at different epitype-inducing temperatures, before and during spring <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Earlier flushing <b>of</b> epitypes originating from embryos developed at 18 C as compared to 28 C, was associated with differential expression of these genes between epitypes and between buds and last year’s needles. The majority of these genes showed significantly different expressions between epitypes in at least one time point. The general trend in DHN expression pattern in buds showed the expected reduction in transcript levels when approaching flushing, whereas, surprisingly, transcript levels peaked later in needles, mainly at the moment <b>of</b> <b>bud</b> <b>burst.</b> Collectively, our results demonstrate that the epigenetic memory of temperature during embryogenesis affects bud burst phenology and expression <b>of</b> the <b>bud</b> burst-related DHN, EBB 1 and FTL 2 genes in genetically identical Norway spruce epitypes...|$|R

40|$|Microtubers were {{obtained}} from potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultured in vitro, they were used in following experiments. The impact of growth regulators (FLD, AgNO 3, BA, ABA) was monitored in length of dormancy. The content of ABA in the budding tubers {{and the content of}} endogenous CK (BA, IP, DHZ, DHZR, Z) was determined during the dormancy as well. Production of ACC, ethylene, O 2, CO 2 and ethane was determined by gas chromatography. Variants containing FLD, AgNO 3 and BA had a significant impact in the shortening of dormancy and stimulation the growth <b>of</b> <b>buds</b> microtubers. When they were used the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>budding</b> tubers was increased by 30 - 40 % over the control. Variant of ABA inhibited the growth <b>of</b> <b>buds.</b> ABA content correlated with the process of dormancy and the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>budding</b> tubers. The highest content of ABA was in variant with freshly collected dormant tubers. Concentration of various CK was dependent on the type of CK and monitored variant. Generally, It was slightly increased with occurrence <b>of</b> <b>budding</b> tubers...|$|R
