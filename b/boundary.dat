5|$|Laminar <b>boundary</b> layers can be loosely {{classified}} {{according to}} their structure and {{the circumstances under which}} they are created. The thin shear layer which develops on an oscillating body {{is an example of a}} Stokes <b>boundary</b> layer, while the Blasius <b>boundary</b> layer refers to the well-known similarity solution near an attached flat plate held in an oncoming unidirectional flow and Falkner–Skan <b>boundary</b> layer, a generalization of Blasius profile. When a fluid rotates and viscous forces are balanced by the Coriolis effect (rather than convective inertia), an Ekman layer forms. In the theory of heat transfer, a thermal <b>boundary</b> layer occurs. A surface can have multiple types of <b>boundary</b> layer simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|The {{occurrence}} of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg <b>boundary</b> {{has been studied}} since the 1930s. Research spurred {{by the possibility of}} an impact event at the K–Pg <b>boundary</b> resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the <b>boundary,</b> however, there is debate ongoing between groups that think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the K–Pg <b>boundary,</b> and those who think the evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the <b>boundary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg <b>boundary</b> into the Paleocene. Further {{analysis}} of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow tropical waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the photic zone) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg <b>boundary.</b> Colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–Pg <b>boundary,</b> however, the use of data from coral fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent Paleocene recovery, must be weighed against the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the K–Pg <b>boundary.</b>|$|E

5|$|At high Reynolds numbers, {{typical of}} {{full-sized}} aircraft, {{it is desirable}} to have a laminar <b>boundary</b> layer. This results in a lower skin friction due to the characteristic velocity profile of laminar flow. However, the <b>boundary</b> layer inevitably thickens and becomes less stable as the flow develops along the body, and eventually becomes turbulent, the process known as <b>boundary</b> layer transition. One {{way of dealing with}} this problem is to suck the <b>boundary</b> layer away through a porous surface (see <b>Boundary</b> layer suction). This can reduce drag, but is usually impractical due to its mechanical complexity and the power required to move the air and dispose of it. Natural laminar flow techniques push the <b>boundary</b> layer transition aft by reshaping the aerofoil or fuselage so that its thickest point is more aft and less thick. This reduces the velocities in the leading part and the same Reynolds number is achieved with a greater length.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–Pg <b>boundary,</b> despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–Pg <b>boundary,</b> including Chiroptera (bats) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even-toed ungulates), although recent research concludes that only marsupial orders diversified after the K–Pg <b>boundary.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Investigations {{of silicon}} layers grown on carbon foil {{were carried out}} using the Electron Beam Induced Current (EBIC) methods. The most of grain <b>boundaries</b> in these ribbons are (111) twin <b>boundaries</b> {{elongated}} along the direction. The EBIC measurements showed that the recombination contrast of dislocations and of the most part of twin <b>boundaries</b> at room temperature is practically absent and only random grain <b>boundaries</b> and very small part of twin <b>boundaries</b> produce a noticeable contrast. At lower temperatures a number of electrically active twin <b>boundaries</b> increases but the most part of them remains inactive. A contamination with iron increases the recombination activity of random <b>boundaries</b> but not the activity of twin <b>boundaries...</b>|$|R

5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the <b>boundary,</b> and using them to directly simulate {{the motion of the}} <b>boundary,</b> rather than simulating the underlying fluid and treating the <b>boundary</b> as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a <b>boundary</b> or shock.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rich dinosaur fossils, {{there are also}} plant fossils that illustrate the reduction in plant species across the K–Pg <b>boundary.</b> In the sediments below the K–Pg <b>boundary</b> the dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains, but the <b>boundary</b> layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the <b>boundary</b> layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.|$|E

40|$|Introduction {{to special}} issue on Victorian <b>boundaries.</b> Reproduced with {{permission}} of the publisher. Â© 2004 Cambridge University Press. WHEN ANGELIQUE RICHARDSON AND I began collecting the essays included here, we were interested to see how recent theorists of <b>boundaries</b> like Audre Lorde (hyphenated identities), Gloria Anzaldua (borderlands), Donna Haraway (cyborg), J-F Lyotard (the in-between), or Jacques Derrida (deconstruction) fared in relation to classic theorists of <b>boundaries</b> like Aristotle, Hegel, Marx, and Darwin. We found that while the field of Victorian Studies has absorbed the theory, current practitioners may refer little to past or present theoretical masters. Rather they describe which <b>boundaries</b> were salient to the Victorians and why; when they were permeable and how; and who enforced them and to what ends. The essays in this volume focus on specific <b>boundaries</b> and amass a wealth of detailed knowledge about them. They include the <b>boundaries</b> or boundlessness of London and her suburbs (Parrinder, Cunningham); transnational or deterritorialized <b>boundaries</b> of empire (Spear and Meduri); psychological <b>boundaries</b> (Rylance, Trotter); <b>boundaries</b> between body and soul (Moran) and living and dead (Robson); generic <b>boundaries</b> (Barzilai, Howsam, Small, Toker); <b>boundaries</b> of popular representation between art and politics (Ledger, Livesey); and <b>boundaries</b> between humans, animals, and machines (Joseph and Sussman). The essays here interrogate <b>boundaries</b> historically and pragmatically, with a high tolerance of the in-between or queer, to which I shall return below...|$|R

40|$|Perception of {{political}} <b>boundaries</b> {{and their role}} in the division of geographical space: the Irish-British and Bohemian-German <b>boundaries</b> between 1750 and 1850 Abstract This thesis aims to assess changing perceptions {{of political}} <b>boundaries</b> and space as represented in German travel literature about Bohemia and British travelogues about Ireland between 1750 and 1850. Both countries had multi-ethnic and multicultural features, historically defined <b>boundaries</b> and were parts of more extensive political units. The perception of political belonging is examined especially in the context of integration tendencies coming from the state cores. The thesis also examines the importance of alternative types of <b>boundaries,</b> e. g. geographical <b>boundaries</b> (sea and mountains that were often described as "natural boundaries") and cultural <b>boundaries.</b> It is presumed that confessional, linguistic and ethnic <b>boundaries,</b> as well as <b>boundaries</b> between different types of landscape (mountains or lowland) and between poor and prosperous regions, will be of importance in Bohemia and Ireland.
