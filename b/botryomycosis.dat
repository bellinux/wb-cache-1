Only about 90 cases {{have been reported in}} world literature till date: 75 % of them are cases of cutaneous <b>botryomycosis.</b> Of the 18 reported cases of primary pulmonary <b>botryomycosis,</b> only one had histologically proven <b>botryomycosis</b> in a lung cavity. We report here a case of primary pulmonary <b>botryomycosis</b> occurring in a lung cavity, which is {{to the best of our}} knowledge first such case from India. The index case was a 62 year old female who presented to us with recurrent episodes of non-massive streaky hemoptysis with CT chest revealing ′Air Crescent′ sign with a probable fungal ball in a left upper lobe cavity. Left upper pulmonary lobectomy was done and histopathology of the cavitary tissue revealed Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon and features suggestive of <b>Botryomycosis.</b> Tissue culture from the cavitary specimen grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. <b>Botryomycosis</b> can mimic Aspergilloma radiologically as was seen in our case, but therapy is often a combination of both medical and surgical measures unlike Aspergilloma...|$|E

40|$|A case is {{presented}} of pulmonary <b>botryomycosis</b> in a 61 -year-old {{man with a}} massive right-side pulmonary infiltrate which looked like a tumor (on X-ray). Microscopic examination of a transbronchial biopsy specimen revealed chronic suppurative inflammation, which did not regress despite intensive antibiotic therapy {{for a period of}} two months. Histological analysis of specimens taken during surgery for hemoptysis revealed pulmonary <b>botryomycosis.</b> The disease was diagnosed on the basis of characteristic eosinophilic granules in which the bacteria are surrounded by protein material (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon). Pulmonary actinomycosis was excluded. The case demonstrates that pulmonary <b>botryomycosis</b> can have the appearance of a mass which resembles pulmonary carcinoma on X-ray, and may also be mistaken for pulmonary actinomycosis.

40|$|Abstract. Pertinent {{necropsy}} findings in a 5 1 / 2 -year-old Scottish Highland steer with chronic intractable pneumonia and cough {{were limited to}} the pulmonary system. The accessory lobe of the lung was collapsed, scarred, and multifocally adhered to parietal pleura. A polypoid mass almost completely obstructed the lobar bronchus and protruded into the trachea; mucopurulent exudate distended more distal bronchi. <b>Botryomycosis</b> was diagnosed when histologic examination revealed pyogranulomatous pneumonia with eosinophilic granules and ‘‘club’ ’ formation surrounding colonies of gram-positive cocci. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the lung. <b>Botryomycosis</b> is an unusual response to infection with common bacteria and is characterized by pyogranulomatous inflammation with formation of eosinophilic granules surrounding colonies of gram-positive cocci or gram-negative bacilli. Among domestic species, staphylococcal <b>botryomycosis</b> is most common as a wound infection in horses or as mastitis in cows and sows. Pulmonary <b>botryomycosis</b> is rare in horses, humans, and guinea pigs and apparently has not been reported in cattle.

40|$|Background: <b>Botryomycosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{infectious}} disease which usually affects the skin. The low virulence of the bacteria tending to form grains and the immune status of the host are important factors {{in the development of}} the disease. Methods: We report a case of cervicofacial <b>botryomycosis</b> and review the current literature. Results: A 47 -year-old male with a long history of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis presented with painful and suppurative nodules of the head and neck. A skin biopsy revealed granules consisting of Gram-positive bacterial colonies in a blossom-like assembly in the center and an eosinophilic rim in the periphery, which are pathognomonic features of <b>botryomycosis.</b> The lesions responded well to systemic antibiotics; however, they rapidly relapsed upon cessation of the treatment. Conclusions: We highlight the well-defined histologic features and recall an almost forgotten disease. We review common predisposing conditions and present evidence that atopic dermatitis might be an additional predisposing factor. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E

40|$|A {{probable}} case report of an abdominal <b>botryomycosis</b> has been hypothesized {{in a patient}} with a stable HIV infection under an effective antiretroviral therapy. Hyperpyrexia, abdominal pain and tenderness, and a thickening of small intestinal walls associated with multiple mesenteric adenopathies and a peritoneal involvement, prompted an ultrasonography-guided fine needle biopsy, and later a laparoscopy-laparotomy which excluded a neoplastic or lymphoproliferative disorders, showing only abundant fibrotic and necrotic-steatonecrotic tissue, with sparse multinuclear giant cells type Langhans. The prompt response to surgical intervention and a treatment with i. v. meropenem alone might be referred to a concurrent gram-negative infection of abdominal origin, until a late culture of an atypical Mycobacterium came to our attention over {{one month after the}} end of hospitalization.

40|$|After oral surgery, a 32 -year-old man {{developed}} a brain abscess. Actinomycosis was suspected due to history, clinical findings, response to penicillin therapy, and demonstration of"sulfur gran-ules " in the surgical specimen, but anaerobic cultures were negative for Actinomyces. Aerobic cultures yielded Streptococcus sanguis and Pseudomonas cepacia. Coccoid organisms demon-strated histologically reacted positively with periodic acid-Schiff, Gomori's methenamine silver, and Brown and Brenn stains, were Ziehl-Neelsen-negative, {{and did not}} include branching fila-ments.
