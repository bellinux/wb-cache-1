5|$|Fourteen {{isotopes}} of berkelium {{were identified}} with mass numbers 238–252. Only 249Bk {{is available in}} large quantities; it has a relatively short half-life of 330 days and emits mostly soft β-particles, which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak (1.45% with respect to β-radiation), but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. 247Bk is an alpha-emitter with a long half-life of 1,380 years, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> obtain in appreciable quantities; it is not formed upon neutron irradiation of plutonium because of the β-stability of isotopes of curium isotopes with mass number below 248.|$|E

25|$|Basophils are chiefly {{responsible}} for allergic and antigen response by releasing the chemical histamine causing the dilation of blood vessels. Because {{they are the}} rarest of the white blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study. They can be recognized by several coarse, dark violet granules, giving them a blue hue. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see {{because of the number}} of coarse granules that hide it.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Mitchell {{writes in}} Hiking the Endless Mountains: Exploring the Wilderness of Northeast Pennsylvania that Ganoga Glen has his [...] "favorite place" [...] in the park: [...] "Here the trail wraps around ledges and {{underneath}} overhanging rocks, {{right next to}} the waterfalls. The roar of the falls reverberates against their rocky confines. The state park trail map says that Seneca, Delaware, and Mohican Falls are here, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> discern which falls are which because they explode from everywhere and are continuous." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Fox {{and others}} note that while Wooden Leg's version is corroborated by the oral {{tradition}} of other Cheyenne witnesses, notably that of Kate Big Head, {{a young woman who}} witnessed the battle, there is no corroboration in {{the oral tradition}} of the Sioux. Fox concludes that [...] "quite simply, the contention is nonsense. A few troopers undoubtedly took their own lives, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> know what factors fostered the idea of wholesale suicide". Fox in his turn has been criticized for selectively using Indian oral tradition when it suits him, but discarding it as nonsense when he finds it disagreeable.|$|E

500|$|FreeBSD's kernel {{provides}} {{support for}} some essential {{tasks such as}} managing processes, communication, booting and filesystems. FreeBSD has a monolithic kernel, with modular design. Different parts of the kernel, such as drivers, are designed as modules. The user can load and unload these modules at any time. ULE is the default scheduler in FreeBSD since version 7.1, it supports SMP and SMT. The FreeBSD kernel has also a scalable event notification interface, named kqueue. It has been ported to other BSD-derivatives such as OpenBSD, NetBSD. Kernel threading was introduced in FreeBSD 5.0, using an [...] This model works well in theory, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> implement and few operating systems support it.

500|$|Kennet Allott, in {{defending}} against any possible harsh criticism of [...] "Ode to Psyche", {{argues that the}} poem [...] "is the Cinderella of Keats's great odes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> see why it should be so neglected, {{and at least two}} poets imply that the conventional treatment of the poem is shabby and undeserved". Allott then cites Bridges and Eliot as views that he sympathizes with, and he believes that the poem [...] "is neither unflawed nor the best of odes, but to me it illustrates better than any other Keats's possession of poetic power in conjunction with what was for him an unusual artistic detachment, besides being a remarkable poem in its own right. This may be another way of saying that it is the most architectural of the odes, as it is certainly the one that culminates most dramatically." ...|$|E
500|$|Swanton {{believed}} that Constantine {{was the first}} West Indian cricketer to make an impression on the British public: [...] "he... personified West Indian cricket from the first faltering entry in the Test arena in 1928 until the post-war emergence of the trinity of Worrell, Weekes and Walcott." [...] Swanton continued: [...] "There have been many all-rounders with better records... <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> think of one who made a more sensational impact [...] impossible to imagine his superior as a fielder anywhere." [...] In 1934 Neville Cardus described Constantine as a [...] "genius" [...] and the [...] "most original cricketer of recent years". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow called Constantine the most exciting cricketer to watch of all his contemporaries. This was partly because his style of cricket meant that he could alter {{the course of a}} match in a short space of time, although he developed his technique to minimise risk.|$|E

Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> accept {{the possibility that the}} real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even if you think you know what the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that it could well turn out that your expectations are wrong." ...|$|E

Lumière himself said that Méliès was the [...] "creator of the cinematic spectacle." [...] However, the enormous amount of praise that he was receiving did not help his livelihood or decrease his poverty. In a letter written to French filmmaker Eugène Lauste, Méliès wrote that [...] "luckily enough, I am strong and in good health. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> work 14 hours a day without getting my Sundays or holidays, in an icebox in winter and a furnace in summer." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{need for}} a {{complete}} method of determining what lesser offenses are included within a charged offense is particularly great where, as here, the statute at issue is {{one that can be}} violated in a number of ways," [...] Flaum wrote. [...] "Indeed, the past several years have seen the enactment of a number of criminal statutes that can be violated in various ways, and that in fact are specifically predicated on violations of any number of other legal provisions" [...] such as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). [...] "They are exactly the type of offenses for which consideration of lesser offenses is appropriate under Rule 31(c), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> imagine how any lesser included offense could ever be considered under the elements test, precisely because these 'greater' offenses are so broadly defined."
