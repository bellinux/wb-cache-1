Thus, the IUCN rates the bohor reedbuck as of Least Concern. Around three-fourth of the populations survive in protected areas. Populations of the reedbuck are either declining or uncertain in <b>Boucle</b> du Baoulé National Park (Mali); Comoé National Park (Ivory Coast); Mole and Digya National Parks (Ghana). Numbers in the Akagera National Park, where its last-known populations in Rwanda exist, have seen a steep fall.|$|E

2500|$|A single {{spun yarn}} may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another. [...] In plying, {{two or more}} yarns are spun together, almost always in the {{opposite}} sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist. [...] The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. [...] Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. [...] Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in <b>bouclé.</b> [...] The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.|$|E
