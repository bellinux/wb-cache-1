5|$|In 1962–1966, {{there were}} {{attempts}} in the United States to produce transplutonium isotopes using {{a series of}} six underground nuclear explosions. Small samples of rock were extracted from the <b>blast</b> <b>area</b> immediately after the test to study the explosion products, but no isotopes with mass number greater than 257 could be detected, despite predictions that such isotopes would have relatively long half-lives of α-decay. This inobservation was attributed to spontaneous fission owing to the large speed of the products and to other decay channels, such as neutron emission and nuclear fission.|$|E

25|$|In {{respect to}} the other {{non-lethal}} weapon effects from an IND detonated {{on or near the}} surface, the detonation's blast wave would likely produce a momentary electric grid blackout due to the loss of a large portion of a city's electrical equipment drawing power/electrical load, while the electromagnetic pulse(EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the <b>blast</b> <b>area,</b> so cell phone towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications. Although if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane are anything to go by, and the cell phone network towers survive, the service would be overloaded(a Mass call event) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service. However, as Civil defense(CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality, they contained amongst other things, at least one CDV-715 radiation survey meter and a CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help and if communications continued, inform them of the outside situation as it developed.|$|E

2500|$|Brimstone is an air-launched {{ground attack}} missile {{developed}} by MBDA for Britain's Royal Air Force. It was originally intended for [...] "fire-and-forget" [...] use against mass formations of enemy armour, using a millimetric wave (mmW) active radar homing seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets.

The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM-65G Maverick, while the small <b>blast</b> <b>area</b> minimises collateral damage.

50|$|Remote control mining {{equipment}} usually refers to mining vehicles such as excavators or bulldozers that are controlled with a handheld remote control.

Thus, the effect of blasting vibration on lighthouse should be studied. On the basis of the dimensional analysis, we deduced a revised formula for water depth based on Sodev’s empirical formula and established the linear fitting model. During the underwater reef project in the main channel of Shipu Harbor in the Ningbo–Zhoushan Port, the blasting vibration data of the lighthouse near the underwater <b>blasting</b> <b>area</b> were monitored. The undetermined coefficient, resolvable coefficient, and F value of the two formulas were then obtained.

40|$|Blasting is an inseparable part of {{the rock}} {{fragmentation}} process in hard rock mining. As an adverse and undesirable effect of <b>blasting</b> on surrounding <b>areas,</b> airblast-overpressure (AOp) is constantly considered by blast designers. AOp may impact the human and structures in adjacent to <b>blasting</b> <b>area.</b> Consequently, many {{attempts have been made}} to establish empirical correlations to predict and subsequently control the AOp. However, current correlations only investigate a few influential parameters, whereas there are many parameters in producing AOp. As a powerful function approximations, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be utilized to simulate AOp. This paper presents a new approach based on hybrid ANN and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to predict AOp in quarry blasting. For this purpose, AOp and influential parameters were recorded from 62 blast operations in four granite quarry sites in Malaysia. Several models were trained and tested using collected data to determine the optimum model in which each model involved nine inputs, including the most influential parameters on AOp. In addition, two series of site factors were obtained using the power regression analyses. Findings show that presented PSO-based ANN model performs well in predicting the AOp. Hence, to compare the prediction performance of the PSO-based ANN model, the AOp was predicted using the current and proposed formulas. The training correlation coefficient equals to 0. 94 suggests that the PSO-based ANN model outperforms the other predictive models...|$|R
