Study of the {{efficacy}} of methanogenesis inhibitors in the rumen has given inconsistent results, mainly due to poorly understood effects on the key microbial groups involved in pathways for methane (CH 4) synthesis. The experiment described in this report was designed to assess the effect of propyl propane thiosulfinate (PTS), diallyl disulfide (DDS) and <b>bromochloromethane</b> (BCM) on rumen fermentation, methane production and microbial populations in continuous culture fermenters. No effects on total volatile fatty acids (VFA) were observed with PTS or DDS, but VFA were decreased with BCM. Amylase activity increased with BCM {{as compared with the}} other treatments. A decrease in methane production was observed with PTS (48 %) and BCM (94 %) as compared with control values. The concentration of methanogenic archaea decreased with BCM from day 4 onward and with PTS on days 4 and 8. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that PTS and BCM decreased the relative abundance of Methanomicrobiales and increased that of Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera. The total concentration of bacteria was not modified by any treatment, although treatment with BCM increased the relative abundance of Prevotella and decreased that of Ruminococcus. These results suggest that the inhibition of methane production in the rumen by PTS and BCM is associated with a shift in archaeal biodiversity and changes in the bacterial community with BCM. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

Methane emissions were recorded and ruminal samples collected from kids at 2 mo of age (weaning, W), and 1 (W+ 1) and 4 (W+ 4) mo after. At W+ 1 mo, CH 4 emissions by k+ kids were 52 % and 59 % lower than untreated kids (in D+ and D- groups, respectively).

Eighteen goats were allocated to 2 experimental groups of 9 animals each: treated (BCM+) or not (BCM?) with 0. 30 g of BCM/ 100 kg of body weight per day. The BCM was administered per os in 2 equal doses per day from parturition to 2 wk postweaning (10 wk). After weaning, methane emissions were recorded over 2 consecutive days (d 57 and 58 on treatment) in polycarbonate chambers. On d 59, individual rumen fluid samples were collected for volatile fatty acid (VFA) analysis and quantification of bacterial, protozoal, and archaeal numbers by real-time PCR. On d 69 and 70, daily milk production was recorded and samples were collected for determination of fat, protein, lactose, casein, and total solids concentration by infrared spectrophotometry, and fatty acid composition by gas chromatography. Treatment with BCM reduced methane production by 33 % (21. 6 vs. 14. 4 L/kg of DMI) compared with nontreated animals, although it did not affect the abundance of rumen bacteria, protozoa, and total methanogenic archaea. The observed improvement in the efficiency of digestive processes was accompanied by a 36 % increase in milk yield, probably due to the more propionic type of rumen fermentation and an increase in VFA production. The increase in milk yield was not accompanied by any changes in the concentrations or yields of fat, protein, or lactose. Despite the substantial decrease in methane production, only minor changes in milk fatty acid profile were observed, suggesting that ruminal biohydrogenation pathways were not affected. Compounds that influence terminal biochemical pathways for methane production deserve further development for future application in the dairy goat sector. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) {{chemical transport}} model (CTM) {{has been used}} to study the tropospheric chemistry and troposphere-stratosphere transport of biogenic very short-lived species (VSLS). Calculations have been performed in order to quantify their contribution to stratospheric bromine loading and also the relative importance of the source gas injection (SGI) and product gas injection (PGI) pathways. Simulations with a chemistry-climate model (CCM) have also been performed {{to assess the impact of}} VSLS on stratospheric ozone (03) and how their transport to the stratosphere may respond to climate change. Five brominated VSLS were considered in this work; bromoform (CHBr 3), dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2), dibromochloromethane (CHBr 2 Cl), bromodichloromethane (CHBrC 12) and <b>bromochloromethane</b> (CH 2 BrCl). The CTM shows these gases contribute ~ 5 parts per trillion (pptv) of inorganic bromine (BryvSLS) to the stratosphere, representing ~ 25 % of total stratospheric bromine in 2009. SGI accounts for between ~ 69 - 75 % of this supply, with the remainder from PG!. The longest lived organic product gas (PG) from CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 degradation is carbonyl dibromide (CBr 20). Its tropospheric lifetime with respect to photolysis is ~ 7 days. It is unlikely that organic PGs make a significant contribution to the total PGI from VSLS. The CTM performs reasonably well in reproducing tropospheric VSLS observations from a number of aircraft campaigns. In the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), CH 2 Br 2 is overestimated when vertical transport is diagnosed from the meteoro- logical analyses. An improved agreement is obtained when vertical transport is calculated using diabatic heating rates, resulting in slower transport through the TTL. CCM runs show during periods of background aerosol loading, the impact of BryvSLS on mid-latitude 03 is small. The impact is larger in polar regions, where BryvSLS enhances the BrO-ClO loss cycle, resulting in a reduction of up to ~ 15 Dobson units (DU) of the total 03 column over Antarctica. The CCM has also been used to diagnose the potential response of SGI to climate change. For 2000, the modelled SGI is ~ 1. 7 pptv, lower than the CTM estimate but still in good agreement with observations. For 2100, the CCM estimate increases to ~ 1. 9 and ~ 2. 7 pptv when the model is forced with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathways (RC Ps) 4. 5 and 8. 5, respectively. The increase is due to enhanced tropical deep convection, reducing transport time-scales in the upper troposphere, particularly over the tropical Western Pacific region.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>bromochloromethane</b> (BCM) in a batch reactor, using phase transfer catalysis, was investigated. During the synthetic procedure, sodium bromide (100. 0 g, 0. 97 mol) {{along with an}} excess amount of dichloromethane (265. 0 g, 3. 12 mol) was charged to a reactor containing benzyl triethylammonium chloride (13 mmol), dissolved in 50 ml of water. The bench scale reactions were all carried out in a Parr 4520 bench top pressure reactor coupled to a Parr 4841 temperature controller. The method produced a 50. 0 percent yield of the product BCM after a reaction time of 12 to 13 hours. The main objective for this investigation was to optimize the abovementioned reaction with respect to yield and reactor throughput. Quantitative analysis of BCM was performed on a Focus Gas Chromatograph, fitted with a flame ionization detector, and a BP 20 column (30 m × 0, 32 mm ID × 0, 25 mm). Delta software, version 5. 0, was applied for data collection and processing. The injector and detector port were set at 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was set and held at 40 °C {{for a period of}} 2 minutes, then gradually increased at a rate of 10 °C/min to 130 °C, with the final hold time set for 1 minute. An analytical method for the quantitative analysis of BCM was developed, optimized and validated. Validation of the analytical method commenced over a period of three days, and focussed the following validation parameters: Accuracy, precision, and ruggedness. Statistical evaluation of the results obtained for precision showed that the error between individual injections is less than 2 percent for each component. However, ANOVA analysis showed {{a significant difference between the}} mean response factors obtained in the three day period (p-value < 0. 05). Thus we could conclude that the response factors had to be determined on each day before quantitatively analyzing samples. The accuracy of the analytical method was assessed by using the percent recovery method. Results obtained showed that a mean percent recovery of 100. 18 percent was obtained for BCM, with the absolute bias = 0. 0004, and the percent bias = 0. 18 percent. Hence the 95 confidence intervals for the percent recovery and percent bias are given by: (Lz, Uz) = (100. 56 percent percent 102. 15 percent), 13 (LPB, UPB) = (0. 56 percent, 2. 15 percent), respectively. Since the 95 percent confidence interval for the percent recovery contains 100, or equivalently, the 95 percent confidence interval for percent bias contains 0, the assay method is considered accurate and validated for BCM. In the same manner the accuracy and percent recovery for DCM and DBM was evaluated. The method was found to be accurate and validated for DBM, however, slightly biased in determining the recovered amount of DCM. With the analytical method validated, the batch production process could be evaluated. A total of six process variables, namely reaction time, water amount, temperature, volume of the two phases, stirring rate, and catalyst concentration, were selected for the study. The effects of the individual variables were determined in the classical manner, by varying only the one of interest while keeping all others constant. The experimental data generated was fit to a quadratic response surface model. The profile plots that were obtained from this model allowed a visual representation of the effect of the six variables. The experimental results obtained showed that the reaction follows pseudo zero-order kinetics and that the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the catalyst. The reaction obeys the Arrhenius equation, and the relatively high activation energy of 87 kJ. mol - 1 signifies that the rate constant is strongly dependent on the temperature of the reaction. The results also showed that the formation of BCM is favoured by an increase in the reaction temperature, catalyst concentration, and a high organic: aqueous phase ratio. Thus the {{synthesis of}} BCM using phase transfer catalyst could be optimised, to obtain a 100 percent yield BCM, by increasing both the reaction temperature to 105 °C, and the concentration of the phase transfer catalyst -benzyl triethylammonium chloride - to 5. 36 mol percent. The reaction time was also reduced to 6 hour...|$|E
