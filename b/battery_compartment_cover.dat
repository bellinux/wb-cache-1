25|$|As {{the heavily}} damaged {{choppers}} returned to Palali airbase, {{it became clear}} that further missions might be impossible. Sqn Ldr Vinayraj's helicopter had sustained significant damage. The undercarriage had been hit, the portside <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> <b>cover</b> was missing and the whole fuselage was peppered with bullet holes. Wg Cdr Sapre’s Mi-8 returned with its hydraulic system damaged.|$|E
5000|$|Customers {{were sent}} prepaid courier {{envelopes}} and instructed to send back their Mifi units for {{replacement of the}} battery and <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> <b>cover.</b> [...] Customers were notified that Novatel would return the serviced units within 6 to 8 weeks of their return. Bell customers were provided with cellular internet access via Novatel U998 USB sticks, which were provided as temporary replacements by Bell.|$|E
50|$|The camera {{handles and}} {{performs}} well, but {{suffers from a}} very loud shutter/mirror operation. The battery control can be cheated: with a lithium battery, the battery control lamp can indicate 'OK', but not have enough energy to release the shutter. The camera has a sturdy feel, except for the very flimsy <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> <b>cover.</b> Without a winder attached, large amounts of dust can (and will!) enter the camera through the winder socket.|$|E
50|$|Both the facelifted Magna and Verada {{benefited from}} a number of safety upgrades, as proven by the fact that all models met the then latest offset {{deformable}} barrier (ODB) and dynamic side impact requirements. In addition, front driver and passenger airbags became standard along with side airbags contained in the front seat bolsters. While the wheelbase of the new series had not changed, rear legroom was claimed to have been increased by reshaping the rear cushion of the front seats, the rear seat and by re-arranging the rear seat hip points and squabs. Other interior revisions included rear air vents {{for the first time on}} Magna as well as electric driver's seat height adjustment. For the first time, a factory-fitted GPS system was also offered as an option whereas most cars gained a rotary climate control panel, without the previous digital display. Systematic cost-cutting measures included the relocation of the front power window controls on the lesser Magna models from the door panels to the centre console, plus the removal of the individual <b>battery</b> <b>cover</b> <b>compartment</b> in the engine bay.|$|R

50|$|In May 2010, the Mifi 2372 was {{recalled}} in Canada by Bell Mobility and Rogers Communications. In two documented cases, difficulty {{of opening the}} MiFi <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> had caused customers to use levels of force that caused physical damage to the batteries, which subsequently overheated. Novatel replaced the recalled units with a type that featured an easier-to-open <b>battery</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|R

50|$|The AN/PVS-4 uses a 25mm screw-type variable-gain Image Intensifier tube. Operational voltage is 3.0 Volts. Early {{production}} models feature two circular <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> {{located on the}} main housing. These <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> are designed to accommodate one 3.0V BA-5567/U, or two 1.5V BA-3058/U simultaneously. Later designations such as the AN/PVS-4A use two common AA batteries (BA-3058/U) via a purpose-built adapter (PN A3009873) that attaches {{to one of the}} circular <b>battery</b> <b>compartments.</b> Use of the adapter negates the need for BA-5567/U and BA-3058/U. AN/PVS-4s still in use today are typically upgraded with the AA battery adapter even if they have not been upgraded to a third generation tube. Some AN/PVS-4A models made after 1984 feature an integral AA battery housing that does not require the use of an external AA battery adapter.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to having specification differences, the Trophy and 7 Trophy have slight design differences as well. The 7 Trophy features a bright yellow <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> (typical of HTC Windows Mobile devices in the past), whereas the Trophy has a bright red <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> (to acknowledge the phone's Verizon ties). Press images of the Verizon device also appear to show a small circular cutout beneath the battery door, and above the Windows Phone logo. This circle is an external antenna port cover.|$|R

50|$|The Rio PMP300 {{suffers from}} a few notable design flaws. The <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> door flap is notorious for breaking. The battery cover is {{difficult}} to repair due to the stress caused by the spring-loaded <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> and the fragile plastic used for the door clips. The metal hinge used to hold the compartment {{to the base of}} the unit would also put strain on the plastic casing, causing cracks around the SmartMedia slot. Furthermore, the silver coating applied to the main central control button in the original 32 MB unit would often peel and flake off with use. The control disc would commonly fall off.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after noon}} on 12 June 1943, R-12, while {{underway}} {{to conduct a}} torpedo practice approach, sounded her last diving alarm. As she completed preparations to dive, the forward <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> began to flood. The collision alarm was sounded and a report was made that the forward <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> was flooding. Orders were given to blow main ballast, but the sea was faster. In about 15 seconds, R-12 was lost. The commanding officer, one other officer, and three enlisted men were swept from the bridge as the boat sank and were rescued. Forty-two lives were lost. R-12 was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 July.|$|R
