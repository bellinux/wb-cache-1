40|$|A {{series of}} acyclic {{nucleoside}} analogues of 5 '-O-tritylthymidine have been synthesized and evaluated as potential human mitochondrial thymidine kinase (TK- 2) inhibitors. In this series, the sugar moiety {{of the parent}} 5 '-O-tritylthymidine {{has been replaced by}} aliphatic chains including (E) - and (Z) -butenol, <b>butynol,</b> or butanol. Among them the (Z) -butenyl derivative (10) showed an IC(50) against TK- 2 of 1. 5 microM, being 1 order of magnitude more potent than the parent 5 '-O-tritylthymidine. This lead compound has been further modified by replacing the thymine base by other pyrimidine bases such as 5 -iodouracil, 5 -ethyluracil, 5 -methylcytosine, 3 -N-methylthymine, or 5, 6 -dihydrothymine, {{as well as by the}} purine base guanine. The trityl group has also been replaced by different aliphatic and aromatic acyl moieties including tert-butylacetyl, hexanoyl, decanoyl, and diphenylacetyl moieties. The evaluation of the compounds against TK- 2 and the phylogenetically close HSV- 1 TK has shown that the base moiety plays a crucial role in their interaction against these pyrimidine nucleoside kinases. Also, the presence of a lipophilic substituent, preferentially an aromatic moiety such as diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl, is required for efficient TK- 2 inhibition. Whereas some compounds showed marked specificity for either TK- 2 (i. e, the 5, 6 -dihydrothymine derivative, 26) or HSV- 1 TK (i. e., the butynyl derivative, 11), some others, including the (Z) -and (E) -butenyl derivatives 10 and 12, showed significant inhibition against both enzymes. They also proved to be inhibitory against HSV- 1 TK in intact human osteosarcoma cells that were transduced with the HSV- 1 TK gene. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} synthetic efforts towards two {{natural products}} matrine and pinnaic acid. The strategy towards matrine focused on effecting an overall, {{but not necessarily}} concerted [4 + 2] cycloaddition in which a 1, 4 -dihydropyridine supplies the dienophile and aN-vinyl pyrldone is activated to act as the diene component. Attempts to progress an expedient route to pinnaic acid that starts with a chiral pyrrolidine cata lysed conjugate addit ion between propionaldehyde and I - nitrocyclopentene is discussed. Chapter 1 is an introduction to previous syntheses of matrine and introduces background literature examples of azadienes or dihydropyridines being used in [4 + 2] cycloadditions, as well as methods for constructing enamides required for the target. Chapter 2 describes our progress towards the synthesis of matrine. Significant contributions {{include the use of}} organotrifluoroborates as air and moisturestable alternatives to boronic acids in the synthesis of N-vinyl pyridones. Zincke reaction and subsequent dithionite reduction gave a high-yield ing route to install the l, 4 -dihydropyridines required for the target precursors. Several studies to initiate intramolecular bond formation between these functional groups are reported. Chapter 3 provides an introduction to previous syntheses of pinnaic acid. Examples of transformations required for our proposed route are introduced including organocatalysed 1, 4 -addit ions of carbon nucieophiles to nitroolefins, an important stereochemistry generating step, and the vinylogous aldol reaction, which are both important components of the planned route. Chapter 4 highlights progress towards the synthesis of pinnaic acid. Significant contributions include the improvement of the diastereoselectivity of our key conjugate addition step via reduction of the in situ generated aldehyde. A panel of organocatalysts was screened for this conjugate addition step, with chiral HPLC studies confirming modest gains in e. e. when trans- 4 -hydroxy- L-proline was employed. This route was used to gain step-efficient access to an intermediate in Heathcock's synthesis of pinnaic acid. Further studies toward a step efficient route to pinnaic acid are described including a Friedel-Crafts acylation between a protected <b>butynol</b> species and chloroacetyl chloride that was demonstrated on a large scale, albeit with a slight preference for the undesired (E) -isomer. Conversion of this material to phosphonate and sulphone species, as well as its use in a model Wittig reaction, was also demonstrated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{controlled}} gold-catalyzed {{preparation of}} 3 -iodo 2, 4, 6 -trisubstituted 9 H-carbazoles {{has been developed}} by starting from (3 -iodoindol- 2 -yl) <b>butynols.</b> These results could be explained through an initial 6 -endo-dig alkyne carbocyclization by chemo- and regiospecific attack of the C 3 -indole position at the external alkyne carbon followed by a stepwise 1, 3 -iodine transfer and dehydration. This reaction outcome for the gold-catalyzed transformation of (3 -iodoindol- 2 -yl) alkynols sharply contrasts with that observed for conventional metal-catalyzed processes of iodoarenes, because iodine transfer is feasible. This selective reaction has been studied experimentally; additionally, its mechanism has been investigated by means of density functional theory calculations. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
