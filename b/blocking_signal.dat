50|$|A {{home signal}} (場内信号機, jōnai shingōki) permits trains {{to enter the}} station. A home signal is {{absolute}} (絶対信号機, zettai shingōki); therefore, non-blocking operation is always prohibited. Some stations have multiple home signals, due to station layout. In these cases, each home signal has an identification number which is counted from {{the outside of the}} station. In high-traffic areas, some operators install home signals {{in the center of a}} platform track to divide the block section. Some operators treat such <b>signals</b> as <b>block</b> <b>signals.</b> In non-interlocking stations, there may be a No.0 <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> (in some operations, a No.1 <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> or home-signal equivalent <b>block</b> <b>signal)</b> which alternates with the home signal.|$|R

50|$|FKBP12 {{is notable}} in humans for binding the {{immunosuppressant}} molecule tacrolimus (originally designated FK506), {{which is used}} in treating patients after organ transplant and patients suffering from autoimmune disorders. Tacrolimus {{has been found to}} reduce episodes of organ rejection over a related treatment, the drug ciclosporin, which binds cyclophilin. Both the FKBP-tacrolimus complex and the ciclosporin-cyclophilin complex inhibit a phosphatase called calcineurin, thus <b>blocking</b> <b>signal</b> transduction in the T-lymphocyte transduction pathway. This therapeutic role is not related to prolyl isomerase activity.|$|E

50|$|The {{detector}} {{was provided}} with a cathode feedback level well into the oscillation range by the 330 pF capacitor. The received carrier blocked the oscillations, allowing strong local stations to be received clearly. In addition, the loop antenna {{was part of the}} resonant tuning circuit, resulting in near-unity coupling between the antenna and the detector, which helped provide a high enough level of carrier for the blocking function. A regenerative detector operated in this mode is sometimes called a superregenerative detector, but in this circuit there was no separate quenching oscillator. The <b>blocking</b> <b>signal</b> was ideally at the same frequency as the oscillation, as opposed to the usually lower frequency employed in a true supperregenerative detector.|$|E
5000|$|The macroscope's {{clear view}} across space {{also makes it}} an ideal {{communications}} system for intelligent races, who broadcast signals by generating macrons, a technique not yet understood on Earth. However, over-riding all of these signals is another of enormous power, one of such strength {{that it must have}} been constructed by a Type II civilization. This signal repeats itself, starting with instructions on basic math and progressing to ever-more complex information. Viewers with high enough intelligence, an IQ of 150, reach a point where the information causes them to go insane or die. Those without the intelligence to understand the advanced portions of the signal are unaffected. The signal appears to be a deliberate attempt to [...] "jam" [...] macroscopic communications, blocking those with the ability to understand the other signals from being able to see them. They refer to the <b>blocking</b> <b>signal</b> simply as the [...] "destroyer".|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Proximity-based direct {{communication}} is {{the technology that}} devices in the near distance can use the radio resource efficiently by operating distributedly without control of BS or AP. Many technologies are proposed for proximity-based {{direct communication}} and taking the operation in unlicensed band into account. Thus, coexistence techniques are needed for coexistence with different kind of devices which operate in unlicensed band such as Wireless LAN. A <b>blocking</b> <b>signal</b> transmission scheme to avoid contention with other devices by transmitting narrow band signal is proposed {{as one of the}} coexistence schemes for coexistence with different kind of devices. In this work, we present analysis of the effect of narrow band interference such as <b>blocking</b> <b>signal</b> caused by CFO on OFDM system for proximity-based direct communication and validate the theoretical results by means of computer simulation...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} identifying {{the support of the}} <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> in a sequence when both the length and the location of the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> are unknown. The multivariate version of this problem is also considered, in which we try to identify the support of the rectangular signal in the hyper- rectangle. We allow the length of the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> to grow polynomially with the length of the sequence, which greatly generalizes the previous results in [16]. A statistical boundary above which the identification is possible is presented and an asymptotically optimal and computationally efficient procedure is proposed under Gaussian white noise in both the univariate and multivariate settings. The problem of <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> identification is shown to have the same statistical difficulty as the corresponding problem of detection in both the univariate and multivariate cases, in the sense that whenever we can detect the signal, we can identify the support of the signal. Some generalizations are also considered here: (1) We ex- tend our theory to the case of multiple <b>block</b> <b>signals.</b> (2) We also discuss about the robust identification problem when the noise distribution is un- specified and the <b>block</b> <b>signal</b> identification problem under the exponential family setting...|$|R

30|$|In QΣΔMs, the {{modulator}} feedback branch mismatches {{have been}} considered most crucial [23, 26, 28]. Exactly this problem can be fought against with mirror-frequency-rejecting STF design in a single-stage QΣΔM [19] or {{in the first stage}} of multistage QΣΔM [21]. The signal fed to the feedback branch of the modulator is the same as in the output, so the STF and NTF effects are seen therein in full extent.
