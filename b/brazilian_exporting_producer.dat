To achieve the proposed goal it was used the Internationalization of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Export</b> <b>Producer</b> Companies Model, built by Kraus (2006) and the Model of Technological Capabilities in Companies of Emerging Economies, built by Figueiredo (2004). The study found that different stages of internationalization require different functions and different levels of technology. The discussion proposed by this paper found a close association between the process of internationalization and the development of technological capability in the company studied. It can be concluded that for companies of Soluble Coffee to conquer, reach and remain competitive in international markets it should engage efforts to build diverse organizational skills, alliances and technological capabilities...|$|R

This article shows that <b>Brazilian</b> manufactured <b>exports</b> too have been negatively affected, and {{that this has been}} reflected in the “primarization” of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> and a declining share in the import markets of its major customers. A variety of different indicators were used to analyse the extent to which <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> have faced competition from China. Constant Market Share analysis was then applied to estimate the quantitative significance of Chinese competition for <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports.</b> This shows that Brazil has lost markets to China in the USA, in the EU and in its major Latin American markets, particularly since 2004. This has occurred not only in low-technology products but also increasingly in high-technology products, and Brazil {{has not been able to}} compensate for losses to China through increasing exports of more sophisticated products.

This paper aims to analyze the evolution of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> to the Eastern Asian countries, focusing on 1980 to 2008 time period and discussing the facts that motivate or halt the trade among Brazil and Eastern Asian countries and how important is this trade for the Brazilian development. Applying both statistics and econometric methodology on secondary data, the following findings arose: (a) China bought only 1. 19 % of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> in 2008 and Japan bought 0. 8 %, however, Japan and China have become important buyers of some specific Brazilian commodities, affecting some region development; (b) China has became the biggest Eastern Asian buyer of Brazilian products, answering for half of the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> to that region in 2008; (c) the Japanese share on Brazil's exports to Eastern Asia countries dropped from 47 % in 1990 to 17 % in 2008; (d) no trade policy has been established for Brazil to stimulate its trade with Eastern Asian countries; (e) more than half of Brazil's exports to Japan and China are compounded by ore, steel and agro-food products, with the first two standing out in <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> to Japan and the third one dominating the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> to China; (f) econometric equations run to supply and demand curves of <b>Brazilian</b> products <b>exported</b> to Japan and China show regional differences among these two buyers and the results help to discuss policies that can improve trade and development between Brazil and its two major partners on Eastern Asia...|$|R

40|$|Non-tariff {{barriers}} (NTBs) affect particularly {{developing countries}} {{because of their}} market dependence on developed countries and their minor influence over the international trade forums. NTBs have an increasing importance in world trade of fishery products due {{to the rise of}} the international transactions of these products. World exports of fishery products doubled between 1998 and 2008, from US $ 51. 5 billion to US$ 101. 9 billion. This article aims to analyze the impact of NTBs implemented by EU on the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> of fishery products. The methodology used was based on the inventory approach integrated to the ARIMA model. The data used refer to technical barriers obtained from the TRAINS/UNCTAD database and to the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> collected on the ALICEWEB database.

We can suppose that NTBs imposed by Europe still do not have relevant effects on <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports.</b> Even for fresh fish, {{it is not possible to}} state accurately that the reduction in volume was caused by the introduction of the NTB because other factors can be involved. However, the rapid increase in the number of NTBs to seafood imports in the European market represents a potential risk to the growth of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports.</b> Moreover, given that much of the Brazilian aquaculture is being developed within complex ecosystems like the Amazon, there is a possibility of emerging new NTBs related to environmental constraints.

40|$|We take {{advantage}} of a novel dataset that incorporates both the technological content of each product as well as its quality to unveil some new features of Brazil-ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trade flows and to challenge the view that the emergence of China would imply the deindustrialization of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports.</b> The trade between the two countries builds on exports of commodity goods from Brazil to China and of manufactured products from China to Brazil. Looking at the technological dimension of the dataset we show that Brazil (increasingly) exports to China products with lower technological content and (increasingly) imports products with higher technological content. The quality dimension of the dataset reveals that both countries export to each other basically low-quality goods (i. e. products whose unitvalue are in the lower range of worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distribution of unit-values for the product). We then show that the overlapping between Brazilian and Chinese total exports is limited and that the degree of competition between the two countries is relatively small. We also show that the number of products in which the two countries have comparative advantage declined in the last years and that in the last years both countries increased their advantage in the products in which they already had advantage in 1994 and lost advantage in the sectors in which they had small advantage in producing in 1994. Available data analyzed in this paper evidences that in the last years <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> of commodity products increased significantly due to the emergence of China and other Asian countries. We show, however, that <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> of high technological content and high quality increased more than the average and more than low technological and low quality exports in the last years. Overall, the emergence of China has been supporting a displacement of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> not only towards naturalbased products but also to goods with higher quality and higher technological content. ...|$|R

We calculate indexes of revealed comparative advantages (RCA) and regional orientation (RO), for the period from 1991 to 2001. We selected the following products: soybeans, orange juice, tobacco, chicken meat, bovine meat, sugar and coffee. Altogether, these products corresponded to more than 20 % of total <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> in that period. The products that show the highest Brazilian participation in world trade are soybeans, orange juice and coffee.

The results indicate comparative advantages for the Brazilian products, showing stable or increasing indexes along the decade. Besides, there is a high orientation of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> to the EU, except for chicken meat and sugar, but with no increases in the period.

Between 1999 and 2004, its exports to China have grown by 800 percent in value terms while the value of its imports from China has more than tripled. China is now Brazil’s third most important export destination and its fourth most important import source. While the Brazilian government actively pursues closer trade and investment links with China, critics fear that potential resulting shifts in specialization patterns towards low-value-added activities with low human capital and technology intensity may adversely affect Brazil’s long-run growth prospects, given that <b>Brazilian</b> <b>exports</b> to China consist primarily of primary commodities, while imports from China increasingly compete with domestic manufacturing output in home and third-country markets.
