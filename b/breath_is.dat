5|$|The {{ability to}} dive and swim {{underwater}} while holding one's <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> considered a useful emergency skill, {{an important part}} of water sport and Navy safety training, and an enjoyable leisure activity. Underwater diving without breathing apparatus can be categorised as underwater swimming, snorkelling and freediving. These categories overlap considerably. Several competitive underwater sports are practised without breathing apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E
5|$|Rigveda, however, {{does not}} {{describe}} yoga {{and there is}} little evidence as to what the practices were. Early references to practices that later became part of yoga, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Hindu Upanishad. For example, the practice of pranayama (consciously regulating <b>breath)</b> <b>is</b> mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (concentrating all of one's senses on self) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE).|$|E

5|$|In Serbia, men {{believed}} to possess properties of an ala were called aloviti (ala-like) men, {{and they were}} given several explanations. An ala may have sneaked into them; these were recognized by their voracity, because the ala, {{in order to satisfy}} her excessive hunger, drove them to eat incessantly. They may also have survived an ala blowing on them– an ala’s <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> usually lethal to humans. These people would then become exceptionally strong. Alternatively, they could be the offspring of an ala and a woman, or could have been born covered with the caul. It was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with a gun or arrow, unless gold or silver was used.|$|E
5|$|In Sri Lanka {{the belief}} of Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's breast and emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> 3 <b>breath</b> sequences: Continuous {{mandatory}} ventilation (CMV), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation (CSV). A <b>breath</b> sequence <b>is</b> {{a particular}} pattern of spontaneous and/or mandatory breaths. The 3 possible breath sequences are: continuous mandatory ventilation, (CMV, spontaneous <b>breaths</b> <b>are</b> not allowed between mandatory breaths), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV, spontaneous breaths may occur between mandatory breaths), and continuous spontaneous ventilation (CSV, all <b>breaths</b> <b>are</b> spontaneous).|$|R

25|$|Breaths are {{classified}} as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory <b>breath</b> <b>is,</b> by definition, assisted.|$|E
25|$|Shortness of <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> {{the primary}} reason 3.5% of people present to the {{emergency}} department in the United States. Of these individuals, approximately 51% are {{admitted to the hospital}} and 13% are dead within a year. Some studies have suggested that up to 27% of people suffer from dyspnea, while in dying patients 75% will experience it. Acute shortness of <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> the most common reason people requiring palliative care visit an emergency department.|$|E
25|$|Halitosis (bad <b>breath)</b> <b>is</b> often stated to be {{a symptom}} of chronic rhinosinusitis; however, gold {{standard}} breath analysis techniques have not been applied. Theoretically, there are several possible mechanisms of both objective and subjective halitosis that may be involved.|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{known as}} “Assist/Control”; CMV <b>is</b> a <b>breath</b> {{sequence}} for which spontaneous <b>breaths</b> <b>are</b> not possible between mandatory breaths because every patient trigger signal in the trigger window produces a machine cycled inspiration (i.e., a mandatory breath). Machine triggered mandatory <b>breaths</b> may <b>be</b> delivered at a preset rate. Therefore, {{in contrast to}} IMV, the mandatory <b>breath</b> frequency may <b>be</b> higher than the set frequency but never below it. In some pressure controlled modes on ventilators with an active exhalation valve, spontaneous breaths may occur during mandatory breaths, but the defining characteristic of CMV <b>is</b> that spontaneous <b>breaths</b> <b>are</b> not permitted between mandatory breaths.|$|R

25|$|The area {{of modern}} breath testing {{commenced}} in 1971, when Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling demonstrated that human <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> a complex gas, containing more than 200 different volatile organic compounds. However, physicians have used breath analysis {{since the days}} of Hippocrates.|$|E
25|$|In {{those who}} are not palliative the primary {{treatment}} of shortness of <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> directed at its underlying cause. Extra oxygen is effective in those with hypoxia; however, this has no effect in those with normal blood oxygen saturations, even in {{those who are}} palliative.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{distinction}} in mechanical ventilation is whether each <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> {{initiated by the}} patient (assist mode) or by the machine (control mode). Dynamic hybrids of the two (assist-control modes) are also possible, and control mode without assist is now mostly obsolete.|$|E

25|$|By the mid twentieth century, high {{pressure}} cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaled <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> vented {{directly into the}} water, and closed-circuit scuba where the carbon dioxide {{is removed from the}} diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated.|$|E
25|$|Edison's last <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> {{reportedly}} {{contained in}} a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a memento. A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also made. Mina died in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Positive-pressure {{ventilators}} work {{by increasing}} the patient's airway pressure through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. The positive pressure allows air to flow into the airway until the ventilator <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> terminated. Then, the airway pressure drops to zero, and the elastic recoil of the chest wall and lungs push the tidal volume — the breath-out through passive exhalation.|$|E

25|$|Exhaled air {{is almost}} fully at {{equilibrium}} with water vapor {{at the body}} temperature. In the cold air the exhaled vapor quickly condenses, thus showing up as a fog or mist of water droplets and as condensation or frost on surfaces. Forcibly condensing these water droplets from exhaled <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> the basis of exhaled breath condensate, an evolving medical diagnostic test.|$|E
25|$|A <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> one {{cycle of}} {{positive}} flow (inspiration) and negative flow (expiration) {{defined in terms}} of the flow-time curve. Inspiratory time is defined as the period from the start of positive flow to the start of negative flow. Expiratory time is defined as the period from the start of expiratory flow to the start of inspiratory flow. The flow-time curve is the basis for many variables related to ventilator settings.|$|E
25|$|A mask is {{considered}} to fit well when it seals comfortably and effectively all round the skirt, and provides a good field of vision, without pressing on the nose or forehead while in use underwater. A low internal volume {{is considered}} desirable by freedivers, as less <b>breath</b> <b>is</b> wasted to equalise, and by scuba divers, as there is less tendency to press up under the nose due to buoyancy, which becomes uncomfortable quite quickly.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} waveform is square, and {{the flow}} waveform is decelerating. This mode {{is a form of}} continuous mandatory ventilation as a minimum number of passive <b>breaths</b> will <b>be</b> time-triggered, and patient-initiated <b>breaths</b> <b>are</b> time-cycled and regulated according to operator-set tidal volume.|$|R
