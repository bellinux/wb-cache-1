2500|$|Bridge {{therapy is}} therapy intended, in {{transportation}} metaphor, {{to serve as}} a figurative <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> another stage of therapy or health, carrying a patient past a challenging period of some kind. There are various types of bridge therapy, such as <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> transplant, <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> candidacy, <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> decision, <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> recovery, and anticoagulation bridge (such as heparin bridge). Bridge therapy exists in contrast to destination therapy, which is the figurative destination rather than a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> something else.|$|R

5|$|The Brighton Main Line was {{the first}} railway line to serve the Crawley area. A station was opened at Three Bridges (originally known as East Crawley) {{in the summer of}} 1841. Crawley railway station, at the {{southern}} end of the High Street, was built in 1848 when the Horsham branch was opened from Three <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> Horsham. A line was built eastwards from Three <b>Bridges</b> <b>to</b> East Grinstead in 1855. Three Bridges had become the hub of transport in the area by this stage: one-quarter of its population was employed in railway jobs by 1861 (mainly at the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's railway works near the station). The Longley company—one of South East England's largest building firms in the late 19th century, responsible for buildings including Christ's Hospital school and the King Edward VII Sanatorium in Midhurst—moved to a site next to Crawley station in 1881. In 1898 more than 700 people were employed at the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the line {{required}} the construction of <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> cross railway lines at Edinburgh Park and Stenhouse, and a tunnel under the A8 near the Gogar roundabout. A bridge at Balgreen was widened.

5|$|A new {{arterial}} road, now the A316 road, {{was given}} Royal Assent on 3 August 1928, and construction began in 1930. The {{construction of the}} road required two new <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> be built, at Twickenham and Chiswick. The proposal was authorised in 1928 and construction began in the same year. The bridge, along with the newly built Twickenham Bridge and the rebuilt Hampton Court Bridge, was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales on 3 July 1933, and the ferry service was permanently closed.|$|E
5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E
5|$|After {{service in}} the Mediterranean the brigade {{returned}} to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it was reinforced {{by the arrival of}} the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943. During the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was part of the strategic reserve, on standby to deploy wherever they were needed to support the invasion. The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> be used subsequently by the British Second Army. Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due to the speed of the Allied advance.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Bridge</b> <b>to</b> transplant: Such therapy {{preserves}} someone's health {{well enough}} and {{long enough that}} they can make it to organ transplant, still being eligible for transplant after spending time waiting for an organ to become available. For example, LVAD often serves as a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> heart transplant, locoregional therapy (such as radiofrequency ablation) for hepatocellular carcinoma can serve as a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> liver transplant, and LVRS can serve as a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> lung transplant.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{proportion}} {{of patients who}} can be bridged with left ventricular assist devices to myocardial recovery and the long-term outcome of these patients is unknown. MethodsWe investigated the outcomes of patients <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery compared with those <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation. All left ventricular assist devices were implanted as a <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> transplantation with a very proactive program of promoting myocardial recovery. A total of 40 patients were <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery and 52 to transplantation. Of the <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery (explanted) group, 33 were men (age, 32. 8 ± 11. 8 years), 37 had dilated cardiomyopathy (familial in 3, peripartum cardiomyopathy in 3) and 3 had myocarditis. Of the <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation (transplanted) group, 42 were men (age, 42. 3 ± 12. 5 years; P < . 0005 vs <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery). The diagnosis was ischemic heart disease in 24, dilated cardiomyopathy in 21 (only 13 received drug therapy), hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in 2, arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in 2, myocarditis in 1, and congestive heart disease in 2. ResultsThe survival rate was 89. 9 %, 73. 9 %, and 73. 9 % and 80. 4 %, 78. 3, and 78. 3 % in the explanted and transplanted groups at 1, 5, and 7 years, respectively. In total, 12 (23 %) patients bridged transplantation either died from, or required ventricular assist device support, for primary graft failure. Of the explanted patients, 4 (10 %) subsequently required transplantation at 34, 512, 1019, and 1213 days (2 died 25 and 1867 days after transplantation and 2 were well after 1523 and 3199 days). The rate of transplant or ventricular assist device-free survival less noncardiac death for the <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery and <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation groups, respectively, was 89. 9 %, 73. 9 %, and 73. 9 % and 80. 4 %, 78. 3 %, and 78. 3 % at 1, 3, and 7 years. At latest follow-up (1394 ± 1195 days for the <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery and 1913 ± 941 days for the <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation group), 5 of the <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation patients (9. 6 %) had malignancy, 34 (65. 4 %) had hypercholesterolemia, 25 (48. 1 %) had hypertension, and 7 (13. 5 %) had coronary disease. The creatinine was 125. 5 ± 43. 5 vs 95. 2 ± 16. 5 μmol/L for the <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> transplantation and <b>bridged</b> <b>to</b> recovery groups (P < . 001). ConclusionsThe outcome after explantation for myocardial recovery is comparable, if not better than, after <b>bridge</b> <b>to</b> transplantation...|$|R

5|$|During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration {{chose to}} make Clark State Forest a {{training}} {{center for the}} Civilian Conservation Corps, and also made it Indiana's largest CCC cantonment in November1933. They created artificial lakes within Clark State Forest, and built many <b>bridges,</b> <b>to</b> aid in water conservation, provide beauty spots within the forest, and teach forestry skills {{to members of the}} Civilian Conservation Corps. The state forest's proximity to the Jeffersonville Quartermaster Depot was key in the decision to focus so much attention on it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 12th century, Philip Augustus {{extended}} the Louvre fortress {{to defend the}} city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares. In 1190, he transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420; {{in spite of a}} 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city, it would remain under English occupation until 1436.|$|E

5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the land walls stands the second major {{entrance}} to the city, the Gate of Ploče. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Ploče was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 April, {{elements}} of the SS Motorised Infantry Division Reich, under command of XLI Motorised Corps crossed the Danube in pneumatic boats and captured Belgrade without resistance. About the same time, most {{of the elements of}} XLVI Motorised Corps that were approaching Belgrade from the west were redirected away from the capital, but part of the 8th Panzer Division continued their thrust to capture the Sava <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> the west of Belgrade, and entered the city during the night. The rest of the 8th Panzer Division turned southeast and drove towards Valjevo to link up with the left flank of the First Panzer Group southwest of Belgrade.

5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for the counterattack {{were made}} during {{the first months of}} 1944. As the bulk of the 17th Army was {{stationed}} in northern and southern Bougainville, engineers needed to develop roads and <b>bridges</b> <b>to</b> allow the troops to move to the hills inland from the American perimeter. All of the units selected for the offensive had departed their bases by mid-February, and advanced along the eastern and western coasts of the island. Barges also moved artillery and other equipment to a point east of Cape Torokina; the guns and supplies were then carried overland into the hills.
