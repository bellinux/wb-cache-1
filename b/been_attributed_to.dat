5|$|The {{cause of}} {{rumination}} syndrome is unknown. However, studies have drawn {{a correlation between}} hypothesized causes {{and the history of}} patients with the disorder. In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents and caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli. The disorder has also commonly <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> a bout of illness, a period of stress in the individual's recent past, and to changes in medication.|$|E

5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam.

5|$|Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of Egypt, {{and were}} {{described}} on the Tempest Stele of Ahmose I, have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption.

5|$|Divorce {{rates in}} Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most {{populated}} economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012.

5|$|Groups of {{wildebeest}} {{females and}} young {{live in the}} small areas established by the male. When groups of wildebeest join together, the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose {{to move to the}} areas held by a smaller number of males. This female-dominated sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance, with higher male mortality having <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> hunting.|$|E

5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the {{influences}} of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, {{and this is the}} source of the merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E
