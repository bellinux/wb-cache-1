40|$|L-band {{measurements}} of land mobile satellite systems (LMSS) propagation effects were last {{made at the}} end of 1988, but some voids were left in the database, making modeling of low elevation roadside tree shadowing and multipath reflections difficult for some path geometries. Transmission of a pilot tone from MARECS-B at 55 deg West during Sep. and Dec. 1991 gave an opportunity to fill the gaps in the experimental results. Two campaigns during which fade data were obtained at elevation angles from 7 deg to 40 deg are described. Below 15 deg, specular terrain reflections in a non-shadowing, hilly environment were observed to introduce significant fading. Although the reflecting surface was at a distance of up to several km, it is shown that the reflected signals are delayed by less than 1 microsec.

40|$|Weile, Daniel S. The {{polarization}} {{of the electromagnetic}} wave transmitted by <b>antenna</b> <b>beacons</b> are used for estimating certain parameters associated with a projectile launched in free space. The development of a novel sensor based {{on the characteristics of}} a propagating polarized electromagnetic wave is presented in this thesis. In particular this thesis investigates how antenna laws can be effectively employed for the real-time and direct measurement of the geometrical orientation (attitude) of a mortar or missile launched in space with respect to a set of reference beacons. This study begins by attempting to determine the location and orientation of a set of dipole antennas to be used as beacons and then builds on those results to move onto more complex antenna design and structures such as smart antennas. Results will show that the proposed scheme has potential as an attitude determination mechanism. University of Delaware, Department of Electrical and Computer EngineeringM. S...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{design of}} a 920 MHz active {{oscillator}} antenna using low cost flexible substrate materials is presented. Flexible amorphous silicon a-Si solar cells are properly integrated in the available area of the circuit substrate preserving the conformal nature of the circuit and providing operational autonomy by harvesting solar power without affecting the radiation properties of the active antenna. Coplanar waveguide fed monopole and slot antennas are designed using EM simulation and harmonic balance simulation is subsequently used to design the oscillator circuit, including the equivalent circuit of the solar module. Two benchmarking prototypes were fabricated, one by method of laser prototyping on PET, and the other by inkjet-printing on photopaper, demonstrating that it is feasible {{to come up with}} a cost effective conformal circuit implementation of a beacon signal generator which can find application in wireless identification and monitoring applications.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{this study}} a field test {{was carried out}} to {{determine}} the total time needed by independently working test persons to locate two active transmitters, placed 15 m apart in a 50 x 50 m area of simulated avalanche debris. A main point is {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of electronic probes with an acoustic hit indication and/or a “deactivating function ” for the transmitter. The interpretation of the results indicates that compared to other combinations, modern equipment (triple <b>antenna</b> <b>beacons</b> with marking function) brings significant benefits to resolving a double burial situation. Experts profit more from modern combinations than beginners. This clearly shows that special training and personal knowledge of all aspects of companion rescue are imperative in a slide scenario. Using specific searching techniques (Three Circle Method) did not prove significantly beneficial. However it is noted that only very few of the test persons know such techniques and are able to perform them correctly under stress. The use of an electronic probe is shown to be a big advantage, both with acoustic support only as well as with acoustic hit indication and a deactivating function. The latter brought the greatest improvement in overall search time. This result can in certain ways be seen as an assignment for manufacturers to develop fully compatible equipment...|$|R
40|$|LOPES is a {{digitally}} {{read out}} antenna array consisting of 30 calibrated dipole antennas. It {{is located at}} the site of the KASCADE-Grande experiment at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe and measures the radio emission of cosmic ray air showers in the frequency band from 40 to 80 MHz. LOPES is triggered by KASCADE and uses the KASCADE reconstruction of the shower axis as an input for the analysis of the radio pulses. Thereby LOPES works as an interferometer when the signal of all antennas is digitally merged to form a beam into the shower direction. To be sensitive to the coherence of the radio signal, a precise time calibration with an accuracy in the order of 1 ns is required. Thus, it is necessary to know the delay of each antenna which is time and frequency dependent. Several calibration measurements are performed to correct for this delay in the analysis: The group delay of every antenna is measured regularly (roughly once per year) by recording a test pulse which is emitted at a known time. Furthermore, the delay is monitored continuously by the so called phase calibration method: A <b>beacon</b> (a dipole <b>antenna)</b> emits continuously two sine waves at 63. 5 MHz and 68. 1 MHz. By that a variation of the delay can be detected in a subsequent analysis of the radio events as a change of the phase at these frequencies. Finally, the dispersion of the analog electronics has been measured to account for the frequency dependence of the delay. Comment: 4 pages, Proceedings of the 31 st ICRC, Lodz 200...|$|R
30|$|Indoor {{positioning}} {{has received}} great attention recently because position information {{is essential for}} providing location-based services (LBSs) [6]. All of local communication technologies and some sensor technologies were applied in indoor positioning, which offers intelligent services in various fields, for example, Internet of Things, hospitals, garages, classrooms, etc. The references about ZigBee indoor positioning [7] were introduced. A large number of nodes should be arranged for indoor positioning, and each node also needs to supply power alone, and the network is complex, it is not suitable for positioning the educational robot in the classroom scenario. Many modern applications use RFID as a wireless non-contact method of data transfer to identify and track the objects to which the transponders are attached [8]. Passive tags can be used, which obtain the energy from the interrogating electromagnetic field created by RFID readers, and the transponders require no local power sources, such as batteries, which results in the reduced need for maintenance while achieving high flexibility, long lifetime, and low cost. RFID technology has been widely adopted in various industrial tracking and positioning applications [9]. RFID system has two main components, RFID tags and RFID readers [10]. In the logistics, transportation and indoor positioning areas have great application. WiFi-based positioning is another potential technology for indoor navigation, because it only uses per-existing WiFi infrastructures. WiFi positioning error does not accumulate with time {{which makes it a}} potential source to aid the stand alone navigation solution based on micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors [11]. WiFi hotspots are very popular in public areas because they can provide high data rates up to 11  Mbit/s (IEEE 802.11 b) or 56  Mbit/s (IEEE 802.11 a/g) [12]. WiFi positioning systems usually estimate the transmitter position using radio <b>beacons</b> involving several <b>antennas</b> and measuring the power of received signals [13]. WiFi positioning {{is one of the most}} ideal positioning technologies, and it is mainly used for moving target positioning in indoor environment.|$|R
50|$|The initial Samos {{satellites}} {{were known}} as Program 101 and were merely a test model designed to verify the operability of the photo-optical camera system. The first Samos launch took place from PALC 1-1 at Point Arguello Launch Complex (later absorbed into the main launch center at Vandenberg Air Force Base) at 12:33 PM on October 11, 1960, using Atlas vehicle 57D and Agena 2101. The Atlas lifted smoothly and steered downrange, as the weather was clear and cloudless, visibility was excellent and the launch vehicle could be seen until after booster section separation. Initial jubilation at the successful launch turned to dismay when the real-time telemetry readouts showed that the nitrogen pressure gas for the Agena's attitude control jets was gone. Without this, the stage could not be stabilized for ignition so that after separation from the Atlas, the Agena was left with no attitude control. Telemetry indicated an erratic attitude rate and abnormal gimbaling of the Bell XLR-81 engine. The Agena burn lasted 122 seconds, slightly longer than nominal, but tracking stations in VAFB, Kodiak Island, and Hawaii found no indication that orbit had been achieved, and {{it was concluded that}} the vehicle had reentered and broken up over an unknown point in the Pacific Ocean. Postflight analysis also found that the Atlas guidance system had malfunctioned in flight, due to either a failure of the rate <b>beacon</b> or waveguide <b>antenna,</b> but the guidance system was not telemetered so an exact cause could not be determined. The guidance system was unable to generate any steering or programmed engine cutoff commands, however backup signals from the missile programmer managed to ensure a proper flight path and on-time engine cutoff. The Agena malfunction was traced to a technician installing a pad umbilical release lanyard improperly, which resulted in the Agena nitrogen quick fill line being ripped out at liftoff. Film and photographs of the launch clearly showed the gas escaping. At Agena engine ignition, performance was also below normal, suggesting damage to the pneumatic system as well.|$|R
