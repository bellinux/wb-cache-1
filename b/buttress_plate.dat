40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} clinical {{results of}} surgical treatment of type-C distal femoral fracture using four {{different types of}} implants. Material and Method: A retrospective study of 86 patients, all with type-C distal femoral fractures, and who underwent surgery using four different types of implants. The use of condylar blade plate, dynamic condylar screw, condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate,</b> or distal femoral locking plate, was evaluated. Following bone union, the functional outcome {{and the degree of}} knee flexion were assessed according to Schatzker and Lambert criteria. Results: Good to excellent functional outcomes of the studied group were found in 72 % of the 86 patients. Average knee flexion was 108. 6 degrees. Among the four different implants, the functional outcomes were as follows: good to excellent results in 89 % of the distal femoral locking plate group, in 78 % of the dynamic condylar screw group, in 66 % of the condylar blade plate group, and in 50 % of the condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> group. Knee flexion in patients treated with the distal femoral locking plate was significantly superior to that found in those who underwent condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> implant. However, {{there were no significant differences}} encountered in other paired comparisons. Conclusion: Of the four different implants used in surgical treatment of type-C distal femoral fracture, the distal femoral locking plate fixation implant provided the highest percentage of good to excellent functional outcome, and achieved a better degree of knee flexion than the condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate.</b> No significant differences were demonstrated in other paired comparisons...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{acetabular}} fractures in the geriatric population requiring open reduction and internal fixation is increasing. Fractures with medial or anterior displacement {{are the most}} frequent types, and via the ilio-inguinal approach <b>buttress</b> <b>plates</b> have proved helpful to maintain the quadrilateral surface or medial acetabular wall. Seven to ten hole 3. 5 mm reconstruction plates {{may be used as}} <b>buttress</b> <b>plates,</b> placed underneath the usual pelvic brim plate. This retrospective study presents our results with this technique in 13 patients at a minimum follow-up of 12 months (average, 31 months). 85 % of the patients had a good result. The early onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis necessitated total hip arthroplasty in two patients (15 %) at 12 and 18 months follow-up, respectively. This treatment option should be considered in the surgeon's armamentarium when fixing these challenging cases...|$|R
40|$|Femur {{parameters}} are key prerequisites for scientifically designing anatomical plates. Meanwhile, {{individual differences in}} femurs present a challenge to design well-fitting anatomical plates. Therefore, to design anatomical plates more scientifically, analyses of femur parameters with statistical methods were performed in this study. The specific steps were as follows. First, taking eight anatomical femur parameters as variables, 100 femur samples were classified into three classes with factor analysis and Q-type cluster analysis. Second, based on the mean parameter values of the three classes of femurs, three sizes of average anatomical plates corresponding to the three classes of femurs were designed. Finally, based on Bayes discriminant analysis, a new femur could be assigned to the proper class. Thereafter, the average anatomical plate suitable for that new femur was selected from the three available sizes of plates. Experimental {{results showed that the}} classification of femurs was quite reasonable based on the anatomical aspects of the femurs. For instance, three sizes of condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plates</b> were designed. Meanwhile, 20 new femurs are judged to which classes the femurs belong. Thereafter, suitable condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plates</b> were determined and selected...|$|R
30|$|Several biomechanical {{studies have}} {{compared}} fixation techniques of supracondylar femur fractures proximal to the TKA [14 – 16]. Biomechanical {{comparison between the}} retrograde-inserted intramedullary nail and plate fixation in these fractures showed retrograde nails to be inferior in initial fixation to dynamic condylar screws and blade plates but superior to condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plates.</b> The LISS showed greater elastic deformation but less permanent deformation than the other devices tested. Comparing the LISS and RISN biomechanically, the RISN may provide greater stability in patients with a posterior cruciate ligament-retaining femoral TKA component [14].|$|R

40|$|Acetabular {{fractures}} involving predominantly {{the anterior}} column {{associated with a}} disruption of the quadrilateral surface can be treated with instrumentation implementing the stabilization of the quadrilateral surface. The recently introduced suprapectineal quadrilateral <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> is specifically designed to prevent secondary medial subluxation of the femoral head, especially in elderly patients with reduced ability for partial weight bearing. Whereas there are guidelines available for safe screw fixation for the anterior and posterior columns, {{there might be a}} concern for intra-articular placement of screws placed through the infrapectineal part of the quadrilateral <b>buttress</b> <b>plate.</b> Within this report we analyzed retrospectively screw placement in 30 plates in postoperative CT scans using algorithms for metal artifact reduction. None of the screws of the <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> penetrated the hip joint. We describe the placement, length, and spatial orientation of the screws used for fracture fixation and suggest that the use of intraoperative image intensifiers with a combined inlet-obturator view of 30 – 45 ° best projects the screws and the hip joint. Preoperative knowledge of approximate screw placement and information for accurate intraoperative imaging may contribute to safe acetabular fracture fixation and may reduce operating time and limit radiation exposure to the patient and the personnel.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{acetabular}} buttress-plate {{has been}} widely used in treating difficult cases with satisfying clinical results. However, the biomechanical properties of a postoperative acetabular fracture fixed by the buttress-plate are not clear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the biomechanical properties of stability after the anterior tube buttress-plate fixation of complex acetabular fractures in the quadrilateral area. METHODS: A construct was proposed based on anterior construct plate - 1 / 3 tube <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> fixation for acetabular both-column fractures. Two groups of six formalin-preserved cadaveric pelvises were analyzed: (1) group A, the normal pelvis and (2) group B, anterior construct plate- 1 / 3 tube <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> with quadrilateral area fixation. The displacements were measured, and cyclical loads were applied in both standing and sitting simulations. RESULTS: As the load was added, the displacements were A<B, increasing in line. In the 600 N physiological loading, the differences were significant (standing position: p =  0. 013; sitting position: p =  0. 009) between groups A and B. CONCLUSION: The anterior construct plate - 1 / 3 tube <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> fixation provided a better stable construct for early sitting. The standing mode yielded more significant differences between the groups. Placing a 1 / 3 tube buttress-plate via an anterior approach is a novel method of providing quadrilateral area support in this setting...|$|E
30|$|The {{evolution}} of internal fixation techniques {{over the last}} 20  years has challenged the Reudi and Allgower principles of early fibula plating {{and the need for}} medial tibial buttressing alone. Fractures that end with valgus failure and those with significant anterior comminution are better supported with anterior or anterolateral plating techniques. The coronal ‘family’ of fractures, as described by Topliss et al. [13], if treated with only medial <b>buttress</b> <b>plates,</b> would hold the primary fracture line suboptimally and lead to failure. Furthermore, the incisions required for anterolateral plating often mean that a standard lateral incision for fibula fixation cannot be utilised.|$|R
30|$|Open {{reduction}} and internal fixation allows anatomical reconstruction and early {{rehabilitation of the}} patient. Several authors have reported good results after open {{reduction and}} internal fixation of these fractures [20 – 22]. Healy et al. treated 20 fractures with open reduction and internal fixation {{using a variety of}} different implants including blade plate, condylar screw and condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plates.</b> They performed bone grafting in 15 patients and achieved union in 18 patients. Two patients, who did not have bone graft at the time of index surgery, needed reoperation with bone grafting to achieve union. Authors recommended primary bone grafting with internal fixation to increase the chances for union of these difficult fractures, to which blood supply has been compromised by previous total knee arthroplasty, the fracture itself and the operative fixation of the fracture [21]. However, achieving rigid internal fixation could be technically demanding in osteopenic and comminuted bones. Figgie et al. reported union in only five out of ten cases after open reduction and internal fixation. The remaining five patients needed further surgical procedures. They also noted that eight out of ten cases developed varus alignment despite satisfactory intraoperative alignment due to metaphyseal comminution, and this was associated with development of progressive radiolucent lines around the prostheses [4]. Moran et al. treated 15 patients with condylar screw and plates, blade <b>plates</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>plates.</b> Of these 15 patients, 2 developed malunion and 3 nonunion at the fracture site requiring further surgery [19]. Cordeiro et al. reported varus angulation in all three patients in their series who were managed with plate and screws [22].|$|R
30|$|Olerud [5] {{described}} his extensile approach with its Y-shaped skin incision for these difficult injuries, {{and in spite}} of skin healing problems, use of ordinary lateral angled blade plate, absence of medial plating, infection in four cases, and single screw fixation of the tibial tuberosity osteotomy, he reported satisfactory overall clinical outcome in his study. To manage these injuries, Sanders et al. [2] also added a medial <b>buttressing</b> <b>plate</b> for their nine cases, {{and in spite of}} their rigid fixation and early rehabilitation, three patients had < 90 ° flexion, and in six the arc of flexion was limited to between 90 ° and 100 °. Additionally, four patients had extensor lag of 5 °.|$|R
30|$|The locked distal femur plate {{played an}} {{important}} role in fixation in this study, especially in the presence of severe medial comminution. However, it has the major disadvantage of uniaxial screw direction, which was overcome by prior application of separate lag screws. Biomechanically, Koval et al. [16] found that the locked <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> provided significantly greater fixation stability than the standard plate or blade plate, both before and after cycling in axial loading. The application of the medial <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> in this study increased the fixation construct rigidity, facilitated graft impaction, and encouraged early rehabilitation without loss of reduction. Also, Sanders et al. [2] reported the efficacy of a medial plate and bone graft in maintenance of reduction during loading in early active motion without loss of reduction or loosening of the implant. Moreover, Jazrawi et al. [1] found that the locked, double-plate construct provided significantly greater fixation stability than the standard double-plate construct.|$|E
30|$|At present, {{there is}} a paucity of {{literature}} on the management of distal-third diaphyseal fractures of the humerus. The current study deals with lower metaphyseal fractures of the humerus (extra-articular distal humerus fractures) treated using a 4.5 -mm LCP (contoured intra-operatively) as a neutralization plate with 3.5 -mm lag screws, using the posterior triceps-splitting approach. Various modifications of plate osteosynthesis have been introduced. These {{include the use of}} a modified lateral tibial head <b>buttress</b> <b>plate,</b> custom-made ‘hybrid’ locking plates, double reconstruction plates and anterior plating of the distal humerus [9 – 11]. Each of these methods has its own disadvantages both in surgical techniques {{as well as in the}} choice of implants. Levy et al. [9] modified the Synthes® Lateral Tibial Head <b>Buttress</b> <b>Plate</b> for use at the distal humerus. An ipsilateral Lateral Tibial Head <b>Buttress</b> <b>Plate</b> was modified using a high-speed rotary diamond-cutting tool to remove the posterior hole of the proximal expanded section of the plate. The resulting sharp edges were rounded off with a diamond-cutting wheel. The plate was then bent so that the bend in the proximal section of the plate was reversed. This resulted in a 4.5 -mm limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) with a distal angular offset of approximately 22 ° that allowed the modified plate to be placed on the lateral column of the distal humerus. The authors reported good results in their series. The problem with this approach is the necessity for elaborate modification of an existing design or the necessity for bulk production of such a modified design.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{is aimed}} at {{achieving}} a stable, aligned, mobile and painless joint and {{to minimize the risk}} of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. To achieve this operative or non-operative treatment plans are considered by physicians based on criteria such as patient characteristics, severity, risk of complications, fracture depression and displacement, degree of injury to ligaments and menisci, vascular and neurological compromise.For early management, traction should be performed early in ward. It can either be Skin Traction or Skeletal Traction. Depends on the body weight of patient and stability of the joint. Schantz pin insertion over the Calcaneum should be done from Medial to lateral side.Later when condition is stable. Definitive plan would be <b>Buttress</b> <b>Plating</b> and Lag Screw fixation.|$|R
30|$|In this series, {{we tried}} to {{overcome}} {{most of the problems}} related to these severe injuries by internal fixation through modification of the extensile Olerud approach, anatomical reduction of the multiplanar fractures including medial and lateral Hoffa fractures, use of a locked distal femur plate, augmentation of the bony defects by medial <b>buttress</b> <b>plating</b> and bone grafting, assembly of the fragments related to the femoral attachments of the cruciate ligaments, preservation of suprapatellar pouch integrity, and early aggressive rehabilitation. The V-shaped skin incision in our cases precluded the wound-edge necrosis and dehiscence encountered by Olerud with the Y-shaped incision. The rigid fixation of the tibial tuberosity osteotomy by two screws and tension band wiring encouraged the early and progressive physiotherapy program.|$|R
30|$|Historically, ORIF {{of these}} {{fractures}} with plates and screws {{has been plagued}} by significant rates of malunion and nonunion [7, 9, 10]. Zehntner and Ganz [17] successfully treated six patients with condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plates.</b> Moran et al. [18] reported on 15 displaced fractures treated with ORIF; 10 of the 15 patients demonstrated good results. There were, however, two malunions and three nonunions. Retrograde intramedullary fixation and supracondylar nails have been proposed to improve the rate of union while decreasing soft-tissue trauma [9]. Mclaren et al. reported on seven cases treated with supracondylar nailing, with stable fixation achieved in all patients [19]. Jabczenski et al. [20] similarly treated four patients with an intramedullary reamed nail, and all four fractures healed without complications.|$|R
40|$|Background & Objectives: Severely {{comminuted}} distal femur fractures are {{in association}} with the high complications and their treatment is so difficult. Supracondylar femur fractures usually occur as a result of low-energy trauma in osteoporotic bone in elderly persons or high-energy trauma in young patients. This study was aimed to assess the results of new treatment plan for comminuted intra-articular distal femur fractures with locking condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate.</b> The results of this strategy will help us to find the effective method of treatment for the distal femur fractures.   Methods: In a prospective cross-sectional study, 47 patients with intra-articular distal femur fractures after two weeks fracture and treating with locking condylar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> were selected. Then, they were examined for infection, range of knee motion and ::union:: at the first and second week and 1, 2 and 3 months after surgery. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and the level of significance was set as p< 0. 05.   Results: 53. 2 % of the patients had closed fractures, 6. 4 % of them had open type I and the rest showed open type IIIA fracture. The overall ::union:: rate was seen in 80. 9 % of cases and infection was detected in 19 / 1 % and mal::union:: was observed 21. 3 % of patients.

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} early {{clinical}} and radiographic outcomes of Hoffa fractures treated by a standard protocol of open reduction and internal fixation using headless compression screws combined with back <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> in a consecutive series of 8 Chinese patients. Methods: Open reduction and internal fixation {{was performed on}} all patients. The fractures were anatomically reduced and held temporarily by K-wire. If the ends of fractures were atrophic, autologous bone graft from the ipsilateral iliac crest was packed between the ends. Then the fracture fragments were fixed with AO 6. 5 mm headless compression cannulated screws. At least two screws were used to provide rotational stability. One pre-contoured reconstruction plate {{was placed on the}} nonarticular surface posteromedially or posterolaterally as back <b>buttress</b> <b>plate.</b> Results: All the patients were followed up for at least 12 months (range 12 - 25 months). All fractures achieved anatomical reduction and healed clinically and radiographically. At recent follow-up, the mean flexion degree was 120. 6 ° (range 110 °- 135 °) and the mean extension degree was 2. 5 ° (range 0 °- 5 °). The average visual analogue scale score was 1. 6 points (range 0 - 3). Six patients were assessed as excellent and 2 as good according to the hospital for special surgery knee score system. There were no superficial or deep infections, or hardware breakages. No patient had giving way or locking of the knee, though some had intermittent pain and swelling after strenuous exercise. Injury mechanism had significant influence on the functional outcome (P= 0. 046). Conclusion: Headless compression screws combined with back <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> and/or autologous bone grafting to treat old Hoffa fracture is one of effective measures. It would be conducive to not only fracture healing but also early exercise and functional recovery. Key words: Fractures, bone; Fracture fixation, internal; Intra-articular fracture...|$|E
40|$|Background Tibial head {{depression}} fractures {{demand a}} high level of fracture stabilization to prevent a secondary loss of reduction after surgery. Elderly individuals are at an increased risk of developing these fractures, and biomechanical investigations of the fractures are rare. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} systematically analyze different types of osteosyntheses in combination with two commonly used bone substitutes. Methods Lateral tibial head depression fractures were created in synthetic bones. After reduction, the fractures were stabilized with eight different treatment options of osteosynthesis alone or in combination with a bone substitute. Two screws, 4 screws and a lateral <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> were investigated. As a bone substitute, two common clinically used calcium phosphate cements, Norian® Drillable and ChronOS™ Inject, were applied. Displacement of the articular fracture fragment (mm) during cyclic loading, stiffness (N/mm) and maximum load (N) in Load-to-Failure tests were measured. Results The three different osteosyntheses (Group 1 : 2 screws, group 2 : 4 screws, group 3 : plate) alone revealed a significantly higher displacement compared to the control group (Group 7 : ChronOS™ Inject only) (Group 1, 7 [p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01]; group 2, 7 [p[*]=[*] 0. 04]; group 3, 7 [p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01]). However, the osteosyntheses in combination with bone substitute exhibited no differences in displacement compared to the control group. The <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> demonstrated a higher normalized maximum load than the 2 and 4 screw osteosynthesis. Comparing the two different bone substitutes to each other, ChronOS™ inject had a significantly higher stiffness and lower displacement than Norian® Drillable. Conclusions The highest biomechanical stability under maximal loading was provided by a <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> osteosynthesis. A bone substitute, such as the biomechanically favorable ChronOS™ Inject, is essential to reduce the displacement under lower loading...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the stability of}} seven Schatzker type II fractures of the lateral tibial plateau treated by subchondral screws and a <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> followed by immediate partial weight-bearing. In order to assess {{the stability of the}} fracture, weight-bearing inducible displacements of the fracture fragments and their migration over a one-year period were measured by differentially loaded radiostereometric analysis and standard radiostereometric analysis, respectively. The mean inducible craniocaudal fracture fragment displacements measured - 0. 30 mm (- 0. 73 to 0. 02) at two weeks and 0. 00 mm (- 0. 12 to 0. 15) at 52 weeks. All inducible displacements were elastic in nature under all loads at each examination during follow-up. At one year, the mean craniocaudal migration of the fracture fragments was - 0. 34 mm (- 1. 64 to 1. 51).

30|$|There {{is a huge}} {{potential}} for the employment of nitinol staples in the orthopaedic field, but there is limited research available on staple use and how it compares to the current implants available {{as a form of}} fixation. Various studies report the use of two staples applied orthogonally to each other as a technique to increase the stability of the staple fixation (Bechtold et al. 1993; Choudhary et al. 2004). While these clinical studies have shown promising results, there has been little research investigating the actual biomechanics of the interface as dictated by this staple orientation.

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of distal radial articular fracture is still controversial despite continue refinement in the treatment. Objectives: The study {{was done to}} compare the functional as well as radiological outcome of {{treatment of}} distal radius by the external fixation frame and internal fixation by plating. Materials and Methods: This prospective {{study was conducted in}} a tertiary care hospital of eastern India on 40 patients with distal radial articular fractures after taking clearance from the Institutional Ethical committee and informed consent of the patients. All cases of distal radial articular fractures were randomly assigned by computerized methods to two different treatment protocols: a) external fixation application and b) internal fixation application. The fractures were classified with Fernandez and Jupiter classification. Results: In the present study excellent results were obtained in all Fernandez type I fractures both in external fixation and internal fixation group. Excellent to good results were obtained in all Fernandez type II fractures both in external fixation and internal fixation group. In external fixation group, out of six type II fracture four (66 %) had excellent result and two (33 %) had good result. In internal fixation group out of nine type II fracture five (55 %) had excellent result and four (45 %) had good result. Mixed results were obtained in all Fernandez type III fractures (16) both in external fixation and internal fixation group. In external fixation group, out of eight type III fracture 3 (38 %) had excellent result, four (50 %) had good result and one (12 %) had fair result. In internal fixation group out of eight type III fracture six (75 %) had excellent result and two (25 %) had good result. The results indicate that in type III fractures internal fixation is a better option. Fair to poor results were obtained in Fernandez type V (3) fractures both in external fixation and internal fixation group. Results may be improved by early bone grafting and possible external fixation and internal fixation (combined fixation). Out of thirteen patients with biplanar JESS, eight (61 %) had excellent results compared to uniplanar UMAX in which out of seven, patients three (42 %), had excellent results. Conclusions: External fixation and volar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> produce almost equivalent functional results in distal radial articular fractures, with volar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> having better anatomical results than external fixation in the present study. With careful assessment, good surgical technique and early mobilization, the distal radial articular fractures can be effectively managed with predictably good outcome using either external fixation or volar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate.</b> Volar <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> can be more effective in type III Fernandez fractures, while UMAX is a better option for Fernandez type II fractures...|$|E
40|$|Background: The fixable {{suture anchor}} plate {{is a new}} device that has been {{designed}} {{with the intention of}} improving anchorage-to-bone strength during tendon-to-bone repair in patients with compromised bone quality. In this in vitro study we compare the load-to-failure and mode-of-failure results of a fixable suture anchor plate to that of other devices that are commonly used during rotator cuff repair surgery, including: a <b>buttress</b> <b>plate,</b> metal suture anchors, bioabsorbable suture anchors, and suture through simple tunnels without any augmenting device. We hypothesized that the fixable suture anchor plate would provide higher load-to-failure measurements compared to the other devices. Methods: Each device was implanted into solid rigid polyurethane foam blocks with densities representing varying degrees of osteoporosis, and then tested to failure. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis tests were used to determine statistical significance. Results: The average load to failure for the fixable suture anchor plate was significantly greater in low and medium density blocks compared to the other devices tested (p≤ 0. 01). The greatest difference in magnitude was seen in low density blocks (5 pcf), where the fixable suture anchor plate failed at 278 ± 53 N (mean ± standard deviation), about double the value of the next highest failure at 133 ± 11 N for the <b>buttress</b> <b>plate.</b> Conclusions: The fixable suture anchor plate demonstrated superior anchorage strength in low and medium density foam blocks compared to the other devices that were tested in this study. Further studies are needed to determine whether clinical use of a fixable suture anchor plate will translate into a higher rotator-cuff-repair success rate in vivo...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{measured}} {{the distribution of}} con-tact area and pressure between the acetabulum and the femoral head of cadaveric pelves in three dif-ferent conditions: intact, with an operatively created fracture of the posterior wall, and after anatomical reduction and fixation of the fracture with a <b>buttress</b> <b>plate</b> and interfragmentary screws. The study involved eight cadaveric hip joints from five pelves loaded to 2000 newtons in simulated single-limb stance. Measure-ments were made with pressure-sensitive film. The ac-etabulum was divided into three areas- the anterior wall, the superior aspect, and the posterior wall- {{for the analysis of}} the data. Creation of a fracture of the posterior wall was followed by an increase in contact area, maximum pres...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of accurate and precise ages for {{the timing of}} collision between oceanic plateaus and continental crust requires {{an understanding of how}} the indenting and <b>buttressing</b> <b>plates</b> respond to the collision. We present geochronological, thermochronological, geochemical and isotopic analyses of magmatic rocks from the Ecuadorian Andes, which relate to the collision of the Late Cretaceous Caribbean Plateau and Great Arc sequence with NW South America. The cessation of subduction magmatism during 65 - 64 Ma beneath the eastern edge of Caribbean Plateau was synchronous with accelerated surface uplift and exhumation within the buttressing continental margin during 75 - 65 Ma. We interpret this as the collision of {{the leading edge of the}} Caribbean Plateau and arc sequence with the South American Plate at 75 - 65 Ma. A U/Pb (zircon) SHRIMP age of 87. 10 +/- 1. 66 (2 sigma) Ma, yielded by an accreted fragment of the plateau, precludes previous estimates of collision at 85 - 80 Ma if the plateau erupted above the Galapagos hotspot...|$|R
30|$|Wei et al. [33] {{randomized}} 46 {{patients with}} an unstable distal radius fracture {{to be treated}} with augmented external fixation (n =  22), a volar locking plate (n =  12) or a radial locking column plate (n =  12). Fractures were considered unstable if fracture fragments were redisplaced following closed reduction and cast immobilization, or if three of the following criteria were met: dorsal angulation of > 20 °, dorsal comminution, an intra-articular fracture, an associated ulnar styloid fracture or age > 60  years. Patients were randomized into three study arms in two phases. First, patients were assigned {{to be treated with}} augmented external or internal fixation. During a second randomization, the patients who had been assigned to receive internal fixation were further randomized to be treated with either a volar locking (EBI OptiLock, Parsippany, New Jersey) or a radial locking column plate. Randomization was done by computer-generated allocation using sealed, opaque envelopes. Only data on patients treated with an external fixator or with a volar locking plate were included in this meta-analysis. Treatment with external fixation (Hoffmann II Compact, Stryker) was augmented with K-wires in all patients, additional small <b>buttress</b> <b>plates</b> (n =  2) or filling of the metaphyseal void with cancellous bone allograft (n =  4) as deemed appropriate by the surgeon. Two patients who had originally been assigned to be treated with a volar locking plate received additional fixation with a dorsal plate, and four patients received supplemental bone grafting following fixation with a volar locking plate. These patients were included in the analysis in the group they were originally assigned to. DASH scores were reported at a follow-up of 3, 6 and 12  months.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION For more {{displaced}} fractures and osteopenic bone, {{techniques of}} internal fixation, which emphasise less disruptive soft tissue dissection, and minimal fixation with wire and non-absorbable sutures {{have been successful}} with a low complication rate. Even AO type <b>buttress</b> <b>plates</b> are being used, but they require more soft tissue dissection and may lead to infection. Management of these fractures is associated with some morbidity and undesirable sequelae. They include complications like avascular necrosis, malunion, non-union, infection, neurovascular injury, loss of motion of shoulder from adhesive capsulitis, chronic oedema, elbow stiffness and atrophy of the soft tissues of the immobilised limb causing significant disability during healing and afterwards. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the functional outcome of the surgical management of fresh displaced three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures with locking plate system. MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study was carried out from August 2012 to December 2014 at Orthopaedic Department in Bangalore Medical College and Hospital. During this period, 25 patients of proximal humerus fractures were treated with locking plates. All patients were followed up for every 4 weeks. Local examination of the affected shoulder for tenderness, instability, deformity and shoulder movements were assessed. X-rays were taken at each visit to know about progressive fracture union and implant position. Rehabilitation of the affected extremity was done according to the stage of fracture union and time duration from surgery. Patients were followed up till radiological union. RESULTS The present study consists of 25 patients of fresh three- and four-part fractures of proximal humerus which were treated surgically with locking plates from August 2012 to December 2014. All the patients were available for follow-up and they were followed every month for first 3 months then once in 3 months. In this study, NEER classification was followed. There were 15 (60...|$|R
