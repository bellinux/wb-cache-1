5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of <b>broodiness,</b> the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E
25|$|The cages are {{arranged}} in long rows as multiple tiers, often with cages back-to-back (hence the term 'battery cage'). Within a single shed, there may be several floors containing battery cages meaning that a single shed may contain many {{tens of thousands of}} hens. Light intensity is often kept low (e.g. 10 lux) to reduce feather pecking and vent pecking. Benefits of battery cages include easier care for the birds, floor eggs which are expensive to collect are eliminated, eggs are cleaner, capture at the end of lay is expedited, generally less feed is required to produce eggs, <b>broodiness</b> is eliminated, more hens may be housed in a given house floor space, internal parasites are more easily treated, and labor requirements are generally much reduced.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Squall was mixed. Journalist Jack Patrick Rodgers of PopMatters said that Squall's cynicism and frustration with {{those around him}} made him a strong character, but [...] "coldly inhuman". GamesRadar called Squall the fifth-best Final Fantasy hero of all time, praising the development of his personality and his improved interactions with other characters. GameZone rated him the fourth-best character in the franchise, saying that while fans [...] "either love or hate this guy" [...] he became the [...] "ultimate anti-hero" [...] (despite little dialogue) of an entertaining journey. The website called Squall and Rinoa the best couple created by Square Enix, noting the differences {{between them and the}} fact that their relationship was the first in the series to drive the plot of a game. They were on The Inquirers list of most-memorable video-game love teams, with comments again focused on the differences between them. GameSpot said that while Squall could be viewed as a [...] "jerk", he could also be seen as [...] "standoffish because of some repressed Wagnerian <b>broodiness,</b> in which case he was kind of interesting". Allgame said that they initially hated Squall, but although he originally seemed [...] "cold and uncaring", his romance changed him for the better. RPGamer called Squall [...] "everyone's favorite orphan" [...] and said that although he tries to distance himself from others, [...] "he can't help but draw people to him, be it sorceresses or gun-slinging ladies' men". GameDaily ranked him sixth on their list of the [...] "Top 25 Gaming Hunks", stating that while critics described the character as a [...] "jerk", his character design, notably his scar, made him visually appealing. Similarly, Den of Geek listed Squall {{as one of the most}} sexually appealing video game characters based on the design, most notably his scar. Arnold Katayev of PSXextreme praised Squall's redesign in Kingdom Hearts as the game's best. In a 2008 Oricon poll, Squall was voted the tenth-most-popular video-game character. He was voted the 29th-best video-game character by Famitsu readers in February 2010. Complex listed him as the one of the greatest Final Fantasy characters.|$|E
2500|$|Sue obsesses {{with the}} idea of having another child but no matter how hard she and Ali try, they cannot conceive. A phantom {{pregnancy}} in May 1986 leaves her heartbroken and she later tries to convince Michelle to let her adopt Michelle's daughter Vicki, culminating in Michelle slapping Sue. In September, Sue begins toying {{with the idea}} of adopting a Turkish child from Cyprus, which is met with indignation from Ali's family. She and Ali decide to apply to adopt in the UK instead. They meet a social worker to assess their suitability; however, their application is rejected because it is felt they are applying too quickly after the death of their child. Sue agonizes over this and in 1987, she faces more turmoil after finding a lump on her breast; she fears she has breast cancer. After much worrying, she is eventually persuaded to get the lump checked out and is subsequently given the all-clear. Later in the year, Sue grows attached to Ali's nephews and niece when they come to stay with her in Walford, and is saddened when they go home several months later. Still unable to conceive, Sue begins to crave a baby more than ever and Ali tires of her eternal <b>broodiness.</b> Sue decides she wants to move to the Isle of Dogs, thinking that the milder climate may increase her chances of conceiving. Ali refuses and in a fury, Sue packs a suitcase and disappears without word. Ali believes she has left him, but Sue is only visiting an old school friend and she returns in October 1987 to announce that she is expecting another baby. In March 1988, she gives birth to another son, [...] "Little Ali", who is delivered by Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Sue's desperation to be a good mother means that she often excludes her husband from parental duties. She becomes so obsessed with her baby's welfare that she has no time for Ali and their relationship suffers. Feeling neglected and tired of his wife's nagging, Ali has sex with Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler). However, Donna blackmails Ali, threatening to inform Sue about their tryst unless he pays her regularly. A fearful Ali pays, silencing Donna for a while, but in March 1989 Sue argues with Donna, banning her from the café. In retaliation, Donna informs Sue about the affair. Upset, Sue turns to Ali's brother Mehmet (Haluk Bilginer) for comfort and attempts to kiss an innocent Mehmet in front of Ali for revenge. Believing that Sue is having an affair with his brother, Ali assaults Mehmet then informs Mehmet's wife Guizin (Ishia Bennison) about the fabricated affair, causing the Osman family to fracture. Following threats from Ali, Sue takes their son and leaves Walford.|$|E
50|$|Some {{environmental}} conditions stimulate <b>broodiness.</b> In heavy breeds of chickens, warm weather tends {{to bring about}} <b>broodiness.</b> Removing eggs each day, out of {{the sight of the}} hens, helps avoid <b>broodiness</b> not only in domestic poultry but also in some wild species in captivity. This continued egg laying means more eggs are laid than would occur under natural conditions. Poultry farming in battery cages also helps to avoid <b>broodiness.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Broodiness</b> is {{more common}} in some chicken breeds than others, {{indicating}} that it is an inherited characteristic. Breeds such as Cochin, Cornish and Silkie exhibit a tendency to <b>broodiness,</b> including brooding eggs from other species such as quails, pheasants, turkeys and geese. In some breeds such as the White Leghorn, <b>broodiness</b> is extremely rare.|$|E
50|$|<b>Broodiness</b> {{is due to}} the {{secretion}} of {{the hormone}} prolactin by the anterior lobe of the hypophysis. Prolactin injection in hens provokes egg laying to stop within a few days, vitellum reabsorbtion, ovary regression (hens only have a left ovary) and finally <b>broodiness.</b> However, attempts to stop <b>broodiness</b> by the administration of several hormones have failed because this state, once evoked, requires time to revert.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Broodiness</b> is {{the action}} or {{behavioral}} tendency {{to sit on}} a clutch of eggs to incubate them, often requiring the non-expression of many other behaviors including feeding and drinking. Being broody has been defined as [...] "Being in a state of readiness to brood eggs that is characterized by cessation of laying and by marked changes in behavior and physiology". [...] Broody birds often pluck feathers from their chest and abdomen, using them to cover the eggs. As a consequence of this, they develop one or several patches of bare skin on the ventral surface. These reddish, well-vascularized areas of skin are usually called brood patches, and improve heat transfer to the eggs. <b>Broodiness</b> is usually associated with female birds, although males of some bird species become broody and some non-avian animals also show <b>broodiness.</b>|$|E
50|$|Castrated males can go broody {{with baby}} chicks, showing that <b>broodiness</b> {{is not limited}} to females, however, {{castrated}} males do not incubate eggs.|$|E

5000|$|Because hens stop laying {{when they}} become broody, {{commercial}} poultry breeders perceive <b>broodiness</b> not as a normal physiological process, but as an impediment to egg and poultry meat production. [...] With domestication, {{it has become more}} profitable to incubate eggs artificially, while keeping hens in full egg production. To help achieve this, there has been intense artificial selection for non-broodiness in commercial egg laying chickens and parent stock of poultry. As a result of this artificial selection, <b>broodiness</b> has been reduced to very low levels in present-day breeds of commercial fowl, both among egg-laying and meat-producing breeds.|$|E

50|$|Incubation {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} certain oviparous (egg-laying) animals hatch their eggs; it also {{refers to the}} {{development}} of the embryo within the egg. Multiple and various factors are vital to the incubation of various species of animal. In many species of reptile for example, no fixed temperature is necessary, but the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds in contrast, the genders of offspring are genetically determined, but in many species a constant and particular temperature is necessary for successful incubation. Especially in poultry, the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called brooding. The action or behavioral tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs is also called <b>broodiness,</b> and most egg-laying breeds of poultry have had this behavior selectively bred out of them to increase production.|$|E

And he saves his biggest mopes for The History of a Cheating Heart, when he complains: 'I carry this on my back.' No wonder Albarn looks so hangdog on the album's cover. But Everyday Robots also comes with moments that are strangely addictive: 'Photographs (You Are Taking Now)' slow-motion throb sounds like something The xx would happily dance to, the title track combines a horror movie atmosphere with genuinely heartfelt lyrics, 'Lonely Press Play' sounds like a Gorillaz outtake that's just missing a De La Soul verse to elevate it to greatness, while the chirpy instrumentals 'Parakeet' and 'Seven High' deserve more exploration." [...] He gave the album three out of five stars and concluded by saying: [...] "He's either a sad man trying to release a happy album, or a happy man trying to release a sad one.
