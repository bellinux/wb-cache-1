Recognizing success in recruiting in the capital city, a second <b>battery</b> <b>of</b> ‘Garrison Artillery’ was authorized in Charlottetown, necessitating two re-designations: No.1 Charlottetown <b>Battery</b> <b>of</b> Garrison Artillery (GO 17 – 25 June 1875) and No.2 Charlottetown <b>Battery</b> <b>of</b> Garrison Artillery (OC Major Morris).|$|R

40|$|Owing to random deployment, {{environmental}} factors, dynamic topology, {{and external}} attacks, emergence <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> in {{wireless sensor networks}} is inescapable. Hole is an area in sensor network around which sensors cease to sense or communicate due to drainage <b>of</b> <b>battery</b> or any fault, either temporary or permanent. Holes impair sensing and communication functions of network; thus their identification is a major concern. This paper discusses different types <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> and significance <b>of</b> <b>hole</b> detection in wireless sensor networks. Coverage hole detection schemes have been classified into three categories based {{on the type of}} information used by algorithms, computation model, and network dynamics for better understanding. Then, relative strengths and shortcomings of some of the existing coverage hole detection algorithms are discussed. The paper is concluded by highlighting various future research directions...|$|R
