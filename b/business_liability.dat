25|$|The Lackawanna Steel {{plant was}} {{declared}} a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1988 after the EPA conducted a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Facility Assessment of the plant. The state of New York subsequently declared it a Class 2 Inactive Hazardous Waste Site, indicating the site poses a significant {{potential threat to}} {{human health and the}} environment. In August 1990, Bethlehem Steel (operating as Tecumseh Redevelopment, Inc.) and the EPA entered into an administrative consent order requiring Bethlehem Steel to identify {{the nature and extent of}} any releases of hazardous waste and mitigate any emergency situations that might be discovered during the course of the investigations. Bethlehem Steel and its successor corporations have been submitting RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) reports since then. Although the RFI was due to be completed in 2004, it still was not complete as of June 2008. The plant was also declared a brownfield in 2003 under the Small <b>Business</b> <b>Liability</b> Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002. While this made the city of Lackawanna eligible for federal assistance money to redevelop part of the site, a cooperative agreement had not been signed as of May 2006.|$|E

2500|$|The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 {{originally}} {{only allowed}} an occupier {{to exclude the}} common duty of care if the property is used for business purposes. Several organisations, including the National Farmers Union and the Country Land and Business Association, argued that this was forcing landowners to exclude people completely {{for fear of being}} sued, thus hindering educational and recreational purposes as well as business ones. In response to this, Section 2 of the Act amends the 1977 Act to say that [...] "breach of an obligation or duty towards a person obtaining access to the premises for recreational or educational purposes ... is not a <b>business</b> <b>liability</b> of the occupier unless granting that person such access for the purposes concerned falls within the business purposes of the occupier". This permits landowners to allow educational and recreational bodies access to their land without the risk of liability.|$|E
2500|$|It is hard {{to place}} an exact value on the money stolen through {{insurance}} fraud. Insurance fraud is deliberately undetectable, unlike visible crimes such as robbery or murder. As such, {{the number of cases}} of insurance fraud that are detected is much lower than the number of acts that are actually committed. [...] The best that can be done is to provide an estimate for the losses that insurers suffer due to insurance fraud. [...] The Coalition Against Insurance Fraud estimates that in 2006 a total of about $80 billion was lost in the United States due to insurance fraud. [...] According to estimates by the Insurance Information Institute, insurance fraud accounts for about 10 percent of the property/casualty insurance industry’s incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses. [...] The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that 3% of the health care industry’s expenditures in the United States are due to fraudulent activities, amounting to a cost of about $51 billion. [...] Other estimates attribute as much as 10% of the total healthcare spending in the United States to fraud—about $115 billion annually. Another study of all types of fraud committed in the United States insurance institutions (property-and-casualty, <b>business</b> <b>liability,</b> healthcare, social security, etc.)put the true cost at 33% to 38% of the total cash flow through the system. This study resulted in the book title [...] "The Trillion Dollar Insurance Crook" [...] by J.E. Smith. In the United Kingdom, the Insurance Fraud Bureau estimates that the loss due to insurance fraud in the United Kingdom is about £1.5 billion ($3.08 billion), causing a 5% increase in insurance premiums. [...] The Insurance Bureau of Canada estimates that personal injury fraud in Canada costs about C$500 million annually.|$|E

30|$|The {{next step}} in the data {{collection}} process was to identify all businesses in Norway where these individuals obtained a majority stake (i.e., more than 50 %) between 2005 and 2016. We focused on limited <b>liability</b> <b>businesses</b> because they have to meet a minimum capital requirement, are obliged to submit annual accounts to the tax authority and they have to report any important changes in the business, including changes in ownership, top manager, or board composition. For these reasons, limited <b>liability</b> <b>businesses</b> are usually larger and less likely to be part-time operations or dormant firms than sole proprietorships and partnerships. We selected majority owners to be able to link personal characteristics of the owners to the firms. This procedure also made sure {{that there is only one}} self-employed person in each business. The Norwegian tax authority has databases for shareholders in limited <b>liability</b> <b>businesses</b> every year from 2005 to 2016 making it possible to trace business owners and exit from business ownership.|$|R
