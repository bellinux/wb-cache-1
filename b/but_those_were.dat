5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} launched {{initiatives to}} exhume the bodies buried at Ovčara in 1993 and 1994, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> unsuccessful. A five-member Commission of Experts {{appointed by the}} UN Secretary General came to Ovčara to exhume the victims in October 1993. However, they were prevented from carrying out their work by the local Croatian Serb administration. After the Croatian Serb authorities blocked several attempts to further investigate the mass grave at Ovčara, still under constant guard by the Russian peacekeepers, the site was visited by then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright in January 1994. She used the occasion to stress U.S. support for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which {{had been set up}} in 1993.|$|E
5|$|All {{the regular}} first-choice players signed on {{again for the}} new campaign, apart from goalkeeper George Hollis. Of the less regular team members, Bernard Pumfrey left for Midland League club Gainsborough Trinity, William Reynolds and Gilbert Smith were {{released}} to join Birmingham & District League club Berwick Rangers, and Chris Charsley retired from League football to concentrate on his police career. Small Heath signed the former Sunderland full back Jack Oliver, whom they had failed to recruit earlier in the season, and forward Charlie Letherbarrow from Walsall, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> the only major signings. The squad was boosted by players from local football, who included Alec Leake, Bill Lewis and a young Billy Pratt. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy. There were no changes to the team's kit of light blue shirts with navy collar trim, cuffs and pocket, white knickerbockers and navy socks.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1796, {{following}} the death of Catherine the Great, Potocki retired to Kurów, Galicia (southern Poland). There he devoted himself to historical studies, publishing several books, translations and commentaries. He also wrote poems, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> never published during his lifteime. Historians still debate over his potential authorship of several anonymous works (primarily political brochures). He distanced himself from activists discussing a new insurrection, but was nonetheless arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian authorities again in the years 1798–1800. In 1801 he joined the Warsaw Scientific Society. He returned to politics shortly after much of Galicia was liberated by Napoleon and attached to the Duchy of Warsaw. During the negotiations with Napoleon in Dresden he contracted severe diarrhea and died on 30 August 1809. He was buried in Wilanów.|$|E

A project to teach basic education for the elderly people using Tunisian Arabic was proposed in 1977 by Tunisian linguist Mohamed Maamouri. It aimed to ameliorate the quality and intelligibility of basic courses for elderly people who could not understand Standard Arabic as they did not learn it. However, the project was not implemented.|$|E
25|$|After the 1920 season, Waldock did {{not return}} to Oxford and {{disappeared}} from first-class cricket for three years. He reappeared in four matches for Somerset {{at the start of the}} 1924 season, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> his last games in English first-class cricket. For the next dozen years, he played for Sri Lankan side, appearing in a few first-class matches against touring teams from England and India. In his last recorded match, a one-day match against the MCC team that was heading for an Ashes series in Australia in 1936/37, he was captain of the Ceylon team.|$|E

However, other teams lost in the National League to give them {{promotion}} in that competition, and their fourth National League win in a row - over Kent Spitfires at St Lawrence Ground - left them {{in control of the}} race for the Division Two title. Sussex finished the Championship season with an eight-wicket victory over Kent, leaving them third in the Championship, and a win over Yorkshire Phoenix gave them the National League Division Two title.|$|E
25|$|Pope John Paul II {{had laid}} out new {{procedures}} for the election of his successor in his Apostolic Constitution Universi Dominici gregis in 1996. It detailed {{the roles of the}} cardinals and support personnel, the scheduling of the conclave, the text of oaths, penalties for violating secrecy, and many details, even the shape of the ballots ("the ballot paper must be rectangular in shape"). He denied the cardinals the right to choose a pope by acclamation or by assigning the election to a select group of cardinals. He established new voting procedures the cardinals could follow if the balloting continued for several days, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> not invoked in this conclave. He maintained the rule established by Paul VI that cardinals who reached the age of eighty before the day the pope died would not participate on the balloting.|$|E
25|$|The {{share of}} urban borrowers kept slowly {{increasing}} to about 30% of all loans <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> riskier loans. The share of loans to merchants, who were mostly Jewish, was particularly low – just 2.2% in 1889 when {{the average of}} other banks was 13.5%. A big jump in urban loans was seen in 1892 due to the agricultural crisis (from 8 million to 13.4 million). These loans helped industrialisation, but were blamed for a construction boom which later resulted in a bust. From 1901 to 1907, the bank auctioned 659 urban properties but managed to sell only 452 and suffered 2 million rubles in losses. There were no restrictions of Catholic nobles or Jews on acquiring urban properties. In 1902, to reign in the perceived abuses, the government limited urban loans to 30% of outstanding loans. Despite the losses and regulations, the bank continued to lend to city residents and the outstanding loans amounted to 35.9 million and represented 2,891 properties in 1915.|$|E

Cheshire is one of the only counties (along with County Durham, Dorset and Rutland) that does not have its own designated BBC Radio station. The majority of the county (south and east) are covered by BBC Radio Stoke, whilst BBC Radio Merseyside tends to cover the west. The BBC directs readers to Stoke and Staffordshire when Cheshire is selected on their website. The BBC covers the west with BBC Radio Merseyside, the north and east with BBC Radio Manchester and the south with BBC Radio Stoke. There were plans to launch BBC Radio Cheshire, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> shelved in 2007 after a lower than expected BBC licence fee settlement.|$|E
25|$|Hansbrough {{collected}} a season-high 13 rebounds in the season-opener against the Detroit Pistons on December 26, with {{five of those}} coming at the offensive end. He had 10+ rebounds twice in the season's first three contests, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> his only games in double figures, until having 10 boards against the Houston Rockets on April 1, 2012. He was second on the team with 226 free throws made and 278 attempts from the foul line. He attempted 10+ free throws three times, including a high of 11 against the Miami Heat on January 4. He scored at least eight points {{in each of the}} season's first 11 games, hitting double-digits in nine of those. In that 11-game span, he averaged 12.2 points per game and had a streak of seven games in a row with 10+ points from December 30 to January 9. He scored in double figures just 20 times the rest of the season, including a season-best 22 points against the Charlotte Bobcats on February 22. The Pacers made it to {{the second round of the}} playoffs in 2012, where they were defeated by the eventual champion Miami Heat.|$|E

In the opener, Kershaw had another strong game, allowing two runs and five hits in eight innings with 13 strikeouts. A solo homer by Justin Turner {{in the top of}} the ninth gave the Dodgers a 3–2 win. Buster Posey hit a walk-off RBI single off of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen the next day as the Giants won 5–4 in 10 innings. Urías struck out seven in the next game, and only allowed two runs, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> on a two-run homer by Brandon Belt in the 6th and that was all the Giants needed for a 2–1 victory. The Dodgers {{traveled to}} Chase Field for a road series against the Arizona Diamondbacks beginning on June 13. Former Dodger Zack Greinke struck out six over seven innings to beat his old team, 3–2. The Dodgers had two homers from Joc Pederson and solo shots by Justin Turner and Chase Utley as they evened the series with a 7–4 win the next game. A three-run homer by Scott Van Slyke accounted for all the Dodgers runs as the finished off the series with a 3–2 win. Kershaw struck out 11 in 7 innings to pick up his 10th win of the season.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Football League first {{introduced}} {{the use of}} a permanent third jersey on September 6, 1994 when the Calgary Stampeders wore black uniforms for the Labour Day Classic against the Edmonton Eskimos. The CFL did not have a rule for use of alternate uniforms and teams were able to wear them as often or as little as they liked, a rule that is still in effect today. Teams are also able to wear multiple alternate jerseys within the same season, as seen with the Montreal Alouettes during their 2009 campaign when they wore alternate black, blue, and throwback jerseys, in addition to their regular home and away uniforms. Teams are also permitted to wear their third jerseys as the away team, provided that they do not clash with the home team's uniforms. Despite teams having no restrictions with third jerseys, only the Stampeders chose to wear them during the 1990s, presumably due to the league's financial struggles during this decade. As such, no CFL USA team ever wore an alternate uniform. The Alouettes were the next team to introduce third uniforms in 2001 when they also wore black uniforms; a colour that {{was not part of the}} team's colour scheme. The Saskatchewan Roughriders first wore their black alternates in 2002 as it became more normal for teams to wear these jerseys. The BC Lions wore orange retro uniforms twice during the 2003 season as part of the celebrations for their 50th season, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>were</b> only worn for that season.|$|E
