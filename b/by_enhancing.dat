5|$|The {{majority}} of crustaceans are aquatic and the isopods {{are one of}} the few groups of which some members now live on land. The only other crustaceans which include a small number of terrestrial species are amphipods (like sandhoppers) and decapods (crabs, shrimp, etc.). Terrestrial isopods play an important role in many tropical and temperate ecosystems by aiding in the decomposition of plant material through mechanical and chemical means, and <b>by</b> <b>enhancing</b> the activity of microbes. Macro-detritivores, including terrestrial isopods, are absent from arctic and sub-arctic regions, but have the potential to expand their range with increased temperatures in high latitudes.|$|E
5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters {{can be found in}} nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects <b>by</b> <b>enhancing</b> the effects of GABA.|$|E

5|$|This {{approach}} {{demonstrates the}} effects of gender inequalities <b>by</b> <b>enhancing</b> macroeconomic models. Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously. That fails {{to account for the}} fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women. Stephen Knowels et al. use a neoclassical growth model to show that women's education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity, more robust than that of men's education. In both of these cases, economists highlight and address the gender biases of macroeconomic variables to show that gender plays a significant role in models' outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Mohammed Daoud Khan, in {{collaboration}} with the Parchamite PDPA and radical military officers, overthrew the monarchy and instituted the Afghan Republic in 1973. After Daoud's seizure of power, an American embassy cable stated that the new government had established a Soviet-style Central Committee, in which Karmal and Mir Akbar Khyber were given leading positions. Most ministries were given to Parchamites; Hassan Sharq became Deputy Prime Minister, Major Faiz Mohammad became Minister of Internal Affairs and Nematullah Pazhwak became Minister of Education. The Parchamites took control over the ministries of finance, agriculture, communications and border affairs. The new government quickly suppressed the opposition, and secured their power base. At first, the National Front government between Daoud and the Parchamites seemed to work. By 1975, Daoud had strengthened his position <b>by</b> <b>enhancing</b> the executive, legislative and judicial powers of the Presidency. To the dismay of the Parchamites, all parties other than the National Revolutionary Party (NRP, established by Daoud) were made illegal.|$|E
5|$|The nascent system tracked {{generally}} west-northwestward {{around a}} subtropical ridge to its north. Favorable outflow {{to the south}} counteracted moderate wind shear, though a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast disrupted the thunderstorm structure. Late on August14, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, naming it Goni. The storm slowly intensified and organized as it approached the Marianas Islands on August15. With diminished wind shear, rainbands were able to wrap tightly around the center. When Goni passed just north of Rota on August15, radar on Guam indicated a developing eyewall in the storm's core. At 18:00UTC on August15, the JMA upgraded Goni to a severe tropical storm, and further to typhoon status by the next day. The previously disruptive trough to the north soon aided the storm's intensification <b>by</b> <b>enhancing</b> its outflow, and other environmental conditions remained favorable. Consequently, Goni began a period of rapid deepening on August16. By early on August17, Goni reached an initial peak intensity; the JMA estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph), and the JTWC assessed higher 1-minute winds of 215km/h (130mph), derived from satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique. At the time, the typhoon had a small eye just 9km (6mi) in diameter.|$|E

5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia <b>by</b> <b>enhancing</b> calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
5|$|While the {{detection}} of Mups excreted by other animals has been well studied, the functional role in the producing animal is less clear. However, in 2009, Mups were shown {{to be associated with}} the regulation of energy expenditure in mice. Scientists found that genetically induced obese, diabetic mice produce thirty times less Mup RNA than their lean siblings. When they delivered Mup protein directly into the bloodstream of these mice, they observed an increase in energy expenditure, physical activity and body temperature and a corresponding decrease in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. They propose that Mups' beneficial effects on energy metabolism occurs <b>by</b> <b>enhancing</b> mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. Another study found Mups were reduced in diet-induced obese mice. In this case, the presence of Mups in the bloodstream of mice restricted glucose production by directly inhibiting the expression of genes in the liver.|$|E

40|$|In the {{southeast}} of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China, dragon spruce (Picea asperata) is a key species and widely used in reforestation processes in the area. The paper mainly studied the effects of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) on growth, physiology and nitrogen nutrition of 3 - and 6 -year-old dragon spruce seedlings. The experimental design included ambient UV-B (control) and enhanced UV-B (+UV-B, a 30 % increase). Enhanced UV-B significantly decreased growth, needle and root nitrogen concentration, needle nitrate reductase activity and increased UV-B absorbing compounds and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of two old dragon spruce seedlings. Glutamine synthetase activity was not affected <b>by</b> <b>enhanced</b> UV-B in two old dragon spruce seedlings. On the other hand, different old seedlings also exhibited different physiological responses to enhanced UV-B radiation. Chlorophyll content, carotenoids content and soluble protein content in 3 -year-old seedlings significantly reduced <b>by</b> <b>enhanced</b> UV-B, but those in 6 -year-old seedlings were not affected <b>by</b> <b>enhanced</b> UV-B. Proline content of 6 -year-old seedlings were increased <b>by</b> <b>enhanced</b> UV-B. Compared with the 3 -year-old seedlings, the 6 -year-old seedlings showed lower reduction of growth and MDA content, and accumulated more proline and UV-B absorbing compounds for protecting seedlings under enhanced UV-B. The results implicated that 3 -year-old seedlings were more sensitivity to enhanced UV-B than 6 -year-old seedlings...|$|R
