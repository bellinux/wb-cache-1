5|$|When NY812 {{was first}} assigned, it was locally {{maintained}} from NY126 in Croghan to NY3 in Diana and from NY3 in Pitcairn to NY58 in Fowler. The {{section of the}} route between NY126 and the Croghan village line was maintained by the village of Croghan; however, {{the rest of the}} two locally maintained sections were maintained by Lewis and St. Lawrence counties. Most of the Lewis County-owned section was co-designated as CR11; however, the short piece between the Croghan village line and Belfort Road was part of CR10. In St. Lawrence County, NY812 was overlaid on the existing CR73 from NY3 to Stone Road, CR99 between Stone Road and Balmat, and CR56 from Balmat to Fowler. The state of New York assumed ownership and maintenance of NY812 between Croghan and Diana on April1, 1980, as part of a highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> Lewis County that transferred NY194 to the county. Ownership of NY812 from Pitcairn to Fowler was transferred to the state on September1, 1982, as part of a highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> St. Lawrence County.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} the county-maintained portion of NY441 near its west end {{was transferred to the}} state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> Monroe County. A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June20. The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August28. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November26, 2007. The entirety of NY441 is now maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} New York assumed {{maintenance}} {{of most of}} the Ausable Chasm–Port Kent roadway at some point after 1920. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the entirety of the highway from Ausable Chasm to the Port Kent ferry landing was designated as NY373, {{despite the fact that the}} small portion of the route east of Lake Street in Port Kent was not maintained by the state at the time. On April1, 1985, ownership and maintenance of NY373 east of Lake Street was transferred from the town of Chesterfield to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> Essex County.|$|E
5|$|There are 21 {{counties}} in New Jersey. These counties together contain 565 municipalities, or administrative entities composed of clearly defined territory; 250 boroughs, 52 cities, 15 towns, 244 townships, and 4 villages. In New Jersey, a county {{is a local}} level of government <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> municipalities. County government in New Jersey includes a Board of Chosen Freeholders, sheriff, clerk, and surrogate (responsible for uncontested and routine probate), {{all of which are}} elected officials. Counties organized under the Optional County Charter Law may also have an elected county executive. Counties traditionally perform state-mandated duties such as the maintenance of jails, parks, and certain roads. The site of a county's administration and courts is called the county seat.|$|E

5|$|US44 {{originally}} {{entered the}} village of Millbrook via NY82, North Avenue, and Franklin Avenue. On April1, 1980, the state of New York assumed ownership of a highway bypassing Millbrook {{to the west and}} north as part of a highway maintenance swap <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> Dutchess County. The newly acquired roadway was designated as NY44A. On June5, 2007, NYSDOT announced that US44 would be permanently realigned onto NY44A. All shields along NY44A were replaced with US44 signage, and the NY44A designation ceased to exist. NYSDOT will continue to perform maintenance on US44's former routing through Millbrook. The portion of the routing that did not overlap NY82 is now NY984P, an unsigned reference route.|$|E
5|$|What became NY319 was {{originally}} built {{during the early}} 19th century as the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, one of many privately maintained turnpikes {{in the state of}} New York. The state of New York assumed ownership of the turnpike's routing in the early 20th century, and the Preston–Norwich state highway was designated as NY319 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Maintenance of NY319 was split <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> the city of Norwich, with the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) handling the part of the route west of the city limits.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} between 1935 and 1938, NY3 was {{truncated}} further to end at its junction with US104 in Hannibal. It was moved another half-mile (0.8km) {{to the east}} in the early 1960s following {{the completion of the}} super two bypass carrying US104 around {{the eastern edge of the}} village. NY3 continued to end at the super two until the early 1980s. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY3's former routing between the Cayuga County line and NY104 was transferred from Oswego County to the state of New York. One year later, on April1, 1981, the state assumed ownership and maintenance of the Cayuga County portion from that county. Both transactions were part of larger highway maintenance swaps <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> the two counties. NY3 was reextended westward to NY104A following the second swap.|$|E
