The results show that TV viewing biases social perceptions of body images; however, TV viewing does not impact men's consumption behavior. For women, in contrast, TV viewing increases the real–ideal self discrepancy, which, in turn, leads to consumption behavior {{in order to achieve}} ideal bodies. For both groups, TV viewing increases body dissatisfaction; also, general beliefs about <b>body</b> <b>images</b> influence related behavior.

5|$|Once {{patients}} {{reach their}} teens, {{they need more}} specific information about pregnancy, birth control, self-esteem, and dating. Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts. The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI, in terms of <b>body</b> <b>image</b> and relationships. Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy, adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs. They can benefit from sexuality counseling, support groups, and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers. With the right care and education from family and professionals, injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults.|$|E

5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects <b>body</b> <b>image,</b> either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E

The inference is that different visual-recognition processes are applied to images of males and images of females. This conclusion is unwarranted on empirical, methodological, and logical grounds...|$|R
40|$|Sigalit Landau is an {{international}} sculpture, video, installation, and performance artist, born in Jerusalem, and raised also in the USA and the UK. This study seeks to analyse Landau's unique body representation of figures made of papier-mâché, focussing on the installation “The Country. ” The point of departure {{of this study is}} a passage from the Platonic dialogue Timaeus, whose text strongly resembles Landau's succulent human images composed of soft bones, moist flesh, and sinews. This analogy then leads to a wider comparative discussion on the meanings of the body in Archaic and Classical aesthetic concepts in comparison with its postmodern meanings. In addition to the strong interest {{in the structure of the}} human body, another common concern of both the ancient <b>body</b> <b>images</b> and those of Landau is that both engage with death (thanatos). The premise underlying this study is that both the body and its implication of death in Ancient Greece, and Landau's <b>body</b> <b>images,</b> reflect metaphorically a political arena. However, while the political meanings of the ancient <b>body</b> <b>images</b> were constituted in manifestations of religion by means of purification, and were aimed at praising the homeland (polis), Landau's bodies manifest meanings of abjection, express political criticism, and are thus profane, reflecting loss of faith. Landau's loss of faith and sceptical spirit are inspired by two sources: the collective trauma of the Holocaust and the criticism of the occupation policy in her country. These two sources are main issues in many other works by Landau and are united in “The Country” installation, and particularly in the <b>body</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R

5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. <b>Body</b> <b>image</b> and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E
5|$|Robbins {{receives}} {{word that}} she has been given a grant to go to Malawi, and become a doctor there. In the end, Torres is shown to have accepted this as well and has decided to leave with Robbins. However, a fight at the airport results in Robbins leaving for Malawi without Torres, ending their relationship. She returns, hoping to rekindle her relationship with Torres, but is initially rejected. Eventually, Torres reveals that she is pregnant with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s baby. Robbins accepts the situation, and she and Torres restart their relationship. Torres gifts Robbins with a weekend getaway, and Robbins proposes to Torres. After proposing, the two get in a car crash leaving Torres in critical condition. A series of surgeries follows, including the delivery of her premature baby, along with emotional breakdowns of both Sloan and Robbins. Upon the awakening of Torres, she accepts her marriage proposal, and the two are married by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). As the fifth year residents are coming close to the end of their residency, Robbins urges Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) to work under her. At the end of the Grey's Anatomy (season 8), Robbins is hurt badly in a plane crash, resulting in her left leg being amputated. In the aftermath of the plane accident, in which Sloan and Lexie Grey were killed, the hospital is sued and eventually found guilty of negligence. Each victim including Shepherd, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), and Robbins herself must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurances refuse to pay. Those doctors and Callie buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Robbins is initially cold towards Callie because she was the one who decided for an amputation. She also struggles with <b>body</b> <b>image</b> issues, but they slowly reconcile as Robbins tries to adapt to her new life. When Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton) arrives at the hospital to reconstruct the face of a baby and flirts with Robbins, she is flattered that a stranger still finds her attractive despite knowing about her injury and the two have a one-night stand.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{recognizing}} gender from full <b>body</b> <b>images.</b> This problem has not been addressed before, {{partly because of the}} variant nature of human bodies and clothing that can bring tough difficulties. However, gender recognition has high application potentials, e. g., security surveillance and customer statistics collection in restaurants, supermarkets, and even building entrances. In this paper, we build a system of recognizing gender from full <b>body</b> <b>images,</b> taken from frontal or back views. Our contributions are three-fold. First, to handle the variety of human body characteristics, we represent each image by a collection of patch features, which model different body parts and provide a set of clues for gender recognition. To combine the clues, we build an ensemble learning algorithm from those body parts to recognize gender from fixed view <b>body</b> <b>images</b> (frontal or back). Second, we relax the fixed view constraint and show the possibility to train a flexible classifier for mixed view images with the almost same accuracy as the fixed view case. At last, our approach is shown to be robust to small alignment errors, which is a preferred property in many applications...|$|R

25|$|<b>Body</b> <b>image</b> {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people {{to live up to the}} standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s <b>body</b> <b>image,</b> some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> This is something that can lead to a change in a person's <b>body</b> <b>image.</b> Often, people who have a low <b>body</b> <b>image</b> will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E

40|$|The stigmatization and {{discrimination}} of obese persons is pervasive {{in almost any}} domain of living. At the explicit level, obese people {{are associated with a}} wide range of negative characteristics. Furthermore, research with the implicit association test revealed the implicit nature of the anti-fat bias. Building upon these findings, the present study used event-related brain potential recordings in order to assess key features of implicit processes. Participants viewed a series of schematic portrayals of anorexic, medium, and obese body shapes and tools. In a passive viewing condition, participants were asked to simply look at the stimuli and, in a distraction condition, participants were asked to detect a specific tool. Viewing obese <b>body</b> <b>images,</b> as compared to medium or anorexic <b>body</b> <b>images,</b> elicited a positive potential shift over fronto-central sites and a relative negative potential over occipito-temporal regions in a time window from ~ 190 – 250 ms. This evaluative brain response to obese <b>body</b> <b>images</b> was similarly pronounced while participants performed a distraction task. Thus, the findings suggest that the anti-fat bias may occur spontaneously, unintentionally, and independent of explicit processing goals. A troublesome picture is emerging in Western cultures suggesting that obese-ism may appear to be as inevitable as a reflex...|$|R

40|$|The artistic {{practice}} of Jan Fabre is characterised by an ardent desire to overthrow standardized <b>body</b> <b>images.</b> His theatre performances in particular bring this profound obsession with physicality and metamorphosis to the fore, as the bodies on stage generally {{appear to be}} {{in a constant state of}} transformation that defies any form of fixation and unsettles conventional expectations of what a body is or can do. In this contribution, we examine how this reconfiguration of <b>body</b> <b>images</b> takes shape throughout Fabre’s creative process in order to articulate the ideological underpinnings of both his aesthetics and artistic methods. Building on the emerging field of theatre genetics, we argue that the significance of Fabre’s work in terms of ideology can only be fully understood by acquiring deeper insight into the various preparatory stages that precede the actual showing of the performances. To substantiate this claim, we trace several decisive steps that typify Fabre’s creative processes, following a trajectory that goes backwards from the performances on stage, to the improvisations during rehearsals, to the various drawings that Fabre makes as a means of creating and thinking. At each of these levels, we discuss the particular strategies that Fabre develops to redraw bodily boundaries as well as their broader implications for the status of the body in contemporary society. Concluding this concise journey into Fabre’s aesthetic universe, we will find that at the core of his practice is a confrontation between <b>body</b> <b>images</b> and <b>bodies</b> without <b>image,</b> resulting in a transitional corporeality that refuses firm consolidation...|$|R
