50|$|In options trading, a <b>bear</b> <b>spread</b> is a bearish, {{vertical}} spread options strategy {{that can be}} used when the options trader is moderately bearish on the underlying security.|$|E
50|$|Because of put-call parity, a <b>bear</b> <b>spread</b> can be {{constructed}} using either put options or call options. If constructed using calls, it is a bear call spread. If constructed using puts, it is a bear put spread.|$|E
50|$|If {{a spread}} is {{designed}} to profit from {{a rise in the}} price of the underlying security, it is a bull spread. A <b>bear</b> <b>spread</b> is a spread where favorable outcome is obtained when the price of the underlying security goes down.|$|E
50|$|Moderately bearish' options traders usually set {{a target}} {{price for the}} {{expected}} decline and utilize <b>bear</b> <b>spreads</b> to reduce cost. While maximum profit is capped for these strategies, they usually cost less to employ. The <b>bear</b> call <b>spread</b> and the <b>bear</b> put <b>spread</b> are common examples of moderately bearish strategies.|$|R
50|$|Stock {{can make}} steep {{downward}} moves. Moderately bearish options traders usually set a target {{price for the}} expected decline and utilize <b>bear</b> <b>spreads</b> to reduce cost. This strategy can have unlimited amount of profit and limited risk when done correctly. The <b>bear</b> call <b>spread</b> and the <b>bear</b> put <b>spread</b> are common examples of moderately bearish strategies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bear</b> call <b>spread</b> and <b>bear</b> put <b>spread</b> are bearish {{vertical}} spreads constructed using {{calls and}} puts respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The Bear Call Credit Spread (see <b>bear</b> <b>spread)</b> is a bearish {{strategy}} {{and consists of}} selling a call option and purchasing a call option for the same stock or index at differing strike prices for the same expiration. The purchased call option is entered at a strike price higher than the strike price of the sold call option. The return calculation for the Bear Call Credit Spread position assuming price of the stock or index at expiration {{is less than the}} sold call is shown below: ...|$|E
5000|$|In options trading, a {{box spread}} is a {{combination}} of positions that has a certain (i.e. riskless) payoff, considered to be simply [...] "delta neutral interest rate position". For example, a bull spread constructed from calls (e.g. long a 50 call, short a 60 call) combined with a <b>bear</b> <b>spread</b> constructed from puts (e.g. long a 60 put, short a 50 put) has a constant payoff of the difference in exercise prices (e.g. 10) assuming that the underlying stock does not go ex-dividend before the expiration of the options. If the underlying asset has a dividend of x, then the settled value of the box will be 10+x. Under the no-arbitrage assumption, the net premium paid out to acquire this position should be equal to the present value of the payoff.|$|E
40|$|A superreplicating hedging {{strategy}} {{is commonly used}} when delta hedging is infeasible or is too expensive. This article provides an exact analytical solution to the superreplication problem for a class of derivative asset payoffs. The class contains common payoffs that are neither uniformly convex nor concave. A digital option, a bull spread, a <b>bear</b> <b>spread,</b> and some portfolios of bull spreads or bear spreads, are all included as special cases. The problem is approached by first solving for the transition density of a process that has a two-valued volatility. Using this process to model the underlying asset and identifying the two volatility values as σmin and σmax, the value function for any derivative asset in the class is shown to solve the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation. The subreplication problem and several related extensions, such as option pricing with transaction costs, calculating superreplicating bounds, and superreplication with multiple risky assets, are also addressed. Superreplication, subreplication, uncertain volatility, Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, transaction costs,...|$|E

40|$|After the September 11 attacks, {{several major}} newswires {{reported}} that there were insiders who tried to profiteer from the futures market {{in anticipation of the}} event. We use the Student’s t-statistics and several non-parametric statistics to test whether there was abnormal trading in S&P 500 (SPX) index options prior to the September 11 attacks. Our findings from the out-of-the-money (OTM), at-the-money (ATM) and in-the-money (ITM) SPX index put options and ITM SPX index call options lead us to reject the null hypotheses that there was no abnormal trading in these contracts prior to the September 11 attacks. We also find evidence consistent with three bearish speculation strategies, namely the Put Purchase strategy, the Put <b>Bear</b> <b>Spread</b> strategy, and the Naked ITM Call Write strategy. In addition, we conclude that there is evidence of abnormal trading in the September 2001 OTM, ATM and ITM SPX index put options immediately after the 9 - 11 attacks. We also employ the CBOE VIX to confirm the conclusion drawn from the call and put options. This, in turn, is consistent with insiders anticipating the 9 - 11 attacks...|$|E
5000|$|The iron condor is {{a neutral}} {{strategy}} {{and consists of}} a combination of a bull put credit <b>spread</b> and a <b>bear</b> call credit <b>spread</b> (see above). Ideally, the margin for the Iron Condor is the maximum of the bull put and <b>bear</b> call <b>spreads,</b> but some brokers require a cumulative margin for the bull put and the bear call.

5000|$|The iron {{butterfly}} is {{a neutral}} strategy {{and consists of}} a combination of a bull put credit <b>spread</b> and a <b>bear</b> call credit <b>spread</b> (see above). The iron butterfly is a special case of an iron condor (see above) where the strike price for the bull put credit <b>spread</b> and the <b>bear</b> call credit <b>spread</b> are the same. Ideally, the margin for the iron butterfly is the maximum of the bull put and <b>bear</b> call <b>spreads,</b> but some brokers require a cumulative margin for the bull put and the bear call. The maximum return generated for the iron butterfly is when the stock price is the same as when the position was entered. The return calculation for the iron butterfly position using the maximum margin of the bull put credit <b>spread</b> and the <b>bear</b> call credit <b>spread</b> and assuming price of the stock or index at expiration is the same as when the position was entered is shown below: ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull put <b>spread</b> with a <b>bear</b> call <b>spread.</b> The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a bull call <b>spread</b> with a <b>bear</b> call <b>spread</b> or a bull put <b>spread</b> with a <b>bear</b> put <b>spread.</b> Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|R

50|$|Many options {{strategies}} are built around spreads and combinations of spreads.

50|$|In 1993, Mary Hutton {{started a}} {{petition}} at her local shopping mall after witnessing on television {{the extraction of}} bile from an Asiatic black bear. The bear was in a coffin-sized cage with its bile being removed via an abdominal catheter. Within months she had thousands of signatures and regular supporters. In 1995, Free the Bears Fund was officially formed. The petition {{was presented to the}} Chinese Embassy in Canberra which evoked public and media interest. Mary Hutton continued to raise funds. During this time she was made aware of the dangers facing the sun bear. Mary was asked to help rescue and relocate some sun bears that had been taken from Phnom Penh restaurants. Her work with the <b>bears</b> <b>spread</b> to encompass multiple species including Asiatic black bears, sloth bears, and sun bears.

40|$|THE use of {{thyroid hormone}} in metastatic breast cancer was first {{reported}} about 70 {{years ago by}} Beatson (1896). He had combined the hormone with oophorectomy and obtained some good results. Many years later, in 1950 Loeser, a rather forgotten pioneer of modern endocrine therapy used thyroid hormone combined with androgens to treat metastatic cancer and independently as a prophylactic measure following radical treatment of breast cancer. There have also been many reports suggesting {{the existence of a}} causal relationship between the level of thyroid function and cancer, especially of the breast (Wilkins and Morton, 1963). Edelstyn, Lyons and Welbourn (1958) observed such an association during routine studies with 1311 performed before hypophysectomy. It was noted that patients in whom the disease was confinied to the chest wall and local glandular areas had consistently higher indices of thyroid activity as judged by neck uptake, urinarv excretion and protein bound 1311 levels, than those patients in whom blood <b>borne</b> <b>spread</b> had taken place. This finding has since been disputed by Reeve aind his colleagues (1961) ...|$|R
50|$|Andrographis paniculata grows erect to {{a height}} of 30-110 cm in moist, shady places.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to determine, the awareness, among individuals living in endemic area on the spread, symptoms, treatment and prevention of malaria. Materials and Methods: This is a cross sectional study, done among individuals, above 18 years, to determine their awareness on malaria. The subjects were interviewed at health exhibition counter and at the out-patient facility (as accompanying persons), of a tertiary medical facility, and the responses were documented and analysed. Actual patients were not interviewed to avoid any bias on the symptoms and treatment aspects of malaria. Results: A total of 278 adults were interviewed in this study, among which 232 (83. 5 %) subjects identified malaria as an infection, 4. 7 % of subjects did not know what causes malaria and 33 (11. 9 %) knew that it was non-bacterial infection. A total of 146 (52. 5 %) identified malaria as a mosquito borne disease. 95. 7 % (266) of subjects were aware of the major symptoms of malaria. 133 (47. 8 %) were of the opinion that malaria can be prevented by mosquito control and 211 (75. 9 %) believed that malaria is completely cured by timely and proper treatment. Among the study subjects 52. 5 % (146) were practising vector control measures at home. Conclusion: Majority of subjects interviewed were aware of malaria as a disease with mosquito <b>borne</b> <b>spread.</b> This shows that the efforts made by various organisations to educate the public on malaria have been effective. The community participation is not good enough to control malaria and its transmission as evidenced by the subject responses...|$|R
