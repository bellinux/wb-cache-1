5|$|The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished {{is a large}} painting, 399cm (13ft 1in) across. It {{depicts a}} {{defeated}} soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from {{the grip of the}} victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
25|$|Garrick was {{the first}} actor to be granted the honour of being buried in Westminster Abbey, in Poets' Corner next to the {{monument}} to William Shakespeare. Later Henry Irving, the first actor to be knighted, was buried <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same spot. Laurence Olivier was the third to be given that honour, in 1989.|$|E
500|$|When the five-year-old Pedro awoke on 7 April 1831, <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed lay his father's {{imperial}} crown. Pedro I and {{his wife}} had already left Brazilian soil and boarded the British frigate Warspite. Pedro II wrote a letter of farewell to his father aided by Mariana de Verna. On receipt of this, a tearful Pedro I composed a reply, calling the little boy [...] "My beloved son, and my Emperor." [...] His father and stepmother remained on board the Warspite another five days before leaving for Europe, but they did not see the young emperor during that period … or ever again. For the remainder of his life, Pedro I would become distressed upon his children's absences and fretted about their futures. Pedro II missed his father and stepmother (who had assumed his mother's role), and this may account for his later lack of any emotional display in public. In fact, the [...] "sudden loss of his family was to haunt Pedro II throughout his life". Three of his sisters stayed behind in Brazil with Pedro II: Januária, Paula and Francisca.|$|E
60|$|<b>On</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} morning {{there was something}} of a surprise. About eleven o'clock, while some of the lads were fishing, and Dave had Jessie out in a canoe, there came a shout from up the brook, and looking in that direction our hero saw Phil approaching, with his uncle <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> leaning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> youth's shoulder.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nay, tell me. Let us sit here." [...] And {{taking hold}} of his sleeve, she sat herself upon a mound, and made room for <b>him</b> <b>beside</b> her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass. With a half-laugh and a sigh he obeyed her, and there, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cliff, {{in the glow of}} the September sun, he took his seat at her side.|$|R
500|$|Æthelbald's {{rebellion}} {{was supported}} by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though {{they appear to have}} been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted [...] "in the western part of Selwood", and western nobles may have backed Æthelbald because they resented the patronage Æthelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that Æthelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think {{it is more likely that}} it was Wessex itself which was divided, with Æthelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, Æthelwulf holding the centre and east, and Æthelberht keeping the south-east. Æthelwulf insisted that Judith should sit <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser this was [...] "without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles".|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{control of}} the ship, the Major then reveals to Batou {{the truth about the}} gynoids. Hiring the Yakuza to traffick young girls, LOCUS SOLUS {{duplicated}} their consciousnesses into the gynoids, giving them human [...] "ghosts" [...] to make them more realistic. Batou rescues a young girl from a [...] "ghost dubbing" [...] machine, and she explains that Jack Walkson, learning the truth about LOCUS SOLUS, promised to save the girls by tampering with the ghosting process; this caused the gynoids to murder their owners, allowing Walkson to attract police attention and indirectly kill the Yakuza boss. Despite Walkson's actions saving the girls, Batou objects that he also victimized the gynoids as well, causing them severe distress by giving them damaged ghosts. Having solved the case, Batou asks the Major if she's happy now, and she notes that she'll always be <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> network, before disconnecting from the gynoid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{family members}} all played music. [...] Mr. Scruggs had played an open back banjo using the frailing technique, though {{as an adult}} Earl had no {{recollection}} of his father's playing. Mrs. Scruggs played the pump organ. Earl's siblings, older brothers Junie and Horace, and older sisters Eula Mae and Ruby, all played banjo and guitar. Scruggs recalls a visit to his uncle's home at age six to hear a blind banjo player named Mack Woolbright, who played a finger picking style and had recorded for Columbia Records. This made an impression on Scruggs, who said, [...] "He'd sit in the rocking chair, and he'd pick some {{and it was just}} amazing. I couldn't imagine — he was the first, what I call a good banjo player." [...] Scruggs then took up the instrument — he was too small to hold it at first and improvised by setting his brother Junie's banjo <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. He moved it around depending on what part of the neck he was playing. [...] After his father's death, Scruggs seemed to take solace in playing music, and when not in school or doing farm chores, spent nearly every spare moment he had practicing. His first radio performance was at age 11 on a talent scout show.|$|E
50|$|St. Cecilia's companions are {{identified}} {{in part by}} their attributes. Immediately to her right, John the Evangelist has an eagle, his usual symbol, peeking out around his robes. <b>Beside</b> <b>him,</b> Paul leans <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sword with which {{he had come to}} be identified in medieval art. Augustine of Hippo holds his crosier. Mary Magdalene holds the alabaster jar by which she is most commonly identified.|$|R
60|$|George {{was working}} in the summer fallow a few days after his return from Grant's homestead, when a man rode across the plowing and pulled up his horse <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> He was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole a {{handsome}} fellow, well mounted and smartly dressed, but there was a hint of hardness in his expression. George recognized him as the landlord of a hotel at the settlement.|$|R

2500|$|McCreight {{became friends}} with many Native Americans and Chief Wa-na-ta (Waanatan II) visited McCreight’s office {{regularly}} to smoke tobacco. [...] McCreight {{was impressed with the}} old chief’s dignity and bearing. “One day he signed that he wished a private interview, when he drew from his blanket a package which he exhibited as something he held more precious than any other treasure. [...] It was carefully wrapped in old newspaper, and after it had been divested of the strings and unrolled to be read, it proved to be the parchment or treaty with Government officials, his own name inscribed as head or Grand Chief. [...] Having thus established his old-day tribal office, he carefully refolded the document, wrapped it in the faded news sheet and returned it to the inner folds of his blanket, then nimbly squatted on the office floor, filled his pipe and enjoyed his usual half-hour smoke.” Chief Wa-na-ta’s smoking pipe was his most precious possession. “A titled English ranch-owner who knew of his importance in history offered any price that the old chief would name for the pipe and pouch, but the chief disdained to listen to any offer of money. [...] But when I squatted <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, where he was puffing meditatively on his long red-stone pipe, to tell him of leaving next week for a trip west, he arose instantly, untied his belt, laid both pouch and pipe across his left hand and extended it to me as a present and token to be preserved after he had passed to the long sleep.” [...] McCreight forever remembered the kindness and generosity of Chief Wa-na-ta.|$|E

60|$|As Dick was {{accustomed}} to go up a rope thirty feet high, hand over hand, without using his legs, he was confident that, with their assistance, he could get up to the main top, lofty as it was, and he at once threw off his jacket and started. He found the task harder than he had anticipated, {{but he did it}} without a pause. He was glad, however, when the two sailors above grasped him by the arms, and placed <b>him</b> <b>beside</b> them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main top.|$|R
6000|$|The {{cries of}} the foul birds awoke the two {{sleepers}} who stared about [20] them in bewilderment. The man staggered {{to his feet and}} looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his eyes. [...] "This is what they call delirium, I guess," [...] he muttered. The child stood <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> holding <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood.|$|R
5000|$|The deities at the Main Altar are Lord Sri Muniswarar Sri Ganesha and Lord Muruga. In {{front of}} the Main Altar stands Lord Muniandy majestically with an [...] "Arwaal" [...] (Sword) in one hand. There two white horses <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right and another <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left. There is also a dog. It is {{believed}} {{that he used to}} roam the areas at night after midnight on his white horse with an [...] "Aravaal" [...] and a cigar in his mouth, a turban on his head and attired like an ancient Indian prince. Many devotees who are gifted have seen his apparition, and one among them was a Chinese who saw him entering <b>the</b> temple compound <b>on</b> a white horse in full white Indian attire and was astounded by what he saw. After witnessing such an incident, the said Chinese assisted financially to build a small altar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> present site. The devotees whose vows are fulfilled make offerings or poojas according to their means. Some will offer [...] "prasatham", some offer live cockerel or goats, others sacrifice goats or cockerel and perform [...] "padayal". The non-vegetarian pooja/padayal is offered to [...] "Lord Muniandy".|$|R

5000|$|According to Diodorus Siculus Hanno and Bomilcar did {{not wait}} for {{soldiers}} from the countryside or their allied cities to arrive in order to attack Agathocles quickly. They raised an army of 40,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 chariots from the Carthaginian citizenry. [...] The numbers for the chariots given by Diodorus were probably much exaggerated. [...] Justin writes that the Carthaginian army numbered 30,000 men and mentions only Hanno as the general. [...] The Carthaginians approached Agathocles at his camp near White Tunis and assumed battle formations. Hanno commanded the right flank with the Sacred Band <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> Bomilcar was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left flank with a deep phalanx, because the terrain prevented him from extending his formation. They placed the chariots and cavalry in front, who were to strike the Greeks first.|$|R
60|$|The centre column {{advanced}} {{covered by}} Captain Cole's squadron of Lancers, to which I attached myself. At about seven o'clock we observed <b>the</b> enemy <b>on</b> a conical hill <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern {{slopes of the}} valley. Through the telescope, an instrument often far more useful to cavalry than field-glasses, {{it was possible to}} distinguish their figures. Long lines of men clad in blue or white, each with his weapon upright <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> were squatting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> terraces. Information was immediately sent back to Colonel Goldney. The infantry, eager for action, hurried their march. The cavalry advanced to within 1000 yards of the hills. For some time the tribesmen sat and watched the gradual deployment of the troops, which was developing in the plain below them. Then, as the guns and infantry approached, they turned and began slowly to climb the face of the mountain.|$|R
5|$|The video {{begins with}} scenes of Brown wearing a {{mirrored}} mask inside a giant birdcage, before {{switching to a}} dance routine in a smoke-filled, graffiti-covered parking garage. In between these scenes, the video shows a Step Up-type dance-off in the parking garage. When Brown raps his verse, he is seen standing next to Rhymes, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a red Brooklyn cap, and a white baseball jersey, which was the signature look of Mars Blackmon from the 1986 film, She's Gotta Have It. Rhymes then raps his verse after Brown's, standing <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> and later <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs in the parking garage. Wayne's verse soon follows after, with scenes of him rapping {{in front of the}} DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, and also on top of an ambulance car. The video also features cameo appearance from Kevin McCall, Diplo, Birdman and Mack Maine. Birdman and Maine appear when Lil Wayne is performing his verse.|$|R

6000|$|They {{had been}} {{treating}} their guard, I suppose, for {{they had a}} gaoler with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths <b>on</b> their hands. <b>The</b> two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their legs,--irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good understanding with them, and stood with them <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> looking <b>on</b> at <b>the</b> putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared {{as a matter of}} course, according to the mysterious ways of the world, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down with his invisible gun! ...|$|R

They grarsped our topical allusion {{as soon as it was}} across the foot-lights, so to speak. They were quite chafed at it. Of course, 'ad we reflected, we might have known that exposin' illuminated rockin'-horses to an army that was learnin' to ride on 'em partook of the nature of a double entender, as the French say--same as waggling the tiller lines at a man who's had a hanging in the family. I knew the cox of the Archimandrite's galley 'arf killed for a similar plaisan-teree. But we never anticipated lobsters being so sensitive. That was why we shifted. We could 'ardly tear our commandin' officer away. He put his head on one side, and kept cooin'.
