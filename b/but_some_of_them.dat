5|$|Overall, {{there are}} 126 {{speaking}} {{parts in the}} film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming. Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance. Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the movie. Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find the Schindlerjuden and fly them in to film the scene.|$|E

5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana outright. The factors which have led to this change are many, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, {{and the potential for}} state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although outright legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge rode into Abbeville, South Carolina on {{the morning}} of April 28. While there, Breckinridge and Brigadier General Basil W. Duke finally {{convinced}} Davis that further prosecution of the war was hopeless. Breckinridge was put in charge of the $150,000 in gold specie remaining in the Confederate treasury; traveling southward by rail toward Washington, Georgia, a group of soldiers in his military escort – unpaid for months – threatened to divide the gold among themselves before it could be captured by federal troops. Breckinridge convinced them to abandon their scheme after paying them their wages from the treasury, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> refused to escort Breckinridge and the bullion any further. Breckinridge's party arrived in Washington on May 4 and, after paying out several requisitions from the treasury, deposited the rest in banks there. He also composed a letter to his remaining deputies in which he disbanded the War Department.|$|E
5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{takes place}} on several worlds {{centered}} around a large tower, built by the Creator in ancient times (God in the Japanese version) to link worlds. There are four unique major worlds that make up different layers of the tower: the World of Continent at the base, the World of Ocean on the 5th floor, the World of Sky on the 10th, and the World of Ruins on the 16th. Time does not flow at a constant pace between levels of the tower, rendering some worlds more technologically advanced than others. Various monsters come forth from the tower into each world; many are hostile, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> are friendly to humans and willing to coexist. An offshoot {{of the human race}} (named mutants) also exists in each world; they are the magic-attuned descendants of a union between humans and the World of Continent's older races.|$|E

5|$|The crusaders {{agreed to}} help the King attack Lisbon, with a solemn {{agreement}} that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The Siege of Lisbon lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> set sail and continued to the Holy Land. Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped capture Santarém earlier in the same year.

5|$|The {{settlements}} were small, forming family based communities, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{were more}} sizable and functioned over many generations. They lacked artificial fortifications, but natural factors facilitating self-defense were often utilized. Such settlements could form small clusters separated by uninhabited areas. One rather large dwelling place, which functioned from the 2nd to the 4th century, was discovered and investigated in Osowo near Suwałki. The living quarters consisted of pillar supported houses, while the farming infrastructure area included eighty grain storage caves. Small fortified refuge areas were built {{to a limited}} extend beginning {{at the end of}} the 4th century, but on a larger scale fortified settlements were constructed by the Western Balts only during the Middle Ages.|$|E
