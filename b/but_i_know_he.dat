25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and he looked at me. And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} his father {{died of a heart}} attack or stroke, Favre decided to play in a December 22, 2003, Monday Night Football game against the Oakland Raiders. The Packers {{traveled}} to Oakland where Favre passed for four touchdowns in the first half and 399 total yards in a 41–7 victory over the Raiders on international television (even receiving applause from [...] "Raider Nation"). He completed 73.3% of his passes and finished the game with a passer rating of 154.9 with having recorded a perfect 158.3 rating with four touchdowns and over 250 yards passing by halftime (a feat accomplished by only four other passers in NFL history). Afterwards, Favre said, [...] "I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play. I love him so much and I love this game. It's meant a great deal to me, to my dad, to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> was watching tonight." [...] After the game, he went to his father's funeral in Pass Christian, Mississippi. Favre won an ESPY Award for his Monday Night Football performance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I say that? I don't {{remember}} now what I said, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> made me angry. Come, let us trot on. They {{can take the}} hounds home without us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{comes from}} Daddy--only <b>he</b> doesn't <b>know,</b> because <b>he's</b> a perfect saint; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> had a devil somewhere, or he couldn't be the saint he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did. Remembering Jake's theory, I {{saw it was}} {{possible}} {{he had come to}} push me off, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> hadn't. That's why I gave him my hand afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{perfectly}} wonderful!" [...] murmured Ruth. [...] "He just {{opens his}} mouth and the words come out. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was somebody, directly I saw him, by his forehead. Like a dome!" [...] Bailey mopped the dome.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Steve {{has been}} very good, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> had rather be with Kitty Van, so of course I feel like a marplot, though he is too polite to hint it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Oh yes,’ replied Julia; ‘good, {{punctual}} creature! I {{have not}} seen it more than once or twice, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> writes very badly and very large. These dear, wild young noblemen, you know, Overton—’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is quite}} safe," [...] said the princess, [...] "not that I count {{much on his}} fear, for he is as brave as a she-wolf with whelps, and fears nothing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> likes me." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Rosa was not there. She {{was a very}} regular attendant, but {{for some}} reason she was absent on this momentous afternoon. I did not say {{anything}} to him on the subject, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> felt this absence deeply.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I <b>knew</b> it! <b>I</b> couldn't {{hear what}} <b>he</b> said, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> spoke to you! Do {{you know who}} it was? It was Lord C., and he is Master of the Buckhounds! Tell me--what {{do you think of}} him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There must be {{some good}} in him," [...] she continued, [...] "even if {{he is such a}} desperate character; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> not The Oskaloosa Kid. Do you really suppose he robbed a house last night and then tried to kill that Dopey person?" ...|$|R
60|$|You {{blame me}} for writing his name at length: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is {{not ashamed of}} his name: and for you, though at the remotest rate, to insinuate it, must needs be damage to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Snipper the Crossbill," [...] replied Jumper promptly. [...] "I haven't {{seen him}} yet this winter, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> is here because only this morning I found some pine seeds {{on the snow}} under a certain tree." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> {{is a man}} of wit and parts; {{which if}} applied {{properly}} to the business of his function, instead of poetry, (wherein it must be owned he sometimes excels,) might be of great use and service to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} forget it," [...] Lucy {{said with a}} shudder. [...] "While I waited and {{wondered}} why he didn't come I thought the anxiety intolerable, but it was worse after we met Walters and the drunken guide. He wanted to join us, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was somehow to blame." ...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, Mulvaney seemed needlessly anxious; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> {{looked after}} Ortheris in a fatherly way.|$|R
6000|$|... "`Balls,' said master, `show him out, and--' {{he pulled}} up short, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> meant to say have {{an eye on the}} great-coats and umbrellas, so I showed the boy out, an' he went down-stairs, quite quiet, but the last thing I saw of him was performin' a sort of {{minstrel}} dance {{at the end of the}} street just before he turned the corner and disappeared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{go to her}} {{as soon as he}} {{will let}} me. I don't think he will forbid my going to her, perhaps, after a day or two; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> would not let me go on purpose to meet her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father is not there; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> wants you, dear, and I am sure {{he would}} rather {{see you in a}} home like this than in the place you came from. Now go and dress; but, tell me first, has it been a happy birthday?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{so fond of}} {{the captain}} and yet you don't seem to care what you say about him. I haven't been with him for seven years, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> isn't {{the sort of man}} that takes to drink. And then--why the devil should he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe he}} was, really. At least, he laughed {{when he read}} the thing. But he hauled me up after school {{and gave me a}} long jaw, and made me take all the lines I'd got to his house. He burnt them. I had it out with Merrett just now. He swears he didn't mean to get the thing spotted, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> did." ...|$|R
6000|$|While I {{was doing}} this {{the two men had}} talked to each other aside. [...] "He's alive, all right," [...] says I. [...] "That's a good job," [...] one of 'em said; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> didn't think so. [...] "We'll carry him up to our cottage. You'll be all the better for a sleep; it must be past two o'clock by this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Glad you saw {{and liked}} Lysaght. He has left {{in our house}} a most cheerful and {{pleasing}} memory, as a good, pleasant, brisk fellow with good health and brains, and who enjoys himself and makes other people happy. I am glad he gave you a good report of our surroundings and way of life; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> would, for <b>I</b> believe he had a glorious time--and gave one.[78] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear sir, {{you have}} so many {{advantages}} over poor Mr. Oldbuck, that no wonder it should put him a little out of humour; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> has much respect for your person and your conversation;--nothing would give him more pain than to be wanting in any real attention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> has come, {{and have}} heard of his narrow escape. I {{should have been in}} that train, if I had not been delayed by the indisposition which I then cursed, but now bless. Are you ready, Jean? Do you repent your choice, my child?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} stupid," [...] said Bessie, [...] "of {{none of those}} girls to have Uncle George to marry them. My aunt fancied he would be nervous, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> did marry a couple when Mr. Lifford was away; I mean him to marry me, as I told them all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was from}} the States. He pretended that <b>he</b> wasn't, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> differently. <b>He</b> got letters from America--I saw one of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{person who}} first {{suggested}} this travelling plan was our old physician, Dr. Mathews. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> exactly what <b>he</b> said about it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>I</b> {{had been studying}} too hard, and needed to [...] "let up" [...] for a while. And I'm sure, too, that he was quite positive that I would have no let up as long as I staid in the same town with the professor.|$|R
5000|$|... [...] "Everybody was {{crouched}} {{behind the}} furniture to surprise me, {{and he tried}} to. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> already <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A buck {{will fight}} {{sometimes}} {{and when he}} does he's as ugly as any critter on four legs," [...] said Jed Sanborn. [...] "I might have fixed him with my first shot only Shep bumped into me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> didn't mean to do it," [...] added the old hunter hastily.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met George Morton at the door, and {{chatted with}} him for several minutes. He appears quite ill, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> has gone two miles {{in the country for}} his mother this raw day; unless he is more careful of himself, he will ruin his constitution, which is none of the best now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Queen Dido for that. How the clergyman {{came into}} the secret I cannot tell--he is a very close man. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> will not hear of Miss Mowbray being married to any one, unquestionably because he knows that, in doing so, she would {{introduce}} disgrace into some honest family--and, truly, I am much of his mind, my lord." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> did {{expect a}} battle, {{by the way}} he came back and back again to embrace me and his child.|$|R
2500|$|Marr was the titular {{subject of}} the 2007 single [...] "Johnny Marr" [...] by the Canadian singer Carole Pope, {{formerly}} of the band Rough Trade. Pope described her inspiration and choice of Marr thus: [...] "I was actually getting nostalgic, which I never really do, about living on a certain street in Toronto in the '80s. The Smiths were the soundtrack of that time. I love [...] Morrissey, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> trouble." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{walked up}} and down the room, and her face was full of anxiety. I watched intently. At last a light knock was heard; she opened the door and a man came in. A small, slight, thin man, with a {{quantity}} of corn-coloured hair falling over his shoulders, and a pale, fair skin. He had blue eyes, and a little golden moustache. He looked hardly twenty, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was older.|$|R
