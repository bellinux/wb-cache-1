25|$|In 1977, Bush announces he {{will run}} for Congress to {{represent}} Texas' 19th district. At a barbecue, Bush meets his future wife, Laura Lane Welch. During a debate, Bush is criticized by his Democratic opponent, Kent Hance, who says that Bush is not a real Texan and has spent campaign contributions to throw an alcohol-fueled party for underage Texas Tech University students. <b>Bush</b> <b>does</b> poorly in the debate and loses the election, but with {{the highest number of}} votes for a Republican candidate in the state's history.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, McCain {{continued}} {{questioning the}} progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: [...] "Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers." [...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as <b>Bush</b> <b>does</b> now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.|$|E

[...] <b>Bush</b> <b>does</b> not indicate in his memoirs if Reese came aboard for the general election but adds that the Reese challenge [...] "toughened me up as a candidate.

5000|$|The Foundation and {{its members}} had also brought suit against Rod Paige, United States Secretary of Education from 2001 to 2005. This was over a keynote speech at a White HouseConference on Faith-Based and Community Initiatives in October 2002 where Paige said [...] "With the stroke of a pen, the President {{signaled}} that this Administration will knock down any barrier,will {{do whatever it takes}} to get people of faith and goodwill involved in helping solve some of the problems in our society today. Now, President <b>Bush</b> <b>does</b> this because he knows first-hand that power of faith to change lives—from the inside out. And the reason he knows this isbecause faith changed his life... He grew up in church, but like most of us, he didn’t always walk the walk. Many years ago, at a particularly low point in his life, he realized thatsomething was missing. Fortunately for him, he bumped into the Reverend Billy Graham. And they had a long, long, long conversation. And he made a decision coming out of that conversation that changed his life. And he believes that if it can change his life, it can change the lives of others as well. And that is why he is so committed to this. So the reason we’re all here today is not because some politician needs to knock off one more thing on his ‘to do’ list. We are here because we have a President, who is true, is a true man of God. A man who prays every day. And I think together, we can really make a difference for mankind, for Americans, we can make America a better place. We can, and I enjoyed the prayer, as we began, served, getting food. He said, if the Jews could be better Jews, and if Christians could be better Christians, if all of us could just be a little better ourselves, what a difference that would make in this world, what a difference that would make." [...] The Foundation {{and its members}} had held that this [...] "gave the appearance of endorsing religion." ...|$|E
