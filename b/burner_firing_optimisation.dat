The effect of dolomite clay on the fire-resistance and thermal properties of expandable graphite based Intumescent fire retardant coatings has been investigated by using Bunsen <b>burner</b> <b>fire</b> test and thermal gravimetric (TG) techniques. The current study describes the effects of Dolomite Clay on the heat shielding performance of intumescent passive fireproofing coatings during fire testing. The fire performance of dolomite clay reinforced intumescent coating formulations were evaluated by Bunsen <b>burner</b> <b>fire</b> test according to ASTM E- 119. Results showed that the dolomite reinforcement in IFRC formulation significantly reduced the steel substrate temperature up to 180 °C after 1 hour of fire exposure. The coating degradation was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The physical morphology and alignment of intumescent char residue were studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). TGA analysis revealed that IFD (8) containing 8 wt. % of dolomite clay enhanced residual weight by 37. 30 %. It is suggested that Dolomite clay can enhance the fire performance and can significantly affect the formation of dense and continuous char if incorporated as a filler in conventional intumescent fire resistive systems...|$|R

50|$|A {{single-ended}} recuperative (SER) burner {{is a type}} of {{gas burner}} used in high-temperature industrial kilns and furnaces. These burners are used where indirect heating is required, e.g. where the products of combustion are not allowed to combine with the atmosphere of the furnace. The typical design is a tubular (pipe) shape with convoluted pathways on the interior, closed on the end pointed into the furnace. A gas <b>burner</b> <b>fires</b> a flame down the center of these pathways, and the hot combustion gases are then forced to change direction and travel along the shell of the tube, heating it to incandescent temperatures and allowing efficient transfer of thermal energy to the furnace interior. Exhaust gas is collected back at the burner end where it is eventually discharged to the atmosphere. The hot exhaust can be used to pre-heat the incoming combustion air and fuel gas (recuperation) to boost efficiency.|$|R

The results of combustion tests on burning natural gas with different flue gas recycle rates are presented, with a particular emphasis on NO(x) production that might affect retrofitting of oxy-fuel technology in conventional boilers. The process and flame characterisation performed on natural gas provides a valuable set of experimental data for the technological development of oxy-combustion burner technology with recycled flue gas, especially in retrofitting scenarios. The data can be used to develop a better understanding of the chemical and physical phenomena involved in oxy-fuel combustion and can provide modellers with a valuable hint for the development of specific sub-models for oxy-combustion simulation. Since is seems technologically unfeasible to reduce down to zero the presence of nitrogen in recycled flue gases, due to air in-leakages, the presence of relatively small amounts of nitrogen in crucial location in the burner provides a thermal NO(x) source, depending on local levels of temperature and oxygen concentration.

40|$|To {{minimize}} oxides {{of nitrogen}} (NOx) emission, maximize boiler combustion efficiency, achieve safe and reliable burner combustion, {{it is crucial to}} master global boiler and at-the-burner control of fuel and air flows. Non-uniform pulverized fuel (PF) and air flows to burners reduce flame stability and pose risk to boiler safety by risk of reverse flue gas and fuel flow into burners. This paper presents integrated techniques implemented at pilot ESKOM power plants for the determination of global boiler air/flue gas distribution, wind-box air distribution and measures for making uniform the flow being delivered to burners within a wind-box system. This is achieved by Process Flow Modelling, at-the-burner static pressure measurements and CFD characterization. Global boiler mass and energy balances combined with validated site measurements are used in an integrated approach to calculate the total (stoichiometric + excess) air mass flow rate required to burn the coal quality being fired, determine the actual quantity of air that flows through the burners and the furnace ingress air.

40|$|Buoyant pool {{fires are}} {{representative}} of accidental and arson related fires resulting in extensive property damage and injury to people. Continued research in pool fires is needed to support technology based efforts to reduce fire losses. Motivated by this, a study of radiation and flow characteristics of two laboratory scale buoyant diffusion flames, mimicking pool fire behavior, was undertaken. ^ Radiation is the primary mode of fire spread in case of accidents. Temporally and spectrally-resolved radiation data from flames are critical for validation of numerical models for fire protection engineering. In the present work, time series of spectral radiation intensities were measured in a 7. 1 cm ethylene (C 2 H 4) pool fire. Both soot and gaseous species (CO 2 and H 2 O) significantly contribute to the radiation output. Autocorrelations and power spectral densities (PSD) of the radiation data reflect the 2 ̆ 2 puffing 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon typically observed in pool fires. ^ Stochastic time series models have been successfully applied to radiation calculations in momentum-driven jet flames in the past. Due to fundamentally different flow characteristics, previous time series models cannot be extended to pool fires. Therefore, a new model was developed to simulate radiation time series in pool fires. Autocorrelations, PSD and probability density functions (PDF) of the simulated radiation time series matched well with the measurements in the 7. 1 cm C 2 H 4 fire, thus validating the new model. ^ Understanding of fire flow fields is important since fire size, and hence the radiation output, {{is related to the}} fire induced flow field. Therefore, three-dimensional (3 D) velocities were measured in a 7. 1 cm methane (CH 4) fire. To the author 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge, these are the first simultaneous measurements of all three velocity components in a pool fire. Based on instantaneous measurements and mean squared velocity fluctuations, the fire flow field is inherently three dimensional. ^ Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology, is extensively used for simulating laboratory scale and realistic fires. Here, FDS was evaluated using data from the present 7. 1 cm CH 4 fire and linear slot <b>burner</b> <b>fire</b> data from the literature. Main findings of the numerical study were: (i) 3 D simulations are needed for accurate estimates of temperatures and velocities in slot <b>burner</b> <b>fires,</b> even with the two-dimensional (2 D) source geometry, and (ii) based on the agreement between calculated and measured velocity statistics, FDS can capture both mean and turbulence characteristics of 3 D velocity fields in pool fires. ...|$|R

The OEC technology is used in those industrial applications, which requires higher thermal efficiency, increased productivity, improved character of the flame, reduced equipment cost, lower volume of exhaust gases and improved product quality. Although this technology involves a number of advantages, it is appropriate to mention some of its disadvantages such as refractory damage, inconsistent heating, increased pollutant emission or flame disturbance and/or flashback.

40|$|A Precessing Jet (PJ) burner {{has been}} {{developed}} which enhances large scale turbulence {{by means of a}} naturally occurring fluid-mechanical phenomenon. A highly stable gas flame is produced without air swirl, quarl or a bluff body stabiliser. The resulting natural gas flame is lower in temperature and is more luminous than flames from many conventional burners so that it reduces NO x emissions while achieving almost total burnout of combustibles. The high luminosity indicates potential for increased fuel utilisation efficiency in process industries where radiation heat transfer is important. For one configuration of the PJ <b>burner</b> <b>firing</b> natural gas in an 18 MW industrial cement kiln, NO x emissions are shown to be reduced by 75 % with a simultaneous reduction in CO when compared with the original turbulent jet burner. Photographs of these flames show that the PJ burner produces a more rapidly spreading and more luminous flame. For another configuration, firing natural gas in a 25 kW laboratory furnace, the radiation spectra of the flame produced by the PJ burner are compared with a high quality commercial swirl burner. The mean radiation intensity produced by the PJ burner is some twenty times that of the commercial burner in the visible spectrum and the normalised fluctuating intensity is about 50 %, some five times that of the commercial burner in the visible range. Good potential for flame detectability is therefore apparent. Mean intensity is shown to increase by a factor of three with the addition of swirl to the air. G. J. Nathan, R. E. Luxto...|$|R
40|$|Porous burners offer {{attractive}} {{features such}} as competitive combustion efficiency, high power ranges, and lower pollutant emissions. In the present study, the thermal characteristics of a porous burner are numerically investigated {{for a range of}} operating conditions and design specifications within a practical range. The premixed flame propagation of a methane/air mixture in a ceramic porous medium is simulated through an unsteady, one-dimensional model. The combustion process is modeled using a suitable single-step chemical kinetics. The reaction location is not predetermined, thus the flame is allowed to float within the solid matrix or to run off from either side of the porous medium. The numerical results indicate that flame stability and thermal characteristics of the burner are strongly dependent on the inlet mixture specifications and the solid matrix structural properties. For a fixed value of the inlet firing rate, the combustion products temperature will increase by an increase in the inlet gas temperature, an increase in the matrix porosity, or by a decrease of the matrix pore density. Among the geometrical properties, the burner length has virtually no effect on the burner performance. An increase in the solid matrix porosity or <b>burner</b> <b>firing</b> rate will increase the efficiency of the preheating zone, while increasing the inlet gas temperature or matrix pore density will cause a reduction in this efficiency. Simulation results also suggest that in order to prevent flame blow-out or flash-back, critical values of the burner settings and design parameters must be avoided.

In this paper, we describe a methodology for front and rear paste selection and process optimisation. We explore the usage of HF dip (20 seconds) on finished cells to differentiate between over-fired and under-fired contacts.

Extensive data had been collected during the Fall of 1999 and Spring of 2000 using a single pulverized-coal (PC) burner, and this data collection was funded by a separate Department of Energy program, the Combustion 2000 Low Emission Boiler System (LEBS) project under the direction of DB Riley. This single-burner data was thus available for comparison with NOx emissions obtained while <b>firing</b> three <b>burners</b> at the same overall load and operating conditions. A range of operating conditions were explored that were compatible with single-burner data, and thus the emission trends as a function of air staging, burner swirl and other parameters will be described below. In addition, a number of burner-to-burner operational variations were explored that provided interesing insight on their potential impact on NOx emissions. Some of these variations include: running one burner very fuel rich while running the others fuel lean; varying the swirl of a single burner while holding others constant; increasing the firing rate of a single burner while decreasing the others. In general, the results to date indicated that multiburner firing yielded higher NOx emissions than single <b>burner</b> <b>firing</b> at the same fuel rate and excess air. At very fuel rich burner stoichiometries (SR < 0. 75), the difference between multiple and single burners became indistinguishable.
