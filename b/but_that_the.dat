5|$|About 18:00, Nedeljković {{received}} {{a telephone call}} from Simović and reported that Bosanska Dubica, Bosanski Novi and Prijedor had all fallen, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bridges on the Sava and Una would be demolished later that night, and that he and his remaining staff would be leaving at 20:00 for Jajce. By this time, Serb officers and soldiers were also deserting in significant numbers.|$|E
5|$|As Plato tells it, the heckler {{hails from}} the small island of Seriphus; Themistocles retorts that {{it is true that}} he would not have been famous if he had come from that small island, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heckler would not have been famous either if he had been born in Athens.|$|E
5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that, not only were conditions in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Jews were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war. Many Polish Gentiles concealed hundreds of thousands of their Jewish neighbors. Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of Saturday 23–24 January, the rebels met at the Mission church in Mbombwe, where Chilembwe gave a speech {{stressing}} {{that none of them}} should expect to survive the reprisals that would follow the revolt <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> uprising would draw greater attention to their conditions and destabilise the colonial system. This, Chilembwe believed, was the only way change would ever occur.|$|E
5|$|Following the problem-ridden limited {{electronic}} voting experiment of the 2008 municipal elections, the Ministry of Justice announced in January 2010 {{that there would}} be no {{electronic voting}} at this time, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ministry would be monitoring the international arenas for development of online voting.|$|E
5|$|However, most {{economic}} contractions reflect {{not that}} less {{can be produced}} <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> economy has started operating below the frontier, as typically, both labor and physical capital are underemployed, remaining therefore idle.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, an enquiry {{investigated}} the Fremantle Prison riot that {{occurred at the}} start of the year. The report suggested that little evidence supported the escape plan theory reported by the media, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> riot was largely the result of an incident of that morning involving the mistreatment of a prisoner and his subsequent release into Three Division yard.|$|E
5|$|In September, Jennifer Lucking of Walk With Me {{encouraged}} Canadians {{to write}} to their members of parliament {{to make sure that}} the promises outlined in the plan come to fruition.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain and the coastal forts, {{included}} Portland, received little attention. A 1623 survey reported that the castle was equipped with three culverins, nine demi-culverins and a saker, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fortifications had suffered badly from sea erosion and required extensive repairs. Fourteen years later, the castle had 15 guns and a garrison of a captain and 12 men.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} from several sources that Donnchadh made these grants on the {{condition}} that the Abbey of Paisley established a Cluniac house in Carrick, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Abbey did not fulfil this condition, arguing that it was not obliged to do so. The Bishop of Glasgow intervened in 1244 and determined that a house of Cluniac monks from Paisley should indeed be founded there, that the house should be exempt from the jurisdiction of Paisley save recognition of the common Cluniac Order, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Abbot of Paisley could visit the house annually. After the foundation Paisley was to hand over its Carrick properties to the newly established monastery.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people believe}} the urban myth that the daddy longlegs Opiliones {{have the most}} {{poisonous}} bite in the spider world, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fangs {{are too small to}} penetrate human skin. This is untrue on several counts. None of the known species of harvestmen have venom glands; their chelicerae are not hollowed fangs but grasping claws that are typically very small and definitely not strong enough to break human skin.|$|E

5|$|More recent investigations, mainly {{based on}} {{original}} medical {{reports from the}} period of the pandemic, found that the viral infection itself was not more aggressive than any previous influenza, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> special circumstances (malnourishment, overcrowded medical camps and hospitals, poor hygiene) promoted bacterial superinfection that killed most of the victims typically after a somewhat prolonged death bed.|$|E
5|$|Only certain traits may be {{required}} to deceive predators; for example, tests on the sympatry/allopatry border (where the two are in the same area, and where they are not) of the mimic Lampropeltis elapsoides and the model Micrurus fulvius showed that color proportions in these snakes were important in deceiving predators, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> order of the colored rings was not.|$|E
5|$|Peringskiöld {{commented that}} the stone was {{reclining}} backwards in a hop-garden at the eastern farm of Lövsta, which was later confirmed by Celius in 1726.

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
