40|$|The deep-pelagic zone (3 ̆e 200 m) is {{essentially}} boundless in 3 dimensions {{for most of}} its extent, structured only by fluid features of the seawater itself. However, near certain topographic features the deep-pelagic zone intersects the seafloor. The mid-ocean ridge system is by far the largest of these features. Unlike the ecosystems of the continental margins, the mid-ocean ridge systems do not receive terrigenous nutrient inputs. Thus, the deep-water fauna associated with mid-ocean ridges ultimately depend on the generally very limited local surface production. Despite this limited surface production, there is evidence that near-ridge demersal fish biomass is increased above the mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). To understand the dynamics of the MAR an international study, MAR-ECO, of the animals inhabiting the northern Mid-Atlantic was undertaken. Utilizing multiple technologies the meso-, bathy- and benthopelagic realms were sampled using pelagic and bottom trawls, ROV video and <b>bottom</b> <b>long-lines.</b> Taxonomic analysis to date has revealed at least 294 species (74 families, 22 orders), with ongoing analysis expected to reveal more species, some new to science. Pelagic sampling collected ca. 206 species, with typical orders dominating (e. g., Myctophiformes, Stomiiformes, Osmeriformes). Bottom trawling collected ca. 175 species, with typical demersal families (Alepocephalidae, Macrouridae, Ophidiidae, Moridae), but also pelagic families occurring in numbers higher than would be expected by contamination during deployment and retrieval alone. Discrete, near-bottom pelagic trawls confirmed this observation. In all, 84 species were caught in both pelagic and bottom trawls, with some species showing enhanced abundances in the near-bottom boundary layer, suggesting that overlap of deep-pelagic and demersal faunas is likely a key process regulating mid-ocean ridge community structure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} spillover (biomass export) around 6 marine protected areas (MPAs) {{in the western}} Mediterranean based on catch and effort data from artisanal fisheries. The selected MPAs were Cerbère-Banyuls and Carry-le-Rouet in France, and Medes, Cabrera, Tabarca, and Cabo de Palos in Spain. These MPAs had been functional for more than 8 yr and incorporate areas of fisheries closure and restricted use where fishing is limited. We based our study on the hypotheses that, {{in the presence of}} biomass export, (1) fishing effort would concentrate close to MPA boundaries, and (2) fishery production, expressed as catch per unit area (CPUA), would be highest near MPA boundaries and decrease with distance. We selected data from 14 ‘fishing tactics' using gill nets, trammel nets and <b>bottom</b> <b>long-lines</b> targeting sparids, mullids, serranids, scorpaenids and palinurids. We analyzed the spatial distribution of effort, fishery production and revenues per unit area, using generalized additive models (GAMs), and we tested regression slopes of effort density and CPUA with distance to closure boundaries, using generalized linear models (GLMs). GAMs allowed us to recognize habitat discontinuities or ‘hot spots' of high production {{in the vicinity of the}} MPAs, and to identify the extent of potential spillover effects in order to implement GLMs. We found evidence of effort concentration and high fishery production near fisheries closures for all fishing tactics analyzed and significant negative slopes for most. Revenues generally followed trends similar to CPUA. Significant negative slopes from GLM of effort density and CPUA with distance from fisheries closures were indicative of biomass export where habitats across closure boundaries had some degree of continuity. The spatial extent of spillover was consistent with species mobility and fisheries efficiency and extended 700 to 2500 m from fishery closure boundaries. Our results suggest that coastal MPAs can be an effective management tool for artisanal fisheries in the region and can be extended to the rest of the western Mediterranean, as the fishing tactics studied are typical of the regio...|$|E
40|$|IRD, Noumea reportAbstract : Biology {{and ecology}} of {{spangled}} emperor, Lethrinus nebulosus (Forsskål), in New Caledonia. The present {{work is a}} synthesis of the knowledge cumulated over {{the last twenty years}} on the biology and ecology of spangled emperor, Lethrinus nebulosus (Forsskål), in New Caledonia, augmented with new information on its population genetics, to establish the bases for rational resource management. Spangled emperors were captured in the northern and southwestern lagoons of Grande Terre and in the Ouvea lagoon, mainly using hand-lines, <b>bottom</b> <b>long-lines,</b> trawls and rotenone poisoning. In total, 2975 fishes were examined for length, weight, sex and gut content. Females were larger than males by 5 cm on average. The longest specimen caught was 69. 5 cm FL and the heaviest weighed 5. 5 kg. In Ouvea, sizes were smaller than in the southern lagoon or the Northern Province. Average size increased with distance to the coast, depth, coral cover and hard-substrate cover, but diminished with algal cover. The largest fishes were caught at 30 - 40 m. For a given size, individuals were lighter in the Northern Province than in Ouvea or the southern lagoon. For a given size, individuals were heavier in May- July, that is, before reproduction. Growth was nearly linear until first reproduction, occurrngi at 4 - 5 years of age. In the southern lagoon, spangled emperors ate more fish, crustaceans and echinoderms, while they ate more mollusks in Ouvea and the Northern Province. Diet varied with individual size but heterogeneously across regions. The proportion of full stomachs decreased in September-October, that is, during the reproductive period. Sex-ratio was 58 % females, increased with size (70 % females at FL > 60 cm) and varied with regions. First reproduction took place at 35 - 45 cm FL and seemed to occur earlier in Ouvea. Samples from the northern and southern lagoons and Ouvea were analysed at the mitochondrial locus (nucleotide sequences of the control region and SSCP analysis of a fragment of 16 S rDNA) and at three intron loci. No genetic heterogeneity was detected. The biological and ecological differences observed between those three geographic sites therefore could be ascribed to phenotypic plasticity, but they nevertheless allowed the distinction of three stocks. Catches were the most important in Ouvea, in terms of either number, weight, or proportion of total catch; bottom long-line catches were more important in the southern lagoon than in the Northern Province; trawl catches indicated an absence of spangled emperor juveniles on soft bottoms, although rotenone catches and visual observations underwater demonstrated the importance of shallow sea-grass and algal beds, as well as rubble, for juveniles. Spangled emperors amount to less than 1 % of the total fish biomass or density, except on mid-lagoon soft bottoms where their biomass was 3. 5 % of the total. Spangled emperor stocks may well reach around 10 000 tons for the entire New Caledonia - Loyalty region (the Chesterfield area excluded). Spangled emperors might well be over-exploited in those areas which have the highest human densities (i. e. southern lagoon and West coast) ...|$|E

40|$|Dasyatis guttata {{has been}} target of artisanal {{fisheries}} in {{the coast of}} Bahia (Northeast Brazil) mainly by “arraieira” (gillnet) and “grozeira” (<b>bottom</b> <b>long-line),</b> but until {{now there is no}} stock assessment study. One of the important data for this knowledge is reliable indices of abundance. The aims of the present work are to: (1) estimate the best predictor for relative abundance (catch-per-unit-of-effort, CPUE), examining whether catch (production – kg) was related to: soak time of the gear, size of the gillnet or number of hooks, applying generalized linear model (GLM); (2) estimate the annual CPUE (kg/hooks and kg/m) averaged by gear; and (3) assess the temporal CPUE variance. Based on monthly sampling between January 2012 and January 2013, 222 landings by grozeira and 76 by arraiaiera were recorded in the two landing sites in Todos os Santos Bay, Bahia. A total of 14, 550 kg (average = 44 kg/month) of D. guttata was captured. Models for both gears were highly significant (P < 0. 0001). The analysis indicated that the most appropriate variable for CPUE analysis was the size of the gillnet (P < 0. 001) and the number of hooks (P < 0. 0001). Soak time of the gear was not significant for both gears (P = 0. 4). High residual deviance expresses the complexity of the relations between ecosystem factors and other fisheries factors affecting relative abundance, which were not considered in this study. The average CPUE by grozeira was 6. 39 kg/ 100 hooks ± 8. 89 and by arraieira, 1. 47 kg/ 100 m ± 1. 66 over the year. Kruskal-Wallis test showed effect of the month on the mean grozeira CPUE (P = < 0. 001), but no effect (P = 0. 096) on the mean arraieira CPUE. Grozeira CPUE values were highest in December and March, and lowest between May to Augus...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{artificial}} bait for <b>bottom</b> set <b>long-line</b> fishing, test baits were made by combining certain chemicals, and food materials such as fishmeal, etc., using a hydrophilious high polymer as the combiner or supporting material. Their efficiency in catching fish was tested in field experiments. A preliminary field experiment was at first conducted to find the textural or tactile effects of the polymer by covering pieces of squid muscle with a thin membrane of hydrophilious polymer. The catch rate of the squid bait with the polymer membrane {{was as good as}} that without the membrane. A total of six test baits were prepared. Of these, R-V was the most efficient. The catch rate of the R-V was about 1. 6 times that of the control squid bait, whereas those of the other five baits were all less than that of the control. The R-V contained alanine, betaine and glycine in addition to other components. Thus, it was most likely that some of the above three chemicals were effective alone or synergistically with other components in stimulating feeding behavior. There was a considerable species selectivity for the R-V, Coclorhynchus japonicus>Deania eglantina>Hozukius embremarius respectively being the speices with the best catch rates. The catch rates of the R-V for these three species relative to those of the squid bait were 3. 4, 2. 2 and 0. 7 respectively. Analyses of the bait loss and numerous gnawed marks on the returned baits suggested that the R-V is an appealing food for scavengers also. In the laboratory, a scavenger Bathynomus döderleini actually ate it...|$|R
40|$|Rockfish (Sebastes spp.) biomass is {{difficult}} to assess with standard bottom trawl or acoustic surveys because of their propensity to aggregate near the seafloor in highrelief areas that are inaccessible to sampling by trawling. We compared {{the ability of a}} remotely operated vehicle (ROV), a modified bottom trawl, and a stereo drop camera system (SDC) to identify rockfish species and estimate their size composition. The ability to discriminate species was highest for the bottom trawl and lowest for the SDC. Mean lengths and size distributions varied among the gear types, although a larger number of length measurements could be collected with the bottom trawl and SDC than with the ROV. Dusky (S. variabilis), harlequin (S. variegatus), and northern rockfish (S. polyspinis), and Pacific ocean perch (S. alutus) were the species observed in greatest abundance. Only dusky and northern rockfish regularly occurred in trawlable areas, whereas these two species and many more occurred in untrawlable areas. The SDC was able to resolve the height of fish off the seafloor, and some of the rockfish species were observed only near the seafloor in the acoustic dead zone. This finding is important, in that fish found exclusively in the acoustic dead zone cannot be assessed acoustically. For these species, methods such as <b>bottom</b> trawls, <b>long-lines,</b> or optical surveys using line transect or area swept methods will be the only adequate means to estimate the abundance of these fishes. Our results suggest that the selection of appropriate methods for verifying targets will depend on the habitat types and species complexes to be examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − A {{total of}} ten Heptranchias perlo, eight Deania histricosa, two D. calcea, and two D. profundorum from the Great Meteor Bank, central East Atlantic, were studied for cestodes. The {{elasmobranchs}} were caught using <b>bottom</b> trawl or <b>long-lines</b> during September 1998 in 298 – 1075 m water depth. Seven different cestode species were found: Tentacularia coryphaenae, Deanicola minor, D. protentus, Grillotia meteori sp. nov., Grillotia cf. microthrix (Trypanorhyncha), Crossobothrium dohrnii, and Crossobothrium sp. (Tetraphyllidea). T. coryphaenae occurred encapsulated {{in the stomach}} wall and all other species were found within the host intestine. G. meteori sp. nov. and G. cf. microthrix additionally infested the musculature {{as well as the}} stomach and intestinal wall. D. profundorum harboured five different cestode species and D. histricosa, H. perlo, and D. calcea were infested with four, three and two species, respectively. With 332 and 181 specimens, D. minor and G. cf. microthrix were the most abundant cestodes. Grillotia meteori sp. nov., Crossobothrium sp., and C. dohrnii were host specific for Deania profundorum, D. histricosa and H. perlo, respectively. The other species were found in more than one elasmobranch, with Deanicola minor and D. protentus restricted to Deania sp. Most parasites are recorded for the first time from the central East Atlantic around the Great Meteor Bank...|$|R
