50|$|A camper shell (also canopy, and {{sometimes}} topper, cap, bed cap, <b>box</b> <b>cap,</b> or simply shell) {{is a small}} housing or rigid canopy used as a pickup truck or coupe utility accessory. The housing is usually made of fiberglass or aluminum, but sometimes wood, and is mounted atop the pickup truck's rear bed. It usually covers the entire bed of the pickup truck, and {{is large enough to}} be used for camping purposes. Even though use for camping may have been its initial purpose, it now seems most often to be used for utility and storage purposes - particularly the protection of cargo from the elements and theft. Some camper shells are so large that they can overlap the top of the truck's cab, and some called soft-tops are made of canvas like convertibles.|$|E

Surprisingly, however, in 2007 / 08 it managed to more than halve its amber box {{compared with that of}} the previous year, easily achieving the reduction targets being touted in the Doha Round. This was largely due to a change in the calculations for fresh fruits and vegetables. These had been linked to the entry price system, which was not affected by the 2008 fruit and vegetables reform.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a fast and sensitive method to automatically discover representation models for functional sites within DNA sequences. In the method, functional sites are represented as a stochastic model called hidden Markov model (HMM) [1] whose network topology is left-to-right. HMM has some advantages of description over conventional representation models such as weight matrix [2] and regular expression [3]. The method consists of the following steps (Fig. 1) : (1) selection of signi cant subsequences; (2) classi cation of the subsequences into groups of functional sites; (3) assignment of characteristic base length for each group; (4) determination of HMM for each group. We have applied the method to automatic discovery of hidden Markov representations for functional site within human promoter sequences. The method discovered 40 representation models with characteristic base lengths. Some of them corresponded to TATA box (Fig. 2), CAAT box (Fig. 3), GC <b>box,</b> <b>Cap</b> site, CT signal, Octamer, B and ATF. To validate the method, we have applied the models to recognition of functional sites within the promoter sequences. As results, recognition accuracy of TATA, CAAT and GC box were 85. 4, 75. 8 and 77. 2 %, respectively. This indicates that good representation models for functional sites has been obtained by the method. DNA sequence...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews recent {{development}} of China’s agricultural domestic support policy, especially {{the switch from}} taxing farmers and agriculture to providing direct subsidies to grain production and purchased inputs. A model-based quantitative analysis {{on the effects of}} these policy changes has been conducted. Simulation results suggest that recent policy changes likely have positively addressed the declared policy objectives in increasing grain production and boosting farm income. Much of the increase in grain production and farm income can be attributed to land reallocation to grain production, cheaper inputs, and extra agricultural employment triggered by the policy changes. Judging from the rural-urban and west-east income gaps in China, the diminishing share of agriculture in China’s economy, and the current political environment, it is expected that the tax cut will be permanent and that government assistance to agriculture and farmers will continue and rise. Two hypothetical future scenarios are simulated. If China uses up all its WTO de minimis support allowances and an assumed Blue <b>Box</b> <b>cap</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} its current practices, increased grain production, changing trade pattern seemingly contrary to China’s comparative advantage, increased rural employment, and significantly higher farm income (over 16 %) will be expected. If alternative, decoupled payments are provided, China’s agricultural production and trade will remain unchanged, rural employment stays stable. But as a way of transferring income, the decoupled payments will be more efficient. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a factor (PO-B), detected {{in a number}} of mammalian cell lines, binds specifically between the TATA box and the transcription initiation site of the pituitary-specific pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene.

Mutation of the PO-B binding site significantly decreased the transcriptional activity of the POMC promoter after transient transfection into the ATt- 20 mouse pituitary tumor cell line and also in in vitro transcription assays. In contrast, mutation of the TATA box produced no overall decrease in transcription in vivo but induced multiple heterogeneous start sites in vitro.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the transcriptionally divergent promoters of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) open reading frames (ORFs) 28 and 29, encoding the DNA polymerase and major DNA-binding proteins, respectively, was performed. We found that the 221 -bp ORF 28 - 29 intergenic domain contains overlapping divergent promoters; these promoters have TATA <b>boxes</b> and <b>cap</b> sites arranged closely back-to-back, have highly concordant patterns of responsiveness to transactivation by VZV ORFs 4 and/or 62, and could not be separated without abolishing the effects that VZV trans activators imparted to them. Mutation of the ORF 28 TATA box rendered this promoter unresponsive to ORF 62 and the combination of ORFs 4 and 62 without altering ORF 29 promoter activity. Mutations of all potential ORF 29 TATA boxes collectively failed to abolish this promoter's responsiveness to either ORF 4 or ORF 62, suggesting a mechanism of gene regulation for ORF 29 that differs from that of ORF 28. These findings are concordant with the observation that both genes are expressed in productive infection, but only ORF 29 expression has been identified in latency...|$|R
40|$|To map the polyomavirus large T antigen binding {{sites on}} the viral genome we {{employed}} a quantitative immunoassay.

This fragment exhibits several singular features, and in particular, two successive potential <b>capping</b> <b>boxes,</b> T 3 xxQ 6 and D 8 xxE 11. The former corresponds to the native hydrogen bond network stabilizing the alpha helix N-terminus in the protein; {{the latter is a}} non-native <b>capping</b> <b>box</b> able to break the helix at residue D 8, and is observed in the domain 2 partially folded state. Using 2 D-NMR techniques, we showed that two main populations of conformers coexist in aqueous solution. The first corresponds to a single helix extending from T 3 to K 17. The second corresponds to a broken helix at residue Ds. Four mutants, T 3 A, F 7 A, D 8 A, and E 11 A, were designed to further analyze the role of key amino acids in the equilibrium between the two ensembles of conformers. The sensitivity of NMR parameters to account for the variations in the populations of conformers was evaluated for each peptide. Our data show the delta 13 Calpha chemical shift to be the most relevant parameter. We used it to estimate the population ratio in the various peptides between the two main ensembles of conformers, the full helix and the broken helix.

40|$|The equine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (EHV- 1) immediate-early (IE) and EICP 0 proteins are potent trans-activators of EHV- 1 promoters; however, in transient-transfection assays, the IE protein inhibits the trans-activation {{function of}} the EICP 0 protein. Assays with IE mutant proteins revealed that its DNA-binding domain, TFIIB-binding domain, and nuclear localization signal may be important for the antagonism between the IE and EICP 0 proteins. In vitro interaction assays with the purified IE and EICP 0 proteins indicated that these proteins interact directly. At late times postinfection, the IE and EICP 0 proteins colocalized in the nuclei of infected equine cells. Transient-transfection assays showed that the EICP 0 protein trans-activated EHV- 1 promoters harboring only a minimal promoter region (TATA <b>box</b> and <b>cap</b> site), suggesting that the EICP 0 protein trans-activates EHV- 1 promoters by interactions with general transcription factor(s). In vitro inter-action assays revealed that the EICP 0 protein interacted directly with the basal transcription factors TFIIB and TBP and that the EICP 0 protein (amino acids [aa] 143 to 278) mediated the interaction with aa 125 to 174 of TFIIB. Our unpublished data showed that the IE protein interacts with the same domain (aa 125 to 174) of TFIIB and with TBP. Taken together, these results suggested that interaction of the EICP 0 protein with the IE protein, TFIIB, and TBP may mediate the antagonism between the IE and EICP 0 proteins.
