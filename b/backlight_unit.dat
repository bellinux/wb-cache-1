5000|$|This is a {{technique}} for expanding the contrast of LCD-screens. LCD-screens comprise a <b>backlight</b> <b>unit</b> which is permanently emitting light and an LCD-panel {{in front of it}} which modulates transmission of light with respect to intensity and chromaticity. In order to increase the contrast of such LCD-screens the backlight can be (globally) dimmed when the image to be displayed is dark (i.e. not comprising high intensity image data) while the image data is numerically corrected and adapted to the reduced backlight intensity. In such a way the dark regions in dark images can be improved and the contrast between subsequent frames can be substantially increased. Also the contrast within one frame can be expanded intentionally depending on the histogram of the image (some sporadic highlights in an image may be cut or suppressed). There is quite some digital signal processing required for implementation of the dynamic contrast control technique {{in a way that is}} pleasing to the human visual system (e.g. no flicker effects must be induced).|$|E

40|$|The optical simulation, analysis, {{and design}} of <b>backlight</b> <b>units</b> (BLU) of liquid crystal displays, using ASAP optical {{modeling}} software, are introduced in this article. Two major types of BLU, i. e. edge lighting and bottom lighting, and their respective optical components are reviewed. The concerns in optical design of those components, namely the light guide in edge lighting BLU and the diffusion and reflection sheets in the bottom lighting BLU, are discussed. A scattering pattern is usually screen printed under the light guide, on which smaller scattering dots are sparsely located near the light sources while larger scattering dots are more densely distributed away from the sources. A diffusion sheet can be a Lambertian surface or with more sophisticated bidirectional reflection distribution function. The cross section of a reflection sheet {{may look like a}} parabolic curve that can be optimized. The structure of ASAP consists of the pre-processor that creates models and specify optical properties, the processor that calculates optical interactions, and the post-processor that retrieves and manipulates data for more analyses. The general procedure of ASAP analyses and optimizations of both types of BLU is introduced. The ASAP scripting language is powerful enough in optimizing the shape and dimensions of the BLU optical components fore mentioned. Finally the results of a case study of the design analysis for equal irradiance in a bottom lighting BLU are given to depict how the ASAP scripting language is applied to obtain the optimal locations for lamps. ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there is}} an evident trend of ever-thinner and {{intricate}} opto-electronic package and devices, which brings about severer thermal issues as well as unprecedented challenges for the thermal design. Not only thickness of opto-electronic package itself will raise the peak temperature and pose a potential risk to electronic devices, but also the limited-space and interacted opto-electro-thermo-mechanical properties restrict the use of traditional active thermal management means and precise estimation of cooling performance. This dissertation aims to numerically and experimentally analyze thermal behaviors of various LED package configurations while thinning {{it as well as}} apply novel radiation coating and packaging materials to cooling electronic devices with limited-space. What’s more, an opto-thermal coupled numerical method in the application of LED was discussed. Last but not the least, much faster Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were adopted to predict patterns for cooling performance of our thermal radiation coating in Li-ion battery system and acceleration stage before the onset of thermal runaway, which is the key to cut-off the battery before explosion.

Continuous innovation and improvement of {{packaging materials}} have been introduced to improve the overall efficiency of LEDs, {{but there are still}} some critical issues need to be addressed for their application in general lighting and LCD backlight displays. In this work, dual-functional silicone-filler composites are investigated and introduced to LEDs and LCD <b>backlight</b> <b>units</b> to enhance their optical and thermal management. In {{the first part of this}} work, we optimized the reflectance of polymer-filler reflectors by controlling filler particle size, filler volume fraction and thickness of reflectors. A simple analytical model was developed to investigate the critical parameters of inorganic fillers required to obtain the highest reflectance, which is expected to accelerate the design and optimization of polymer-filler composite reflectors. Our results demonstrate for the first time that for inorganic fillers, the effect of filler size on reflectance is non-monotonic, and a critical filler size ranging from one submicron to several microns provides the maximum reflectance. The existence of a critical thickness at which the optical reflectance of a polymer-filler composite reaches its maximum value is demonstrated. In the second part of this work, the apparent radiation cooling effect of silicone-based composite coatings was investigated for its dependence on coating thickness and filler size. It is established, contrary to prior reports, that the effective passive radiation cooling does not exhibit a significant filler size dependence. We found the apparent cooling effect is filler type dependent and the optimal thickness is around 70 µm regardless of filler type. In the third part of this work, dual-functional polymer-filler composites with high optical diffusive reflectance and passive cooling ability is investigated for optoelectronic device applications. It was demonstrated the addition of inorganic fillers to a volume fraction higher than 0. 2 can effectively improve the apparent cooling effect and light reflectance of silicone composites.

40|$|Capillary-pumped loops (CPL's) are {{devices that}} are used to {{transport}} heat from one location to another [...] specifically to transfer heat away from something. In low-gravity applications, such as satellites (and possibly the International Space Station), CPL's are used to transfer heat from electrical devices to space radiators. This is accomplished by evaporating one liquid surface on the hot side of the CPL and condensing the vapor produced onto another liquid surface on the cold side. Capillary action, the phenomenon that causes paper towels to absorb spilled liquids, is used to "pump" the liquid back to the evaporating liquid surface (hot side) to complete the "loop. " CPL's require no power to operate and can transfer heat over distances as large as 30 ft or more. Their reliance upon evaporation and condensation to transfer heat makes them much more economical in terms of weight than conventional heat transfer systems. Unfortunately, they have proven to be unreliable in space operations, and the explanation for this unreliability has been elusive. The Capillary-Driven Heat Transfer (CHT) experiment is investigating the fundamental fluid physics phenomena thought to be responsible for the failure of CPL's in low-gravity operations. If the failure mechanism can be identified, then appropriate design modifications can be developed to make capillary phase-change heat-transport devices a more viable option in space applications. CHT was conducted onboard the Space Shuttle Columbia during the first Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL- 1) mission, STS- 94, which flew from July 1 to 17, 1997.
