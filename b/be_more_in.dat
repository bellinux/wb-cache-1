The engine offers better speed efficiency and new graphical features such as coloured lighting and triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex geometry. The game was designed to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> line with the puzzle-solving gameplay of the original Tomb Raider {{as opposed to the}} more shooting-oriented style of Tomb Raider II. The PlayStation served as the lead platform for the game, while the Microsoft Windows release is simply a better-looking conversion.|$|E
5|$|Many battles were fought from January to July 1499, {{and in all}} but a few minor skirmishes, the {{experienced}} Swiss soldiers defeated the Swabian and Habsburg armies. After their victories in the Burgundian Wars, the Swiss had battle tested troops and commanders. On the Swabian side, distrust between the knights and their foot soldiers, disagreements amongst the military leadership, and a general reluctance to fight a war that even the Swabian counts considered to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> the interests of the powerful Habsburgs than {{in the interest of the}} Holy Roman Empire proved fatal handicaps. When his military high commander fell in the battle of Dornach, where the Swiss won a final decisive victory, king Maximilian I had no choice but to agree to a peace treaty signed on September 22, 1499 in Basel. The treaty granted the Confederacy far-reaching independence from the empire. Although the Eidgenossenschaft officially remained a part of the empire until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the peace of Basel exempted it from the imperial jurisdiction and imperial taxes and thus de facto acknowledged it as a separate political entity.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{may be a}} therapeutic tool {{in a variety of}} patients with, or at risk for diabetes. Recent evidence has shown that increased physical activity in conjunction with dietary changes can prevent individuals heading towards diabetes. Physical activity plays an independent role in protection against diabetes. Present study indicates that in a total sample of 1000 subjects, 359 persons are performing physical activities and 641 are doing sitting type of work. Borderline, newly detected, known and total diabetic subjects <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> subjects performing sitting type of work than physical work. Men <b>are</b> <b>more</b> physically active than women. Physical activity <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> rural population in borderline and newly detected diabetic subjects but in known cases it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> urban population. Hence the risk of developing diabetes <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> urban population. In the total population (1000) only 38 subjects (3. 8 %) were doing exercise daily. Similarly in the present study, borderline, newly detected, known and total diabetic subjects <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> physically inactive persons. The significance of this study, thus, {{lies in the fact that}} the individuals are unaware of their disease status and more having a sedentary life style. These findings indicate that promotion of physical activity is important in the prevention of diabetes mellitus...|$|R

25|$|The late 20th century {{saw another}} period of {{domestic}} upheaval {{with the military}} coup known as the Carnation Revolution. Eventually military rule gave way to Portugal's transition to democracy which led to Portugal's entry into the European Union in 1986. Admission into the EU has had an immense impact on the Portuguese wine industry. In order to comply with EU standards, many of the country's monopolistic legislation that unfairly benefited co-operatives were overturned. Smaller growers and wine producers received {{millions of dollars of}} subsidies and grants from the EU to improve their vineyards and winemaking facilities. The stability brought by democracy and the European Union also encouraged more foreign investments, which brought expansions and upgrades of winemaking technology and know how to Portugal.

25|$|Some {{researchers}} who study sexual orientation {{argue that the}} concept may not apply similarly to men and women. A study of sexual arousal patterns found that women, when viewing erotic films which show female-female, male-male and male-female sexual activity (oral sex or penetration), have patterns of arousal which do not match their declared sexual orientations as well as men's. That is, heterosexual and lesbian women's sexual arousal to erotic films do not differ significantly by the genders of the participants (male or female) or {{by the type of}} sexual activity (heterosexual or homosexual). On the contrary, men's sexual arousal patterns tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> line with their stated orientations, with heterosexual men showing more penis arousal to female-female sexual activity and less arousal to female-male and male-male sexual stimuli, and homosexual and bisexual men being more aroused by films depicting male-male intercourse and less aroused by other stimuli.|$|E

Other reports claimed that Cherepanov's autopsy showed evidence of myocarditis. Outside doctors, particularly in North America were skeptical of this early explanation, believing it unlikely that a young, elite athlete would suffer from an undiagnosed form of ischemia, particularly when considering the medical testing he underwent prior to the NHL draft.

40|$|Introduction: Telangana {{state in}} {{southern}} India has many areas which have high–low fluoride levels in drinking water, and Mahabubnagar district is one among them, {{where people are}} affected with dental and skeletal fluorosis, with the majority belonging to low socio-economic status. Aims: To assess the prevalence of dental fluorosis in school going children of Mahabubnagar district and also to assess fluoride levels in drinking water from different areas of Mahabubnagar district. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 2000 children in the age group 6 – 12 years in different areas of Mahabubnagar district. Dental fluorosis status was assessed by using Modified Dean’s Fluorosis Index. Alizarin visual method was used to estimate fluoride levels in water. The data collected were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Dental fluorosis in primary and permanent dentition was 15 and 70. 3 %, respectively. In {{the northern part of}} Mahabubnagar district, primary dentition <b>was</b> <b>more</b> affected by fluorosis whereas in southern part, the permanent dentition <b>was</b> <b>more</b> affected. The prevalence of dental fluorosis <b>in</b> primary dentition <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> 6 – 7 -year-old children (35. 5 %), and in permanent dentition, it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> 9 – 10 -year-old children (70 %). The fluoride level <b>in</b> drinking water <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> Kosghi, Kalwakurthy (2. 0 [*]ppm). Conclusion: Dental fluorosis <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> 10 -year-old and less in 6 -year-old children. It <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> eastern and northern zones of Mahabubnagar district and less in local villages of Mahabubnagar...|$|R
