5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid.</b> These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E

They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an explosion at the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E
5|$|Ka is the {{dissociation}} constant of a substituted compound, K is the {{dissociation constant}} when the substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a {{property of the}} unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent.

Hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation.

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the monocarboxylic acids of the benzene series. The {{preparation}} of <b>Benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> from arenes, toluenes, aryl halides, and arynes is discussed. Optimum conditions for the oxidation of alkylarenes to <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids,</b> avoiding decarboxylation, have been determined. Monoalkylbenzenes are oxidized to <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> by oxygen {{in the presence of}} a cobalt/manganese catalyst. The oxidation of toluenes (especially nitrotoluenes) with potassium permanganate at 95 ºC in nitrobenzene/water under phase-transfer conditions gives good yields of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids.</b> Another well established approach involves the photochlorination of toluenes, to give benzotrichlorides, followed by hydrolysis. Benzyne can be generated from either bromobenzene, or chlorobenzene, by treatment with sodamide. The aryne is then reacted in situ with O-silyl enolates of carboxylic esters to form bicyclic adducts. These adducts, after hydrolysis, yield 2 -alkylbenzoic acids.

25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and its salts {{are used}} as a food preservatives, {{represented}} by the E-numbers E210, E211, E212, and E213. <b>Benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its sodium, potassium, or calcium salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Acidic food and beverage like fruit juice (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbon dioxide), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), pickles (vinegar) or other acidified food are preserved with <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> and benzoates.|$|E
25|$|The {{major cause}} of benzene in soft drinks is the {{decarboxylation}} of <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315). <b>Benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> is often added to drinks as a preservative in the form of its salts sodium benzoate (E211), potassium benzoate (E 212), or calcium benzoate (E 213). Citric acid is not thought to induce significant benzene production in combination with <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> but some evidence suggests that in the presence of ascorbic or erythorbic acid and <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> citric acid may accelerate the production of benzene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> occurs {{naturally}} as do its esters in many {{plant and}} animal species. Appreciable amounts {{have been found in}} most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several Vaccinium species (e.g., cranberry, V. vitis macrocarpon; bilberry, V. myrtillus) contain as much as 0.03–0.13% free <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> is also formed in apples after infection with the fungus Nectria galligena. Among animals, <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) as well as in gland secretions of male muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) or Asian bull elephants (Elephas maximus).|$|E
40|$|The {{need to have}} {{a measure}} of the {{strength}} of some substituted <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> in ionic liquid solution led us to use the protonation equilibrium of sodium p-nitrophenolate as a probe reaction, which was studied by means of spectrophotometric titration at 298 K. In order to evaluate the importance of electronic effect of the substituents present on the aromatic ring, both electron-withdrawing and -donor substituents were taken into account. Furthermore, to have a measure {{of the importance of the}} steric effect of the substituents both para- and ortho-substituted <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> were analyzed. The probe reaction was studied in two ionic liquids differing for the ability of the cation to give hydrogen bond and π-π interactions, namely [bm 2 im][NTf 2] and [bmpyrr][NTf 2]. Data collected show that <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> are less dissociated in ionic liquid than in water solution. Furthermore, the equilibrium constant values seem to be significantly affected by both the nature of ionic liquid cation and the structure of the acid. In particular, the ortho-steric effect seems to operate differently in water and in the aromatic ionic liquid, determining in this solvent medium a particular behavior for orthosubstituted <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} of substituent groups to the extractability of phenols and <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> was examined {{by using a}} substituent constant, π, derived from the distribution coefficients of nonionic substances. This constant is defined as π(X) =log K(D(X)) -l 8 o 9 g K(D(H)), where K(D(X)) is the distribution coefficient of a derivative and log K(D(H)) {{is that of the}} parent compound. The substituent constants of the groups at the ortho-position of phenol were found to vary with a variation of the extraction solvent, possibly due to competition between the hydration and solvation of an organic solvent. From the K(D) values of the phenols and <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> determined between chloroform and water, the substituent constants of halogeno, cyano, trifluoromethyl and nitro groups were calculated. In phenols, the π values of the ortho-substituting group (π(o)) were greater than those of the meta- and para-substituting group, π(m) and π(p), respectively, whereas in <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> π(o) are smaller than π(m) and π(p). Such results can be explained by a masking effect and the overlapping effect: the masking effect increases the π(o) values, whereas the overlapping effect decreases the π(o) values. A method for predicting the total π values of di- and tri-substituted phenols and <b>benzoic</b> <b>acids</b> is proposed...|$|R
