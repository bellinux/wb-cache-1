5|$|Blackbuck are {{severely}} affected by natural calamities such as floods and droughts, {{from which they}} can {{take as long as}} five years to recover. Wolves are major predators; a study found that old rutting bulls might <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> wolves. Cheetahs and pariah dogs are the other predators. Juveniles are also hunted by jackals. Village dogs are reported to kill fawns, but are unlikely to successfully hunt and kill adults.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that the}} 22nd Guards Brigade group would <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> German {{armoured}} counterattacks {{in the open}} ground around Bir Wair and Mussaid, Brigadier Gott withdrew it during {{the early hours of}} the morning of 16 May. By 10:00, the infantry had taken up new positions back at Halfaya Pass, although the 7th Armoured Brigade group was ordered to remain west of Fort Capuzzo for the time being.|$|E
50|$|For example, rifle {{infantry}} {{are capable}} of quickly killing other infantry types, but <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> light vehicles and dedicated anti-infantry/anti-air units such as tankettes and APCs, which in turn <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> main battle tanks, which themselves <b>are</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> missile-equipped infantry and aircraft.|$|R

5|$|When {{specimens}} are to {{be placed}} in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and display cases, archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> this reaction.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and were likely to <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{when the}} Sisters of Death arrived in Mega-City One, they found Kraken there instead of Dredd. Finding Kraken to <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> {{manipulation}} by their psychic powers, {{as he was}} still torn by latent subconscious loyalty to his late master Judd, {{they were able to}} use him as their agent to free Judge Death from captivity and begin their conquest of the city. Had Dredd not resigned, they might not have found their task so easy. Dredd eventually returned to the city and defeated them.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{concerns}} grew {{that the}} Thames might <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attack from torpedo boats and armoured cruisers, and in 1903 four quick-firing 12-pounder, 12 cwt (5.4 kg, 50.8 kg) guns were positioned on Tilbury's south-east curtain wall, supplemented in 1904 by two 6-inch (15 cm) breech loading guns. In 1905, however, the government {{decided that the}} Royal Navy and the forts downstream gave sufficient protection for the capital and removed the artillery, leaving only machine-guns in place.|$|E

5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E
5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is an {{important}} part of the desert ecosystem. It has been found at population densities of up to 480,000 individuals per hectare, which is equivalent to a biomass of 19.2kg/ha; in comparison, desert mammals are estimated to have a combined biomass of 39.9kg/ha. The main predator of H. reaumuri is the scorpion Scorpio maurus, and it may compose up to 70% of the scorpion's diet. It appears to <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attack only on the surface; no predators are known to attack H. reaumuri in its underground burrows.|$|E
5|$|Henry II visited York Castle {{four times}} during his reign. The royal {{chambers}} {{at the time}} were inside the keep for safety, and Henry paid £15 for repairs to the keep. During his 1175 visit, Henry used the castle as the base for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland. Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison, and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid-12th century. The mills proved to <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> the flooding of the two rivers and had to be repeatedly repaired.|$|E

5|$|The {{weakness}} of the plan was that, politically at least, it abandoned most of eastern Belgium to the Germans. Militarily it would put the Allied rear {{at right angles to}} the French frontier defences; while for the British, their communications located at the Bay of Biscay ports, would be parallel to their front. Despite the risk of committing forces to central Belgium and an advance to the Schedlt or Dyle lines, which would <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> an outflanking move, Maurice Gamelin, the French commander, approved the plan and it remained the Allied strategy upon the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{the late}} spring of 1940, Fighter Command had been {{preparing}} to meet a possible air attack on the British Isles coming only from due east, from Germany itself; prior to the German victory in Western Europe. The possibility that France might fall and Britain would continue to fight on had not been considered. An air attack from Germany meant the Luftwaffe's bombers would operate beyond the range of their fighters and <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attack. If twin-engine fighters, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 110s were used, they would be fighting at {{the limits of their}} range.|$|E
5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed routine inspection process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led {{to the introduction of}} widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also had the advantage of detecting cracks and flaws too small to be seen otherwise.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru {{reed warbler}} has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means that it could <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may <b>be</b> <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if stumbled upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E
