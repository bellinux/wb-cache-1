50|$|The Hose's civet {{is similar}} to the <b>banded</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (Hemigalus derbyanus). Hose’s civet was first {{described}} as Hemigalus hosei in 1892 by Oldfield Thomas and it was only in 1912 that he found that the difference in shape of muzzle and teeth, as well as the obvious difference in the pattern of colouration, implied the necessity of distinguishing Diplogale from Hemigalus. Like the Hose’s civet, the <b>banded</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> is strictly nocturnal and more ground dwelling; the distribution of Hose’s civet, however, is much more restricted and more confined to higher altitude forest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (Hemigalus derbyanus), {{also called}} the banded civet, is a civet found in the Sundaic region and occurs in peninsular Myanmar, peninsular Malaysia, peninsular Thailand and in Indonesia on the islands of Sipura, Sumatra and Borneo. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List because of its large {{geographic}} and elevation range and tolerance to some habitat disturbance.|$|E
25|$|The Malagasy civet was to {{be placed}} in the {{subfamily}} Hemigalinae with the <b>banded</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civets</b> and then in its own subfamily, Fossinae, because of similarities with others in the group pointed out by Gregory, but it is now classified {{as a member of the}} subfamily Euplerinae, after Pocock pointed out more similarities with that one.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, it was {{proposed}} to {{also include the}} golden wet-zone <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. aureus), the Sri Lankan brown <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. montanus) and the golden dry-zone <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. stenocephalus), which are endemic to Sri Lanka.|$|R

In 1840-48 he is credited with uncovering 2000 fossils at various excavation sites in France.

50|$|The Owston's palm civet is a mid-sized palm civet at 57 cm (23 in), plus a tail of 43 cm (17 in). With its pointed face, it is {{sometimes}} thought to resemble a large insectivore, such as a shrew. It has a tawny buff-grey body with highly contrasted black markings on its back and tail. They usually only have 4 bands on their back. The last two-thirds of the tail is completely black. They look somewhat like the <b>banded</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> Hemigalus derbyanus, except for that {{the hair on the}} back of their neck are not reversed, and the Owston's has spots on its legs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>banded</b> <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> {{has a long}} pointed face, {{reminiscent}} of insectivorous mammals. It has a long body set on short legs, and five toes on each foot with retractable claws. It looks very similar to Owston's palm civet (Chrotogale owstoni), except that it lacks spots on its body, and the hair on its neck points upwards instead of down along the neck. It is also similar to the rare Hose's palm civet (Diplogale hosei), an endemic of northern Borneo - they only differ in shape of muzzle and teeth and Hose's civet {{does not have the}} banded pelage of the banded civet. The banded civet has short, dense fur that is generally a dark cream/buff color with four to five dark bands on its back. Its tail has two dark bands and {{the latter half of the}} tail is dark brown to black. There is a dark brown stripe that extends down the length of the top of the muzzle, and two stripes that extend from the top middle of the eye to the inside corner of the ears. There are two areas of white above and below each eye, and the muzzle is darker than the rest of the face.|$|E

50|$|The masked <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> is {{considered}} a delicacy and is hunted and farm raised. In 2003, the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic was traced to masked <b>palm</b> <b>civets.</b> Several larger civets such as the large-spotted civet, Malayan civet and large Indian civet are also hunted and trapped for their meat. The small Indian civet is trapped and farm raised to harvest musk, {{which is used to}} make perfume and traditional Chinese medicine. Other civets species include the Asian <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> small-toothed <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> and Owston's <b>palm</b> <b>civet.</b>|$|R

40|$|Information {{is scarce}} about sylvatic rabies virus in Asia and about rabies in <b>palm</b> <b>civets.</b> We report a novel sylvatic rabies virus variant {{detected}} in a golden <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> in Sri Lanka. Evolutionary analysis suggests the virus diverged from canine rabies viruses in Sri Lanka in ≈ 1933 (range 1886 – 1963). Rabies has been eliminated from domestic animals in industrialized countries, but sylvatic rabies remains an endemic disease. The ecology of rabies in wildlife populations and natural ecosystems is poorly understood (1), and, as a result, eliminating rabies {{from the wild}} is difficult. Little is known about sylvatic rabies in developing countries, where rabies takes its biggest toll on humans. Rabies is endemic to Sri Lanka and has been identified in different wild animals. However, all documented cases of rabies in wildlife in Sri Lanka have been considered a consequence of spillover from dogs. Rabies viruses circulating {{in this country are}} distinctly highly homogeneous (2, 3). Two species of <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> are commonly found in Sri Lanka: the common <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> Paradoxurus hermaphroditus, which is widespread in southern Asia and Southeast Asia, and the golden <b>palm</b> <b>civet,</b> P. zeylonensis, which is indigenous to Sri Lanka. This species is closely related to the brown <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. jerdoni), which lives only in southern India (4). Moreover, 3 additional new species have been identified in Sri Lanka: the golden wetzone <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. aureus), the golden dry-zone <b>palm</b> <b>civet</b> (P. stenocephalus), and the Sri Lankan brown palm cive...|$|R
