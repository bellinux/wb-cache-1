5|$|The {{committee}} {{proposed that}} the municipality <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> for NOK150,000. When the issue was debated in the municipal council on 9 June, it met with resistance from representatives from Tranby in the west of Lier, who stated that they felt that the railway would have no impact on them, and that the municipality should only <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> for NOK75,000. It resulted in a compromise where the municipality bought shares for NOK100,000. A year later, the municipality purchased shares for an addition NOK30,000. The other major shareholders were Drammen Municipality with NOK30,000, Buskerud County Municipality with NOK50,000 and private investors, who supplied NOK174,050.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying interest on the loan {{until the end of}} the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E
5|$|In 1859 {{a company}} had been formed to link the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway with the SD via the Derwent Valley; by 1860 this had grown into the Newcastle, Derwent & Weardale Railway, which now {{bypassed}} the SD and linked with the SD, and the North British and London & North Western (LNWR) railways were providing {{two thirds of the}} capital. The LNWR proposed to build warehouses in Hartlepool and <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> in the West Hartlepool Harbour & Railway. The North Eastern Railway (NER), formed in 1854 by amalgamation, at the time was the largest railway company in the country and controlled the East Coast Main Line from Knottingley, south of York, through Darlington to Berwick-upon-Tweed. When they approached the S with a proposal to merge, the directors deciding they preferred a merger with the NER than eventually becoming part of the LNWR, entered negotiations. Opposed by the NER, the Newcastle, Derwent & Weardale Railway bill was approved by the House of Commons in 1861, but the line was eventually rejected by the House of Lords. The SD and EVR were absorbed by the S on 30 June 1862.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United was floated on {{the stock}} market in June 1991 (raising £6.7million), and {{received}} yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust – who encouraged supporters to <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a £623million offer, but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999. A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.|$|E
5|$|Outside of hockey, Gardiner enjoyed several {{different}} hobbies. During one off-season from the Black Hawks, Gardiner began taking flying lessons from his former teammate Konrad Johannesson. He quickly {{learned how to}} fly solo and would <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> in the Winnipeg Flying Club, which Johannesson had founded. He also enjoyed shooting rifles; {{in the summer of}} 1931 he was recognised for this when he was elected Field Secretary of the Winnipeg Gun Club. The following summer Gardiner earned a certificate in business administration and sales from the International Correspondence Schools. He then became a partner in a sporting goods business and travelled across Western Canada in the summer to sell products to sports teams. Gardiner attended church services at Grace United Church in Winnipeg, which had hosted his wedding. He was also a Freemason, and joined the St. John's Lodge in Winnipeg on April 21, 1926. During the summer of 1933, he was selected as a Shriner at the Lodge; at the age of 29 he was the youngest Shriner in the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make it appear that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to make it appear that the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E

25|$|Roach {{had founded}} the Delaware {{shipyard}} {{in anticipation of}} a boom in iron shipbuilding in the United States. He was soon to discover that he had seriously underestimated the conservatism of American shipping lines, most of whom were content to continue ordering the familiar wooden-hulled paddle steamers in spite of the proven advantages of iron hulls and screw propulsion. In order to attract more business, Roach tried reducing the entry cost of purchase by offering to <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> in the ships he sold, taking a corresponding ratio of their future earnings as part payment for their construction. In this way he found himself gradually accumulating substantial interests {{in a number of different}} shipping lines.|$|E
25|$|Controversy also arose {{around the}} fact that retail investors were {{excluded}} from the initial public offering (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to <b>buy</b> <b>shares,</b> with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some brokerage firms to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an institutional investor but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.|$|E

25|$|Rockefeller saw the SIC as {{the ideal}} {{mechanism}} for achieving another goal: A monopoly on oil refining in Cleveland. Once the SIC had severely weakened his competitors, Standard Oil would buy out the city's 26 major oil refining companies at fire sale prices. The monopoly would allow Standard Oil to dominate the national refining market, garner significantly higher profits, and drive even more competitors out of business. With higher profits, Standard Oil could then rapidly expand, becoming the nation's dominant oil refining company. To make the purchases, Standard Oil needed cash. To secure the cash, Rockefeller allowed Amasa Stone, Stillman Witt, Benjamin Brewster, and Truman P. Handy—all of whom were officers in Cleveland banks—to <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> in Standard Oil at par in December 1871. Witt and the other bankers used their influence at their own and other banks to give Rockefeller the financial backing he needed. Witt now owned the equivalent of 5 {{percent of the entire}} outstanding stock of Standard Oil.|$|E

25|$|Vonage offered {{shares of}} its stock to its {{existing}} customer {{base in the}} period before the initial public offering (IPO). Typically, only large institutional investors such as banks are able to <b>buy</b> <b>shares</b> of an IPO. Vonage’s initial public offering occurred on the New York Stock Exchange on May 24, 2006, opening at $17.00 per share. The price closed at $14.85, a decrease of 12.7 percent, the worst trading day for any IPO in 2006 up to that point. The IPO raised $531 million for the company. However, the existing customers who lost money filed a class-action lawsuit. The IPO and its immediate aftermath also earned Vonage a “Business 2.0 Magazine” award as 14th of 101 “Dumbest Moments in Business for 2006”. In 2009, Vonage reached an agreement with IPO investors. All shareholder claims against Vonage and its individual directors and officers who were named as defendants were dismissed. The amount of the settlement, $3.6 million, was paid by an insurance policy covering the directors and officers of the company.|$|E
