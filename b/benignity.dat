2500|$|The Confucian school {{eventually}} came {{to consider the}} verses of the [...] "Airs of the States" [...] to have been collected {{in the course of}} activities of officers dispatched by the Zhou Dynasty court, whose duties included the field collection of the songs local to the territorial states of Zhou. This territory was roughly the Yellow River Plain, Shandong, southwestern Hebei, eastern Gansu, and the Han River region. Perhaps during the harvest. [...] After the officials returned from their missions, the king was said to have observed them himself in an effort to understand the current condition of the common people. The well-being of the people was of special concern to the Zhou because of their ideological position that the right to rule was based on the <b>benignity</b> of the rulers to the people in accordance with the will of Heaven, and that this Heavenly Mandate would be withdrawn upon the failure of the ruling dynasty to ensure the prosperity of their subjects. The people's folksongs were deemed to be the best gauge of their feelings and conditions, and thus indicative of whether the nobility was ruling according to the mandate of Heaven or not, accordingly the songs were collected from the various regions, converted from their diverse regional dialects into standard literary language, and presented accompanied with music at the royal courts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{concurrence}} {{with the}} majority opinion Justice Clarence Thomas restated his view, in agreement with Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy, that the Constitution is [...] "color-blind." [...] For Thomas, this means that no {{discrimination on the basis}} of race is permitted by the Constitution, even for a so-called [...] "benign" [...] purpose (Thomas rejected the notion that there could be a purely benign purpose in his concurrence in Adarand because the <b>benignity</b> or malignity of race-based discrimination turns on [...] "whose ox is being gored" [...] or is [...] "in the eye of the beholder"). [...] Justice Thomas also rejected the view advanced by the dissent that these school districts were in danger of resegregation. [...] He contended that whatever trends toward classroom racial imbalance have obtained, they were not the result of state-sanctioned segregation as in the pre-Brown era. Justice Thomas goes on to call out the dissent for adopting segregationist reasoning advanced in Brown, particularly its insistence that the Court should defer to local school board knowledge, expertise, and judgment. [...] He also wrote about the unsettled debate concerning whether racial balance or diversity has a positive effect on educational outcomes. [...] Justice Thomas recoils at the suggestion that black students can only learn if they are sitting next to white students. [...] Some of the concurrence consists of social science citations and statistics showing that black students can succeed in majority black schools such as HBCUs. [...] Justice Thomas concludes noting [...] "If our history has taught us anything it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories." [...] In a footnote the Justice added a personal mention of Justice Breyer: [...] "Justice Breyer's good intentions, which I do not doubt, have the shelf life of Justice Breyer's tenure." [...] He goes on to explain that he is skeptical that school boards will always have such good intentions in their race-based decisionmaking, for, as Madison said, [...] "if men were angels, no government would be necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opinions {{differed}} about Fancourt's melodramatic {{style in}} his roles, especially {{his interpretation of}} his best-known role, that of the Mikado of Japan, and his famous Mikado laugh. Frederic Lloyd, who joined the D'Oyly Carte in 1951 and had studied the company's history, told an interviewer that Fancourt invented his interpretation, concerned that the earlier movements used during the Mikado's song could {{be taken as a}} Fagin-like caricature. [...] According to Lloyd, Fancourt had said that, because of his Jewish background, [...] "I just couldn't go through those movements, it would bother me", and Lloyd reported that, when Fancourt showed Rupert D'Oyly Carte and his stage director J. M. Gordon his new business for the song, they were delighted. Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 premi√®re, was unimpressed: [...] "Who, I want to know, intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster we so often see now is not one bit like the suave and oily Mikado created [...] at the Savoy." [...] The Times thought that he [...] "undoubtedly loses {{a good deal of the}} Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'." [...] A later Times review commented more favourably: [...] "Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the <b>benignity</b> of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs." [...] The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, [...] "He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette said, [...] "Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days. So he has given us a Mikado who really does curdle the blood, with a voice like a steam hammer slowly crushing a ton of Brazil nuts, and a make up of ghastly villainy, and a fiendish, gurgling laugh, which must be heard to be appreciated." [...] Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as [...] "a dragon getting up steam". With respect to Fancourt's portrayal of the Pirate King, fellow actor Henry Lytton told an interviewer, [...] "The King should be a story book pirate, not a real one and blood thirsty to boot. But that's the way Mr. Fancourt plays it".|$|E

60|$|While {{this game}} of charity was yet at its height, a limping, gimlet-eyed, sour-faced person--it {{may be some}} {{discharged}} custom-house officer, who, suddenly stripped of convenient means of support, had concluded to be avenged on government and humanity by making himself miserable for life, either by hating or suspecting everything and everybody--this shallow unfortunate, after sundry sorry observations of the negro, began to croak out something about his deformity being a sham, got up for financial purposes, which immediately threw a damp upon the frolic <b>benignities</b> of the pitch-penny players.|$|R

6000|$|At the Diet of Augsburg (1530), and {{the signing}} of the Augsburg Confession there, he was sure to be. He rode thither with his Anspach Knightage about him, [...] "four hundred cavaliers,"--Seckendorfs, Huttens, Flanses and other known kindreds, {{recognizable}} among the lists; [Rentsch, p. 633.]--and spoke there, notbursts of parliamentary eloquence, but things that had meaning in them. One speech of his, not in the Diet, but in the Kaiser's Lodging (15th June, 1530; no doubt, in Anton Fugger's house, where the Kaiser [...] "lodged for year and day" [...] this time but WITHOUT the [...] "fires of cinnamon" [...] they talk of on other occasions [See Carlyle's Miscellanies (iii. 259 n.). The House is at present an Inn, [...] "Gasthaus zu den drei Mohren;"where tourists lodge, and are still shown the room which the Kaiser occupied on such visits.]), is still very celebrated. It was the evening of the Kaiser Karl Fifth's arrival at the Diet; which was then already, some time since, assembled there. And great had been the Kaiser's reception that morning; the flower of Germany, all the Princes of the Empire, Protestant and Papal alike, riding out to meet him, in the open country, at the Bridge of the Lech. With high-flown speeches and <b>benignities,</b> on both sides;--only that the Kaiser willed all men, Protestant and other, should in the mean while do the Popish litanyings, waxlight processionings and idolatrous stage-performances with him on the morrow, which was CORPUS-CHRISTI Day; and the Protestants could not nor would. Imperial hints there had already been, from Innspruck; benign hopes, of the nature of commands, That loyal Protestant Princes would in the interim avoid open discrepancies,--perhaps be so loyal as keep their chaplains, peculiar divine-services, private in the interim? These were hints;--and now this of the CORPUS-CHRISTI, a still more pregnant hint! Loyal Protestants refused it, therefore; flatly declined, though bidden and again bidden. They attended in a body, old Johann of Saxony, young Philip of Hessen, and the rest; Margraf George, as spokesman, with eloquent simplicity stating their reasons,--to somewhat this effect:-- ...|$|R
