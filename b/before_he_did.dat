5|$|During the tour, Saggers had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As a result, many of the bowlers batted <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.|$|E

He was pulled from the truck by a group of men including Henry Watson, who proceeded to kick and beat him, before striking him unconscious with a fire extinguisher taken from his own vehicle. He lay unconscious for more than a minute as his truck was looted, before staggering back to his vehicle. With the help of an unknown African American named Rodney, Tarvin was able to drive his truck out of further harm's way. Just <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so, another truck, driven by Reginald Denny, entered the intersection.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{was born}} on Scotland Road in Liverpool. His parents were working class; his mother, Mary Jane (née Fleming), a cleaner, was a devout Catholic, and his father, John Stewart Baker, was a seaman. Baker {{attended}} Cheswardine Boarding School. At 15 he became a novice monk with the Roman Catholic Brothers of Ploermel in Jersey and later in Shropshire, but left the monastery six years later after losing his faith. As {{he wrote in his}} autobiography he realised he wanted to break each of the Ten Commandments in order and thought he should get out <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> something serious. He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, studying at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, Sidcup in 1956 where he met his first wife. He {{went on to become a}} professional actor in the late 1960s after the marriage broke down.|$|E

25|$|William Perkin {{continued}} active {{research in}} organic chemistry {{for the rest}} of his life: he discovered and marketed other synthetic dyes, including Britannia Violet and Perkin's Green; he discovered ways to make coumarin, one of the first synthetic perfume raw materials, and cinnamic acid. (The reaction used to make the latter became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin's Greenford dyeworks. In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye alizarin, which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with purpurin, another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.|$|E
25|$|Many of Woodward's syntheses were {{described}} as spectacular by his colleagues and <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> them, it was thought by some {{that it would be}} impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.|$|E
25|$|In a rocky {{wilderness}} Morald and Gunther meet Gernot. The former pair {{have been}} sent to find out what has happened to Arindal, who disappeared eight years ago. In the meantime his father, the king, has died from grief and the kingdom is being attacked by their enemy Murold who demands they surrender Arindal's sister Lora as his wife. Gernot relates how he and Arindal had hunted a beautiful doe to a river where it vanished. They heard a voice and jumped into the river where they found a beautiful woman in luxurious surroundings. She declared her love for Arindal and said they could stay together provided Arindal could go eight years without asking who she is. But the day <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> ask her, and Arindal and Gernot found themselves in the wilderness. Morald and Gunther depart before Arindal can know of their presence. Arindal appears and sings of his grief at the loss of Ada (Wo find ich dich, wo wird mir Trost?). Gernot tries to argue him round to believing that Ada is a sorceress who has abandoned him and that he should return to his kingdom. He sings of an evil witch who had disguised herself as a beautiful woman (War einst 'ne böse Hexe wohl). Gunther returns, disguised as a priest, and continues the attempt to persuade Arindal that he will be turned into a wild beast by the witch unless he returns at once; Morald similarly disguises himself as the ghost of Arindal's father and announces that his kingdom is threatened. Each disguise is magically destroyed just as Arindal is about to be convinced. However, the three are finally able to persuade him of his country's need. They agree to depart in the morning, although Arindal fears he will not see Ada again. When he is left alone he falls into an enchanted sleep.|$|E

500|$|Vaan was voiced in Final Fantasy XII by Bobby Edner in English and by Kouhei Takeda in Japanese.

When asked how he compares to other Final Fantasy protagonists, Hideo Minaba stated that {{due in part to}} being designed by a different character designer than <b>before,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not feel he could be compared to any other Final Fantasy character. Vaan's inclusion in Dissidia 012 met difficulties due to the fact Takeda was busy with other works to voice him.

500|$|While visiting Budapest in April 1921, Heseltine befriended {{the then}} little-known Hungarian {{composer}} and pianist Béla Bartók. When Bartók visited Wales in March 1922 {{to perform in}} a concert, he stayed {{for a few days}} at Cefn Bryntalch. Although Heseltine continued to promote Bartók's music, there are no records of further meetings after the Wales visit. Heseltine's on-off friendship with Lawrence finally died, after a thinly disguised and unflattering depiction of Heseltine and Puma ("Halliday" [...] and [...] "Pussum") appeared in Women in Love, published in 1922. Heseltine began legal proceedings for defamation, eventually settling out of court with the publishers, Secker and Warburg. Puma, meanwhile, had disappeared from Heseltine's life. She returned from Ireland <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and had lived for a while with the young child Nigel at Cefn Bryntalch where the local gentry considered her [...] "not of the same order of society as we are". There was no resumption of married life, and she left Heseltine sometime in 1922.|$|E
500|$|The Rutherford {{government}} {{had just been}} resoundingly re-elected in the 1909 provincial election, winning 36 of the legislature's 41 seats, when the new legislature first met in February 1910. [...] There was initially no sign of controversy {{in relation to the}} A Railway: William Clarke, A President, had several months earlier announced that the line would be completed by the end of 1912, ahead of schedule. [...] When the A bonds went on sale in London in November 1909, the issue was oversubscribed. [...] The following month, the contract for ties was awarded. [...] Everything seemed to be progressing as planned when, {{at the beginning of the}} new legislative session, Liberal backbencher John R.

[...] Rutherford, Minister of Railways as well as Premier, responded to the questions in writing. [...] <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so, however, a rumour began to circulate that William Henry Cushing, Minister of Public Works, had resigned from the cabinet.|$|E
500|$|In late 1940, medical {{units in}} the Middle East were {{experienced}} [...] "precarious and at times acute" [...] shortages of medicals stores. Units {{were sent to the}} Middle East as fully equipped as was possible, with the expectation that the British Army would make up the difference, but British policy was that all possible sources had to be exploited before any demands could be made on the United Kingdom's sources. General Sir Thomas Blamey, the Commander in Chief of the AIF, recognised this as something that had to be negotiated between the two governments, but medical officers in the Middle East blamed the Medical Services in Australia—and therefore Downes—for the situation. The Minister of the Army, Percy Spender decided to pay a visit to the Middle East to see the situation for himself but <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so, he resolved that Downes should become Director of Medical Services, AIF (Middle East). On arrival in the Middle East with the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, Spender found that Blamey had already appointed Major General Samuel Burston to that post. This came as a surprise to them as they had not realised that Blamey had the authority to make such an appointment; but on seeing the situation for himself, Spender confirmed Burston's appointment.|$|E
