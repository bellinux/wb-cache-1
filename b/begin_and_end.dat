30|$|The {{knowledge}} of the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of each curve (different numbers for each measurement as implied below) led to {{the determination of the}} <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> number for each curve and measurement. Thereafter by simply averaging the velocities within the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> number we calculated the mean velocity (apparently for each curve and measurement). It is noted that the velocity of each measurement at the <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of each curve was calculated with linear regression of the values right before and right after the curve implying that the trajectory and hence the variation of the velocity between two consecutive points, is linear.|$|R
5|$|Industrialized {{societies}} generally {{follow a}} clock-based schedule for daily activities {{that do not}} change {{throughout the course of}} the year. The time of day that individuals <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> work or school, and the coordination of mass transit, for example, usually remain constant year-round. In contrast, an agrarian society's daily routines for work and personal conduct are more likely governed by the length of daylight hours and by solar time, which change seasonally because of the Earth's axial tilt. North and south of the tropics daylight lasts longer in summer and shorter in winter, with the effect becoming greater the further one moves away from the tropics.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} to fill the aircraft with one gallon of fuel and see how far they got. Seeing that this would lead to aircraft retrieval problems, the organisers decided that all flights must <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> at Lypmne. Instead, each was fuelled over a gallon by a standard amount, landing when they judged they had insufficient fuel for another 12.5 miles. If they had used more than one gallon, the calculated consumption was pro rata; if they had used less than one gallon the consumption was nevertheless based on one gallon used.|$|E
25|$|The type of book being {{produced}} determines {{the amount of}} design required. For standard fiction titles, the design is usually restricted to typography and cover design. For books containing illustrations or images, design takes on a much larger role in laying out how the page looks, how chapters <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end,</b> colours, typography, cover design and ancillary materials such as posters, catalogue images, and other sales materials. Non-fiction illustrated titles are the most design intensive books, requiring extensive use of images and illustrations, captions, typography and a deep involvement and consideration of the reader experience.|$|E
25|$|What {{is common}} {{throughout}} all the {{editions of the}} Nights is the initial frame story of the ruler Shahryār and his wife Scheherazade and the framing device incorporated throughout the tales themselves. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while others <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> of their own accord. Some editions contain {{only a few hundred}} nights, while others include 1,001 or more. The bulk of the text is in prose, although verse is occasionally used for songs and riddles and to express heightened emotion. Most of the poems are single couplets or quatrains, although some are longer.|$|E

25|$|Cycling in Melbourne is {{a popular}} pastime, as one {{can tell from the}} bevy of cyclists and paths that lie all {{throughout}} the city, as well as a spectator sport. Melbourne's flat terrain and extensive off-road paths in green wedges are conducive to riding. Beach Road combines with the Nepean Highway to form a 90-kilometre stretch from Port Melbourne to Sorrento, incorporating the Bayside Trail. It is the city's most popular training route and attracts cyclists from around the world. Thousands of commuters cycle the roads, bike lanes and bike paths daily. Bicycle Victoria's annual events, Around the Bay in a Day and Ride to Work Day, attract tens of thousands of Melburnians. Other events such as the Herald Sun Tour <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> in the Melbourne area and there are many local cycling events of varying grades all year round.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarities}} between Tot and Webern's music are striking. In an often programmatic or cinematic fashion Webern ordered his published movements, themselves dramatic or visual tableaux with melodies that frequently <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> on weak beats or else settle into ostinati or the background. In them, tonality, useful for communicating direction and narrative in programmatic pieces, becomes more tenuous, fragmented, static, symbolic, and visual or spatial in function, thus mirroring the concerns and topics, explicit or implicit, of Webern's music and his selections for {{it from the}} poetry of Stefan George and later Georg Trakl. Webern's dynamics, orchestration, and timbre are given so as to produce a fragile, intimate, and often novel sound, despite distinctly recalling Mahler, not infrequently bordering on silence at a typical ppp. In some cases, Webern's choice of instrument in particular functions to represent or to allude to a female voice (e.g., the use of solo violin), to inward or outward luminosity or darkness (e.g., {{the use of the}} entire range of register within the ensemble; registral compression and expansion; the use of celesta, harp, and glockenspiel; the use of harmonics and am steg directions), or to angels and heaven (e.g., the use of harp and trumpet in the circling ostinati of op. 6 no. 5 and winding to conclusion {{at the very end of}} op. 15 no. 5).|$|E

500|$|Before Flotilla, Chung {{worked on}} a prototype, a {{two-dimensional}} turn-based space action game called Space Piñata, whose gameplay and structure {{were similar to those}} of the final version of Flotilla. Chung intentionally limited the solo mode's play time as an [...] "experiment in making a short-story generator", such that an adventure could <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> within a half hour. Following negative response, a patch was deployed to change this limitation. The patch included a new [...] "hardcore" [...] mode. Flotilla score incorporates several pieces of classical music, such as Chopin's [...] "Raindrop" [...] prelude. According to Edge magazine, the [...] "Raindrop" [...] prelude gives the game's battles [...] "an emotional undercurrent". Chung said that the soundtrack was designed to give the game [...] "a tragic feel" [...] and that he wanted the game to be portrayed as [...] "the anti-testosterone-fueled" [...] action game.|$|E

500|$|While players <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> {{the game}} in Dunwall, much of the story {{takes place in the}} coastal city of Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos that lies along the {{southern}} region of the Empire of the Isles, whose chief exports include silver. Unlike Dunwall, which relied on whale oil for power, Karnaca is powered by wind turbines fed by currents generated by a cleft mountain along the city's borders, though the winds that blow over and into the city cause it to be rife with dust storms, most notably within its mining district which led it {{to be known as the}} [...] "Dust District". At the time the game begins, two factions, the Howlers and Overseers, engage in violent conflict within the district, with the Howlers seeking to oppose the new Duke and his government following the passing of its previous Duke, leading to the Grand Serkonan Guard, Karnaca's law enforcement and military, erecting defensive barriers called Walls of Light in response to the disarray.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} in the subway was {{initially}} {{going to be on}} top of a building so that the episode would <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> the same, but co-creator J.J. Abrams thought {{it would be better to}} start it underground and [...] "move up throughout the episode". The episode began the setup of Olivia's backstory by revealing the Cortexiphan drug trials, which would be an ongoing plot point in continuing episodes. All the shots were chosen carefully to put the viewer in Olivia's troubled frame of mind, and consequently the episode had many tight shots that were meant to give a [...] "sense of unease". The producers felt that shooting on the lab set was the [...] "hardest set to shoot at on the planet" [...] because it contained several levels that inhibited the crew's ability to move cameras around. As Goldsman had an aversion to shooting in hospitals, they used a church for the mental hospital scenes. When Olivia, Peter, and Walter are en route to the climax at the building, the shots of them in the SUV were just shots of them driving back and forth on the 59th Street Bridge.|$|E
500|$|Her outfit in Lightning Returns was {{designed}} by Nomura. He was told by Toriyama to create something representative of her final battle, with [...] "strength" [...] as the main guideline. The resultant outfit, which resembles a leather bodysuit, has spinal column patterns on its sleeves and is primarily colored red and white. Nomura later commented that he felt [...] "a strong reaction within [...] " [...] while creating Lightning's final look. Nomura's design was Kamikokuryo's favorite out of the many outfits created for the character. Her other outfits for the game were designed by Kamikokuryo, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Toshitaka Matsuda: many of them drew inspiration from the character designs of regular Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. In addition to the new costumes, Lightning's in-game model was rebuilt from the ground-up. Her breasts were enlarged and several of her outfits were designed to present her in a more feminine way. For the game's epilogue, Toriyama wished for Lightning to appear in an everyday setting and normal clothes. The team considered ending the game with Lightning either meeting or speaking with her allies, but Toriyama wished the story to <b>begin</b> <b>and</b> <b>end</b> with her alone. He has claimed that Lightning, with her solo role in Lightning Returns, was the Final Fantasy series' [...] "first female protagonist".|$|E
