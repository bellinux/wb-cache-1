25|$|Though NBA.com lists George's height as 6ft 9 in (2.06 m), a December 15, 2011 {{report from}} The Indianapolis Star said that George was 6ft 10 in (2.08 m). He entered the league as a {{shooting}} guard but was later {{moved to the}} small forward position, {{with the emergence of}} Pacers shooting guard Lance Stephenson. Stephenson's improvement as a facilitator and distributor in the backcourt allowed George to play off the ball more often during games. Early in his career, he was unable to create shots for himself and lacked a great deal of <b>ball</b> <b>handle,</b> something he worked on with trainer Jerry Powell during the 2012 off-season. With All-Star swingman Danny Granger injured during the 2012–13 season, George took on a larger offensive responsibility, which resulted in the NBA Most Improved Player Award.|$|E

25|$|Stewart {{was born}} in Syracuse, New York, to Brian and Heather Stewart and has a younger brother named Connor. Breanna began playing {{basketball}} at an early age; in fifth grade, she decided to improve her game. Now six feet four inches tall, {{she had always been}} tall for her age, which often meant coaches wanted her inside as a rebounder. However, her father thought it would help if she had <b>ball</b> <b>handling</b> skills and a perimeter shooting ability. Stewart started a routine of dribbling around her block, wearing headphones. She completed enough loops to cover a mile. She continued the routine almost every day, improving her <b>ball</b> <b>handling</b> to the point she routinely dribbled behind her back or between her legs. Even after heading off to college, she still did the routine at home.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{experiments on}} {{the learning of}} object handling behaviors by a small humanoid robot using a dynamic neural network model, the recurrent neural network with parametric bias (RNNPB). The first experiment showed that after the robot learned different types of <b>ball</b> <b>handling</b> behaviors using human direct teaching, the robot was able to generate adequate <b>ball</b> <b>handling</b> motor sequences situated to the relative position between the robot’s hands and the ball. The same scheme was applied to a block handling learning task where it was shown that the robot can switch among learned different block handling sequences, situated to the ways of interaction by human supporters. Our analysis showed that entrainment of the internal memory structures of the RNNPB through the interactions of the objects and the human supporters are the essential mechanisms for those observed situated behaviors of the robot...|$|R
