5|$|Avinor {{wants to}} extend most short {{airports}} to 1200 m <b>by</b> <b>year</b> 2030, {{because they see}} a lack of aircraft types which have more than 19 seats able to use 800-meter runways. Dash 8 built after 2009 can't use them. Few countries apart from Norway have such short airports. There is however no room for this at Hasvik, so the plan here and for some other airports with few passengers, is to use small planes with less than 20 seats.|$|E
5|$|Biofuel cars {{in general}} get strong tax {{incentives}} in France, including a 0 or 50% reduction {{on the tax}} on new vehicles, and a 40% reduction on CO2 tax for new cars. For company cars there is a corporate car tax free for 2 years and a recovery of 80% of the value added tax (VAT) on E85 vehicles. Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at € 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per liter, as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85, even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps <b>by</b> <b>year</b> end 2007. French automakers Renault and PSA (Citroen & Peugeot) announced they will start selling FFV cars beginning in the summer 2007.|$|E

5|$|Currently, the {{earliest}} listed film is Newark Athlete (1891), {{and the most}} recent is 13 Lakes (2004). Counting the 11multi-year serials in the NFR once each (as the NFR does) <b>by</b> <b>year</b> of completion, the years with the most films selected are 1928, 1939, and 1940, with 18films from each year chosen for preservation. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121years; Edison Kinetographic Record of a Sneeze was originally released in 1894 and selected for preservation in 2015. The shortest span is the minimum 10years; this distinction is shared by Raging Bull, Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas, Toy Story, Fargo and 13 Lakes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire, roads in the region deteriorated. Only the Via Sclavonica is known to have existed in the region <b>by</b> <b>year</b> 1030. It was an eastwest route {{spanning}} from Pazin to Poreč. Road transport in the region lost significance after the peninsula was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice. From 18091813, the TriestePula route was rebuilt by the First French Empire, after the French captured the entire region from Venice and the Habsburgs. Upgrades to the regional road network continued after the Austrian Empire acquired Istria at the 18141815 Congress of Vienna. By 1830, the road network in Istria had expanded to a degree that would not change for a century and a half. The only significant improvement of region's roads was paving of the TriestePula road in 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The operas listed {{cover all}} {{important}} genres, and include all operas regularly performed today, from seventeenth-century works by Monteverdi, Cavalli, and Purcell to late twentieth-century operas by Messiaen, Berio, Glass, Adams, Birtwistle, and Weir. The brief accompanying notes offer an {{explanation as to}} why each opera has been considered important. For an introduction to operatic history, see Opera.
