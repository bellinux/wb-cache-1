The specialty TV channel line-up will include one news channel, one youth-oriented channel, an educational channel, and a movie channel.

This differed from the previous webcasts {{in that it was}} specifically an audio-visual experience and not an audio adventure: it was fully animated to <b>broadcast</b> <b>standard</b> (although the webcast version was slightly simplified for that medium) by Cosgrove Hall Films and webcast over five weeks in November and December 2003.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, René Barthélemy {{developed}} an 819-line television standard. During {{the years of}} occupation, Barthélemy reached 1015 and even 1042 lines. On October 1, 1944, television service resumed after the liberation of Paris. The broadcasts were transmitted from the Cognacq-Jay studios. In October 1945, after repairs, the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was back in service. On November 20, 1948, François Mitterrand decreed a <b>broadcast</b> <b>standard</b> of 819 lines; broadcasting began {{at the end of}} 1949 in this definition. Besides France, this standard was later adopted by Algeria, Monaco, and Morocco. Belgium and Luxembourg used a modified version of this standard with bandwidth narrowed to 7MHz.|$|E

25|$|On July 5, 2005, the Head of the Earth Orientation Center of the IERS sent {{a notice}} to IERS Bulletins C and D subscribers, soliciting {{comments}} on a U.S. proposal before the ITU-R Study Group 7's WP7-A to eliminate leap seconds from the UTC <b>broadcast</b> <b>standard</b> before 2008 (the ITU-R {{is responsible for}} the definition of UTC). It was expected to be considered in November 2005, but the discussion has since been postponed. Under the proposal, leap seconds would be technically replaced by leap hours as an attempt to satisfy the legal requirements of several ITU-R member nations that civil time be astronomically tied to the Sun.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Hankey Committee was {{appointed}} to oversee the resumption of television broadcasts after the war. Baird persuaded them to make plans to adopt his proposed 1000-line Telechrome electronic colour system as the new post-war <b>broadcast</b> <b>standard.</b> The picture resolution on this system would have been comparable to today's HDTV (High Definition Television). The Hankey Committee's plan lost all momentum {{partly due to the}} challenges of postwar reconstruction. The monochrome 405-line standard remained in place until 1985 in some areas, and the 625-line system was introduced in 1964 and (PAL) colour in 1967. A demonstration of large screen three-dimensional television by the BBC was reported in March 2008, over 60 years after Baird's demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{original}} 625-line PAL colour videotapes, all except Episode Four were wiped for reuse. However, a converted 525-line colour NTSC version recorded off-air from an American broadcast was {{made available to}} the BBC. This version was abridged and unsuitable for transmission as it was not of <b>broadcast</b> <b>standard</b> (the US recordings were made on a domestic Betamax VCR from a repeat in 1978). In 1992 the colour signal from the NTSC tapes was used as the basis for restoring the colour to the 16mm monochrome telerecordings of episodes one, two, three and five. These versions were subsequently repeated on BBC2 on consecutive Fridays in November/December 1992 (20/11/92 to 18/12/92 at 7.15pm). The ratings were 2.52, 2.96, 2.30, 2.19 and 2.34 million viewers respectively.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) {{adopted the}} American NTSC 525-line B/W 60 field per second system as its <b>broadcast</b> <b>standard.</b> It began {{television}} broadcasting in Canada in September 1952. The first broadcast was on September 6, 1952 from its Montreal station CBFT. The premiere broadcast was bilingual, spoken in English and French. Two days later, on September 8, 1952, the Toronto station CBLT {{went on the}} air. This became the English-speaking flagship station for the country, while CBFT became the French-language flagship after a second English-language station was licensed to CBC in Montreal later in the decade. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, CKSO in Sudbury, Ontario, launched in October 1953 (at the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that was relaxed in 1960–61 when CTV, Canada's second national English-language network, was formed).|$|E
500|$|As {{the place}} where English first evolved, the British Isles, and {{particularly}} England, are home to the most diverse dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the Received Pronunciation (RP), an educated dialect of South East England, is traditionally used as the <b>broadcast</b> <b>standard,</b> and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At {{the time of the}} Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.|$|E
2500|$|The first testing {{television}} station in Mexico signed on in 1935. When KFMB-TV in San Diego signed on in 1949, Baja California {{became the first}} state to receive a commercial {{television station}} over the air. Within a year, the Mexican government would adopt the U.S. NTSC 525-line B/W 60-field-per-second system as the country's <b>broadcast</b> <b>standard.</b> In 1950, the first commercial television station within Mexico, XHTV in Mexico City, signed on the air, followed by XEW-TV in 1951 and XHGC in 1952. Those three were not only the first television stations in the country, but also the flagship stations of Telesistema Mexicano, which was formed in 1955. That year, Emilio Azcárraga Vidaurreta, who had signed on XEW-TV, entered into a partnership with Rómulo O'Farrill who had signed on XHTV, and Guillermo González Camarena, who had signed on XHGC. The earliest 3D television broadcasts in the world were broadcast over XHGC in 1954. Color television was introduced in 1962, also over XHGC-TV. One of Telesistema Mexicano's earliest broadcasts as a network, over XEW-TV, on June 25, 1955, was the first international North American broadcast in the medium's history, and was jointly aired with NBC in the United States, where it aired as the premiere episode of Wide Wide World, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. [...] Except for a brief period between 1969–1973, nearly every commercial television station in Mexico, with exceptions in the border cities, was expected to affiliate with a subnetwork of Telesistema Mexicano or its successor, Televisa (formed by the 1973 merger of Telesistema Mexicano and Television Independiente de Mexico). This condition would not be relaxed for good until 1993, when Imevision was privatized to become TV Azteca.|$|E
