Many formulas for mutual relations among these conditions are known, but their use is not simple. Therefore, the present author has obtained a graph showing these mutual relations from results of experiment and calculation. 工場に於いて旋削作業を行う場合， 普通使用する機械と加工材料並びに切削する工具が与えられて切削作業に最も適応した切削速度切込送り及び切削カ並に切削動力等の作業条件を迅速に決定せねばならない場合が多いのである。之等の作業条件の相互の関係に就いては今迄多くの実験式が発表されているが何れも其の計算が可也煩雑であって現場に於ける取扱いには不便である。本文に於いては之れ等の関係を一連の等分割対数座標に纏めて図式によって作業条件相互の関係を解かんとするものである...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the museum's railroad equipment exhibits, its shops hold a historic collection of industrial <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> and hand tools. One of these is a sheet-metal shear, which was made by Parker Manufacturing Company, a <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> in Santa Monica, CA. The company needed a shear, but backlogs in the World War II years meant a two-year waiting list to obtain one. So, the small company decided to design and make its own shear. It was made entirely of steel plate (no castings) due to backlogs in foundries. The design was successful, and desired by other <b>shops</b> needing <b>machine</b> <b>tools.</b> Soon, the local company was in the shear manufacturing business. The museum puts this unique shear to use in its Carhouse #4.|$|R
50|$|A <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> is a room, building, or {{company where}} {{machining}} is done. In a <b>machine</b> <b>shop,</b> machinists use <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> and cutting tools to make parts, usually of metal or plastic (but sometimes {{of other materials}} such as glass or wood). A <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> can be a small business (such as a job shop) or {{a portion of a}} factory, whether a toolroom or a production area for manufacturing. The parts produced can be the end product of the factory, to be sold to customers in the machine industry, the car industry, the aircraft industry, or others. In other cases, companies in those fields have their own <b>machine</b> <b>shops.</b>|$|R

In Paint shop painting work in trains after blasting has been done. After painting of bogies wheels will be attached in trains in this building. Bogie shop is the biggest building of the project. It is meant for attachment of shells and shaping it into bogie and after that attachment of bogies into each other of the train.

2500|$|The Sten was a 9×19 mm Parabellum submachine gun {{manufactured}} by the United Kingdom in World War II.

50|$|For most drill presses—especially those {{meant for}} {{woodworking}} or home use—speed change {{is achieved by}} manually moving a belt across a stepped pulley arrangement. Some drill presses add a third stepped pulley {{to increase the number}} of available speeds. Modern drill presses can, however, use a variable-speed motor in conjunction with the stepped-pulley system. Medium-duty drill presses such as those used in <b>machine</b> <b>shop</b> (<b>tool</b> room) applications are equipped with a continuously variable transmission. This mechanism is based on variable-diameter pulleys driving a wide, heavy-duty belt. This gives a wide speed range as well as the ability to change speed while the machine is running. Heavy-duty drill presses used for metalworking are usually of the gear-head type described below.|$|R

50|$|A 163 ft tall {{headframe}} {{was erected}} over the shaft to operate two hoists, one for ore skips {{and another for}} men and materials, riding in double-decker cages. The hoist cables were fed from massive cable-drum winches located inside two red brick hoist houses situated directly behind the headframe. Nearby was an ore-crushing and screening plant and a plant for pressing the crushed ore into briquettes (built in the 1950s, now demolished). The miners' bath house, designed to accommodate a work force of 500, contained a rack system so that clothes buckets could be suspended out of reach near the ceiling.
