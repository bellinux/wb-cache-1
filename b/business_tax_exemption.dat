Colorado's projected budget shortfalls for the 2010-2011 fiscal year were substantial and obvious cuts {{had been made in}} years prior. All functions of state government had undergone cuts in previous sessions, but the ongoing reductions in state spending also threatened to defund numerous departments and functions of government. Gagliardi agreed with many additional cuts in the state's budget, but argued extensively against further reductions in spending for education, infrastructure, and [...] "social safety net" [...] programs. To prevent these cuts, she voted with many fellow Democrats to close tax loopholes and end certain <b>business</b> <b>tax</b> <b>exemptions</b> which altogether totaled more than $110,000,000 annually.

40|$|Many {{countries}} adopted specific {{tax laws}} {{with regard to}} the inheritance of family <b>businesses.</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>exemptions</b> result from the belief that the burden of the inheritance tax might force family-owned companies to shut down the business.

In this paper we test how fragile Flemish family businesses are at the moment of a forced transfer of the family firm, using survey data and accounting records for 273 family-owned companies. The ability to pay inheritance taxes is proxied by the liquid assets and the available and tax-free reserves. The analysis shows that if both liquid assets and tax-free reserves are taken into account, maximum 8, 4 % of the family-owned companies in the sample will face serious difficulties when confronted with the unforeseen decease of the ceo...|$|R

40|$|The Great Recession has {{punched a}} gaping hole in state {{government}} budgets. California has a projected budget deficit of $ 21. 3 billion for the 2012 fiscal year. Illinois has a projected shortfall of $ 17 billion; New Jersey?s is $ 10. 5 billion. Texas may have a $ 10 billion dollar hole to fill in each year of the upcoming biennium. Fortunately, there are solutions that could not only narrow the state?s budget gap, but also reduce the distortions imposed by its current system of taxation. Tax breaks for some firms and industries necessarily mean higher tax rates for others. Keeping rules as consistent as possible appeals to our sense of equity and promotes economic efficiency.
