5|$|In the four-armed form, one of {{the left}} arms rests on Nandi's head, while the other is <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> kataka pose and holds a nilotpala (blue lotus) or hangs loosely at her side. In the three-armed representation, the left hand holds a flower, a mirror or a parrot. In the case of {{two-armed}} icons, the left hand rests on Nandi's head, hangs loose or holds either a flower, a mirror or a parrot. The parrot may be also perched on Parvati's wrist. Her hand(s) is/are adorned with ornaments like a keyura (anklet) or kankana (bangles).|$|E

In this form, he is usually shown standing with one leg <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> {{front of the other}} in the Tribhanga posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic and seductive man with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 2009, Campbell {{signed a}} {{four-year}} contract with Sunderland after Manchester United had accepted a £3.5million bid (potentially rising to £6million) after successfully passing a medical earlier that same day. He scored his first {{goal for the}} club in a 2–0 League Cup victory over Birmingham City. On 28 December 2009, Campbell partnered Darren <b>Bent</b> <b>in</b> attack against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the 2–2 draw. Campbell scored twice in the FA Cup against non-League team Barrow on 2 January 2010. On 9 March 2010, Campbell scored his first Premier League goal for Sunderland, scoring against Bolton after just 41 seconds in a 4–0 win. The striker also scored in league matches against Aston Villa, Burnley and Birmingham.|$|E

5|$|Sunderland opened {{negotiations}} to sign <b>Bent</b> <b>in</b> July 2009. The deal seemed delayed and through social networking website Twitter he accused club chairman Daniel Levy of disrupting his move to Sunderland, although Bent later apologised, saying he acted out of frustration. He travelled to Sunderland to {{sign for the}} club after they agreed a fee with Tottenham, and after passing a medical, Bent signed for Sunderland on 5 August for an initial fee of £10million plus potential additional payments, which later rose to £16.5million. He scored on his Sunderland debut, which was the only goal in a 1–0 victory against Bolton, and was followed with Sunderland's opening goal against Chelsea in a 3–1 defeat. He scored a brace in the 4–1 win over Hull City to give himself his third and fourth goals in five matches.|$|E
5|$|The event, {{featuring}} commentary by Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler and Booker T, {{began with}} the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match. During the bout, Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a ladder propped between the ring apron and the announcers' table with a powerbomb. The ladder was <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside. Near {{the end of the}} match, Barrett, Rhodes and Bryan were the only three in the ring. Bryan put Rhodes in a guillotine choke submission hold on top of the ladder {{in the middle of the}} ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of the ladder. After Bryan knocked Rhodes off the ladder, Barrett got Bryan onto his shoulders and tried to throw him off. Bryan countered with repeated elbow strikes to Barrett's head. Bryan then kicked Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{posture of}} Ardhanarishvara may be tribhanga – <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> three parts: head (leaning to the left), torso (to the right) and right leg {{or in the}} sthanamudra {{position}} (straight), sometimes standing on a lotus pedestal, whereupon it is called samapada. Seated images of Ardhanarishvara are missing in iconographic treatises, but are still found in sculpture and painting. Though the canons often depict the Nandi bull as the common vahana (mount) of Ardhanarishvara, some depictions have Shiva's bull vahana seated or standing near or behind his foot, while the goddess's lion vahana is near her foot.|$|E
40|$|A {{class of}} bent {{functions}} which contains bent functions with various properties like regular, weakly regular and not weakly regular <b>bent</b> functions <b>in</b> even and in odd dimension, is analyzed. It is shown that {{this class includes}} the Maiorana-McFarland class as a special case. Known classes and examples of <b>bent</b> functions <b>in</b> odd characteristic are examined for their relation to this class. In the second part, normality for <b>bent</b> functions <b>in</b> odd characteristic is analyzed. It turns out that differently to Boolean bent functions, many - also quadratic - <b>bent</b> functions <b>in</b> odd characteristic and even dimension are not normal. It is shown that regular Coulter-Matthews bent functions are normal...|$|R

5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the award}} {{was created by}} The Bookseller, {{the idea of an}} award celebrating books with odd titles was {{proposed}} by Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for The Bookseller, took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given {{due to a lack of}} odd titles, The Bookseller opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by <b>Bent.</b> <b>In</b> 2009, online submissions sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being Strangers Have the Best Candy by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper aims at the classiffication of <b>bent</b> {{functions}} <b>in</b> {{order to}} allow their construction without searching or sieving. We focus on the characterization of <b>bent</b> functions <b>in</b> the context of Specialized Normal Forms. Furthermore we want to express <b>bent</b> functions <b>in</b> terms of derivative operations of the Boolean Differential Calculus. In order to solve these problems, we study bent functions of two and four variables in detail. This exploration leads finally to Boolean differential equations {{that will allow the}} direct calculation of bent functions.

25|$|A. duodenale worms are grayish {{white or}} pinkish {{with the head}} {{slightly}} <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> relation {{to the rest of}} the body. This bend forms a definitive hook shape at the anterior end for which hookworms are named. They possess well-developed mouths with two pairs of teeth. While males measure approximately one centimeter by 0.5 millimeters, the females are often longer and stouter. Additionally, males can be distinguished from females based on the presence of a prominent posterior copulatory bursa.|$|E

25|$|Following a siege, the Turks were victorious {{over the}} last Venetian overlord, Angelo Gozzadini, in 1617. (According to a story recounted by J.L. <b>Bent</b> <b>in</b> his 1885 travelogue on the Cyclades, Kastro fell only because of a treacherous ploy by the Turks: a young woman, heavy with child and {{apparently}} in pain, approached the entrance and begged to be admitted; the watchman's daughter opened the gate for her—and for the Turks hiding nearby. Bent writes that this version is preserved in a popular island ballad (Bent, 1885, reprinted 2002, chap. 17).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, a {{piece of}} acacia wood was located between the bones {{and the head of}} the nail, presumably to keep the {{condemned}} from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the nail in question was <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> such a way that it could not be removed.|$|E
25|$|The electoral {{district}} {{was created in}} 1952 from the former districts of Brandon and Souris. It has been held by a centre-right party for all but one term of its existence. This tradition was broken in 1993 when massive vote-splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and take the riding. However, the seat reverted to form in 1997 when the PCs reclaimed it. The PCs and their successors, the modern Conservatives, have held the seat ever since. While Brandon has some Liberal and NDP support, {{it is not enough}} to overcome the conservative <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> the more rural areas of the riding.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains in}} the ossuary were placed with great care and were {{undamaged}} {{at the time of}} burial. In order to maximise the use of space, the remains were packed very tightly together; so tight that it was nearly impossible to identify individual skeletons unless articulated. Due to the tightly compacted nature of this ossuary, bones were broken or <b>bent</b> <b>in</b> the shape of the walls (particularly long bones). These fractures are not consistent with trampling and because the broken ends remained in close proximity, it was interpreted that great care was taken to minimize damage to the bones in the filling and packing of the ossuary.|$|E

Hart also kept a clean sheet in Manchester City's 3–0 victory over Liverpool, where he was still first-choice goalkeeper and made even more good saves, enhancing his reputation even further. Hart conceded his first goal of the season from a late penalty by Darren <b>Bent</b> <b>in</b> a 1–0 defeat at Sunderland, and made an error that led to Blackburn Rovers' opening goal in a 1–1 draw two weeks later.|$|E
