40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} programme and a CFD based mathematical model using a brush seal at two bristle to rotor clearances (0, 27 mm. and 0, 75 mm.), are presented. The experimental programme examined the radial pressure distributions along the <b>backing</b> <b>ring,</b> the axial pressure distribution along the rotor, {{and the mass}} flow through the seal, through a range of pressure ratios while exhausting to atmosphere. The results from this experimental programme {{have been used to}} further calibrate a CFD based model. This model treats the bristle pack as an axisymmetric, anisotropic porous region, and is calibrated by the definition of non-linear resistance coefficients in three orthogonal directions. The CFD analysis calculates the aerodynamic forces on the bristles, which are subsequently used in a separate program to estimate the bristle movements, stresses and bristle and rotor loads. The analysis shows that a brush seal with a build clearance produces a very different flow field within the bristle pack to one with an interference, and the need to understand the bulk movements of the bristles. These are shown to be affected by the level of friction between the bristles and the <b>backing</b> <b>ring,</b> which has an important effect on the bristles wear and seal leakage characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes –Part 1 Numerical simulations Leaks occasionally occur in flange joints in plastic pipelines, predominantly large dimension ones. Such pipelines are normally {{of importance for}} e g water supply, and repair is expensive. A better understanding is vital since a clear background is missing for the existing design and mounting recommendations, which also are differing. Analysis of plastic flanges {{is more complicated than}} for metal ones since the material is time dependent, and much softer than the backing rings and bolts. The aim of this work was to be able to assess on one hand if presently standardized flange geometries mean smaller safety margins when the size of the pipe is increased, {{and on the other hand}} if the instructions for mounting have to be improved. First, an analysis was made by manual calculations, without consideration of the time dependent properties of the material, in order to assess the stresses just after tightening of the joint but before pressurizing and start of service time of the pipeline. The manualanalysis is of course misleading for assessment of the compression stresses in the flange surfaces over time, although it seems that such calculations often are used for design. The value of the manual analysis was mainly that it showed that the nominal stresses aresimilar for different sizes, except for the 630 mm pipe where they are significantly higher. Further it was established that pressurizing of the pipe means a moderate influence on the flange stresses and bolt forces, 10 - 15 %, and that the bolt and <b>backing</b> <b>ring</b> are much stiffer than the plastic flange, meaning that it is mainly relaxation that is responsible forunloading of the joint over time. Computer simulations (FEM) were then made of both the tightening and the service phase for a set of geometries, and with a material model including time dependent properties of the plastic parts of the joint using material data from in-house experiments. Although the computer simulations are approximate too, they give a much better impression both of the principal function of the joint and of the magnitude of the stresses over time. It appears that the geometry of the flange joint means that the contact is lost over large parts of the flange surfaces already at pressurizing and that a triangulardistribution of pressure covering a part of the flange surface corresponding to the width of the <b>backing</b> <b>ring</b> is developed over time which should be sufficient to keep the joint tight. The effects of gaskets and profiled, softer, backing rings are clarified, and it is indicated that re-tightening is an efficient way to improve the function of the joint over time. Further, it seems that there is no significant difference in behaviour, as regards flange pressure, between SDR 11 and SDR 17 geometries. So, the FEM investigation has revealed that intuitive thoughts about reasons for inferior functioning of large size flange joints in plastic pipes are not well founded. The most efficient way to improve the joint is to increase the bolt force and to keep it up,by re-tightening or by flexible backing rings. Gaskets, soft ones, may be beneficial for reducing unevenness of the plastic joint surfaces...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for predicting the 3 D bending behaviour of bristles in brush seals. The model builds upon and addresses shortcomings {{in an earlier}} 2 D bending model. The work was motivated {{by the need to}} develop a general 3 D solid mechanical model which can ultimately be incorporated into CFD models of flow and heat transfer through brush seals. The iterative method considered here, which is based upon linear beam-bending theory, allows relatively large numbers of bristles to be considered with arbitrary imposed aerodynamic forces. Bristle-to-bristle contacts and deflections are considered, as well as shaft and <b>backing</b> <b>ring</b> contacts. The method also allows arbitrary initial bristle packs and lay-angles to be considered, as well as periodic conditions so that the model re{{presents a}} sector of a brush seal. Other physically important features such as the so-called ' 3 D-splay' and 'inclined prop' effects are also taken into account. The method described here has been incorporated into a new computer code called 'SUBSIS' (Surrey University Brush Seal Iterative Simulator). Example results from this code are presented which show the bending behaviour of initially hexagonally packed brush seals under model imposed pressure loads acting on the bristle tips. The effects of rotor incursions into the bristle pack, increase of the pressure load, and changes in the lay-angle and Young's modulus are also shown. The results illustrate the expected bending behaviour observed in real brush seals. Procedures for coupling SUBSIS with CFD models are also currently under investigation...|$|E

40|$|Compliant {{contacting}} filament seals such as {{brush seals}} {{are well known}} to give improved leakage performance and hence specific fuel consumption benefit compared to labyrinth seals. The design of the brush seal must be robust {{across a range of}} operating pressures, rotor speeds, and radial build-offset tolerances. Importantly the wear characteristics of the seal must be well understood to allow a secondary air system suitable for operation over the entire engine life to be designed. A test rig at the University of Oxford is described which was developed for the testing of brush seals at engine-representative speeds, pressures, and seal housing eccentricities. The test rig allows the leakage, torque, and temperature rise in the rotor to be characterized as functions of the differential pressure(s) across the seal and the speed of rotation. Tests were run on two different geometries of bristle pack with conventional, passive, and active pressure-balanced <b>backing</b> <b>ring</b> configurations. Comparison of the experimental results indicates that the hysteresis inherent in conventional brush seal design could compromise performance (due to increased leakage) or life (due to exacerbated wear) as a result of reduced compliance. The inclusion of active pressure-balanced backing rings in the seal designs are shown to alleviate the problem of bristle–backing ring friction, but this is associated with increased blow-down forces which could result in a significant seal-life penalty. The best performing seal was concluded to be the passive pressure-balanced configuration, which achieves the best compromise between leakage and seal torque. Seals incorporating passive pressure-balanced backing rings are also shown to have improved heat transfer performance in comparison to other design...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{aesthetic}} and structural advantages, tubular space truss structures are enjoying increasing popularity in modern bridge construction. The use of cast steel nodes for the joints between the circular hollow section members is also becoming increasingly popular. The fatigue design of such joints however requires additional knowledge {{with respect to}} their fatigue resistance. The present work deals with the global fatigue behaviour of cast steel nodes used in longitudinal truss girders of steel-concrete composite bridges. The global fatigue behaviour of cast steel nodes in a truss girder is quantified on the basis of experimental investigations. The relative influence of the resistance of the cast steel node and the resistance of the welds is analysed as a function of various parameters. An economically optimal fatigue design consists of adapting the fatigue resistance of the cast node to that of the welds. The experimental results show very clearly that the fatigue behaviour is governed by the welds in all tested configurations. Their fatigue behaviour is therefore investigated in a research program conducted simultaneously. The present work concentrates on the adaptation of the resistance of the cast steel nodes to that of the welds. Consequently, allowable initial casting defect sizes must be defined {{as a function of the}} required fatigue resistance of the welds. Using a numerical boundary element model, they are calculated for cast steel nodes in a typical steel-concrete composite bridge. The results show that brittle failure of a node containing cracks does not occur. A crack depth equal to 90 % of the wall thickness at the crack location is therefore chosen as the failure criterion, assuming that a through-thickness crack is unacceptable. Varying between 28 and 88 % of the wall thickness, the resulting allowable initial casting defect sizes are very large. Aiming at a general application for steel-concrete composite bridges, the results of the numerical investigations are represented by an approximate formula for the stress intensity factor based on a constant correction factor. This approximation results in a considerable simplification of the procedure for the fatigue design of cast steel nodes established for the aforementioned typical composite bridge. The approximate formula is used to perform a parametric study. The influences of the utilisation ratio under traffic and fatigue loads, the cast steel fracture toughness and yield strength and the node dimensions on the defect size are described. Assuming a fracture toughness likely to be encountered in practice and a mean utilisation ratio of the node as well as a range of node dimensions, the allowable initial casting defect sizes are quantified. The present work shows that the fatigue resistance of the welded joints needs to be improved substantially in order to benefit from the high fatigue resistance of the cast nodes. Weld details including a <b>backing</b> <b>ring</b> offer a higher fatigue resistance than those without. Using the proposed design concept, allowable initial defect sizes in cast steel nodes can be estimated as a function of the required fatigue resistance...|$|E
