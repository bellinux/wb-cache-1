The concepts introduced will concentrate on new synchronisation techniques based on, modulation derived, code derived, code assisted <b>bit</b> <b>synchronisation</b> and matched filter profile synchronisation. The result of trials of these techniques under simulated and real radio path conditions is given...|$|E

It is obtd. from the <b>bit</b> current. The <b>synchronisation</b> criteria reoccur periodically and synchronisation is est. as quickly as poss. so as to eliminate the recurring interference. The bit patterns formed from the received data are compared with the specific bit pattern of the frame synchronisation symbol. A signal is prod. {{in the event of}} concurrence. This signal is used to trigger a flywheel circuit with the periodicity of the time frame when the signal appears within the given time interval. The instant of opening and closing the time window will be determined by considering at least two characteristic results with regard to stability...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a digitally implemented modem for use over HF (2 - 30 MHz) radio channels. As a completely digital approach offers the prospect of a number of significant improvements, a new digital multifrequency-shift-keying (MFSK) modem has been developed that employs a novel digital processing procedure termed code-assisted <b>bit</b> <b>synchronisation</b> (CABS). Signal detection is achieved via a set of noncoherent correlators, whilst symbol synchronisation and error correction are performed using a soft-decision Viterbi decoder. Practical tests of modem show that it operates effectively under both additive white Gaussian noise and real HF channel conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} {{the period of}} a series of periodic events is considered under the condition where the measurements of the times of occurrence are noisy and sparse. The problem is common to <b>bit</b> <b>synchronisation</b> in telecommunications and pulse-train parameter estimation in electronic support, among other applications. Two new algorithms are presented which represent different compromises between computational and statistical efficiency. The first extends the separable least squares line search (SLS 2) algorithms of Sidiropoulos et al., having very low computational complexity while attaining good statistical accuracy. The second is an approximate maximum-likelihood algorithm, based on a low complexity lattice search, and is found to achieve excellent accuracy...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares two {{burst-mode}} {{clock and}} data recovery (BM-CDR) techniques suitable for bursty upstream data transmission, namely a gated voltage controlled oscillator (GVCO) and an oversampling clock phase alignment (CPA). Numeric models were deduced with timing jitter and duty cycle distortion (DCD) {{present in the}} received data. The performance of the two techniques are analyzed and compared especially in an optically amplified long-reach high-split PON (LR-PON) system. It is shown that an oversampling CPA exhibits a large DCD tolerance and better jitter rejection than a GVCO without line coding, resulting in high network efficiency while keeping fast <b>bit</b> <b>synchronisation.</b> This makes the oversampling CPA technique the best option for the proposed network...|$|E
40|$|We propose and {{evaluate}} a novel improvement to a previously published, unreliable covert channel {{based on the}} network traffic of multiplayer, first person shooter online games (FPSCC). Covert channels typically embed themselves within pre-existing (overt) data transmissions in order to carry hidden messages. FPSCC encodes covert bits as slight, yet continuous, variations of a player’s character’s movements. These variations are visually imperceptible to human players, yet occur frequently enough to create a low bit-rate covert channel. The nature of first person shooter network protocols means the original FPSCC channel is noisy (not reliable), experiencing {{a significant number of}} <b>bit</b> errors (including <b>synchronisation</b> errors). We have now augmented FPSCC to ensure bits are transmitted reliably. Evaluation of our technique with a prototype demonstrates throughput of up to 13 bits/second without any bit errors...|$|R
40|$|The rise of {{photonic}} integration makes optical {{code division}} multiple access (OCDMA) worth revisiting due to its promising role in future all-optical networks. OCDMA has the potential to exploit the surplus bandwidth of optical fibres and to carry over to the optical domain the benefits seen CDMA radio communication systems, such as the effective sharing of the spectrum for multiple network subscribers, and resistance to jamming and eavesdropping. One of the major requirements for the deployment of OCDMA in networks is integration. This thesis presents a research study of integrated OCDMA systems using the AlGaInAs/InP semiconductor material system. This material is considered due to its useful intrinsic properties such as thermal stability, strong electron confinement, and low threshold, making it suitable for fabricating optoelectronic devices. Two bespoke OCDMA systems are considered for integration: coherent temporal phase coding (TPC), and incoherent wavelength-hopping time-spreading (WHTS) OCDMA systems. TPC systems are excellent for high speed communications due to their static en/decoding enabling features. In this research, a 2 × 2 asymmetric Mach Zehnder interferometer (AMZI) is used to generate a 2 -bit phase code, allowing multiplexing for up to four users. A semiconductor mode-locked ring laser is also embedded in the circuit, and using a synchronous mode-locking method, adequate signal en/decoding is achieved. WHTS systems on the other hand fully exploit the spectral and temporal space available in networks by assigning each user with a unique wavelength-time hop sequence for en/decoding data signals. Here, a mode-locked laser array is used with intracavity distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) for spectrally tuning each laser, and a 4 : 1 multimode interference coupler is used to combine the laser signals into a single channel for amplification, modulation and transmission. The integrated system is fully characterised and synchronisation experiments are performed to show the potential for its use in high speed multi-user networks. Mode-locked lasers {{play an important role in}} many OCDMA implementations due to their wide spectrum and discrete temporal properties, which can be easily exploited during data en/decoding. Various mode-locked laser devices have been studied during this research with additional embedded components such as intracavity DBRs and phase controllers for precise tuning of the wavelength and pulse repetition frequency. However, the noisy nature of passively operating mode-locked lasers make them prone to high jitter, which can result in high <b>bit</b> error rates. <b>Synchronisation</b> schemes are thereby explored in order to temporally stabilise the pulse oscillations to make them suitable for use in long haul transmission systems. This includes synchronous and hybrid mode-locking, as well as a passive technique using an optical fibre loop to provide phase feedback, which is shown to promote ultralow RF linewidths in mode-locked lasers...|$|R
40|$|A new {{simulator}} named DLBS (Dynamic Link Budget Simulator) {{was written}} {{to simulate the}} time-varying communication link between a vehicle that re-enters the atmosphere from the outer space, and a ground station. During the vehicle descent trajectory, communications blackouts typically occur due {{to the effects of}} plasma that forms around the vehicle. A companion simulator, AIPT (Antenna In Plasma Tool), evaluates the electric field at the input of the ground station antenna, taking into consideration the vehicle structure, its antenna, the characteristics of plasma at some specified points along the vehicle trajectory, and the obtained values are stored in a file. DLBS processes the data read from the AIPT output file and evaluates the corresponding channel transfer functions. DLBS then allows to simulate the typical telemetry and telecommand links, using both CCSDS standardised and some non standard channel encoding schemes and modulations. For each generated frame, DLBS uses a channel transfer function obtained by adequately interpolating the two nearest transfer functions evaluated in the initial phase. DLBS includes realistic frame, frequency, phase and <b>bit</b> <b>synchronisation,</b> so that synchronisation errors are also included as source of performance degradation, and measures both the average bit and frame error rates, and the bit error rate at frame level, so {{that it is possible to}} appreciate the dynamic system behaviour. The paper will show the results obtained for a case stud...|$|E
