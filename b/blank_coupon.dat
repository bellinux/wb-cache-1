30|$|We {{investigated}} the contamination levels of CC 2 at the ESCuC/JAXA, where the Hayabusa 2 -returned samples {{are due to}} be stored. We used witness coupons to collect contaminants, following {{the example of the}} Stardust mission. All of the detected amino acids on our witness coupons were found to be common amino acids of terrestrial origin. The amino acids were thought to be of multiple origins, the nature of which will be determined in future studies. Nevertheless, {{the results of this study}} indicate that most of the amino acids were found to be several times more abundant on the witness coupons than on the <b>blank</b> <b>coupon,</b> as determined by primary signals from the samples handled in CC 2. Contamination control, especially related to organic contaminants of terrestrial origin, is an essential part of sample return missions from C-type asteroids. Inter-laboratory evaluation of the witness coupons between our ISAS/JAXA curation facility and other related missions such as the OSIRIS-REx mission (NASA/JSC) will contribute to our understanding of the nature of potential contaminants and how to further minimise the levels of such contaminants.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis examines various aspects on connections and joints in Pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymeric (PFRP) structures. The work {{is divided into two}} experimental investigations on the determination of pin-bearing strength and the characterisation of dowel connections and joint for the Startlink Lightweight Building System (SLBS). To support the development of a strength formula for bearing resistance in bolted connections two pin-bearing strength test series were conducted to study the effects of load orientation and hot-wet conditioning. The limitations of existing standard test methods are exposed from a critical review to show that they do not specify the need for a clearance hole, the range of bolt diameters and PFRP thicknesses found in practice. Because the size of tension coupons is found to be too big to be cut from standard structural profiles an alternative test method, having a smaller coupon size, is needed for every pin-bearing strength to be quantified by testing. Reported in this thesis are test results using an in-house test method that requires a maximum <b>blank</b> <b>coupon</b> of 100 mm × 125 mm. Characteristic strength are determined using Annex D 7 of Eurocode 0. Pin-bearing strengths for load orientations of 0, 5, 10, 20, 45 and 90 o, to the direction of pultrusion are obtained for a web material taken from a standard wide flange section of 9. 53 mm thick. In the test matrix there were four sizes of pin diameter from 9. 7 mm to 25. 4 mm and a minimum clearance hole of 1. 6 mm. The in-house test method is shown to satisfactorily determine pin-bearing strength. Another finding from this study is that the Hankinson formula cannot be applied to establish pin-bearing strength at any orientation on knowing the two characteristic strengths at 0 o and 90 o. To characterise the effect of hot-wet conditioning 0, 45 and 90 o specimens were immersed under water for 3000 hours at 40 ° C. It is found that the average reduction in characteristic strength is in the range of 18 to 31...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{to measure the}} corrosion effects of aerosols {{as a function of}} their aerodynamic size and chemical composition was used to study the effects of atmospheric aerosols on mild steel at a rural coastal site. The technique uses collocated micro-orifice uniform deposition impactor samplers to deposit ambient atmospheric particles on exposure steel coupons and collect aerosol samples for ionic analyses. Rusts were found on the coupons with aerosols but none on the <b>blank</b> <b>coupons</b> even the <b>blanks</b> were incubated at the same conditions. FTIR analysis shows that the composition of rusts changes gradually with the aerosol particle size. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{reason for}} this is that airline {{reservation}} systems (and major GDSs) require the segments following on sequentially, so arriving at one city, and then departing from another, will cause the system to return an error message. The ARNK field tells the system that this is intentional, and also allows for the ticketing system to <b>blank</b> the unused <b>coupons</b> of a ticket.|$|R
30|$|Carbon steel coupon (20 mm× 10 mm× 2 mm) {{surfaces}} {{were treated}} using a sandblasting technique and were cleaned {{prior to the}} biofilm assay, as described previously (Nemati et al. 2001 b). Briefly, the coupons were cleaned in 18 % HCl, which was then neutralized by immersion in a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. Finally, coupons were washed with distilled water, rinsed in acetone, and dried in an air stream. Conditioned surfaces were obtained by immersion of carbon steel coupons in LEO at MIC, sub-MIC and supra-MIC solutions for 24 h at 20 °C. A cell control (without LEO) and a blank control (without cells) were performed using untreated coupons. Treated and control coupons were performed in 4 replicates. The remaining amount of LEO that was not absorbed to the metal surface was then removed by rinsing with deionised water and dried with sterile air. The cleaned coupons were placed in tubes containing Postgate C medium inoculated with 105 cells ml- 1 of D. alaskensis and incubated for 7 days. The effect of LEO was evaluated under macroscopic observations. In addition, to analyze coupon weight loss coupon surfaces were cleaned (washed in acid, neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, rinsed in water and acetone, and dried in an air stream) and coupon weight loss was determined by measuring {{the weight of the}} coupon using an analytical balance (Sartorius AG model TE 214 S, Goettingen, Germany) as previously described (Marques et al. 2012). Weight was measured in grams, and the corrosion rate (CR) of carbon steel coupons was calculated and is expressed in mm year- 1 (ASTM G 4 / 95 2001), using 7.84 g cm- 3 as the density of carbon steel. The average corrosion observed on <b>blank</b> <b>coupons</b> was subtracted from cell control (untreated) and conditioned coupons weight loss values. A two-sample t test was performed on treated and control coupons.|$|R
30|$|Using {{aluminium}} foil {{as a witness}} coupon material, by exposing it to CC 2 for different durations, the amino acid content in CC 2 was quantitatively evaluated. To compare our results {{with those of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Johnson Space Center (NASA/JSC) OSIRIS-REx team, we used the same workflow system, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Aluminium foil, with a thickness of 0.05  mm, was cut to 3 [*]×[*] 3  cm pieces and baked at 450  °C for 6  h. The baked {{aluminium foil}} was placed in cleaned Pyrex Petri dishes (φ 28  mm) and introduced into CC 2 (Fig.  1 b). The cleaning procedure of the Petri dishes was based on the procedure described by Ishibashi et al. (2012). They were then baked {{in the same way as}} the aluminium foil. The baking of the aluminium foil and cleaning of the Petri dishes were done in the manufacturing and cleaning room at the ESCuC. After enclosing the pieces of aluminium foil in Petri dishes, they were brought to CC 2 in the planetary sample handling room at the ESCuC. After being evacuated and purged with nitrogen in the airlock of CC 2, the Petri dishes filled with aluminium foil were introduced into CC 2. After their introduction into CC 2, the lids of the Petri dishes were opened, and the aluminium foil was exposed to the environment in CC 2. Five witness coupons were prepared and exposed for 1  day, 2  days, 8  days and 31  days, with the last used as a reference without exposure as a <b>blank</b> witness <b>coupon.</b> Each of the coupons was folded using tweezers inside CC 2 and taken out of the chamber after closing the lids of the Petri dishes. The <b>blank</b> witness <b>coupon</b> was directly stored in the Petri dish after being baked together with the other witness coupons. The Petri dishes were wrapped in triplicate with baked aluminium foil and transported to the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) for analysis.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, our {{analytical}} method for detecting amino acids is highly sensitive, and {{the concentrations of}} the detected amino acids on our witness coupons {{are similar to those}} on the <b>blank</b> witness <b>coupon.</b> This result means that our method can detect most amino acids that exist at levels only a few times higher than those found on the blank as primary signals from the samples handled in CC 2. In CC 2, most of the tools, jigs and containers were introduced just after being ultrasonically cleaned by following the methods described by Ishibashi et al. (2012). Baking the items before introduction to CC 2 resulted in a decrease in the level of contamination. In addition, it is important to continue monitoring the amino acid contamination level in CC 2 on a regular basis to maintain the cleanliness and to detect any accidental increases in the contamination level. It is also useful to understand the detection limits of amino acids in the Hayabusa 2 -returned samples processed in CC 2.|$|R
