5|$|Dengue {{can also}} be {{transmitted}} via infected <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> and through organ donation. In countries such as Singapore, where dengue is endemic, the risk {{is estimated to be}} between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions. Vertical transmission (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue emerging in new regions in recent decades.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} need rapid {{reversal}} of warfarin such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous vitamin K. <b>Blood</b> <b>products</b> should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when vitamin K could work alone. PCC {{has been found to}} be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E
30|$|Constraint 4 {{denotes the}} formula {{relation}} among the supply, the demand, and the shortage. The demand of <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> p with <b>blood</b> group k at blood bank j is satisfied {{by the same}} group product and substitutions of other blood groups, and the unsatisfied demand will be the shortage. Constraint 5 ensures that the total demand for any type of <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> may not exceed its supply. Constraint 6 denotes that the shortage of each type of <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> is allocated among all blood banks according to their demand proportions. Constraint 7 denotes the limitation on the substitution amount of each blood group at each blood bank. Constraint 8 represents the total substitution amount of each <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> at each <b>blood</b> bank under the limitation of substitution rate. Constraint 9 denotes that the substitution amount of each <b>blood</b> <b>product</b> is allocated among all blood banks according to their demand proportions. Constraint 10 defines the domain of decision variables.|$|R

5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|The US FDA has {{approved}} two Chagas tests, including one approved in April 2010, and has published guidelines that recommend testing of all donated blood and tissue products. While these tests {{are not required}} in US, an estimated 75–90% of the blood supply is currently tested for Chagas, including all units collected by the American Red Cross, which accounts for 40% of the U.S. blood supply. The Chagas Biovigilance Network reports current incidents of Chagas-positive <b>blood</b> <b>products</b> in the United States, as reported by labs using the screening test approved by the FDA in 2007.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} in about 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries {{the risk of}} acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and <b>blood</b> <b>products,</b> representing between 5% and 10% of global infections. Although rare because of screening, it is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation.|$|E

5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and <b>blood</b> <b>products.</b> Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
