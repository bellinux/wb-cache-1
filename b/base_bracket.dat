40|$|Background: Fixed {{orthodontic}} appliances with ceramic brackets are used frequently {{to fulfill the}} aesthetic demand of patient through orthodontic treatment. Ceramic brackets have some weaknesses such as bond strength and enamel surface damage. In high bond strength the risk of damage in enamel surfaces increases after debonding. Purpose: This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of silane on <b>base</b> of <b>bracket</b> and adhesive to shear bond strength and enamel structure of ceramic bracket. Method: Sixteen extracted upper premolars were randomly divided into four groups based on silane or no silane on the <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> and on the adhesive surface. Design of the <b>base</b> on ceramic <b>bracket</b> in this research was microcrystalline to manage the influence of mechanical interlocking. Samples were tested in shear mode on a universal testing machine after attachment. Following it, adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores were used to assess bond failure site. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way Anova and the Mann-Whitney test. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a magnification of 2000 x was used to observe enamel structure after debonding. Result: Shear bond strength was increased between group without silane and group with silane on the <b>base</b> of <b>bracket</b> (p< 0, 05). There was no significance different between group without silane and group with silane on adhesive (p< 0, 05). Conclusion: Application of silane on <b>base</b> of <b>bracket</b> increases shear bond strength, however, application of silane on adhesive site does not increase shear bond strength of ceramic bracket. Most bonding failure occurred at the enamel adhesive interface and damage occurred on enamel structure in group contains silane of ceramic bracket...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article aims {{to analyze}} the {{difference}} in stresses generated in the bracket-cement-tooth system {{by means of a}} peel load in single and double-mesh <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> using a three-dimensional finite element computer model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A three-dimensional finite element model of the bracket-cement-tooth system was constructed and consisted of 40, 536 bonds and 49, 201 finite elements using a commercial mesh generating programmer (ANSYS 7. 0). Both single and double-mesh <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> were modified by varying the diameter from 100 - 400 &# 181;m progressively, and the spacing between the mesh wires was kept at 300 &# 181;m for each diameter of wire. A peel load was applied on the model to study the stresses generated in different layers. RESULTS: In case of double-mesh <b>bracket</b> <b>base,</b> there was reduction in stress generation at the enamel in comparison to single-mesh <b>bracket</b> <b>base.</b> There was no difference in stress generated at the bracket layer between single and double-mesh <b>bracket</b> <b>bases.</b> At the impregnated wire mesh (IWM), layer stresses increased as the wire diameter of the mesh increased. CONCLUSION: Results show that bracket design modification can improve bonding abilities and simultaneously reduce enamel damage while debonding. These facts may be used in bringing about the new innovative bracket designs for clinical use...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the bond strength of rebonded orthodontic brackets after adhesive residuals {{on the surface of the}} <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> were removed by Er,Cr:YSGG lasers. Seventy-six brackets bonded to premolars with a self-etching primer adhesive system were equally divided into four groups after the first debonding with the <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> (Group 1) untreated, and treated by (Group 2) Er,Cr:YSGG laser, (Group 3) sandblaster, and (Group 4) Er,Cr:YSGG laser/sandblaster. The treated brackets were rebonded to the new premolars in the same manner as the first-stage experiment. The shear bond strengths were measured, with the bonding/debonding procedures repeated once after the first debonding, and the bracket/adhesive failure modes were evaluated after each debonding. The treated <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> surfaces were observed under a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mean rebond strengths were significantly lower in group 1 than in other groups, and that there were no significant differences between the other groups. The mean initial bond strength was significantly higher than the mean rebond strength in group 1 but there was no significant difference between the two in the other three groups. Failures at the bracket-adhesive interface occurred frequently at second debonding in group 1. Under the SEM, residual adhesive was removed from the <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> by Er,Cr:YSGG laser, while adhesive remnant was seen underneath the meshwork of the <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> and microroughness appeared on the meshwork after sandblasting.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{recycling}} of deboned ceramic brackets via an Er:YAG laser or via the traditional chairside processing methods of flaming and sandblasting; shear bond strength and morphological changes were evaluated in recycled brackets versus new brackets. Materials and Methods. 3 M Clarity Self-Ligating Ceramic Brackets with a microcrystalline base were divided into groups subjected to flaming, sandblasting, or exposure to an Er:YAG laser. New ceramic brackets served as a control group. Shear bond strengths were determined with an Electroforce test machine and tested for statistical significance through analysis of variance. Morphological examinations of the recycled ceramic <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> were conducted with scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Residue on the <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> was analyzed with Raman spectroscopy. Results. Faded, dark adhesive was left on recycled <b>bracket</b> <b>bases</b> processed via flaming.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength of metallic brackets bonded with Right-On composite under different enamel conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five bovine permanent lower incisors were used, and {{were divided into}} three groups (n = 15). For group 1 (control), the bonding procedures were performed by using Transbond XT according to the manufacturer?s recommendations, that is 37 % phosphoric acid etching, washing, drying, application of primer XT and, finally, the bonding procedure itself. For the other two groups, the brackets were bonded by using the Right-On composite. The bonding procedures for group 2 were performed according to the manufacturer?s recommendations, that is 37 % phosphoric acid etching, application of the composite activation liquid, both on the etched surface and the <b>bracket?s</b> <b>base,</b> and insertion of the composite on the <b>bracket?s</b> <b>base</b> and <b>bracket</b> positioning.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of orthodontic <b>bracket</b> <b>base</b> shape on shear bond strength and adhesive remnant index. In this in vitro study using 140 bovine incisors, shear bond strength (SBS) of <b>brackets</b> with different <b>base</b> shapes (rectangle, flower, round, heart, diamond, star, and football) were measured with an Instron testing machine and tested until bond failure. Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) scoring was evaluated after debonding to evaluate the location of bond failure. Descriptive and one-way ANOVA post-hoc Tukey statistical analyses were performed with a statistical significance set at p? 0. 05. Statistically significant difference in mean SBS in Newtons was observed for multiple base shapes (p< 0. 05). The highest mean SBS (N ± SD) was observed in football and flower base shapes (73. 83 N ± 53. 46; 65. 82 N ± 37. 89 respectively); the lowest mean was observed with diamond and heart shapes (30. 51 N ± 11. 73; 33. 28 N ± 16. 89 respectively). When reported in Megaspascals, statistically significant difference was observed for rectangle base shape (3. 54 MPa ± 2. 69) when compared to all other <b>base</b> shapes. <b>Bracket</b> <b>base</b> shape has an effect on SBS.
