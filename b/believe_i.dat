At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E

We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people.

Futterman said it [...] "seamlessly" [...] wove the two [...] "into an uplifting and thematically appropriate mash-up", and credited Santana and Blaine with [...] "an impressive job on Minaj's rap verses, while Rachel, Artie and Mercedes split tastefully understated solos". Slezak credited [...] "solid vocals from Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Mercedes, and some not terrible rapping from Blaine and Santana", but he thought the number [...] "lacked the epic scope you want from a Regionals showdown" [...] and disliked the song [...] "I <b>Believe</b> <b>I</b> Can Fly"; his grade was a [...] Votta characterized the mashup as [...] "just off" [...] and [...] "better visually than it is just to listen to the track".
