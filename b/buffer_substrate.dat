Hard magnetic layers of NdFeB and SmCo have been prepared by pulsed laser deposition on heated substrates and the phase formation, microstructure, texture and consequences for the magnetic properties were examined. By choosing an appropriate <b>buffer,</b> <b>substrate</b> temperature and film thickness, Nd 2 Fe 14 B films with a small grain size, a pronounced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and a coercivity up to 1. 5 T could be prepared.

The best combination of remanence and coercivity is obtained for stoichiometric SmCo 5 films.

Due to the prebiotic availability of fatty acids, fatty acid vesicles are a popular model for proto-{{cell membranes}} in origin-of-life studies. Vesicles of one such fatty acid, decanoic acid, are often used to model early membranes, but the mechanism by which decanoic acid forms vesicles is not clear. Monolayer studies of the stability of decanoic acid on water surfaces may help illuminate the key molecular interactions that result in vesicle formation. To this end, consistent amounts of decanoic acid were deposited {{on the surface of}} aqueous salt and buffer solutions, and a variety of isotherms were collected with a Langmuir trough and Wilhelmy balance. Time versus surface pressure isotherms were analyzed and it was found that there was no statistical difference in the isotherms collected on 50 mM and 500 mM NaCl, indicating that the effects of salt on the phase behavior of decanoic acid might plateau at a lower concentration. However, the isotherms run on a Tris <b>buffer</b> <b>substrate</b> were statistically different from the isotherms at both salt concentrations.

The purpose was to decrease AMD acidity to a level where sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) placed in it may be activated. Of all materials, a whole soil (a high cation-exchange capacity clayey mollisol containing 40 % clay, and 4 % soil organic matter) caused the greatest pH increases from 2. 5 up to 5. 5 units after 10 days in the AMD water.

40|$|Within {{this thesis}} a {{strategy}} for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral short chain alcohols using biocatalysis is developed. This is realized in close collaboration with an industrial partner. The biocatalysts used are alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) which need nicotinamide cofactors (NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH) as redox equivalents. The regeneration of the cofactors is done substrate dependent by addition of 2 -propanol which is oxidized by the ADH while the cofactor is reduced, and enzyme dependent. Here, a malate dehydrogenase(MDH) as second enzyme and L-malic acid as specific substrate are used for in situ cofactor reduction. The kinetic characterization of the different ADH preparations and of a NAD- and a NADP-dependent MDH shows strong dependence of activity on the substrate, on reaction parameters like concentrations of <b>buffer,</b> <b>substrate,</b> and cofactor, {{on the type of}} ADH and on the kind of preparation, i. e. lyophilized or purified. The obtained results are transferred to one-phase batch synthesis of (R) - and (S) - 2 -butanol. Conversion and enantioselectivity (ee) are dependent on reaction conditions, i. e. 2 -propanol and substrate concentration. Generally it is possible to synthesis both enantiomers of 2 -butanol in the one-phase system. Due to limitations like low conversion, low selectivity, and low substrate solubility the synthesis of (R) - 2 -butanol is transferred to two-phase reaction systems using methyl-tert-butyl ether(MTBE) and the tailor-made ionic liquid (IL) as non-reactive phase. MTBE {{turns out to be the}} solvent of choice. Depending on substrate and co-substrate concentration conversion and ee can be positively influenced. The same is found for two-phase reactions with MTBE in a continuous reaction set-up. With the optimum reaction conditions obtained from the batch experiments conversion and ee are improved. Another influencing factor in the continuous reaction is the flow rate. ADH and cofactor show exceptionally high stability and high TTN. Together with further development of a work-up strategy the continuous two-phase reaction set-up will be a strong tool to produce enantiopure alcohols on preparative relevant scale...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Computer {{display panels}} create a vast color palette by {{combining}} color from three {{light emitting diodes}} (LEDs), each producing red, green, or blue light. The light from these three LEDs is chosen so that the display can generate the largest color combination possible. Tri-color LED displays typically use one of two combinations of LEDs. In the first, InGaN blue (480 nm), AlGaAs red (637 nm), and GaP green (572 nm). This combination provides a full color spectrum, but is limited in its display of deep green colors 1. The second option uses substitutes the GaP green for InGaN green (515 nm). This shift to 515 nm, a more yellowish green, increases the depth of greens and reds in the display. However, the incorporation of a green LED with a wavelength of 530 nm in current LED displays {{would result in a}} color range and color depth that would significantly exceed anything currently available. Such a technology would increase the richness of displays and would also make the mixing of green colors less power intensive given the availability of 'true green' in the display. Another technologically relevant application for such a "true green" technology is in lasers. Current green LED lasers are a combination of an infrared laser diode and a frequency multiplier. Light emitted by the laser diode is passed through a frequency doubler, which is a non-linear device that combines photons to create photons of higher energy within the material. For commercially available green lasers, an infrared laser diode emitting 1064 nm light is converted into 532 nm green light. While the fabrication of such a device has become inexpensive, it is still a multi-component system. The development of a green laser diode would reduce the costs associated with assembly of such a system. In addition, the reduction in size of the entire laser diode would enable the manufacturing of very small green laser-based devices. The development of green emitting materials has been limited by the ability to grow lattice-matched semiconductor material of the appropriate bandgap on commercially available substrates. A III-V semiconductor material such as InGaP can be grown with a bandgap of - 2. 3 eV to emit 532 nm light. However, the lattice constant of InGaP with this bandgap is in the 5. 45 to 5. 5 A range. A suitable substrate might be GaAs with a bandgap of roughly 5. 65 A, but the lattice mismatch between these two materials is roughly 4 %. The deposited InGaP layer is populated by dislocations that propagate through the material to the substrate, resulting in poor electrical conductivity and minimal light emission if any. The development of graded buffer substrates has enabled the lattice matching of semiconductor materials whose lattice constants are significantly different 2. Layers of incrementally changing percent composition are deposited on a substrate such as GaAs, enabling a gradual change in lattice constant to one that more closely matches that of the active material being deposited. This technology holds great promise for the fabrication of devices with optical emission spectra never before available with traditional substrates. Scope of Thesis: The development of "true green" LEDs and lasers using a graded <b>buffer</b> <b>substrate</b> is explored in this thesis. The aim of this project was to fabricate a green InGaP LED {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of making such a device on a graded <b>buffer</b> <b>substrate.</b> The results of such an endeavor would outline the potential to develop a green InGaP laser diode using a similar heterostructure and a ridge waveguide geometry. The first step in this process was the fabrication of an All InGaP red LED using the waveguide geometry to test the operation of a known LED heterostructure in this geometry. The second step was to fabricate an InGaP LED using the waveguide structure to characterize the optical and electrical properties of the emitting material. This project was successful in the completion of the first step, but was only partially successful in the execution of the second step. The inability to successfully complete a working InGaP LED was the result of a chemistry problem-wet etching. The results of the working All InGaP LED are presented, in addition to the problems encountered during fabrication of InGaP devices. by Josué F. Martínez. Thesis (S. B.)

The multilayer flux transformers having total thickness similar to 2 -mu m were prepared on the <b>buffered</b> MgO <b>substrates</b> and demonstrated an improved insulation between the superconducting layers and an increased dynamic range compared to flux transformers on SrTiO 3 substrates.

40|$|In {{the context}} of superconducting {{electronics}} integrated with traditional silicon-based electronics we grew Si/YSZ/CeO 2 /YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x architectures {{by means of the}} scalable magnetron sputtering growth technique. In this paper we report on structural, surface and electrical transport characterization of typical multilayers. We focus on the electrical transport characterization in the temperature range 18 – 30 K of c-axis YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x films grown on top of several (001) oriented <b>buffered</b> <b>substrates.</b> The electric field vs. current density (E-J) curves exhibit step-like behaviour in correspondence to the transition between the non-dissipative and the flux-flow regimes. This trend is accompanied by the signature of linearly correlated pinning. On the other hand, in the flux-flow regime clear signatures of weak-link behaviour and current percolation are exhibited. In this complex framework possible future applications are discussed. Copyright EDP Sciences/Società Italiana di Fisica/Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{developed}} {{a simple and}} stable precursor solution containing low fluorine content to fabricate YBa 2 Cu 3 Oy (YBCO) films on CeO 2 /YSZ/CeO 2 <b>buffered</b> NiW <b>substrates.</b> The fluorine content in the precursor solution could be controlled at 23. 1 % by tuning the ratio of barium trifluoroacetate to barium acetate. Fast pyrolysis process and smooth surface of YBCO precursor films could be acquired by using the low-fluorine solution. The phase, texture,microstructure, and superconducting properties of YBCO film were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, and four-probe method, respectively. The crystallized YBCO film showed good out-of-plane and in-plane textures. A high critical current density Jc of ∼ 3 MA/cm 2 (77 K, 0 T) could be obtained in the YBCO/CeO 2 /YSZ/CeO 2 /NiW sample derived from the low-fluorine solution. The {{results indicate that the}} controllable fluorine content solution could be useful for epitaxial growth of YBCO films on <b>buffered</b> NiW <b>substrates...</b>|$|R

LBTO films deposited on STO layers exhibited enhanced ferroelectricity and decreased leakage current (9 × 10 - 7 A/cm 2 at 50 kV/cm), conductivity, and Hall mobility, compared to those of LBTO films on MgO substrate. The remanent polarization (Pr) and coercive field (Ec) for LBTO thin films on STO <b>buffered</b> MgO <b>substrate</b> dramatically improved, 36. 5 μC/cm 2 and ~ 220 kV/cm, compared to those for LBTO thin films on MgO substrate, 3 μC/cm 2 and ~ 60 kV/cm.

40|$|The {{concept has}} been {{advanced}} that many enzymes {{are present in}} cells {{in at least two}} forms. The term "lyoenzyme " has been ascribed to the extractable component and "desmoenzyme " to the insoluble fraction which remained fixed to the cellular structural constituents (1 - 3). Lison (4) deserves credit for re-emphasizing the role of these two enzyme components in histochemical analysis. Investigators who have been developing or:employing histochemical techniques have been aware of the significant amount of enzyme which diffuses into the incubation medium. The appearance of the split product in the <b>buffered</b> <b>substrate</b> solution {{as well as in the}} tissue section has been a disturbing feature of many methods. Efforts to reduce this phenomenon have been partly successful by either exposing the tissues to fixatives before incubation, or by adding high concentrations of salts to the incubating solution. These attempts have met with varying degrees of success, depending to a large extent upon the enzyme being investigated, the degree of inhibition by these agents, and the solubility characteristics of the enzyme.

40|$|Impressive {{performance}} {{has been achieved}} in (RE) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -delta (REBCO) coated conductors, but for many applications, the high cost and ac losses remain prohibitive. Inkjet printing methods combine scalability and low equipment cost with high-resolution patterning, potentially addressing both issues by enabling the production of multifilamentary coated conductors without subtractive processing. The successful production of multifilamentary superconducting YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -delta (YBCO) structures by inkjet printing of a low-fluorine YBCO precursor solution on SS/ABAD-YSZ/CZO substrates is reported. Two approaches have been developed. In the first method, YBCO filaments were directly deposited on the <b>buffered</b> <b>substrate</b> by piezoelectric printing; {{and in the second}} approach, CeO 2 tracks were first printed to pattern a subsequently overprinted YBCO film, creating a multifilamentary structure by an inverse technique. Scanning Hall probe measurements have been used to compare the filamentary structures and critical currents achieved by both methods, and a J(c) of up to 3 MA cm(- 2) has been obtained at 77 K. For the inverse printing approach, the ac hysteresis losses have been also measured and compared with theoretical models. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|R

This paper presents the structural, magnetic and electrical properties of La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 (LSMO) thin films deposited on Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 (BTO) /CeO 2 /yttria-stabilised-zirconia (YSZ) <b>buffered</b> Si(001) <b>substrates.</b> A comprehensive X-ray diffraction study was performed in order to investigate the epitaxial quality. The temperature of maximum resistance and the Curie temperature was 390 and 350 K, respectively, for the 50 nm thick films. Preliminary low frequency noise measurements were performed. The normalized Hooge parameter was in the range 10 ^− 27 to 10 ^− 28 m^ 3, which make these films already competitive for uncooled bolometer applications, even if the noise is about one or two orders of magnitude higher than what we typically measured in the best LSMO films deposited on (001) SrTiO 3 substrates.
