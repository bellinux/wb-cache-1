40|$|Historical {{longline}} catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) constitutes the major time series used in tuna stock assessment {{to follow the}} trend in abundance {{since the beginning of}} the large-scale tuna fisheries. The efficiency and species composition <b>of</b> a <b>longline</b> fishing operations essentially depends on the overlap in the vertical and spatial distribution between hooks and species habitat. Longline catchability depends on the vertical distribution of hooks and the aim of our paper was to analyse principal factors affecting the deviation <b>of</b> observed <b>longline</b> hook depths from predicted values. Since observed hook depth is usually shallower than predicted, this deviation is called longline shoaling. We evaluate the accuracy of hook depth distribution estimated from a theoretical catenary model commonly used in longline CPUE standardizations. Temperature-depth recorders (TDRs) were deployed on <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> a monitored <b>longline.</b> Mainline shapes and maximum fishing depths were similar to gear configurations commonly used to target both yellowfin and bigeye tuna by commercial longliners in the central part of the South Pacific Ocean. Our working hypothesis assumes that the maximum fishing depth reached by the mainline depends on the gear configuration (sag ratio, mainline length per basket), the fishing tactics (bearing of the setting) and environmental variables characterizing water mass dynamics (wind stress, current velocity and shear). Based on generalized additive models (GAMs) simple transformations are proposed to account for the non-linearity between the shoaling and explanatory variables. Then, generalized linear models (GLMs) were fit to model the effects of explanatory variables on the longline shoaling. Results indicated that the shoaling (absolute as well as relative) was significantly influenced by (I) the shape of the mainline (i. e., the tangential angle), which is the strongest predictor, and (2) the current shear and the direction of setting. Geometric forcing (i. e. transverse versus in-line) between the environment and the longline set is shown for the first time from in situ experimental fishing data. Results suggest that a catenary model that does not take these factors into consideration provides a biased estimate of the vertical distribution of hooks and must be used with caution in CPUEs standardization methods. Since catchability varies in time and space we discuss how suitable data could be routinely collected onboard commercial fishing vessels in order to estimate longline catchability for stock assessments...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{longline}} fishing {{can be understood}} as a case study of the cultural, economic, environmental and social impacts of unsustainable fishing technology. While much attention has been attributed to the impact <b>of</b> industrial <b>longlines</b> on the marine ecosystem, {{little is known about the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing on local food security, employment, cultural belief systems and traditions, revenue generation from marine tourism and climate change. New data demonstrate that the contributions of Marine Protected Areas, marine tourism and recreational fishing to local coastal economies dwarf the contributions <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing. When combined with the impact of overfishing on coastal fishing communities and fish consumers, policies promoting sustainable fisheries must be expanded to take these other factors into account along with issues <b>of</b> biodiversity. <b>Longline</b> fishing Sea turtles Recreational fishing Marine tourism...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{and deep}} sea fishing are the main sub sectors of Sri Lankan fishery industry. The deep sea {{fisheries}} in Sri Lanka have been in existence since the early 1980. Sri Lanka coastal fishing sector mainly uses conventional methods with less capital investments. Dispute of this, coastal fish production of Sri Lanka {{is higher than the}} deep sea fish production. Longline and gillnet are the two widely use fishing methods in {{deep sea fishing}} sector. In this paper economic efficiency, Post Harvest Fish Lost (PHFL) <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing are evaluated and identified. Similar evaluation is conducted for gillnet fishing to compare the position <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing in the deep sea fishing sector. Research methodology for economic efficiency and PHFL was developed using the findings of literature survey. Primary data were collected from 150 deep sea vessels operated in Negombo fishery harbour. 3, 346 deep sea fishing vessels are operated in Sri Lanka in the year 2010 according to the fishery statistic 2010, issued by Ministry of fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development (MFARD). Data collection was done during February through October of 2011 in Negombo fishery harbour. Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) measures the net gain from a capital investment. ARR is use to evaluate and identify the economic efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing and gillnet fishing. To calculate ARR, capital investments, fix costs, variable costs, revenues, number of fishing trips per years are used. Further this paper investigates the trend <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing in the Sri Lanka. Secondary data from MFARD and FAO were used to evaluate and identify the trend. Findings indicate that the ARR for longline fishing are attractive and comparatively higher than gillnet fishing. It is found that PHFL <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> Fishing is very less. PHFL <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing is found as around 12. 5 % of gillnet fishing. Further deep sea fishing sector demonstrates impressive improvement during last few years. Hence the results conclude that high return and high quality standard <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> fishing. This will make longline fishing more popular and attractive in deep sea fishery sector. Further Deep sea fishing will dominate Sri Lanka fishery sector as implied in trend analysis. Hence longline fishing will be very significant in Sri Lanka fishery sector. It is suggested that in order to improve the fisher sector in Sri Lanka, longline fishing should be promoted by placing right credit mechanism to the fishermen, easy and affordable access to modern technology and right infrastructures for longline vessels in fishery harbours...|$|R

40|$|I {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} 11 variables on the catchability <b>of</b> pelagic <b>longlines,</b> which are used to catch tunas and billfishes in the open ocean. Extension of the depth range and the duration <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> operations have reduced the catchability of several epipelagic species, such as mako sharks (Isurus spp.), since industrial longlining commenced in the tropical Pacific Ocean in the early 1950 s. Reductions in the body size of many species also resulted in reduced searching for food and fewer encounters with longline hooks. By contrast, the catchability of commercially valuable species, like bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), increased substantially {{as a result of}} the extension of the depth range <b>of</b> <b>longlines</b> and the longer duration of fishing operations. Stronger and less visible line materials, new bait species, and skipper experience also contributed to increased catchability. Dedicated surveys should be used to obtain fishery independent estimates of abundance. Another option is to use surveys to measure variations in the relationship between longline catch rates and animal abundance...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimation}} method for the three-dimensional underwater shape <b>of</b> tuna <b>longlines</b> is developed, using measurements of depth obtained from micro-bathythermographs (BTs) {{attached to the}} main line at equally spaced intervals. The shape of the main line is approximated by a model which consists of a chain of unit length lines (folding-rule model), where the junction points are placed at the observed depths. Among the infinite number of possible shapes, the most likely shape {{is considered to be}} the smoothest one that can be obtained with a numerical optimization algorithm. To validate the method, a series <b>of</b> experimental <b>longline</b> operations were conducted in the equatorial region of the eastern Pacific Ocean, using 13 or 14 micro-BTs per <b>basket</b> <b>of</b> main line. Concurrent observations of oceanographic conditions (currents and temperature structure) were obtained. The shape of the main line can be calculated at arbitrary times during operations. Shapes were consistent with the current structure. On the equator, the line was elevated significantly by the Equatorial Undercurrent. It is shown that the shape of main line depends primarily upon the vertical shear and direction of the current relative to the gear. Time sequences of calculated shapes reveals that observed periodic (1 - 2 hours) oscillations in depth of the gear was caused by swinging movements of the main line. The shortening rate of the main line is an important parameter for formulating the shape <b>of</b> the <b>longline,</b> and its precise measurement is desirable...|$|R

40|$|During {{seven days}} of {{operations}} involving the setting and hauling <b>of</b> <b>longlines</b> to catch the toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides around the South Sandwich Islands, actual and potential interactions with seabirds were assessed. Bird numbers increased rapidly after dawn and large numbers of Cape, giant and storm petrels and smaller numbers of white-chinned petrels and black-browed albatrosses were present during day hauling operations. No incidental mortality was seen and only one bird was caught on a hook; nevertheless many species in these aggregations of birds are clearly potentially vulnerable to setting operations in daylight hours. Several species of the seabirds present presumably originated from South Georgia populations; however wandering and grey-headed albatrosses, whose populations are in serious decline at South Georgia, were rare; their vulnerability to longlining operations in the South Sandwich Islands may, therefore, be low. Quantitative data and observations <b>of</b> <b>longline</b> vessels fishing around South Georgia, however, indicate significant catch rates of albatrosses...|$|R
