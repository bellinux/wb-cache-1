50|$|India has {{a growing}} {{population}}, and large impoverished rural population {{that relies on}} monsoon-irrigated agriculture. Weather uncertainties, and potential climate change induced weather volatilities, raise concerns of social stability and impact of floods and droughts on rural poverty. The population of India {{is expected to grow}} further at a decelerating pace and stabilize around 1.5 billion by 2050, or another 300 million people - the size of United States - compared to the 2011 census. This will increase demand for reliable sources of food and improved agriculture yields - both of which, claims India's National Council of Applied Economic Research, require significantly improve irrigation network than the current state. The average rainfall in India is about 4,000 <b>billion</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre,</b> of which annual surface water flow in India is estimated at 1,869 <b>billion</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre.</b> Of this, for topological and other reasons, only about 690 <b>billion</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> of the available surface water can be utilised for irrigation, industrial, drinking and ground water replenishment purposes. In other words, about 1,100 <b>billion</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metre</b> of water is available, on average, every year for irrigation in India. This amount of water is adequate for irrigating 140 million hectares. As of 2007, about 60% of this potential was realized through irrigation network or natural flow of Indian rivers, lakes and adoption of pumps to pull ground water for irrigation.|$|R

25|$|There are {{numerous}} deposits of oil sands in the world, {{but the biggest}} and most important are in Canada and Venezuela, with lesser deposits in Kazakhstan and Russia. The total volume of non-conventional oil in the oil sands of these countries exceeds the reserves of conventional oil in all other countries combined. Vast deposits of bitumen – over 350 <b>billion</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> (2.2 trillion barrels) of oil in place – exist in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. If only 30% of this oil could be extracted, it could supply the entire needs of North America for over 100 years at 2002 consumption levels. These deposits represent plentiful oil, but not cheap oil. They require advanced technology to extract the oil and transport it to oil refineries.|$|E
25|$|Successive {{years of}} drought from 1998–2002 had {{dramatically}} lowered water levels {{in all of}} the main reservoirs. 1998–1999 was the worst drought year in Israel for the past 100 years. The following years were also characterized by less than average rainfall which led to a shortfall of some half a billion cubic meters in Israel's water balance each year, in comparison to an average year. The winters of 2002–03 and 2003–04 were characterized by average and higher than average rainfall which led to a significant rise in the water level of the Sea of Galilee and in the collection of floodwater in catchment reservoirs. However, the country's aquifers have remained depleted. It was estimated in 2003 that increased water demand and decreased water availability has led to a cumulative deficit of nearly 2 <b>billion</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>metres.</b> In 2008 another drought occurred.|$|E

In 2012, the Barryroe field was confirmed to have up to 1.6 billion barrels of oil in reserve, with between 160 and 600 million recoverable.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is a major contributor to Norway’s economy and the country as a whole. In the last 50 years, 6. 6 <b>billion</b> standard <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> of oil equivalents have been extracted from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). There are an estimated 7. 7 <b>billion</b> standard <b>cubic</b> <b>metres</b> of oil equivalents left in the ground. This includes both oil and gas. To be able to extract the remaining resources, there is a significant need for further investments. This thesis will try to answer the following question: What is the estimated future requirement for investment in the NCS in order to extract the remaining oil and gas resources? The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) has a database that contains information of all the resources. The resources are divided into four: undiscovered resources, discovered resources, resources in production and sold resources. This information has been used to find the remaining resources for each class in barrels per oil equivalent. Rystad Energy has a database containing costs per field at fields in the NCS. Using this database they have estimated the future unit costs to be 8 for exploration, 14 for development and 9 for production. All costs are in USD per barrel of oil equivalents. The conclusion of this paper estimate future requirement for investment in the NCS to extract the remaining oil and gas resources to be USD 1058. 6 billion. The need for investment to explore, develop and produce the undiscovered resources is USD 569. 4 billion. Discovered resources have a need for investment of USD 368. 8 billion to be developed and produced. Resources in production have a need for investment of USD 120. 4 billion to be produced. NCS is divided in three regions, The North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. The estimated need for investment for each region is USD 475. 3 billion for the North Sea, USD 261. 2 billion for the Norwegian Sea and USD 321. 8 billion for the Barents Sea. In the work of this thesis there have been used different unit cost scenarios to show how this affects the overall need for investment in the NCS and for each region. Results regarding an overall unit cost increase, investment needed at different sizes of undiscovered resources and resource life are also presented in this paper. The results are uncertain for many reasons. The undiscovered resources are only estimated values based on geological methods and the exact size of the remaining resources can only be taken for granted when the resources eventually are produced and sold. The unit cost per barrel of oil equivalents is an estimation of future costs which is by nature uncertain...|$|R
