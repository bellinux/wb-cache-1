5|$|After meeting M-43, the two {{trunklines}} run concurrently {{for about}} a mile (1.6km) before M-50 breaks off to the southwest near Woodbury. From there, the road continues in its southeasterly path along Clinton Trail through the northeast part of Eaton County as it runs through fields to Charlotte. Just prior to entering the city, the road <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the south and near the middle of town it has a junction with M-79 and Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69). After this intersection, M-50 continues south concurrent with the business loop for a several blocks before turning eastward. On {{the eastern end of}} town, it has an interchange with I-69 at exit60.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the airport, Highway 82 turns due south. It <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the {{southeast}} {{to cross the}} new Maroon Creek Bridge, with the original, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, immediately to its south. At this point, with a golf course on the north side, the Aspen city limit begins to follow the road, {{and by the time}} it goes through a roundabout and passes the Holden/Marolt Mining and Ranching Museum to the south it is fully in the city of Aspen. Another stream crossing, Castle Creek, brings the highway into the developed portion of the city.|$|E
5|$|Continuing its north/northeast winding, the Sprain Brook enters an {{interchange}} with NY100B (Dobbs Ferry Road), {{passing by}} East Rumbrook Park. Crossing over NY119 in Elmsford, the parkway enters an interchange with Interstate 287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). After crossing through the interchange, the Spain continues northward as a six-lane parkway {{back through the}} town of Greenburgh, entering an interchange with NY100C (Grasslands Road). Paralleling NY100 to the west, the parkway, bending northward into Mount Pleasant and an interchange with County Route301 (Bradhurst Entrance North Road), which connects to NY100 (Bradhurst Avenue). North of that junction, the southbound lanes of the Sprain Brook interchange with a crossing NY100.

5|$|From there, NY454 {{turns to}} the southeast, {{intersecting}} with NY111 (Wheeler Road) and narrowing to two lanes. After turning further to the south, the highway intersects with CR67, the former alignment of the Long Island Motor Parkway. Here, NY454 returns to four lanes and meets the Long Island Expressway (Interstate495) and its frontage roads. The route enters the village of Islandia and enters a large commercial district, where the route intersects with CR100 (Old Nichols Road). After crossing the Long Island Rail Road, NY454 enters Connetquot River State Park, <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the east and traverses the park. Crossing over the Connetquot River, the arterial crosses a hiking trail and soon leaves the park.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Onondaga territory, {{the route}} {{initially}} serves {{only a handful}} of scattered homes separated by long stretches of dense forests. After , however, the road <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the northeast and enters the town of Onondaga and the hamlet of Indian Village, the main population center of the reservation. NY11A quickly runs through the linear community, crossing Hemlock Creek on its way to another lightly developed, mostly wooded stretch along the east bank of Onondaga Creek. The route passes {{only a handful of}} isolated homes before ending at an intersection with US11 on the northern edge of the reservation. The junction is located just south of the hamlet of Nedrow, located along US11 between the Onondaga territory and the Syracuse city line.|$|E

5|$|NY324 crosses {{its last}} major route, Transit Road (NY78), on an {{overpass}} {{just north of}} the once-thriving Eastern Hills Mall, which had been the premier mall in the Buffalo area until it began losing tenants and customers to the larger Walden Galleria in Cheektowaga. Beyond Transit, the road is still four-lane but primarily residential as it enters the Town of Clarence. After Harris Hill Road, the highway <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the southeast once again for a final mile into its eastern end at Main Street (NY5). This last section was widened from two lanes to four in the mid-1990s, and has seen some development but still remains lightly trafficked most of the day.|$|E
5|$|NY454 {{continues}} as a four-lane arterial {{through a large}} commercial district, intersecting with CR93 (Lakeland Avenue). There, the highway passes Long Island MacArthur Airport and <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles. The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four-lane arterial {{for the last two}} miles (3.2km) of NY454. About three miles (4.8km) from Lakeland Avenue, NY454 connects to the Sunrise Highway (NY27) at exit51, a partial interchange in Holbrook. Here, the NY454 designation ends and its right-of-way merges into the eastbound service road of NY27. There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY454 itself; instead, the connection is made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Unionville, {{the route}} slowly <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, {{paralleling}} the former right-of-way of the Middletown and New Jersey Railroad (MNJ) as it runs northwest through farmlands. At the far {{eastern end of}} the hamlet of Waterloo Mills, the highway also begins to follow Rutgers Creek. The waterway, the former railroad right-of-way and the road take similar paths to the hamlet of Westtown, where NY284 serves as the main northsouth route through the community. It passes Lockenhurst Pond {{in the southern part}} of the hamlet before meeting CR1 near Art Fords Lake. Past Westtown, NY284 winds its way northeastward across another rural part of Minisink, intersecting CR62 and CR22 at back-to-back junctions near the northern town line. The latter route provides access to the hamlet of Johnson, which NY284 bypasses to the southeast.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{intersection}} with Oak Hill Road, Route4 transitions from a divided arterial highway into a four-lane limited-access freeway. The freeway passes {{to the west}} of Belleville Pond and begins to parallel the alignment of Route102 (Ten Rod Road) near the community of Lafayette. Route4 passes over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad before entering the business district of Wickford Junction. The freeway interchanges with Routes2 and102 at exit5, a partial cloverleaf interchange. After the interchange, Route4 <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, beginning a parallel alignment with Route2 that continues to its northern terminus. Route4 crosses into the town of East Greenwich, passing under South Road before interchanging with Route2 at exit6, a partial cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
5|$|Starting at {{its western}} {{terminus}} at the Vienna/Fairfax-GMU station in Virginia, the tracks {{run on the}} median strip of Interstate 66 until they enter a tunnel under Fairfax Drive just before the Ballston-MU station. Although originally proposed to follow I-66 through Arlington, city planners successfully argued that the line be relocated to Fairfax Drive, which has since stimulated high rise development along the line's route. At the Clarendon station, the tunnel shifts to Wilson Blvd. and 16th Street North. The tunnel then turns north and merges with the Blue Line just before entering the Rosslyn station which is located under North Lynn Street. The tunnel continues under the Potomac River and <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the east to travel under I Street NW in the District of Columbia.|$|E

5|$|The route {{parallels}} the Bronx River Parkway (BRP) as it enters Westchester's county seat, White Plains. Within {{the city of}} White Plains, NY22 is maintained by Westchester County with the unsigned designations of County Route53 (CR53) from the Scarsdale line to NY125, CR108 between NY125 and Westchester Avenue, and CR87 from Broadway to the North Castle line. NY22 also intersects NY125 and NY119 in downtown White Plains, then <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the northwest along North Broadway, eventually intersecting the Cross-Westchester Expressway (Interstate287 or I-287). White Plains Rural Cemetery is visible to the west as NY22 continues northward out of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{rural road}} <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the {{southeast}} gradually, entering {{the town of}} Lapeer, turning east again until it meets CR133 (Clarks Corner Road). The highway soon reverts to a southeast direction, passing {{to the north of}} Beaver Pond and the county line, while NY221 enters the hamlet of Hunts Corners and intersects with CR136 (Jennings Creek Road). Here, NY221 changes direction again, following a northeasterly path out of the hamlet. It bypasses the nearby hamlet of Clarks Corner and soon intersects with the eastern terminus of CR133, which gives way to NY221 as the state road merges with the east–west county highway. NY221 continues on an eastward track into the town of Marathon, where it descends into the Tioughnioga River valley and enters the village of Marathon.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Barnes Corners, NY177 {{returns to}} being the two-lane rural roadway, {{progressing}} southeastward through the town of Pinckney. Despite the rural scenery, the route does enter the hamlet of New Boston and the junction with CR23 (Liberty Road). Passing a few farms, the route turns to the northeast near Mile Square Road, and enters the hamlet of Bellwood, within the town of Harrisburg. Bellwood consists of a few houses and an intersection with CR27 and CR28 (Sears Pond Road). Leaving Bellwood, NY177 continues eastward into the hamlet of Windecker, which consists only of a few houses. Leaving Windecker, NY177 <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the southeast and enters the town of Lowville, passing a few farms and wind turbines before bending into the hamlet of West Lowville.

5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E
5|$|SR15 {{ends at the}} Michigan {{state line}} just north of Pioneer, Ohio, where it becomes M-99. The roadway travels northward from the state line on Pioneer Road, through mostly {{agricultural}} areas of Hillsdale County before reaching a junction with M-34 just west of Osseo. The trunkline turns westward on Hudson Road, which curves to the north around Baw Beese Lake just southeast of Hillsdale. M-99 passes through Hillsdale on a northwest course on Broad Street and Carlton Road, passing {{just a few blocks}} to the west of Hillsdale College. After leaving town, the road <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the north as Olds Street as it runs parallel to the St. Joseph River to Jonesville. In that community, M-99 intersects US12. The two highways run concurrently through Jonesville for less than half a mile (0.8km) before M-99 returns to its northwesterly course. It leaves the town toward Litchfield continuing parallel to the river.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas Turnpike then leaves Lawrence and <b>bends</b> <b>to</b> the {{northeast}} before leaving Douglas County and entering Leavenworth. It overpasses Mud Creek before passing under K-32. Northeast of here at mile 209, the Lawrence Service Area {{is located in}} the median. Afterward, the turnpike has a diamond interchange with 222nd Street, which is signed as Leavenworth County Road 1, at Exit 212 (Tonganoxie/Eudora). The highway then travels northeast and passes through it eastern terminal toll booth. This is the final toll booth on the route travelling east and all vehicles must pay their final toll before continuing. The turnpike then enters Bonner Springs. It crosses Wolf Creek before leaving Leavenworth County and entering Wyandotte County. In Bonner Springs, the turnpike intersects K-7, westbound US-24, westbound US-40, and the southern terminus of US-73 at Exit 224 (Bonner Springs, formerly Exit 223) with a trumpet interchange. The mileposts on the route switch to match those of I-70 after this interchange.|$|E
