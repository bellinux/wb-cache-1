50|$|The Brandberg Massif or Brandberg Intrusion is a {{granitic}} intrusion, {{which forms}} a dome-shaped massif. It originated during Early Cretaceous rifting {{that led to}} the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. Argon-argon dating yielded intrusive ages of 132 to 130 Ma. The dominant plutonic rock is a homogeneous medium grained biotite-hornblende granite. In the western interior of the massif (Naib gorge), a 2 km in diameter body of pyroxene-bearing monzonite is exposed. The youngest intrusive rocks based on cross-cutting relations are arfvedsonite granite dikes and sills in the southwestern periphery of the Brandberg massif which crop out in the Amis valley. The arfvedsonite granites contain minerals rich in rare-earth element minerals such as pyrochlore and <b>bastnaesite.</b> Remnants of Cretaceous volcanic rocks are preserved in a collar along the western and southern margins of the massif. Their angle of dip increases towards the contact where clasts of country-rock occur within the granite forming a magmatic breccia. The origins of the magmas that formed the Brandberg intrusion are related to emplacement of mantle-derived basaltic magma during continental break-up which led to partial melting of crustal rocks resulting in a hybrid granitic magma. Erosion subsequently removed the overburden rock. Apatite fission track dating indicates approximately 5 km denudation between 80 and 60 Ma.|$|E

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of the mixed RE (rare earth) concentrate <b>bastnaesite</b> (RECO 3 F) and monazite (REPO 4) {{has been investigated}} extensively for a few decades. In this work, a novel environmental friendly Na 2 CO 3 -based roasting decomposition strategy for the mixed RE concentrate has been proposed. It is a two-step strategy combining air-oxidation and Na 2 CO 3 -roasting. In {{the first step of}} air-oxidation, almost all of <b>bastnaesite</b> decomposes. While more than 95 % of monazite decomposes in the second Na 2 CO 3 -roasting step. Thus, the consumption of Na 2 CO 3 in the current proposed process would decrease greatly. The Na 2 CO 3 -roasting phenomena were compared among the reactions of Na 2 CO 3 -mixed RE concentrate, Na 2 CO 3 -pure <b>bastnaesite</b> and Na 2 CO 3 -the first leaching residue by H 2 SO 4. The air-roasting temperature was optimized. In particular, the roasting temperature for the reaction of Na 2 CO 3 and H 2 SO 4 -leaching residue has been optimized according to P- and Ce-leaching percents. Finally, following the proposed flowsheet under the optimized conditions, taking 50 g of mixed RE concentrate as feedings, the final solid residue occupies around 2. 4 %. In addition, about 70 % of F and 87 % of P can be transferred into H 2 SO 4 -leaching liquor and H 2 O-leaching liquor, respectively. 93. 7 % of Th and 96. 6 % of RE can be leached.

The {{results showed that the}} decomposition processes of REE in magnetic tailing were divided into two steps. The first step from 380 to 431 °C mainly entailed the decomposition of <b>bastnaesite</b> (REFCO 3). The second step from 605 to 716 °C mainly included the decomposition of monazite (REPO 4). The decomposition products were primarily RE 2 O 3, Ce 0. 75 Nd 0. 25 O 1. 875, CeO 2, Ca 5 F(PO 4) 3, and CaF 2. Adding CaO could reduce the decomposition temperature of REFCO 3 and REPO 4. Meanwhile, the decomposition effect of CaO on <b>bastnaesite</b> and monazite was significant. Besides, the effects of the roasting time, roasting temperature, and CaO addition level on the decomposition rate were studied. The optimum technological conditions were a roasting time of 60 min; roasting temperature of 750 °C; and CaO addition level of 20 % (w/w). The maximum decomposition rate of REFCO 3 and REPO 4 was 99. 87 %. The roasting time and temperature were the major factors influencing the decomposition rate.

40|$|The Hoidas Lake Rare Earth Element (REE) Deposit is one {{of several}} REE showings which are {{spatially}} associated with a regional-scale fault system that cuts through the Rae Province in northern Saskatchewan. The showings occur along the Hoidas-Nisikkatch fault, believed to be a subsidiary of the Black Bay Fault, and consist of multiple REE-enriched veins. Surface outcrops and drilling have delineated a vein system, called the JAK zone, which extends for over 1 km along strike, with the system remaining open both along strike and down dip. The majority of the REE are hosted by fluorapatite and allanite-(Ce), although there are also minor amounts of monazite, <b>bastnaesite</b> and chevkinite which can contain significant concentrations of REE. The veins are dominantly LREE-enriched, specifically La, Ce, and Nd. The mineralization at Hoidas Lake is complex, with the chemical and mineralogical compositions changing with each vein generation. The earliest veins consist of REE-bearing allanite and chevkinite which occur in association with clinopyroxene, titanite, and hyalophane. The allanite-rich veins are followed by veins dominated by red or green apatite, both of which are typically brecciated. Finally, there is a late apatite which crosscuts all previous vein generations. Each of the distinct apatite generations shows discrete chemical variations, particularly in their light rare earth element content, with the total rare earth oxide content ranging from approximately 1. 5 % in the oldest apatite to as much as 5 % in the green apatite. The majority of the apatite and allanite crystals are strongly zoned, reflecting the chemical changes in the mineralizing system through time and, particularly in the earliest vein generations, there are signs of hydrothermal alteration. The early apatite generations typically show the development of monazite inclusions which suggests interaction with hydrothermal fluids, as do the REE-poor rims and <b>bastnaesite</b> alteration observed in the majority of the allanites. The veins are fault controlled and are interpreted to be late magmatic- hydrothermal in origin, with the fluid derived from a magmatic source at depth. Although the exact source of the fluids remains uncertain, the high concentration of REE, as well as Sr and Ba, and a relative depletion in high field strength elements suggests that the mineralization may be related to either an alkali or carbonatitic source...|$|E

40|$|Two {{contrasting}} {{swarms of}} pegmatite dikes occur intermingled in the Pikes Peak granite and in related alkalic granites in the Mount Rosa area, west of Colorado Springs. One is the older calc-alkalic Pikes Peak type; the younger is the alkalic Mount Rosa type. The accessory assemblage of the Mount Rosa quartz-microcline-riebeckite pegmatites consists chiefly of radioactive zircon, fluorite, astrophyllite, thorite, and lesser amounts of pyrochlore, rutile, niobian rutile, columbite, bertrandite and rare aluminofluorides. These dikes intrude both the Pikes Peak and its derivative fayaiite granites along north-east-trending fractures. These pegmatites contrast markedly with the coexisting Pikes Peak pegmatites, which {{are characterized by}} quartz and amazonite crystals, zircon, biotite, siderite, and minor topaz, allanite, cassiterite and genthelvite. The Pikes Peak type occurs as segregations and injected bodies only within Pikes Peak granite. Age determinations on zircons from pegmatites of the Mount Rosa type proved to be inconsistent, but ages determined {{by means of the}} Kao/Ara 0 method on pegmatitic rie-beckite are consistent rvith geological evidence and age determinations on the granites, giving an age of 1040 my. INrnolucrroN Discoverl ' of unusual minerals in pegmatites of the St. Peters Dome district, Mount Rosa area, Colorado, attracted the attention of mineralo-gists as earlv as 1877 (Koenig, 1877). <b>Bastnaesite</b> and fluocerite were among the earliest found (Allen and Comstock, 1880).

40|$|Monazite {{structural}} group includes arsenates, phosphates, and silicates, with general formulae A B O 4, (A = Bi, Ca, Rare Earth Elements, Th, U and B = As 5 +, P 5 +, Si 4 +). Among them, the phosphate monazite {{is the most}} abundant independent Rare Earth Element mineral, occurring in several geological sites. It presents a variable composition and morphology and has strong chemical and physical stability. This paper presents a review about this mineral, particularly for monazite associated with carbonatite complexes. Detailed study of the composition of monazite will improve geochemical and petrological interpretations. In the economic field, monazite is, with <b>bastnaesite,</b> an ore mineral present in the main deposits in the world; its morphological and composition characteristics have influence in ore quality and in efficiency of concentration processes. Since the seventhies, its importance reachs the environmental field and his highly stable structure has been investigated as model for a synthetic phase to long-term storage of radionuclides from nuclear waste. The most important monazite ore deposits in Brazil are alluvional Monazite occurs also in other materials, mainly in carbonatites and their weathering products, which may constitute important source of REE. In these rocks, because its high stability and possibility of weathering genesis, monazite {{is the most important}} among the phosphate minerals. However, researches about monazite associated with Brazilian carbonatitic materials have shown mainly unfavourable morphological characteristics for economic profit...|$|E
40|$|Incipient charnockitisation of an A-type granite protolith {{has been}} {{recognized}} in a spectacular outcrop 35 km north of Antananarivo. The charnockites form structurally-controlled dark greenish patches suggesting channelized fluid transfer, during and after partial reworking of the granite coeval with the Antananarivo virgation zone (ca 560 Ma) and/or the Angavo shear zone of late-Panafrican age (ca 550 Ma). They are characterized by a significant increase of the bulk magnetic susceptibility. The granitic protolith contains quartz, perthitic alkali feldspar, high-Ti hastingsitand accessory minerals (apatite, allanite, magnetite and zircon). The charnockitic granite contains quartz, perthitic alkali feldspar and ghost (altered) orthopyroxene crystals, as well as secondary low-Ti hastingsite surrounding orthopyroxene. The large increase of magnetic susceptibility magnitudes {{is related to the}} formation of pockets of secondary magnetite, spatially associated with quartz and other accessories, such as fluorine, calcite, <b>bastnaesite,</b> sphalerite, Ti-oxide and (Ca, REE) fluor-carbonates, in fluid percolation zones or in reaction rims around ghost orthopyroxene. Fluid inclusions entrapped in quartz grains witness the presence of CO 2 -rich hydrocarbonic fluids of low salinity, that are more abundant in charnockites than in granites. It is suggested that the rocks underwent a rather long history of fluid percolation, leading to prograde and then retrograde transformations. The corresponding metasomatic changes point to the mobility of Ti, Fe, Ca, Zn, F and REE. These changes are consistent with the CO 2 -rich nature of the percolating fluids...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} model is presented for {{the generation of}} crustal carbonatites in rift environments from mantle carbon, both primordial and recycled through subduction. The carbon {{is involved in the}} generation of melts in the asthenosphere and the melts are then processed in the lithosphere associated with continental rifting. Parental nephelinitic melts from about 75 km depth then yield the carbon in the form of carbonatite at shallower depths in the upper mantle, or within the crust. Selected experimental phase equilibrium data are reviewed to test parts of the model. Similar tests can be made for carbonatites formed in different tectonic environments. Experiments with lherzolite (synthetic and natural) confirm that with CO_ 2 and H_ 2 O at depths greater than about 75 km, near-solidus liquids correspond to Ca-Mg carbonatites, enriched in alkalis; the prospect that primary carbonatites could be erupted from the mantle justifies a search for them, but volume relationships favor an origin by differentiation for most occurrences. A wide miscibility gap between silicate and carbonate liquids with variable Ca/Na and Ca/Mg extends from crust to mantle pressures, but primitive CO_ 2 -bearing nephelinites do not yield immiscible carbonatite magmas at 75 km depth; immiscibility should occur commonly at shallower depths, certainly in the crust. Fractional crystallization of nepheline-normative magmas in the crust can yield the series of rocks occurring in some alkalic complexes with carbonatites. Carbonatite magmas differentiate: crystallization paths confirm the prospect of fractional crystallization of dolomite and calcite and the coprecipitation of calcite and <b>bastnaesite</b> from magmas...|$|E
40|$|Carbonatites {{associated}} with alkalic rocks of the McClure Mountain and Gem Park Complexes, and the complex at Democrat Creek, {{can be classified}} into two distinct groups, replacement and primary magmatic, based on distinctive petrographic differences. These two groups also show ' distinctive differences in mineralogy and geochemistry. Replace-ment carbonatites hoxv textures indicating nearly complete pseudomorphous replacement of originally porphyritic or hypidiomorphic-granular igneous dike rocks by carbonate minerals. They contain an element suite characteristic of carbonatites {{as well as a}} trace element signature indicative of a mafic silicate precursor. Minerals containing thorium, niobium, and rare earth elements as essential constituents are generally rare. Primary magmatic carbonatites, which do not show the distinctive replacement textures, are also enriched in elements characteristic of carbonatites but contain greater average amounts of these elements than replacement carbonatites. Thorite, <b>bastnaesite,</b> synchisite, ancylite, and monazite are chiefly responsible for the high thorium and rare earth element content of these rocks compared to other igneous rocks. Primary magmatic carbonatites are spacially more closely {{associated with}} the alkalic intrusions than are replacement car-bonarites. which have a somewhat wider distribution. Field data and 3 • 80 and values support an igneous origin for primary magmatic carbonatites; isotopic values also indicate that the carbonatite replacing the earlier alkalic dikes also was derived from igneous sources. Exchange of isotopes between both types of carbonatite and nonigneous reservoirs appears to be minimal. Abundances of rare earth elements and niobium in carbonatites of the Wet Mountains are somewhat lower than those at other carbonatite localities containing economic or near-economic concentrations. Thorium is more abundant in closely related vein-type deposits than in the carbonatites...|$|E
40|$|Alkaline granites {{have high}} K + Na vs Si ratios. Some {{of the best}} studied of these are in the Kola Province of NW Russia where they are {{characterized}} by high Rare Earth Element (REE) concentrations which stabilize a remarkable range of rare REE-rich minerals. The {{northern part of the}} Indian Plate in northern Pakistan is intruded by a number of Upper Carboniferous alkaline complexes including the Ambela and Warsak plutons. As in the Kola Peninsula, the alkaline granites of northern Pakistan host a range of REE-rich minerals. Many of these are of gem quality. Zagi Mountain is located in the Warsak area of the Mulla Ghori tehsil of the Kyber Agency, part of the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan. The area is underlain by granites of the Warsak igneous complex. The Warsak complex is made up of a series of sill-like alkaline granites, micro-granites, gabbros and dolerites. The granitic rocks contain aegirine, riebeckite and astrophyllite. The granites are rich in the rare earth elements and contain a number of REE-bearing gem minerals. These include bastnaesite-(Ce), parasite-(Ce), monazite-(Ce), xenotime-(Y), titanite, genthelvite, eudideymite together with non REE-bearing grossular garnet, quartz and zircon. (Khan & Marwat, 2007). Analytical data presented here document the chemistry of light REE bearing <b>bastnaesite,</b> parisite and monazite, and heavy REE bearing xenotime. Most of the REE phases are located along fractures and veins or in vugs and show good crystal shapes. These textures are typical of minerals precipitated into open space fillings from hydrothermal fluids. This suggests fractionation of the REE into late stages of the alkaline magma prior to their being partitioned into hydrothermal fluids...|$|E
