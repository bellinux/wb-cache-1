5|$|Davenport {{experienced}} {{an economic and}} building boom in the 1920s and early 1930s. The Kahl Building and the Capitol Theatre, the <b>baseball</b> <b>stadium,</b> the Parker Building, and the Blackhawk Hotel {{are a few of}} the buildings built during this time period that are still standing. The Great Depression brought economic tough times to the city. The inclusion of new factories in the 1940s and 1950s helped turn the economy around after World War II. Davenport was on hard times once again with the farm crisis of the 1980s, when the Caterpillar Plant closed, costing 35,000 jobs. The city was rejuvenated once again in the 1990s and present by renovations and building additions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} a {{cultural}} phenomenon that {{is driven by the}} demolition of Major League <b>Baseball</b> <b>stadiums,</b> ballparks, and fields. Prompted by their inherent role {{in the evolution of the}} sport and the inadequacies of the existing historic preservation framework, this study examines how American society preserves this utilitarian form, after their demolition, through observations, data collection, and analysis. In doing so, this study exposes that Major League <b>Baseball</b> <b>stadiums,</b> ballparks, and fields are preserved through the use of nine overlapping preservation methods, which memorialize five significant features. However, though these preservation methods do not prevent Major League <b>Baseball</b> <b>stadiums</b> from being demolished, they do illustrate how our society alternatively preserves historically and culturally significant resources when the existing historic preservation framework is rendered incompatible...|$|R

5|$|Norfolk's {{city leaders}} began a long push to revive its urban core. While Granby Street {{underwent}} decline, Norfolk city leaders {{focused on the}} waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's skyline have been erected. In 1983, the city and The Rouse Company developed the Waterside festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment. Other facilities opened in the ensuing years, including the Harbor Park <b>baseball</b> <b>stadium,</b> home of the Norfolk Tides Triple-A minor league baseball team. In 1995, the park was named the finest facility in minor league baseball by Baseball America. Norfolk's efforts to revitalize its downtown have attracted acclaim from economic development and urban planning circles throughout the country. Downtown's rising fortunes helped to expand the city's revenues and allowed the city to direct attention to other neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is not gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would even {{want to go to}} a <b>baseball</b> <b>stadium.</b> Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons about students who get diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder from the same doctor for better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and we learn that Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students. Veronica has a dream about Cervando, who says that the perpetrator was probably in the vicinity of the bus crash. Veronica learns that the “I am God” image is actually an album cover. Keith tells Veronica that the perpetrator was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, more frightening dream.|$|E
5|$|Sports in Manila have a {{long and}} {{distinguished}} history. The city's, and in general the country's main sport is basketball, and most barangays have a basketball court {{or at least a}} makeshift basketball court, with court markings drawn on the streets. Larger barangays have covered courts where inter-barangay leagues are held every summer (April to May). Manila has many sports venues, such as the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex and San Andres Gym, the home of the now defunct Manila Metrostars. The Rizal Memorial Sports Complex houses the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium, the <b>Baseball</b> <b>Stadium,</b> Tennis Courts, Memorial Coliseum and the Ninoy Aquino Stadium (the latter two are indoor arenas). The Rizal complex had hosted several multi-sport events, such as the 1954 Asian Games and the 1934 Far Eastern Games. Whenever the country hosts the Southeast Asian Games, most of the events are held at the complex, but in the 2005 Games, most events were held elsewhere. The 1960 ABC Championship and the 1973 ABC Championship, forerunners of the FIBA Asia Championship, was hosted by the complex, with the national basketball team winning on both tournaments. The 1978 FIBA World Championship was held at the complex although the latter stages were held in the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Southeast Asia's largest indoor arena at that time.|$|E
