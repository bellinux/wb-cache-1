5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more <b>boards.</b> The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with <b>boards</b> placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two <b>boards,</b> but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

5|$|With many mining {{communities}} suffering {{high levels}} of unemployment following the General Strike, some Poor Law <b>boards</b> granted relief to unemployed workers by misusing provisions intended for exceptional circumstances. These <b>boards</b> used the provisions to give benefits to nearly all applicants. With the system thrown into crisis, Chamberlain sought legislation to permit the Minister of Health to dismiss recalcitrant <b>boards,</b> and later got Parliament to pass further legislation to prescribe criminal penalties to members of such <b>boards.</b> Though no board members were prosecuted, Chamberlain dismissed three <b>boards,</b> replacing their members with his own appointees. Finally, in 1929, Chamberlain brought in legislation to abolish the Poor Law <b>boards</b> entirely, replacing them with bodies appointed by local authorities. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a}} half hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded, he was applauded by all parties. The Local Government Act 1929 passed by an ample majority, and the Morning Post commented that (despite Labour attacks), it had been found to be impossible to make it unpopular.|$|E

Chamberlain sought {{the abolition of the}} elected Poor Law <b>Boards</b> of Guardians which administered relief—and which in some areas were responsible for rates. Many of the <b>Boards</b> were controlled by Labour, and such <b>Boards</b> had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. In 1929 Chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish the Poor Law <b>boards</b> entirely. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons {{for two and a half}} hours on the second reading of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.|$|E

5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory <b>boards</b> may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by <b>boards</b> of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all statutory <b>boards.</b>|$|E
