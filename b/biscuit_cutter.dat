25|$|A <b>biscuit</b> <b>cutter</b> {{a tool to}} cut out a biscuit from bread {{dough in}} a {{particular}} shape before they are put into an oven to bake. On May 11, 1875, Alexander P. Ashbourne filed the first patent for the <b>biscuit</b> <b>cutter</b> that consisted of a board to roll the biscuits out on and hinged to a metal plate with various <b>biscuit</b> <b>cutter</b> shapes mounted to it. It was later issued on November 30, 1875.|$|E

5000|$|Appuhamy {{then opened}} a bakery, which {{initially}} sold bread but later added hand made biscuits to their range. One {{of the first}} biscuits produced was the Maliban Marie biscuit. In order to satisfy the demand he purchased a <b>biscuit</b> <b>cutter</b> from India {{to assist in the}} biscuit manufacturing.|$|E
5000|$|Puzzles {{generally}} involve {{using the}} right verb action {{with the appropriate}} object — [...] "use <b>biscuit</b> <b>cutter</b> with rubber tree," [...] for example.

50|$|A {{cookie cutter}} in American English and <b>biscuit</b> <b>cutter</b> in Commonwealth English {{is a tool}} to cut out cookie/biscuit dough in a {{particular}} shape. They are often used for seasonal occasions when well-known decorative shapes are desired, or for large batches of cookies where simplicity and uniformity are required. Cookie cutters have also been used for, among other uses, cutting and shaping tea sandwiches.|$|E
50|$|This American dish {{is usually}} made by cutting a circle or other shape {{out of a}} slice of bread, often using a {{drinking}} glass or <b>biscuit</b> <b>cutter.</b> The bread is fried until brown {{on one side and}} then flipped, and an egg is broken into the center and seasoned, usually with salt and pepper, and sometimes herbs. The pan is then covered, and the egg is cooked until the white is just set. The cutout center of the bread is often fried as well, and served alongside or on top of the finished egg.|$|E
40|$|The acha (Digitaria exile staff) grain {{was washed}} (tap water), sun dried, milled and sieved (400 mn sieve aperture) to produce acha flour. The beniseed(Sesamum indicum) seeds were sorted, washed, sun dried, milled, {{defatted}} (using ethanol), dried and sieved (400 mn sieve aperture) to produce beniseed flour. The defatted beniseed flour was substituted into the acha flour at 0 - 20 % to produce beniseed-acha composite flour. This was mixed with fat, sugar, salt, baking powder to produce batter. The batter was rolled (on a steel table), cut into shapes (using <b>biscuit</b> <b>cutter),</b> placed on greased trays and baked at 160 o C for 20 minutes. The effect of added defatted beniseed on the physical, chemical and sensory quality of acha–beniseed composite biscuit were evaluated. The protein, fat, moisture, ash, breaking strength and spread ratio increased from 10. 5 to 12. 9, 1. 80 to 2. 15, 1. 0 to 1. 6, 1. 20 to 3. 20 %, 1. 49 to 1. 67 kg and 6. 0 to 7. 25, respectively with {{increase in the}} percentage of added defatted beniseed. However, the average means of the sensory properties decreased from 8. 30 to 4. 30, 7. 20 to 5. 80, 8. 50 to 6. 30, 8. 30 to 4. 20, and 7. 90 to 3. 70 for color, texture, appearance, flavor and general acceptability, respectively at p ≤ 0. 05 level of acceptance. The addition of defatted beniseed above 10 % has a significant negative effect on the acceptances of the product. There was an increase of 12 and 16. 4 % of protein and fat content respectively, at the maximum acceptance level (10 %) of the added beniseed flour...|$|E
