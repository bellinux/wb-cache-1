5000|$|During the April 11, 2011 {{debates on}} the 2011 United States federal budget, Mayor Gray {{and several other}} D.C. elected {{officials}} joined city residents outside the Hart Senate Office Building to protest <b>budgetary</b> <b>line</b> items that restricted the city's ability to spend its own locally raised funds. In particular, the budget limits the city's ability {{to spend money on}} abortion services and reauthorizes a school voucher program that the city government opposes. U.S. Capitol Police arrested several protesters, including Vincent Gray, for blocking automobile traffic. Speaking to the press before the arrest, Gray said, [...] "This is an absolute travesty. All {{we want to do is}} spend our own money... Why should women in the District of Columbia be subjected to a set of rules that no other woman is subjected to?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Senator Bill Frist {{introduced}} the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 in the United States Senate. Rather than provide for an actual legislative veto, however, the procedure {{created by the}} Act provides that, if the President should recommend rescission of a <b>budgetary</b> <b>line</b> item from a budget bill he previously signed into law—a power he already possesses pursuant to U.S. Const. Art. II—the Congress must vote on his request within ten days. Because the legislation {{that is the subject}} of the President's request (or [...] "Special Message", in the language of the bill) was already enacted and signed into law, the vote by the Congress would be ordinary legislative action, not any kind of veto—whether line-item, legislative or any other sort. The House passed this measure, but the Senate never considered it, so the bill expired and never became law.|$|E
40|$|THESIS ABSTRACT Maria Emilia Escobedo Resano The {{first chapter}} {{will consist of}} a {{detailed}} description of the Cooperation Agreement, contextualizing it with the EU-Mexico former relations and the troubles both countries encountered before signing it, especially the Democratic Clause which presented a big issue for the Mexican government. The second chapter will go through Mexico's indigenous education status and the laws that improved the coverage, quality, and access to schooling. I will also present some national statistics comparing the non-indigenous with indigenous children's access to education, quality of public schools, and academic achievement. The third chapter will be about the EU's education guidelines for Mexico, explaining both projects, in which <b>budgetary</b> <b>line</b> they fall in, the funding process, and the actors involved: Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Ministry of Education; and the way these projects work. All of this is in order to understand EU-Mexico's cooperation on indigenous childrens' education, how it is carried out, and the participation of different level actors. The fourth chapter will deal with the assessment of the projects; this is a crucial point for evaluating the impact on the population, the spill-over effect and the accuracy of these very specific projects for the [...] .

40|$|We {{consider}} a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} with collective wage bargaining and investigate how unemployment dynamics are affected by two types of <b>budgetary</b> policies. In <b>line</b> with traditional reasoning, a balanced-budget rule amplifies fluctuations in the short run, whereas an unbalanced-budget persistence by its adverse impact on growth, and may even destabilize the adjustment path. If this is the case, a future fiscal consolidation is needed which further raises unemployment. These {{results are consistent with}} empirical evidence on a positive cross-country relationship between government borrowing and unemployment persistence. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} theoretical and empirical research on the interaction between political institutions and economic variables. Using the dynamic panel model, the paper also investigates the indirect effects of electoral systems {{on the size of}} general government spending. The analysis is performed on a panel dataset of 26 countries (25 member states of the European Union and Croatia) for the period between 1995 and 2010. The results show that government fragmentation and political stability affect the dynamics of <b>budgetary</b> expenditures in <b>line</b> with theoretical assumptions. Regarding the implications of this research for Croatia, {{it has been shown that}} a higher degree of government fragmentation leads to an increase in government spending which is a significant result since Croatia has generally had some form of coalition government...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the Singapore government budget's {{organization and}} reporting structure, and draws lessons and policy implications for improving public financial management practices. The paper finds that Singapore's fiscal marksmanship record has been poor with consistent underestimates of revenue and overestimates of expenditure. Second, subtle divergences from international reporting standards limit {{the information available}} and constrain the budget's analytical usefulness in international comparisons. Third, current reporting conventions of the budget fail to provide an adequate representation of the government's fiscal position. Fourth, revised estimates of <b>budgetary</b> balances in <b>line</b> with international reporting standards show a considerable increase in the fiscal space available. The policy implications of these findings are discussed, {{as well as some}} reporting changes which can help improve the fiscal marksmanship record, increase public sector transparency and accountability, and facilitate better quality discourse among all stakeholders on public financial management...|$|R

Regarding on-line classes, what is the state of the current situation and the status of changes from the view of three groups of community college personnel: administrators, faculty who have been and/or are currently involved with preparation and teaching on-line classes, and faculty who have not been involved with preparation and teaching on-line classes? Regarding on-line classes, what are the institutional encouragements from the administrative and faculty view? Regarding on-line classes, what are the institutional discouragements from the administrative and faculty view? All 48 Illinois community colleges received six surveys which were distributed to two administrators, two faculty who have been or currently are involved with preparation and teaching on-line classes, and two faculty who have not been involved with preparation and teaching on-line classes. Out {{of the total number of}} responses, the percentage of those that responded were 36 % administrators, 36 % faculty with experience, and 28 % faculty without experience. Possible discouragements were found when 48 % felt the pre-assessment of students' technological skills is not present, but it is important to the success of on-line classes. A total of 77 % reported the preassessment is important, while 29 % recorded that it was present in their institution. When discussing the need and use of a master plan for on-line classes, 78 % reported that it is important, 44 % indicated it was important and present in their institution. Encouragements included 93 % of the respondents reporting that technological support for faculty was important and evident in their institution. Respondents stated that 74 % of the institutions have faculty driven curricula for their on-line classes. It appears that 54 % of the responding colleges do not have a <b>budgetary</b> <b>line</b> for on-line classes. Administrators should accept the concept of cost accounting for on-line classes. If they do not have a separate line in the budget, it would be hard to determine if they are making money, losing money, or breaking even with these courses. Although an institution of higher education is dedicated to teaching adults, they still must be concerned with staying maintaining a positive budget...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 50). The {{occurrence of}} a natural disaster is generally regarded as a chance event. The impact of a hurricane or similar weather-related event can only be predicted in advance by days or maybe weeks. In {{the event of a}} sudden disaster such as an earthquake, science has only seconds or minutes in which to issue a warning. The single certainty is that disasters will occur. With a rising population and seemingly more disasters, the importance of preparing to better respond is becoming evermore important to communities globally. Much can be done to use the patterns of the past to prepare for the future, but action is required. Community leaders must take a concerted and aggressive stance in advance of such disasters befalling the people they serve or be prepared to suffer the consequences of ignoring such threats. Communities are tasked with the safety and security of their residents and therefore must take the long view of preparedness. Emergency preparedness and disaster response is a complex and costly endeavor but it is one that must be undertaken by every community that chooses to manage risk rather than wait to be a victim of the inevitable. The City of Monterey Park is a small community on the eastern border of Los Angeles that has chosen to prepare itself for the certainty of coming disasters. The purpose of this narrative is to illustrate the state of readiness in the city and the steps taken thus far by the Emergency Preparedness Division of the Monterey Park Fire Department whose motto is "be prepared, not scared. " This thesis will describe a number of the actions taken to develop a comprehensive emergency preparedness and disaster response program. The program consists of training of city personnel for disaster response, education of the public to enhance self-sufficiency, and the construction of a purpose-built emergency operations center. This Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was built in compliance with federal mandates as well as by developing a new <b>budgetary</b> <b>line</b> item to provide ongoing support for these projects to make a sustainable solution for the people and businesses of Monterey Park. The EOC was designed for the city with time and money challenges, so the solutions are applicable to many other cities and jurisdictions as a scalable template, not just a solution for one city. Much like a fire station, the EOC is a place for ongoing training, relationship building with responders to each other and the community and other regional responders, and also a place for preparing the needed communications, social media, and outreach efforts to make the facility a dynamic solution to the city's public-safety challenges. It also is a place that can be an example to others, much like the cleanliness and preparedness of fire stations...|$|E
40|$|Board of {{education}} members, {{who are responsible}} for local school governance, should know the local students 2 ̆ 7 needs and expectations. Yet, little information regarding school improvement has been collected from board members. The purpose of this case study was to describe the expectation for school improvement constructed from the perspectives of people who serve as members of the board {{of education}}. ^ The primary questions answered by this study were: (a) What is the nature of school improvement? (b) What role should the local board of education have in developing and implementing school improvement?^ For this case study, purposive sampling was used to select six rural Class III school districts in Nebraska with enrollments of 200 to 600 students. A board member with five or more years of experience was selected from each of the six districts. Men and women were equally represented. Informant 2 ̆ 7 s interviews were audiotaped. Informants reviewed transcribed copies to ensure accuracy. ^ Board members defined school improvement as providing a more effective education for students. The board 2 ̆ 7 s role was described as a supportive role, with the board relying heavily on school personnel to develop and implement school improvement. ^ Board members expressed a need for training in boardsmanship. They expressed anger about unfunded state and federal mandates, teacher stagnation, the lack of equality in curriculum and educational costs across the state, and the misalignment of contractual and <b>budgetary</b> time <b>lines.</b> Board members also expressed concern that the legislature continues to diminish local control. ^ School improvements described by board members were intended to create a more effective and efficient system. Such changes are known as first-order change and come from within the system. Board members did not, however, propose any changes {{in the design of the}} system (which the public expects, according to the literature). Such changes are known as second-order change and come from outside the system. ...|$|R

Reflecting the rise in oil prices, the fiscal and current account balance position improved significantly. Congo’s medium-term prospects have improved significantly because of the rise in oil prices, notwithstanding the downward revision of oil production. In the banking sector, the government’s key objectives are to promote greater market discipline and improve the governance framework as regards bank loans. Although Congo’s recent progress provides a good basis for continued program implementation, important risks remain.

This arrangement aims to prepare Albania for graduation from IMF-supported programs. If properly implemented, the policies it embodies will reduce vulnerabilities, enhance growth potential, strengthen government solvency, and protect priority spending. These policies will {{also contribute to}} improved governanceâ€”a precondition for attracting the high-quality investment needed to address the structural imbalances in the external accounts and to ensure the continuation of strong growth. Remaining vulnerabilities in the financial system are also addressed.
