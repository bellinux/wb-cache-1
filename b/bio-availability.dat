This study aimed to evaluate changes of soil properties, potential nitrification rates (PNRs), and functional gene abundances and link their relationships after remediating co-contaminated agricultural soil with Medicago sativa L. (alfalfa) planting, alone or together with biochar application. Compared with the control (CK), alfalfa planting, alone or together with biochar application, could significantly increase soil organic matter (SOM) contents and discrepantly affect soil pH values. The PNRs of the amended treatments were significantly higher than that of the CK. Moreover, alfalfa plantings also enhanced the abundances of functional genes related to soil nitrification and denitrification, with the sole exception of nosZ gene. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the PNRs were best described by the gene abundance ratios of AOB amoA/nifH and nirS gene abundances. Compared with the CK, alfalfa planting, alone or with biochar application, could restore nitrogen cycling in the co-contaminated agricultural soil and enhance the PNRs via decreasing contaminant <b>bio-availabilities</b> and increasing SOM contents and gene abundance ratios of AOB amoA/nifH.

Proper drying can preserve their <b>bio-availabilities</b> prior to subsequent processing or consumption. Pure Maitake (Grifola frondosa) strain was cultivated in Mushroom Complete Medium (MCM) using submerged fermentation for 14 days. Maitake mycelia were harvested and treated respectively by vacuum, oven drying treatments while the fresh mycelia were assigned as control. All {{the samples were}} tested for Total Phenolic Content, DPPH radical scavenging assays and nutritional contents. Submerged fermentation produced mycelia biomass (1. 3 ± 0. 1 g/L) within 14 days of fermentation. Both the pH and reduced sugar content had decreased (P < 0. 05) throughout fermentation. Vacuum dried mycelia had shown higher (P < 0. 05) total phenolic (20. 0 ± 0. 4 mg GAE/g), DPPH radical scavenging activity (84. 7 ± 0. 1 %), and soluble protein content (283. 6 ± 7. 1 µg/mL) as compared to other treated samples. The crude protein (39. 1 ± 0. 2), fat (5. 7 ± 0. 7), ash (11. 1 ± 0. 3 %) of mycelia were well preserved using vacuum drying as compared to oven dried samples.

Serum levels and urinary excretion were determined at various time intervals by a microbiological assay. After iv adminis-tration, a two-compartment body model was used to analyse the data.

However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the stomach, and as such gastrointestinal (along the gastrointestinal tract) may be a more fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as enteral, such as sublingual (under the tongue) and sublabial or buccal (between the cheek and gums/gingiva), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly enteral administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for systemic administration, as well as local (sometimes termed topical), such as in a contrast enema, whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term enteral is reserved for substances with systemic effects.Many drugs as tablets, capsules, or drops are taken orally. Administration methods directly into the stomach include those by gastric feeding tube or gastrostomy. Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a duodenal feeding tube and enteral nutrition.
