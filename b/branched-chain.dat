5|$|The {{herbicide}} glyphosate is an inhibitor of 3-phosphoshikimate 1-carboxyvinyltransferase, other herbicides, {{such as the}} sulfonylureas {{inhibit the}} enzyme acetolactate synthase. Both these enzymes are needed for plants to make <b>branched-chain</b> amino acids. Many other enzymes are inhibited by herbicides, including enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of lipids and carotenoids and the processes of photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in hepatic encephalopathy, although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain. Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression (especially EAAT 2) {{has been attributed to}} acute liver failure. Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and <b>branched-chain</b> amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role. Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide on astrocytes.|$|E
25|$|The BCKA decarboxylase enzyme is {{composed}} of two subunits in a tetrameric structure (A2B2) and {{is essential for the}} synthesis of <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acids. It is responsible for the decarboxylation of α-keto acids formed by the transamination of valine, leucine, and isoleucine and produces the primers used for <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid synthesis. The activity of this enzyme is much higher with <b>branched-chain</b> α-keto acid substrates than with straight-chain substrates, and in Bacillus species its specificity is highest for the isoleucine-derived α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid, followed by α-ketoisocaproate and α-ketoisovalerate. The enzyme’s high affinity toward <b>branched-chain</b> α-keto acids allows it to function as the primer donating system for <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid synthetase.|$|E
25|$|Capsaicin is {{the most}} {{abundant}} capsaicinoid found in the Capsicum genus, but at least ten other capsaicinoid variants exist. Phenylalanine supplies the precursor to the phenylpropanoid pathway while leucine or valine provide the precursor for the <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid pathway. To produce capsaicin, 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-CoA is produced by the <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid pathway and condensed with vanillamine. Other capsaicinoids are produced by the condensation of vanillamine with various acyl-CoA products from the <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid pathway, which is capable of producing a variety of acyl-CoA moieties of different chain length and degrees of unsaturation. All condensation reactions between {{the products of the}} phenylpropanoid and <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid pathway are mediated by capsaicin synthase to produce the final capsacinoid product.|$|E
25|$|The <b>branched-chain</b> {{fatty acid}} synthesizing system uses α-keto acids as primers. This system is {{distinct}} from the <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid synthetase that utilizes short-chain acyl-CoA esters as primers. α-Keto acid primers are derived from the transamination and decarboxylation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine to form 2-methylpropanyl-CoA, 3-methylbutyryl-CoA, and 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively. 2-Methylpropanyl-CoA primers derived from valine are elongated to produce even-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 14-methyl-pentadecanoic (isopalmitic) acid, and 3-methylbutyryl-CoA primers from leucine {{may be used to}} form odd-numbered iso-series fatty acids such as 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. 2-Methylbutyryl-CoA primers from isoleucine are elongated to form anteiso-series fatty acids containing an odd number of carbon atoms such as 12-Methyl tetradecanoic acid. Decarboxylation of the primer precursors occurs through the <b>branched-chain</b> α-keto acid decarboxylase (BCKA) enzyme. Elongation of the fatty acid follows the same biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli used to produce straight-chain fatty acids where malonyl-CoA is used as a chain extender. The major end products are 12–17 carbon <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acids and their composition tends to be uniform and characteristic for many bacterial species.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthesis of the {{capsaicin}}oids {{occurs in}} the glands of the pepper fruit where capsaicin synthase condenses vanillylamine from the phenylpropanoid pathway with an acyl-CoA moiety produced by the <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid pathway.|$|E
25|$|Free radicals, {{molecules}} with unpaired electrons, play a {{large role}} in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into <b>branched-chain</b> isomers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Branched-chain</b> {{fatty acids}} are usually {{saturated}} and {{are found in}} two distinct families: the iso-series and anteiso-series. It {{has been found that}} Actinomycetales contain unique branch-chain fatty acid synthesis mechanisms, including that which forms tuberculosteric acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} enthalpy change of combustion, ΔcHo, for alkanes increases by about 650nbsp&kJ/mol per CH2 group. <b>Branched-chain</b> alkanes have lower values of ΔcHo than straight-chain alkanes {{of the same}} number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.|$|E
25|$|The general biosynthetic pathway of {{capsaicin}} {{and other}} capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden. Radiolabeling studies identified phenylalanine and valine as the precursors to capsaicin. Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. {{are responsible for}} identifying leucine as another precursor to the <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency of chili peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase. Similar studies showed high transcription levels in the placenta of chili peppers with high pungency of genes responsible for <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acid pathway.|$|E
25|$|Primary biliary cirrhosis. CD is {{prevalent}} in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). In PBC anti-mitochondrial antibodies are directed toward 3 mitochondrial autoantigens (pyruvate dehydrogenase, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, <b>branched-chain</b> alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase), 2 or more nuclear proteins (nucleoporin 210kDa, nucleoporin 62kDa, centromere protein, and sp100), and 57% of acute liver failure patients have anti-transglutaminase antibodies.|$|E
25|$|The melting {{points of}} <b>branched-chain</b> alkanes {{can be either}} higher or {{lower than those of}} the {{corresponding}} straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.|$|E
25|$|Tributylphosphine finds some {{industrial}} {{use as a}} catalyst modifier in the cobalt-catalyzed hydroformylation of alkenes, where it greatly increases the ratio of straight-chain aldehydes to <b>branched-chain</b> aldehydes in the product mixture. However, tricyclohexylphosphine is even more effective for this purpose (although more expensive) and, in any case, rhodium catalysts are usually preferred to cobalt catalysts for the hydroformylation of alkenes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to complete proteins, some supplements will contain protein {{that has been}} partially hydrolyzed to short peptide chains or individual amino acids (such as <b>branched-chain</b> amino acids or glutamine). Amino acids {{have been used by}} some companies to artificially inflate and falsify protein values in their product (protein spiking). Many protein supplements explicitly indicate on the label that no protein spiking has occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the alkylate, is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, <b>branched-chain</b> paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and is clean burning. The octane number of the alkylate depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining butylene with isobutane and has an octane rating of 100 by definition. There are other products in the alkylate effluent, however, so the octane rating will vary accordingly.|$|E
25|$|From pentane to octane the alkanes {{are highly}} {{volatile}} liquids. They {{are used as}} fuels in internal combustion engines, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. <b>Branched-chain</b> alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes knocking, than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition {{is measured by the}} octane rating of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100, and heptane has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.|$|E
25|$|The order Legionellales {{comprises}} two families, Legionellaceae and Coxiellaceae. The family Legionellaceae {{includes the}} genera Legionella and relatives Fluoribacter and Sarcobium. The colonies that appeared around {{the third day}} in the CYE slants were grey and raised with a “ground-glass appearance". It was positive for both oxidase and catalase production. Strains of L. jordanis are thin, motile Gram-negative rods that {{range in size from}} 0.3 to 0.9µm wide by 2 to 20µm long. In addition, it is not encapsulated or nonspore-forming. After being stained with Sudan B, many of the cells did not have fat deposits. Gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry show that all known species of Legionella contain large amounts of <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acids. DNA that was unlabeled from BL-540 was tested against labeled DNAs from the six recognized Legionella species. When reactions were performed at an incubation temperature of 60°C, relatedness of BL-540 to the other DNAs were between 4 and 20%. When reactions were performed at a higher incubation temperature of 75°C, the relatedness ranged from 0 to 10%. The results indicated that L. jordanis was a new species. The two strains, BL-540 and ABB-9, were almost identical when DNA relatedness reactions were performed at both 60 and 75°C.|$|E

2500|$|... α-Keto acid primers {{are used}} to produce <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acids that, in general, are between 12 and 17 carbons in length. The {{proportions}} of these <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acids tend to be uniform and consistent among a particular bacterial species but may be altered due to changes in malonyl-CoA concentration, temperature, or heat-stable factors (HSF) present. All of these factors may affect chain length, and HSFs have been demonstrated to alter the specificity of BCKA decarboxylase for a particular α-keto acid substrate, thus shifting the ratio of <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acids produced. An increase in malonyl-CoA concentration {{has been shown to}} result in a larger proportion of C17 fatty acids produced, up until the optimal concentration (≈20μM) of malonyl-CoA is reached. [...] Decreased temperatures also tend to shift the fatty-acid distribution slightly toward C17 fatty-acids in Bacillus species.|$|E
2500|$|The rest of {{the group}} is classed {{according}} to the functional groups present. [...] Such compounds can be [...] "straight-chain", <b>branched-chain</b> or cyclic. [...] The degree of branching affects characteristics, such as the octane number or cetane number in petroleum chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|Omega-alicyclic {{fatty acids}} {{typically}} contain an omega-terminal propyl or butyryl cyclic group and {{are some of}} the major membrane fatty acids found in several species of bacteria. The fatty acid synthetase used to produce omega-alicyclic fatty acids is also used to produce membrane <b>branched-chain</b> fatty acids. In bacteria with membranes composed mainly of omega-alicyclic fatty acids, the supply of cyclic carboxylic acid-CoA esters is much greater than that of <b>branched-chain</b> primers. The synthesis of cyclic primers is not well understood but {{it has been suggested that}} mechanism involves the conversion of sugars to shikimic acid which is then converted to cyclohexylcarboxylic acid-CoA esters that serve as primers for omega-alicyclic fatty acid synthesis ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is almost}} certain that the term {{paraffin}} stems from the petrochemical industry. <b>Branched-chain</b> alkanes are called isoparaffins. The {{use of the term}} [...] "paraffin" [...] is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers, i.e., compounds of the same chemical formula, e.g., pentane and isopentane.|$|E
2500|$|Straight-chain alkanes are {{sometimes}} {{indicated by the}} prefix [...] "n-" [...] (for normal) where a non-linear isomer exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where {{there is an important}} difference in properties between the straight-chain and <b>branched-chain</b> isomers, e.g., n-hexane or 2- or 3-methylpentane. Alternative names for this group are: linear paraffins or n-paraffins.|$|E
2500|$|A {{straight-chain}} alkane {{will have}} a boiling point higher than a <b>branched-chain</b> alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare isobutane (2-methylpropane) and n-butane (butane), which boil at −12 and 0°C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58°C, respectively. For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can [...] "lock" [...] into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.|$|E
2500|$|Biotin is {{important}} in fatty acid synthesis, <b>branched-chain</b> amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. It covalently attaches to the epsilon-amino group of specific lysine residues in these carboxylases. This biotinylation reaction requires ATP and is catalyzed by holocarboxylase synthetase. In bacteria, biotin is attached to biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) by biotin protein ligase (BirA in E. coli). The attachment of biotin to various chemical sites, biotinylation, is used as an important laboratory technique to study various processes, including protein localization, protein interactions, DNA transcription, and replication. [...] Biotinidase itself {{is known to be}} able to biotinylate histone proteins, but little biotin is found naturally attached to chromatin.|$|E
2500|$|Bodybuilding {{supplements}} are {{dietary supplements}} commonly used by {{those involved in}} bodybuilding and athletics. Bodybuilding supplements {{may be used to}} replace meals, enhance weight gain, promote weight loss or improve athletic performance. Among the most widely used are vitamin supplements, protein drinks, <b>branched-chain</b> amino acids (BCAA), glutamine, essential fatty acids, meal replacement products, creatine, weight loss products and testosterone boosters. Supplements are sold either as single ingredient preparations or in the form of [...] "stacks" [...] – proprietary blends of various supplements marketed as offering synergistic advantages. While many bodybuilding supplements are also consumed by the general public their salience and frequency of use may differ when used specifically by bodybuilders.|$|E
2500|$|Dragan and his {{colleague}} {{were the first to}} report about isomerization in alkanes. [...] Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated {{in the presence of a}} platinum catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become <b>branched-chain</b> isomers. In other words, it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens, keeping the same molecular weight. In reformation, the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance. Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization, as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers.|$|E
2500|$|Whey protein {{contains}} {{high levels}} of all the essential amino acids and <b>branched-chain</b> amino acids. It also has the highest content of the amino acid cysteine, which aids in the biosynthesis of glutathione. For bodybuilders whey protein provides amino acids used to aid in muscle recovery. Whey protein {{is derived from the}} process of making cheese from milk. There are three types of whey protein: whey concentrate, whey isolate, and whey hydrolysate. Whey concentrate is 29–89% protein by weight whereas whey isolate is 90%+ protein by weight. Whey hydrolysate is enzymatically predigested and therefore has the highest rate of digestion of all protein types. Whey protein is usually taken immediately before and after a workout ...|$|E
