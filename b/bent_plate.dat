Study design: Of 47 Japanese patients with mandibular prognathism, 24 underwent SSRO and 23 underwent SSRO in combination with a Le Fort I osteotomy. A 3 - 5 -mm gap was made between the proximal and distal segments, and a <b>bent</b> <b>plate</b> was fixed with 4 screws in each side of the mandible. The angle of the condylar long axis, as well as the anteroposterior and mediolateral displacement of the condylar head were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively by computerized tomography (CT). Results: There was no significant difference in reduction in mandibular length between SSRO alone and SSRO with Le Fort I on the axial view of a 3 -dimensional CT. There were no significant differences between pre- and postoperative horizontal changes in the condylar long axis or in the anteroposterior and mediolateral displacement of the condylar head, although the length of the proximal segment in SSRO with Le Fort I osteotomy was significantly shorter than in SSRO alone (P <. 05). Conclusion: These results suggest that the use of a <b>bent</b> <b>plate</b> for SSRO does not change preoperative angle or position significantly in setback surgery, regardless of the addition of Le Fort I osteotomy. © 2008 Mosby, Inc.

40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} of the earth’s crust due to topographic loads can {{be derived}} by either inverse or direct approach. As for the inverse approach, it is postulated that the density anomaly {{is proportional to the}} earth’s radius vector so that it is linearly related to topography by a convolution of the topography and an isotropic kernel function. Accordingly, one can prove that the attraction of the compensating masses is also a convolution of the topography and an isotropic isostatic response function. Such an isostatic response function can be determined by deconvolution. This paper gives the derivation of such a deconvolution by means of spherical harmonics. A practical determination of the isotropic isostatic response function needs the harmonic analysis of both the topography and the attraction of the compensating masses. Applying the principle of inverse isostasy, by which we aim to achieve zero isostatic anomalies, then the attraction of the compensating masses equals the Bouguer anomalies with an opposite sign. The harmonic analysis of the Bouguer anomalies is thus a combination of the harmonic analysis of the topographic potential and the already existing global reference models. As for the direct approach, consider that the earth’s crust is an infinite thin plate subject to topographic loads. The solution of such a <b>bent</b> <b>plate</b> represents the displacement of the earth’s crust due to topographic loads. The paper illustrates that the exact solution of the <b>bent</b> <b>plate</b> is given by the Kelvin function keix. A practical application has been carried out for both approaches using EGM 96 and GPM 98 CR geopotential earth models as well as TUG 87 and TBASE digital height models.

Cross-frames and diaphragms {{play an important}} role in stabilizing steel girders, particularly during construction. The commonly used <b>bent</b> <b>plate</b> connection between skewed braces and steel girders can introduce flexibility that can have detrimental effects on the bracing behavior. An alternative detail investigated in this study is a split pipe stiffener used to connect cross-frames to girders at a skew. The split pipe stiffener allows perpendicular connections to the cross-frame connection tab, regardless of the skew angle. The split pipe provides a stiffer connection between the cross-frame and the girder. More importantly, the split pipe stiffener increases the torsional stiffness of the girder by introducing substantial warping restraint. This increases the lateral torsional buckling capacity of the girder and allows the first line of intermediate cross-frames to be moved farther from the support. Overall, the increase in girder torsional stiffness and buckling capacity that results from the use of the split pipe stiffener will enhance the safety of the girder at all stages of construction: during transportation, lifting, erection, and placement of the concrete deck.

Models are developed for the SDA in its working state, building on previous work reported in the literature. A suspended SDA plate actuated by electrostatic forces has been analysed. A mathematical model has been established based on electrostatic coupled mechanical theory. Two SDA modes have been analysed namely the noncontact mode and the contact mode.

40|$|The {{zirconium}} alloy, Zircaloy- 4 (Zr- 4), has extensive {{applications in}} the nuclear industry as core structural components and fuel claddings in the nuclear reactors. The mechanical performance of these components can be strongly affected by the precipitation of brittle zirconium hydrides and the induced embrittlement. This work investigated the hydride precipitation behaviours in different Zr- 4 materials with various thermo-mechanical states (i. e. the high-pressure torsion (HPT) processed disk, hot-rolled and annealed plate, and hot-extruded and annealed bar). The effect of hydride formation on the mechanical properties of Zr- 4 materials was also studied. A comparative {{study was conducted to}} clarify the effect of HPT processing on the hydride formation in Zr- 4 materials. The Zr- 4 materials before and after HPT processing were gaseously hydrided at 450 °C using different hydrogen pressures (10, 15 and 20 atm). Detailed quantitative characterisation of the microstructure of these hydrided samples showed that at the same hydriding conditions, more hydrides tended to form in the HPT samples compared with the counterparts without HPT processing. The enhanced potential for the hydride formation in the HPT samples was attributed to the generation of a large concentration of lattice defects by HPT, which could act as hydrogen traps, hydrogen fast diffusion channels and preferred hydride nucleation sites. Further, the gaseous hydriding-induced changes in the microstructure, texture and mechanical properties of Zr- 4 processed by HPT were thoroughly assessed. Much δ-ZrH 1. 66 precipitation at 15 atm (volume fraction ~ 21 %) incurred significant hardening of vacuum-annealed HPT samples, and pure ε-ZrH 2 obtained at 20 atm showed a superior microhardness of 470 HV 0. 3 and a low fracture toughness of 0. 63 MPa m 1 / 2. The neutron diffraction measurements indicated that the δ-hydrides in HPT samples presented a weak (111) texture and followed the δ(111) //α(0001) orientation relationship (OR) with the α-Zr matrix. Detailed microstructure and texture studies of the hydride precipitation in annealed Zr- 4 materials were also performed by electron microscopy and neutron diffraction. Results showed that the precipitated δ-ZrH 1. 66 generally followed the δ(111) //α(0001) and δ[110]//α[11 2 0] OR with the α-Zr matrix. Texture analyses of these hydrided materials confirmed the result from the HPT samples that the δ-hydride precipitates displayed a weak texture, and further indicated that the hydride texture was determined by that of the α-Zr matrix. This texture dependence essentially originated from the observed OR between δ-hydride and α-Zr. The neutron diffraction line profile analysis and the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observation revealed a significant amount of dislocations present in the δ-hydride with an estimated average density of one order of magnitude higher than that in the α-Zr matrix, which contributed to the accommodation of the substantial misfit strains associated with the hydride precipitation in the α-Zr matrix. The hydride distribution in the bent and unbent Zr- 4 plate samples subjected to gaseous hydriding was investigated by neutron tomography in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. For the unbent plate sample hydrided at a hydrogen pressure of 20 atm, thin hydride layers on the surface and concentrated hydrides at the edges/corner of the sample were observed. This localised hydride accumulation was presumably resulted from the preferential hydrogen accumulation and saturation in these regions. For the <b>bent</b> <b>plate</b> hydrided at 10 atm, a thin hydride layer was present on the surface region with a significant compressive plastic deformation generated in the bending process. Besides, {{it was found that the}} hydride platelets in the hydrided <b>bent</b> <b>plate</b> tended to align parallel to the direction of the maximum tensile and compressive strain induced by the prior bending deformation. The electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) observations on the hydrided bent sample showed that the primary OR between δ-hydride and α-Zr matrix transited from δ(111) //α(0001) in the tensile strain region to δ(111) //α(1010) in the compressive strain region of the bent sample. Additionally, the influence of the hydride precipitation on the mechanical performance of hydrided Zr- 4 plate materials containing different hydrogen contents were studied at room temperature. For the unnotched plate samples with the hydrogen contents ranging from 25 – 850 wt. ppm, the uniaxial tensile tests showed that the tensile ductility was severely degraded with increasing hydrogen content. Also, the degree of embrittlement and fracture mode were strongly related to the hydrogen content. When the hydrogen content reached a level of 850 wt. ppm, the plate exhibited negligible ductility, resulting in almost completely brittle fracture behaviour. For the hydrided notched plate, the tensile stress concentration associated with the notch tip facilitated the hydride accumulation at the region near the notch tip and the premature crack propagation through the hydride fracture during hydriding. The final brittle through-thickness failure for this notched sample was mainly ascribed to the formation of a continuous hydride network on the thickness section and the obtained very high hydrogen concentration (estimated to be 1965 wt. ppm) ...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The retrofit of existing structures to resist external explosions is becoming increasingly necessary. The use of thin sheets on the tension face of a wall is one of the viable methods for blast retrofit of infill wall systems. Previous research at the University of Missouri-Columbia utilized: thin sheets of polypropylene, steel, polyurea, polyvinyl-chloride (PVC), and spray-on-polymers. Current research uses a newly developed Polymer-Fiber Composite Sheet (PFCS) that exhibits desirable properties, such as large ductility and high strength-to-weight ratio. This thesis evaluates the feasibility of PFCS and <b>bent</b> <b>plates</b> for blast retrofit of CMU infill walls. To promote the widespread use of PFCS for blast retrofit, it is necessary to develop an engineering design and analysis methodology for predicting the dynamic response of a PFCS and CMU wall system. Therefore, the engineering properties of the composite sheets, the connection details, and a preliminary static resistance function for the PFCS are evaluated experimentally in this thesis. The research has focused on evaluating the load-deflection response of the PFCS at the macro level using full scale tension tests. The connection response in tension of <b>bent</b> <b>plates</b> used to anchor sheet retrofit to building floors is experimentally evaluated in this thesis. In addition, the response of connections and sheets under uniform transverse pressure is evaluated experimentally using a full-scale loading tree. The results show that the fiber architecture has a significant effect on the response of the sheet. Based on the results of this research, polymer fiber composite sheets are capable of sustaining large amounts of strain while maintaining moderate loads. Together, these two properties make PFCS a viable blast sheet retrofit...|$|R
