Initial works were delayed by heavy rain for three weeks converting the ground to a quagmire, {{and as a result}} thousands of feet of ashes and coke breeze were carted from the gasworks and deposited in order to keep trucks moving with <b>borrow</b> <b>material</b> from Nudgee. By 18 February 1942 the construction of one hangar had begun and the SW-NE runway was nearing completion. Shiploads of aircraft components were arriving at the port and had to be transported to Amberley for assembly until Eagle Farm was ready. The Americans advised that the runways were urgently needed for the fighter plane protection of Brisbane, and as a result two ten-hour shifts were organised using 100 trucks which hauled 33,000 cubic yards of fill to complete the section, and on 29 March 1942 a squadron of P-39 aircraft landed.|$|E

50|$|The Democratic Association of Victoria was {{the first}} socialist {{organisation}} in Australia. The group was founded in February 1872, but it lasted less than a year. Its political outlook was largely utopian socialist. The group borrowed more inspiration from Robert Owen, Charles Fourier and John Stuart Mill rather than Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. However, the organisation did <b>borrow</b> <b>material</b> from The Communist Manifesto in some sections of its programme. The organisation became the Australian section of the International Working Men's Association in September 1872, the international organisation led by Marx (the 'First International'). George Scammel Manns was the Secretary of DAV. The group published the journal The Internationalist between February-August 1872.|$|E

The books contain lists of his students, often arranged according to their social status. His prototypical student would have been novices - as evidenced by the book's largely simplistic music. These encompass music in lower positions of the instrument that avoided complex textures, rhythms, and techniques. Some of his more famous contemporaries - such as Giovanni Paolo Foscarini (fl. 1600-1647) and Francesco Corbetta (c. 1615 - 1681), {{paved the way for the}} Guitar's popular emergence in the coming centuries.|$|E

50|$|Comparing {{these two}} compositions, Martinis Martinella {{consists}} of two nearly equal sections, like {{the majority of his}} secular works. The first section opens with an expansive duet between superius and tenor, followed by a shorter duet for tenor and contratenor. Next, a tutti for all three voices is interrupted by a series of short imitative duets. The short characteristic phrase, indeed, {{is one of the main}} stylistic traits of Martini.Isaac seems to extensively <b>borrow</b> <b>material</b> from his model, but recomposes it. He reuses the melodic material from Martini in the opening and concluding sections as well as several places of his setting, yet with motivic elaboration. For instance, Isaacs opening phrase is based on the initial material of Martini, expanding the initial duet into three-part texture in imitation. In addition, a series of short motives is exchanged between various pairs of voices. This is a similar technique to that which Martini used in the same part of the form, although Isaac did not borrow any explicit melodic material from his model.|$|E
50|$|On 7 December 1941 the US Navy Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbour was {{attacked}} by the Japanese. The US Pensacola convoy bound for the Philippines was redirected to Brisbane, arriving on 22 December 1941. Most of the Convoys seventy crated A-24s and P-40s were trucked to Amberley for erection and then for flying to their Clark Field destination in the Philippines, but Archerfield also shared in the erection of both fully crated and deck cargo delivered aircraft. A decision was made in January 1942 to develop Eagle Farm as a major aircraft erection depot and aerodrome from which the planes could proceed. Initial works were delayed by heavy rain for three weeks converting the ground to a quagmire, {{and as a result}} thousands of feet of ashes and coke breeze were carted from the gasworks and deposited in order to keep trucks moving with <b>borrow</b> <b>material</b> from Nudgee. Shiploads of aircraft components were arriving at the port and had to be transported to Amberley, and some to Archerfield, for assembly until Eagle Farm was ready. The Americans advised that the runways were urgently needed for the fighter plane protection of Brisbane, and on 29 March 1942 a squadron of P-39 aircraft landed. Archerfield Aerodrome would assume a new strategic importance as it would provide a base for Australian, American, British, and Dutch air squadrons, would be used for the maintenance and repair of military aircraft, and for training purposes, while maintaining its civil aviation functions and well established repair and maintenance facilities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of <b>borrowed</b> <b>material</b> {{in the work of}} the {{composer}} Alexander agricola (ca. 1456 - 1506). It is argued that Agricola's reputation in his lifetime has but little informed the scholarly attention afforded to him in modern times, and that the reasons for this neglect have been predominantly aesthetic ones. Accordingly an aesthetic framework is proposed through which to evaluate his music, following the work of Gilles Deleuze and F&# 233;lix Guattari _Rhizome_. This concept of Rhizome is shown to inform many of the underlying principles of Agricola's deployment of <b>borrowed</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

The total volume of materials to be recovered over a 10 -year period {{is estimated to}} be approximately 7, 600, 000 cubic meters (10, 000, 000 cubic yards). The proposed action would include ensuring adequate access is provided to the borrow locations. Existing roads might be upgraded, as necessary, to enhance egress. Appropriate utilities would be provided, and might include portable generators or extension of power lines for lighting, installation of trailers for personnel, and portable toilets. Conventional industrial equipment would be used during operations to recover the <b>borrow</b> <b>material.</b> For example, a power shovel or a front-end loader would excavate materials. New or modified equipment and facilities would be provided at the specific locations to provide for crushing, screening, size classification, washing, handling, and stockpiling. Truck loading stations would be provided. Depending on the nature of specific borrow materials at individual locations, select sites might be expanded. For analysis, it is assumed that of the total disturbed surface area (i. e., 3 square kilometers or 1. 2 square miles), expansion could result in an additional surface area disturbance of 10 % (approximately 0. 3 square kilometers [0. 12 square miles]). The resulting volume of additional <b>borrow</b> <b>material</b> available from expansion would be approximately 1, 500, 000 cubic meters (2, 000, 000 cubic yards) ...|$|E

40|$|There are {{numerous}} soil stabilization techniques {{for improving the}} strength of the in-situ soil especially in road construction, and one of the techniques is using chemical additive.

The focus on this research is on the improvement of engineering properties of two natural residual soils and mixed with different proportions of liquid chemical.

40|$|While the {{publishing}} industry is developing new business and delivery models for electronic titles, libraries are experimenting with the integration of these titles into their collections and services. A major issues, however, is the reluctance to read large textual titles on current screen technology. This paper reports on research that is identifying issues associated with the acceptance of electronic textbook materials. Comparison is made between different digital formats to determine if these alter acceptance of reading textbook material on screen. These preliminary findings suggest a reluctance to move to digital textbooks unless the digital files provide incentives through better or easier access to the content itself. I remember when I was completing my undergraduate degree. The best tool that we had was the photocopier. Students would queue at the closed reserve or journal collection, <b>borrow</b> <b>material</b> for short-term loan and photocopy the contents. Today, many of the library resources are, obviously, provided digitally. However, have you watched students use full text journal resources, such as those aggregated by vendors like ProQuest, Informit or Gale? Observation tends to show that students search the bibliographic databases, possibly skim-reading the content, and then they usually print the articles of interest. What has changed – is the printer the new photocopier...|$|E
