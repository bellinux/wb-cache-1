50|$|The Chrysler Royal is an {{automobile}} which {{was produced by}} Chrysler Australia from 1957 to 1963. After investing in tooling to stamp body panels for the 1954 P25 series Plymouth locally, and with Chrysler headquarters in Detroit unwilling {{to assist in the}} costs of retooling for the new US models, Chrysler Australia made the decision to develop their own range, using as much of the existing tooling as possible, whilst also realising that the new car had to appear as different as possible. The doors and basic structure of the P25 sedan was retained, and with input from Australian and American Chrysler designers, the 1955 US Plymouth front sheetmetal was adapted to the P25 <b>body</b> and the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> panels redesigned. They also added a wraparound rear windscreen, which caused development problems with Pilkington Glass, the Australian suppliers, who struggled to get the correct curved shape.|$|R
50|$|Mouse-deer {{possess a}} triangular-shaped head, arched back, and round <b>body</b> with {{elevated}} <b>rear</b> <b>quarters.</b> The thin, short legs which support the mouse-deer {{are about the}} diameter of a pencil. Although Java mouse-deer do not possess antlers or horns like regular deer, male Java mouse-deer have elongated, tusk-like upper canines which protrude downward from the upper jaw {{along the sides of}} their mouth. Males use these “tusks” to defend themselves and their mates against rivals. Females can be distinguished from males because they lack these prominent canines, and they are slightly smaller than the males. The average size of a Java mouse-deer ranges from 1 - 2 kg, with females falling on the smaller end of this spectrum. Java mouse-deer can furthermore be distinguished by their lack of upper incisors. The coat coloration of the Java mouse-deer is reddish-brown with a white underside. Pale white spots or vertical markings are also present on the animal’s neck.|$|R
2500|$|Development of the V10 series Camry and Vista {{began in}} August 1977 {{following}} the 1973 oil crisis and would later cover the 1979 crisis. Automobile manufacturers {{were making the}} inexorable move to downsized, lighter, more fuel efficient cars with better aerodynamic performance. The industry also began wide-scale switching from the rear-wheel-drive layout to the lighter and more compact front-wheel-drive {{in the interest of}} increased fuel economy. With a development focus on exports, particularly to the US, Toyota designed Camry to replace the Corona T130 in many overseas markets. It needed to compete with the compact, front-drive Honda Accord sedan from Japan. Via one-upmanship, Camry exceeded the Accord's wheelbase by [...] and offered larger engines. The design brief also established the compact front-wheel-drive X platform vehicles by General Motors in the US as competitors. In light of this competition—and a first for Toyota—the V10 adopted front-wheel drive with the engine transversely mounted. Between this layout that reduced the size of the engine compartment, the notchback sedan and liftback <b>bodies</b> with <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> windows, and the longer wheelbase of —the V10 series was considered spacious for its time and class. Furthermore, by situating the fuel tank underneath the back seat, luggage space is increased. The styling of the V10 followed the box-shaped trends characteristic of the early 1980s. Wind tunnel testing led to the fitment of drag-reducing flush pillars, a flat roofline to reduce wind buffeting, and one-piece front bumper with air dam to direct air flow. Drag coefficient is quoted at [...] for the sedan and [...] for the liftback.|$|R
50|$|Two {{body styles}} were available, a 6-light saloon and 4-light sports saloon. The 6-light saloon had a <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> window (sometimes {{referred}} to a 6-window saloon) while the 4-light sports saloon had the lack of the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> window (sometimes {{referred to a}} 4-window saloon).|$|R

50|$|A {{significant}} safety {{improvement was}} achieved with relocation {{of the fuel}} tank from the left <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> where it had resided since the 1950s, to under the floor just behind the rear axle. Under floor storage space was reduced on 2-seat wagons, but revisions in the 3rd seat folding mechanism minimized any compromises in seating utility. The space freed up in the left <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> panel became a lockable storage compartment.|$|R

2500|$|The first-generation Toronado lasted {{with the}} usual annual facelifts through 1970. Other than the brakes, the major changes were the {{replacement}} of the original [...] V8 with the new [...] in 1968 that was rated at [...] in standard form or [...] with the W-34 option, revised <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> panels (with small fins to disguise the slope of the <b>rear</b> <b>body</b> in side view) in 1969, and the disappearance of hidden headlights and the introduction of squared wheel arch bulges in 1970. An ignition lock became standard in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{construction}} of each Classic, Centurion would actually use two different Ford trucks: an F-Series crew-cab pickup and a Bronco. The wheelbase was shortened from 168 inches to 140 inches (9 inches longer than the Suburban), and the Bronco <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> panels, hardtop, and tailgate were mated to the pickup bodywork. [...] Early models used fiberglass <b>rear</b> <b>body</b> panels, but later, these were made from steel. [...] As the rear seat of the Bronco was retained, the Centurion Classic featured three-row seating for up to nine people.|$|R

External changes {{included}} intake and cooling ducts added behind the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> windows, taillights from the Rover SD1, and an integrated front spoiler. S2 Esprits also had [...] Speedline alloy wheels designed by Lotus. Other changes included relocating the battery from above {{the right side}} fuel tank under the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> window {{to the rear of}} the car, adding an access door to the engine cover, installing wider seats and replacing the Veglia instrument cluster with individual gauges made by Smiths and a new style of illuminated dashboard switches.|$|R
50|$|The 1974 Catalina {{and other}} big Pontiacs had a new Mercedes-like center split grille and revised rear styling with new 5 mi/h km/h bumpers on the aft end and license plate moved above the bumper. Two-door hardtop coupes {{featured}} new fixed triangular side windows, but kept the pillarless style with roll-down <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> windows, unlike Chevrolet, which eliminated the rolldown <b>rear</b> <b>quarters</b> in the Caprice and Impala Custom coupes. The four-door pillared and hardtop sedans were virtually unchanged from 1973. Interiors were {{much the same as}} 1973 except for a revised standard steering wheel and new cut-pile carpeting.|$|R
5000|$|The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International) {{defined the}} landau closed-type body with {{provision}} for opening or folding the <b>rear</b> <b>quarter,</b> {{by use of}} landau joints which precludes the use of quarter glass. In the 1920s and 1930s, especially in the United States, [...] "landau" [...] became associated with a simulated convertible, in which a fixed roof of a sedan with solid <b>rear</b> <b>quarters</b> was covered with fabric or leather and fitted with S-shaped side landau bars {{to make it appear}} like a convertible top. This became the commonly accepted definition of [...] "landau" [...] in North American marketing usage.|$|R

5000|$|The landau {{term was}} revived during the 1960s. There was a trend for making [...] "fake convertibles" [...] by {{applying}} vinyl roofs on regular cars. Some of these vehicles were called [...] "landaus" [...] by their manufacturers, {{and many were}} fitted with landau bars on the <b>rear</b> <b>quarters</b> (faux cabriolet). Some used the term [...] "Town Landau" [...] such as {{for one of the}} 1967 models in the Ford Thunderbird line. This generally meant a wider rear pillar with no <b>rear</b> <b>quarter</b> windows, or a partial vinyl roof that was applied only over the rear seat area (and is thus reminiscent of a town car).|$|R
50|$|A landau roof is {{commonly}} used on the North American hearse. These vehicles have long, closed <b>rear</b> <b>quarters,</b> a vinyl roof, and large polished landau bars. This has been the preferred hearse style since before World War II.|$|R
