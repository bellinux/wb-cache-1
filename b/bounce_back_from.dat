500|$|Pedro II {{was also}} {{undergoing}} physical decline, which {{only served to}} exacerbate his mental state. In younger days, he was admired {{for his ability to}} work long hours and rapidly <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> setbacks. But [...] "lack of exercise and very poor eating habits also took their toll." [...] By the 1880s he had to rely on pince-nez spectacles for reading due to deterioration of his eyesight, and on dentures for eating, as sugar had caused his teeth to decay. A tendency to doze off unexpectedly began to be exhibited, including falling asleep [...] "in the middle of important meetings and during public engagements." [...] The cause was what is known today as type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent), with which the Emperor was diagnosed sometime around 1882. Throughout the following years, the monarch was afflicted with several sudden illnesses, ranging from stomach pains to fevers. In 1884 he received a laceration on his left leg which became infected and, complicated by his diabetes, took longer than expected to completely heal.

500|$|Much of the {{discussion}} after the match centred around referee Terje Hauge's decision to send off Lehmann. Football pundit Mark Lawrenson stated: [...] "The game changed when Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger agreed: [...] "When Jens Lehmann got sent off, that left us with 70 minutes to play with ten against eleven, against a team that retains the ball very well". He refused to openly criticise this decision, although he did criticise the decision to award Barcelona's first goal, as he felt that Samuel Eto'o was offside. Wenger was also adamant that his young side would <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the defeat. One person who did criticise the referee was Thierry Henry, stating: [...] "I was kicked all over the place. I expected the referee to do his job. I don't think he did". There was much discussion after the match over whether Henry would remain with Arsenal or move to Barcelona, whom he had been linked with a move to over the past months. Arsène Wenger was asked post match if Henry would leave, to which the Arsenal manager replied: [...] "I don't know. I don't think so". However, on 19 May, Henry signed a new four-year contract with Arsenal, ending the speculation about a possible move to Barcelona.|$|E

500|$|Mayberry {{entered the}} season looking to <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a rather tumultuous 2012 campaign, and was {{considered}} a solid bench player who can make occasional starts in the outfield. Baseball statistician Bill James projected Mayberry would hold a [...]257 batting average and hit 11 home runs in 306 plate appearances. Despite being projected as a bench player, Mayberry was the Phillies' opening day right fielder, and batted seventh in the opening day starting lineup, as Delmon Young, acquired to be the starting right fielder, was injured. On June 4, 2013, Mayberry hit a walk-off grand slam in the 11th inning against the Miami Marlins 7–3. The preceding inning, he hit a solo home run to tie the game. By doing so, {{he became the first}} player in Major League history to hit two extra-inning home runs, the second of which being a grand slam. Ultimately, Mayberry played in 134 games, recording just a [...]227 batting average, 11 home runs, and 39 runs batted in. After the season, the Phillies tendered a contract to him despite external pressure not to do so. Ruben Amaro Jr. commented that he sees Mayberry as a valuable player off the bench for a relatively cheap price. Bill Baer, a writer for Crashburn Alley, a Phillies blog sponsored by ESPN, countered, [...] "Everything Amaro said there is accurate. Mayberry is not starter-caliber; he is an ideal platoon partner in the outfield or at first base. The only problem is that the Phillies had some ideal situations to use Mayberry in specifically that way and Amaro either did not realize it or ignored it." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the {{following}} season, on October 18, 2008, Crosby scored one goal and three assists to surpass benchmarks of 100goals, 200assists, and 300points for his career. On the play in which Crosby scored, teammate Malkin assisted to record his own 200th point. As a result, Crosby had a team trainer cut the puck in half so both players could commemorate the achievement. Minor injury troubles kept Crosby from five games {{early in the season}} as he was listed day-to-day, but he was, for the most part, able to <b>bounce</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the previous injury-riddled season and stay healthy. He recorded 33 goals and 70 assists to finish third in league scoring, as Evgeni Malkin captured his first career Art Ross Trophy. Entering the 2009 playoffs as the defending Prince of Wales Trophy winners, the Penguins defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the opening round before meeting the Washington Capitals for a highly publicized second-round matchup. The series was heavily followed as it pitted Ovechkin of the Capitals against both Crosby and Malkin, who together finished as the league's top three scorers that season. In the second game, Crosby and Ovechkin recorded matching three-goal efforts for their first career playoff hat tricks in a 4–3 Capitals victory. Despite being down 2–0 in the series, Crosby and the Penguins won the next three games and eventually defeated the Capitals in a seventh and deciding game, in which Crosby added another two goals. Following a sweep of the Carolina Hurricanes in the Eastern Conference Final, Crosby opted against recent NHL tradition and picked up the Prince of Wales Trophy, which he had left untouched the previous year. In explanation of the change of heart, Crosby said, [...] "We didn't touch the trophy last year, and obviously we didn't have the result we wanted ... Although we haven't accomplished exactly what we want ... we can still enjoy it." ...|$|E

[...] Talking about the meaning and the composition of the song, Jer Fairall of PopMatters said: [...] "The song's subject—Adele mentally addressing an old lover who has since found happiness elsewhere—is familiar, but the detail she colors it with are vibrantly tactile and resonant, from the sense-memory setting of 'we were born and raised in a summer haze' to her recollection of his cruel kiss-off line 'I remember you said, 'sometimes it lasts in love and sometimes it hurts instead' and how she comes to take solace in the statement as an empowering mantra." ...|$|E
