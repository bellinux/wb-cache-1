500|$|Just to the north, the Rockaway Line gains {{two extra}} non-revenue tracks {{straddling}} the two revenue tracks. The western track {{is a test}} track, installed in 2001 and called the Far Rockaway Test Track, while the eastern track is used to relay shuttle trains. The western track extends around [...] or nearly 2 miles, while the eastern track is long enough for one full-length train (...) and ends at a bumper block. The test track was installed in 2001 by New York City Transit's Maintenance of Way Department to ensure that new cars have undergone necessary acceleration and <b>braking</b> <b>tests</b> before being put into revenue service. This was because NYCT needed to recover a greater amount of braking energy and reduce power demand peaks {{with the introduction of}} AC-motored cars with the capability for regenerative braking. A kinetic energy storage system with KESS technology was installed, and as a result, the voltage regulation of the track improved. The system provides voltage support to the revenue tracks as well as reinforcing the voltage of the test track during the testing of new trains.|$|E

50|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> is a {{term used}} in motorsport. A driver is said to <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> another driver when the two are driving very close {{together}} and the front driver deliberately brakes very hard, causing the second driver {{to have to do}} likewise and often make an evasive maneuver to avoid an accident.|$|R
40|$|At present time, the <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench conducts the <b>braking</b> and {{suspension}} <b>tests</b> of {{front or}} rear axles {{and the test}} results are evaluated through one axle. The purpose of the <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> system is to determine braking force and damping coefficient dissymmetry of one axle. Thus, this test system evaluates the performance of service brake, hand brake and suspension systems by considering separately front and rear axle dissymmetry. For this reason, the effects of different braking and damping forces applied by right and left wheels of both axles on braking performance of all vehicle are not determined due to available algorithm of the test bench. Also, the other brake failures are not occurred due to the algorithm of <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> system. In this study, the interface has been developed to determine the other effects of dissymmetry and the other brake failures by using the one axle results of <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench. The interface has algorithm computing the parameters according to the interaction between front and rear axles by only using measured test results. Also, it gives the warnings by comparing changes in the parameters with braking performance rules. <b>Braking</b> and suspension <b>tests</b> of three different vehicles have been conducted by using <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> bench to determine {{the performance of the}} algorithm. Parameters based on the axle interaction have been calculated by transferring <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> results to the interface and the test results have been evaluated. As a result, the effects of brake and suspension failures on braking performance of both axle and vehicle have been determined thanks to the developed interface. </span...|$|R

50|$|The {{main cause}} of the {{accident}} was blamed on human error when interpreting signals. The Finnish signalling system {{at that time was}} still less than ten years old. It contained a number signal as a complement to the expect 35 or proceed 35 aspects to allow higher speeds, such as 80 or 110 km/h. The signals at Jyväskylä were showing expect 35 and proceed 35; with the number signal they were able to show the signals expect 80 and proceed 80 respectively for trains directed on track 1. According to the data recovered from the train and subsequent <b>braking</b> <b>tests,</b> it seems that the driver had misinterpreted the signals and arrived at Jyväskylä, fully expecting to enter track 1 at a speed of 80 km/h, and, realising what had happened, applied emergency braking just before the fateful switch.|$|E

40|$|In the past, <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> of rubber-tyred {{vehicles}} {{operating in}} quarries, opencast coal sites, mines and similar environments, comprised ‘simple’ stopping distance tests, typically {{carried out at}} daily or weekly intervals. More recently, many operators of such plant have progressed to using a <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> method that employs electronic instrumentation, {{as a means of}} determining the ‘brake ratio’ of a vehicle. This is because instrumented testing gives more accurate results. Accordingly, the time between performing these instrumented tests has increased to monthly, or even 3 -monthly, intervals. For both simple and instrumented test methods, international standard ISO 3450 is often (wrongly) used as the guide to acceptable <b>brake</b> performance <b>testing</b> regimes. The ISO standard contains formulae that enable either a stopping distance or a brake ratio to be calculated (depending on which test method is used). However, these calculated values are minimum levels of braking ability necessary for a vehicle to be placed on the market. That is, the ISO standard is a minimum standard for manufacture, not a maintenance standard. To put this into context, it is likely that any ‘modern’ vehicle will have levels of braking performance approaching twice these minimum ISO values. In using these ISO values as routine test pass or fail criteria, organisations may be indirectly accepting that brakes on modern vehicles can deteriorate by up to 50 per cent before their operators become concerned with braking ability. In addition, test conditions on site (particularly speed and gradient) may be much less onerous than those used in ISO 3450, which produces low test results. The overall outcome of this may be a ‘poor’ <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> result, but one that exceeds a low level pass criterion and is not, therefore, seen as a test failure. Another common problem with some <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> regimes is that they do not readily correlate to site operating conditions; in particular to gradients, but also to vehicle speed and load. The law requires organisations to ‘ensure’ that work equipment is suitable (safe) for the conditions of use it will encounter. This means being able to demonstrate that vehicle braking capabilities are adequate for actual site operating gradients, speeds and loads. Naturally therefore, any testing regime should accurately take account of the site conditions which the vehicle will be exposed to. In order to address these shortcomings regarding <b>brake</b> <b>testing</b> of rubber-tyred vehicles, this guide explains the brake ratio method of <b>brake</b> <b>testing.</b> A step-by-step guide on how to correlate braking performance with actual site conditions and how to design and put in place a suitable <b>brake</b> <b>test</b> regime is preceded by several discussion chapters.
