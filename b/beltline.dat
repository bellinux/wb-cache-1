5|$|By 1945, Byp. US131, {{along with}} the other various bypass routes, was {{designated}} along the Grand Rapids <b>beltline</b> system, replacing M-114. Byp. US131 followed the south <b>beltline</b> (28th Street) and East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue between Division Avenue and Plainfield Avenue, allowing north–south traffic to bypass downtown Grand Rapids. In late 1949, M-37 was rerouted onto 28th Street between Kalamazoo and East Beltline/Broadmoor avenues. Then in 1953, US131 was rerouted onto the beltlines to replace its bypass route; the former mainline through downtown was redesignated Bus. US131.|$|E
5|$|M-44 {{starts at}} the {{intersection}} of 28th Street and East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue in Kentwood. M-11 runs east and west along 28th Street and M-37 runs south along Broadmoor Avenue as the continuation of East <b>Beltline.</b> M-44 and M-37 run together on East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue north from this intersection, which is also the location of the Woodland Mall in Kentwood. From here north, M-37/M-44 runs along a four-lane divided boulevard through the campus of Calvin College. East <b>Beltline</b> passes through suburban residential areas near the east end of Reeds Lake and M-21's western terminus at Fulton Street. Just north of this intersection is an interchange with I-96 at exit38. M-37 leaves the roadway to run along I-96 while M-44 continues northward along East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue. All of M-44 to this point is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|US 131 {{was moved}} to its freeway north of Grand Rapids in 1969. The Northland Drive segment of US131/M-44 was redesignated as only M-44, and the Plainfield Avenue segment became Conn. M-44. M-37 was rerouted as well up East <b>Beltline</b> from M-11 {{concurrently}} with M-44 to I-96. In 1977, this junction at I-96 became the official western terminus of M-44, with the M-44 signs along East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue removed. Then in 2003, the signs along the East <b>Beltline</b> were restored and the route extended back to its former terminus.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{the state}} was {{building}} a <b>beltline</b> system for Grand Rapids. This highway, numbered M-114 was decommissioned by 1945 and the streets that composed it were given new designations. Byp. M-21 was routed along 28th Street from Grandville to Paris Township and along East <b>Beltline</b> into Grand Rapids Township. In 1953, the mainline M-21 was rerouted to replace its bypass around downtown, decommissioning the Byp. M-21 designation.|$|E
5|$|Bypass US Highway131 (Byp. US131) was a {{bypass route}} around {{downtown}} Grand Rapids. The highway followed 28th Street eastward from the intersection with US131 (Division Street) south of downtown. From this starting point eastward, it ran concurrently with Byp. US16 and Byp M-21. M-37 also followed 28th Street {{at the time}} eastward from the intersection at Kalamazoo Avenue. At the intersection with East <b>Beltline</b> and Broadmoor avenues in Paris Township (now Kentwood), Byp.US16/Byp. US131/Byp.M-21 turned northward to follow East <b>Beltline,</b> and M-37 turned southward on Broadmoor. The bypass route continued northward through Grand Rapids Township. At the intersection with US16/M-50 (Cascade Road), Byp. US16 ended, and Byp. M-21 ended {{less than half a}} mile (0.4km) north of that at the intersection with M-21 (Fulton Street). North of the intersection with Fulton Street, Byp. US131 was the only designation along East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue at the time. The highway ran northward into Plainfield Township, and it terminated at an intersection with US131 at Plainfield Avenue and Northland Drive just south of the Grand River.|$|E
5|$|The {{designation}} {{was created}} when US131 was rerouted on the Grand Rapids <b>beltline</b> system in 1953. Previously, a Bypass US131 (BYP US131) designation was {{used on the}} <b>beltline</b> system following 28th Street and East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue. After the change, the former mainline through downtown on Division Street and Plainfield Avenue was redesignated Bus. US131, and the mainline US131 replaced Byp. US131. In 1961, the US131 freeway was extended northward {{to the west of}} downtown, and between 28th Street and the downtown exit, it was initially designated as part of Bus. US131. In December 1962, the I-296/US131 freeway was completed west of downtown. Afterwards, Bus. US131 was truncated on its southern end to the modern exit84B interchange {{on the south side of}} downtown. At the same time, the northern end was also truncated, using Coldbrook Street and Monroe Avenue to Leonard Street to connect back to the freeway.|$|E
50|$|Spooner Hall was {{constructed}} of rough-faced gray limestone blocks quarried {{in the immediate}} vicinity. A red Dakota sandstone accents quoins, columns, <b>beltlines</b> and sills. The roof is a steeply pitched gable with clay tile roof covering, accented by a sculpted owl on {{the peak of the}} western gable. The original interior was completely modified for use as an art gallery.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, many ring {{roads are}} called <b>beltlines,</b> beltways, or loops, {{such as the}} Capital Beltway around Washington, D.C. Some ring roads, such as Washington's Capital Beltway, use [...] "Inner Loop" [...] and [...] "Outer Loop" [...] {{terminology}} for directions of travel, since cardinal (compass) directions cannot be signed uniformly around the entire loop. The term 'ring road' is occasionally - and inaccurately - used interchangeably with the term 'bypass'.|$|R
5000|$|The Belt Line {{passes through}} {{the eastern edge of}} the Westview {{neighborhood}} as part of the <b>BeltLine's</b> [...] "Model Mile". (See the map displaying the proposed areas.) Construction was broken into two phases. The first phase broke ground on January 22, 2008 at White Street in West End. The second phase broke ground on December 12, 2009 at Muse Street. The walking path features greenery, park space, and an arboretum. Though still some years away, a street car station is proposed for the intersection of Ralph David Abernathy Blvd., Langhorn Street, and Cascade Avenue.|$|R
5|$|Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) was a {{bypass route}} of M-21 in Kent County. It {{started at the}} {{intersection}} between M-21 (Chicago Drive) and 28th Street in Grandville. From there, it was routed eastward along 28th Street running concurrently with Byp. US16. At the intersection with US131 (Division Street) on the Wyoming–Paris township line, a Byp. US131 started and ran concurrently eastward along 28th Street. Byp. US16/Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 continued along 28th Street in Paris Township to an intersection with Kalamazoo Avenue where M-37 turned off Kalamazoo and onto 28th Street. Further east, 28th Street and East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue intersected. At that junction, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 turned northward along East <b>Beltline</b> while M-37 turned south and Byp. US16 continued eastward on 28th Street. Running northward in Grand Rapids Township, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 intersected US16/M-50 at Cascade Road before Byp. M-21 terminated at the intersection with M-21 (Fulton Street).|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{the state}} highway {{department}} completed {{enough of the}} Grand Rapids <b>beltline</b> to reroute M-21 to it. The former routing of M-21 was then redesignated Bus. M-21. With the completion of I-196 from Holland to Grand Rapids in 1974, the highway was truncated to its current format and renamed BS I-196.|$|E
5|$|East of the river, I-96 and M-37 {{pass through}} the {{northern}} suburb of Comstock Park, intersecting Connector M-44 (CONN M-44, Plainfield Avenue) near Lamberton Lake. Past that interchange, the freeway angles southeasterly and then southward, bypassing Grand Rapids to the northeast. East of downtown, I-96/M-37 meets I-196 (Gerald R. Ford Freeway) at a partial interchange; traffic headed eastbound on I-196 must enter I-96 eastbound and only westbound I-96 traffic may enter I-196. Immediately east of the interchange is another for M-44 (East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue) where M-37 separates from the freeway to turn southward. Through this series of interchanges, I-96 curves {{to the east and}} then turns back southward after passing through them. There are two more interchanges for M-21 (Fulton Street) and Cascade Road before I-96 meets the eastern end of M-11 at 28th Street. The next interchange for 36th Street provides access to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. The freeway continues to the east of the airport and then intersects the eastern end of M-6 (Paul B. Henry Freeway, South <b>Beltline</b> Freeway) at an interchange over the confluence of the Thornapple and Grand rivers.|$|E
5000|$|PATH400 will be ca. 5 mile km long, {{extending}} from Loridans Drive {{south to the}} Atlanta <b>BeltLine’s</b> Peachtree Creek spur trail. The trail will be 10 ft to 14 ft wide and traverse the neighborhoods of North Buckhead, Peachtree Park and Lindmont LaVista. It {{is intended to be}} the [...] "spine of Buckhead’s Trails and Greenways Subsystem, part of the Buckhead Collection, connecting parks, trails, schools and neighborhoods to the urban core of Buckhead and ultimately to the Atlanta BeltLine." [...] The PATH400 Trail is a partnership between Buckhead CID, Livable Buckhead and the PATH Foundation, and is estimated to cost $10 million.|$|R
40|$|During 1990 - 2001, a {{total of}} 518 fires {{occurred}} in all metal/ nonmetal mining categories; 296 of those fires caused 308 injuries and 4 fatalities. Surface operations had the most fires and the highest injury risk rate values. Forty-five fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. In the future, many of these fires and injuries might be prevented or detected and extinguished at their earliest stage by improving current fire safety procedures, adopting existing/ improved fire detection and suppression technologies, and/or developing new technologies. Several strategies for reducing and/or preventing the number of fires and fire injuries follow. I. Increase vigilance, improve safety procedures, and develop new technologies {{in order to prevent}} fires and injuries caused by fame cutting and welding operations. 2. Improve equipment hydraulic/fuel/electrical systems inspection programs; adopt fire-resistant hydraulic fluids and electrically powered motors for use in underground mines; develop new technologies (equipment/cab rapid fire detection/ prevention/suppression systems, emergency line drainage systems, and fire barriers); adopt an optimal ground level location for the activation of emergency systems; improve operator's fire preparedness training programs; and develop effective and rapid local firefighting response capabilities. 3. Adopt existing/improved systems for continuous and early detection of combustion gases and smoke along <b>beltlines.</b> 4. Adopt existing/improved technologies for monitoring equipment (<b>beltlines)</b> operational functions. 5. Increase vigilance and adopt improved safety procedures for handling f amenable liquids and refueling fuel in the vicinity of heat sources...|$|R
50|$|For {{model year}} 1974, Chrysler Corporation {{introduced}} its new large car lineup originally planned a year earlier. The timing {{could hardly have}} been worse… The Arab oil embargo of late 1973 had Americans waiting in line for gasoline coast to coast, sometimes for hours. Big cars quickly became a glut on the market, despite the fact that Chrysler’s new models were some of the best large cars Chrysler had produced in years. The new styling was a clear departure from the fuselage generation, and appeared to share the proportions and design cues of GM’s 1971 large car redesign. Body sides had a more pronounced tumble home. A-pillars were thin, and <b>beltlines</b> were noticeable lower, yielding significantly more glass area. Energy absorbing bumpers were nicely integrated into the designs, front and rear.|$|R
5|$|In 1953, {{the route}} was realigned onto {{the south and}} west <b>beltline</b> to bypass Grand Rapids; the old routing through {{downtown}} became Business M-50 (Bus. M-50). In the late 1950s, when the US127 freeway bypass east of Jackson opened up, the old routing through town became Bus. US127/M-50. At the same time, the concurrency with US23 between Dundee and the Ida area was dropped after the new US23 freeway opened; the old route becomes solely designated M-50.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Kent County, M-37 follows Cherry Valley Road through Caledonia. As {{the highway}} transitions to Broadmoor Avenue, the landscape also transitions from rural to suburban. North of 76th Street, Broadmoor widens to a four-lane boulevard which passes a campus of Davenport University near the M-6 freeway {{on the outskirts}} of the Grand Rapids area. This section is dominated by light industrial complexes west of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in the suburb of Kentwood. These complexes change over to retail establishments north of 32nd Street. At 28th Street, Broadmoor Avenue ends, and East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue begins. This same intersection also marks the western terminus of M-44, which starts concurrent with M-37 in Kentwood. These two highway designations follow East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue between the Woodland Mall and the Centerpointe Mall. North of the malls, M-37/M-44 passes through the campus of Calvin College and along residential areas at the east end of Reeds Lake. The intersection of East Beltine Avenue and Fulton Street is the western terminus for M-21, a highway that runs east across the state to Flint. North of this junction, M-37/M-44 meets I-96.|$|E

5000|$|An {{article in}} Creative Loafing called the store [...] "one of the city's quirky charms that Atlantans seem to both love and hate {{at the same}} time". It opened shortly after 1986, when low-interest {{government}} loans were used to convert the adjacent and former Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant into lofts and commercial spaces. From the 1990s, and until at least 2002, the store had drivers license renewal services. In 2002 the store tested scan-it-yourself checkout devices. After two Publix supermarkets opened nearby, the store was refurbished around 2002. The closest neighboring Kroger, near Little Five Points, is the area's top performing one, as of 2006. In October 1999, a man robbed the Bank of America inside the store. [...] A song titled [...] "Murder Kroger" [...] by the group Attractive Eighties Women, which incorporates a mention of the nearby Clermont Lounge into the lyrics, is dedicated to shoppers who frequent the store. Renovations were scheduled for completion in November 2014 at the market, including a bike/pedestrian ramp to the Atlanta <b>BeltLine's</b> Eastside Trail, a bike repair station, new curbs and sidewalks (including paved sidewalk access to Ponce de Leon Avenue), new trees and landscaping, a [...] "water quality pond" [...] {{in the parking lot}} to filter runoff, new LED parking lot lighting and repaving the front and back parking lots.|$|R
50|$|During the 1974 model year, {{the newly}} {{redesigned}} full-size C-body 1974 Plymouth Fury was offered {{as the last}} full-size car in production after nine previous model years of production as a full-size car (since from model years 1965-1968 and from model years 1969-1973). During the next four model years (1975-1978) the Plymouth Fury nameplate would be relegated only to Chrysler's mid-size B-body platform, which is the concurrent mid-size B-body 1974 Plymouth Satellite, which also is the concurrent mid-size B-body 1974 Dodge Coronet (since from model years 1965-1973 - on from model years 1975-1976) as well, in which the Satellite nameplate (ever since its first appearance on Chrysler's mid-size B-body Plymouths from during the mid-1960s) was eliminated during {{the end of the}} 1974 model year. During the next three model years (1975-1977), Chrysler's full-size C-body Plymouth would become the Plymouth Gran Fury. The 1974 Plymouth Fury shared Chrysler's all-new full-size C-body platform in common with the concurrent flagship Imperial (on through to model year 1975), the concurrent Chrysler New Yorker (on through to model year 1978), Chrysler Newport (on through to model year 1978) and the concurrent Chrysler Town and Country (on through to model year 1977), also with the concurrent Dodge Monaco (on through to model year 1976 - and the 1977 model year Dodge Royal Monaco) as well. Styling was more squared off with lower <b>beltlines</b> and greater use of glass than with Chrysler's previous fuselage generation (from model years 1969-1973), also with cues more similar to the model year 1971 and later Buicks and model year 1973-1974 Mercurys. The unibody structure with subframe for engine/transmission was retained along with other typical Chrysler Corporation engineering features including torsion bar front suspension and multi-leaf springs in the rear.|$|R
5|$|A Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) {{designation}} {{was created}} in the Grand Rapids area in 1945. This designation ran from the corner of 28th Street and Chicago Drive along Byp. US16 and Byp. US131 on 28th Street. At East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 turned north back to M-21. M-21A in Flint was turned over to local control in 1948, decommissioning the number. The Byp. M-21 routing was replaced by M-21 in 1953. The former routing in Grand Rapids became Bus. M-21 instead.|$|E
5|$|As {{it existed}} before the {{designation}} was removed, M-114 {{started at the}} corner of BYP US16 (28th Street) and what is now East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue in Paris Township (now Kentwood) and ran northward. The trunkline intersected the mainline for US16/M-50 at Cascade Road and the mainline for M-21 at Fulton Street near East Grand Rapids in Grand Rapids Township. Further north, the highway split into two. In Plainfield Township, a leg of M-114 continued west along the modern 3Mile Road through an intersection with US131 to terminate at Coit Avenue near the Grand River and the other leg continued north to a terminus with US131 at Northland Drive and Plainfield Avenue.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} farther north, {{and closer to}} Grand Rapids, it is lined with more commercial and light industrial properties. The unincorporated suburb of Cutlerville lies to the east as US131 approaches M-6, the South <b>Beltline</b> Freeway, and meets in the largest freeway interchange in West Michigan. Gaining a third lane in each direction, the interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8km) in width and over a mile (1.6km) in length and encompasses 27bridges and 18retaining walls. US131 continues north through the city of Wyoming to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of Grand Rapids north of M-11 (28th Street).|$|E

5|$|East of US131, M-6 crosses over Division Avenue {{and enters}} Gaines Township {{through a series}} of sound barrier walls as the freeway ramps merge back into the main lanes. This area had the highest traffic counts in 2011 at 55,236vehicles per day. Near Kalamazoo Avenue, the freeway passes through an area with retail {{businesses}} and movie theaters {{on each side of the}} interchange; to the northeast is East Kentwood High School. On the approach to the East Paris Avenue underpass, M-6 curves first to the northeast and then back to the southeast, passing near one of Steelcase's office buildings, the pyramid-shaped Corporate Development Center. The freeway begins to curve to the northeast as it crosses into Caledonia Township, with an interchange for M-37 (Broadmoor Avenue) and an overpass for 60th Street. M-6 curves around the southeast side of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Cascade Township. As the South <b>Beltline</b> nears I-96, it crosses 48th Street next to the Thornapple Pointe Golf Course. The carriageway splits into ramps for each direction of I-96, the ramps to eastbound I-96 crossing over the Thornapple River in the process. This interchange marks the eastern terminus of the Paul B. Henry South <b>Beltline</b> Freeway. The entire length of the freeway is listed on the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, M-21 was rerouted {{to replace}} its bypass route. The former route through {{downtown}} Grand Rapids was redesignated as Bus. M-21. At the time, Bus. M-21 continued eastward along Franklin Street before turning northward on Eastern Avenue into downtown Grand Rapids. Once there, it followed Fulton Street eastward through East Grand Rapids and into Grand Rapids Township where it terminated at East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue. The business loop was truncated to US131 in 1972, and then redesignated as BS I-196 in 1974.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{approached}} Kent County, it met the western terminus of M-11 {{which was the}} former routing of US16 through the Grand Rapids metropolitan area. I-196/US16 continued eastward around {{the north side of}} the metropolitan area through the suburbs of Walker and Comstock Park. The freeway intersected the contemporaneous routing of US131 along the East <b>Beltline</b> and curved south through the eastern edge of Grand Rapids to meet the end of I-96 east of downtown. There I-196 ended and US16 was transferred to the I-96 freeway. I-96/US16 continued southward intersecting Cascade Road, which was previously US16. Cascade Road east of this interchange meets the westernmost part of Grand River Avenue, which carried US16 east continuously to Downtown Detroit.|$|E
5|$|By June 15, 1942 the {{highways}} in the Grand Rapids area were reconfigured. A Bypass US16 (BYP US16) designation {{was assigned to}} the portion of M-114 that traveled around the southwest side of Grand Rapids (now M-11), leaving just the east and unfinished north segments left. The section along {{the east side of the}} city was completed as M-114. A northern leg was added along 3 Mile Road at the same time. By 1945, the northern leg of M-114 was turned back to local control and removed from the highway system. The eastern leg was assigned a BYP US131 designation, thereby eliminating the last remaining portion of M-114. A BYP M-21 designation was also used along part of the southern and eastern legs. East <b>Beltline</b> now carries M-37 and M-44.|$|E
5|$|Cotto's third {{championship}} defense {{took place}} on September 24, 2005 at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, against Ricardo Torres of Colombia. In the first round Cotto had an offensive advantage and scored a knockdown on Torres. In the second round after trading hits Torres scored a knockdown on Miguel. The last seconds of the round were evenly matched with both boxers finishing the round injured. Cotto was apparently in better condition when the third round began and was dominating the fight at that point. With two minutes remaining in the round one of Cotto's punches landed in Torres' <b>beltline.</b> Following this Torres was granted thirty seconds to recover by the referee. Cotto dominated the fourth round and Torres won the fifth. Cotto won and scored a knockdown in the sixth round. At 1:24 of the seventh round a left hook by Cotto knocked Torres out.|$|E
5|$|M-114 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway and planned <b>beltline</b> in the US state of Michigan around the city of Grand Rapids. It was designated {{by the end of}} 1929 on various streets in adjoining cities and townships. By the 1940s, sections of it on the west and south sides of Grand Rapids were given new designations and the segment along the east side of town was finished. By late 1945 the highway designation was completely decommissioned in favor of other numbers. M-114 split into two branches, one running east–west and the other running north–south. The east–west spur routing is now local streets while the rest is part of state highways.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1962, {{the freeway}} through {{downtown}} Grand Rapids was completed, including the section marked as I-296. The business loop {{was removed from}} the freeway when US131 took its place. East <b>Beltline</b> Avenue was renumbered as an extension of M-44, while 28th Street retains the M-11/M-21 designations it had in addition to US131. I-296/US131 runs alongside the Grand River between I-96 downtown and I-196 north of town. At the end of I-296, US131 followed I-196 east to the northern portion of the business loop at Plainfield Avenue and followed Plainfield Avenue back to the remainder of its routing north of Grand Rapids. The other end of the freeway was extended south to M-43 {{on the west side of}} Kalamazoo. Traffic there is directed along M-43 into downtown to connect with the remainder of the highway.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} the freeway opened, traffic volumes along {{parallel}} roads like 44th, 56th and 68th streets dropped 40–50%. At the same time, roads with interchanges along the freeway saw increased traffic. Wilson Avenue experienced a 120% increase and sections of Byron Center Avenue jumped 100% in traffic levels a month after M-6 opened. Property values in the townships surrounding the freeway increased 11.3–12.4% by 2006 {{as a result of}} development attached to the freeway. Local officials credited the freeway for increased access to the area, driving housing starts as residents flocked to the communities for their schools and quality of life. In 2007, the Metro Health Village, a commercial development centered around the Byron Center Avenue exit and the hospital opened. Described as being similar to a mall with the hospital as a tenant, the village features restaurants, shops, offices and a hotel. Metro Health relocated from Grand Rapids to the location in Wyoming in the face of opposition to planned expansions of their previous location. Since opening, even though the freeway was officially named for Paul Henry, the original South <b>Beltline</b> name is still in use.|$|E
