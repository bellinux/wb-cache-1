The Sungei Road laksa legacy {{was started in}} 1956 when a Hainanese friend of Wong, Ah Tong, gave Wong and his brother Wong Yew Poh, his secret recipe for laksa on account of their long-standing friendship. The Wong brothers set up a push-cart stall to sell their laksa and the response to their recipe was overwhelming. It was sold with the thick bee hoon (Chinese noodle) cut up and served only with a spoon, without chopsticks, topped with cockles, <b>bean</b> <b>sprouts</b> and home-made fried fish cakes in distinctive chicken motif bowls. Customers ate it while standing by the roadside and it cost only 20 cents a bowl back then. By day, they sold along Johor Road and by night, off Sungei Road. Today, the brothers have since lost contact with Ah Tong, but their children still serve the traditional recipe, using charcoal fire to keep his gravy constantly warm to maintain its distinctive flavour. It is regarded among the best laksa stalls in Singapore by many food reviewers.|$|E

For this purpose, in a farm test, 4 cultivars of Faba bean plants (Barekat, Saraziri, Eraghi and Gavi) were cultivated on 11 sowing dates (one in each month) and the required days to their sprouting were recorded. Beta, curve, quadratic and Sawtooth models were used to describe relationship between the sprouting rate and the temperature. To select the best model, it has been used an average root mean square deviation (RMSD), an R square (R 2), simple linear regression coefficients (a and b) and a correlation coefficient (r). The results showed that the Faba <b>bean</b> <b>sprouting</b> reaction to temperature was better described by a Piecewise function. The estimation of the cardinal temperature by a Piecewise function indicated that the base temperature varies from 0. 98 C to 1. 61 C, and the optimum temperature varies from 24. 99 C to 28. 8 C for the different cultivars of Faba bean plants, but the ceiling temperature for all the cultivars was estimated at 35 degree centigrade. Also, the required biologic day estimation for sprouting as determined by the Piecewise model showed a significant difference between the cultivars, as the Gavi cultivars (which are smaller) germinated after 6. 65 days (maximum rate is 0. 09). For the other cultivars, the required biologic day fell between 8. 60 and 9. 31 days.

Approach: We hypothesized that antifungal activities might be found in <b>sprouts</b> of mung <b>beans,</b> or Vigna radiate (L.) R. Wilczek.
