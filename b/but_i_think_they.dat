500|$|The {{group also}} held an improvisational {{approach}} to live performances, which connected the band with jam band culture. [...] "Jazz and blues musicians {{have been doing}} this for decades, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> really brought that sense that anyone onstage can inspire anyone else at any given time to rock music," [...] said Haynes. [...] "We sure didn’t set out to be a [...] "jam band" [...] but those long jams just emanated from within the band, because we didn’t want to just play three minutes and be over," [...] said Allman. Rolling Stone referred to the group as [...] "without question the first great jam band, and they took the jam to heights that it had not previously reached." ...|$|E
500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player. You know I have the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E
500|$|McEwen faced {{questions}} about the bounced checks he had written on the House bank. Buchert ran campaign commercials citing McEwen's checks, the expenses of his Congressional office, and his campaign finance disclosures, while noting Portman was [...] "the handpicked choice of the downtown money crowd" [...] and was [...] "a registered foreign agent for the biggest Democrat lobbying firm in Washington," [...] labeling Portman and McEwen [...] "Prince Rob and Bouncing Bob." [...] McEwen, who had taken a hard-line on his checks in 1992, relented in the campaign. Martin Gottlieb wrote, [...] "McEwen says now that his problem {{was a form of}} excessive pride. He says he used to 'demand perfection' of himself." [...] McEwen also said, [...] "I felt I could never admit a mistake.... I am very, very sorry. I should have watched it more carefully.... I have learned a great deal." [...] Les Spaeth, chairman of the Warren County Republican Party and former Warren County Auditor, said, [...] "People very much disliked the check overdraft thing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> don't see it as happening again. I think it's past. He made a mistake and he got caught. But that's overridden by the service he's given, particularly to our county." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{told the}} {{president}} over the 'phone that I was innocent, maybe the three swore to it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> gave their names." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{remember}} seeing any very handsome girls while I was here. There are some pretty girls {{up at the}} Glen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>they</b> could be called beautiful." ...|$|R
2500|$|The other {{threat to}} the {{security}} of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights {{of the rest of us}} are hardly safe … ...|$|E
2500|$|Bishop lectured {{in higher}} {{education}} {{for a number of}} years starting in the 1970s when her inheritance began to run out. For a short time she taught at the University of Washington, before teaching at Harvard University for seven years. She often spent her summers in her summer house in the island community of North Haven, Maine. She taught at New York University, before finishing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She commented, [...] "I don’t think I believe in writing courses at all, It’s true, children sometimes write wonderful things, paint wonderful pictures, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> should be discouraged." ...|$|E
2500|$|John O'Hara, in his 1960 novel Ourselves to Know, uses St. Anthony Hall {{membership}} in the characterizations of the protagonists: [...] "Did you join a fraternity at Penn?" [...] I said. [...] "Yes I did. [...] St Anthony-Delta Psi. [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were sorry that they invited me..." [...] --- [...] "I happened to know, because I had seen it, {{that he had a}} Delta Psi Tea Company gold charm on his watch chain, but the reason he did not show it was one of delicacy; in 1908 they had not accepted his resignation but he kept the insigne hidden..." [...] --- [...] "He and Robert quickly looked at each other's watch-chain and the Delta Psi charm and smiled. [...] "You know, I've been meaning to write you a letter..." [...] ("Tea" [...] Company was a then-used appellation referring to the fraternity's Tau Cross emblem.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The schooner!" [...] said Harry significantly. [...] "She's {{beating up}} over the tide and she'll {{probably}} stand close in, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> could see us against the land." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to do, at present," [...] Will said. [...] "When the other parties arrive, they may make an attack; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will do so, till night.|$|R
6000|$|... "It would assuredly be {{a desperate}} enterprise, sheik, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> may attempt it, seeing {{that it is}} all-important to them to obtain {{possession}} of the port before our fleet can return." ...|$|R
60|$|D-n. What are details? C-l-y. I am not sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{are things}} that are left over.|$|E
60|$|None of us voiced his belief. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{were all}} alike: Victory and Snider had stolen the launch, and deserted us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' he said. 'Of course it's {{difficult}} to remember exactly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were placed there soon after one o'clock {{the day before}} yesterday.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those Indian muskets are no good," [...] Harold said contemptuously, [...] "and {{the trade}} powder the Indians get is very poor stuff; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> are well {{within range of}} my rifle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>I</b> cannot say, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{will come}} from Revel. There was a talk of large reinforcements, but whether from Sweden or from the king's army, I cannot say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fulkerson had {{the word}} for her: academic. She's {{everything}} that instruction and discipline can make of a woman; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> could make enough of her {{to be in love}} with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{belong to}} papa. When you ask about cattle {{you must go}} to Sid Todd. He knows every animal for miles around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The first boat is {{not more}} than fifty yards behind, the other thirty or forty behind it. They gain on us very slowly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will catch us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jennie {{went out}} with him this afternoon," [...] {{continued}} Annie. [...] "Where they went to, I do not know. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> hired a motor boat and went across the lake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think the}} young men think much about the obedience," [...] said Nora. [...] "Some marry for money, and some for love. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> marry to get a slave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The detectives are {{following}} up {{one or two}} clues. One report was that this Baxter and Girk had gone to some place on Staten Island. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> know for certain." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me in a {{pleading}} sort of way. I wouldn't swear that her eyes were wet with unshed tears, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were, certainly she clasped her hands in piteous appeal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly; {{and that}} is just the way they have grown great--by {{dropping}} you when you have ceased to be useful. People say they are not clever; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are very clever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{will take}} the form of a chronicle, a kind of diary, wherein each chapter will be called a camp. Camp One, Camp Two, and the like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{they both}} lay still, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were nearly dead {{when they were}} put on the te-train. Their heads moved thus. And there is much blood on the line. Come and see?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't mass {{unless you}} {{absolutely}} have to," [...] were his words of caution. [...] "They have the weight, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have the wind. Keep {{them on the}} jump. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that is your only chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] he said, [...] "these {{are the men}} we expected, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> mean {{to worry}} us now, and they've had a long ride." [...] He turned to the strangers. [...] "Won't you sit down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{expect to}} make {{anything}} out of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would be grateful," [...] said Rose on one occasion when several complaints had come in at once and Buffum had reported great difficulty in collecting the low rents.|$|R
6000|$|Clarke {{examined}} it. [...] "It's rather heavy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{will use}} it. Place {{it on the}} table. Put a pad and pencil there also," [...] he added. [...] "We may get some writing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{supposed}} that {{father would have}} been pleased, anyway; for he has seen her, and--and. Of course the girls haven't, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> might have trusted my judgment a little. I'm not quite a fool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{care more}} for {{the opinion of the}} tenth person than of the nine," [...] said Harry; [...] "I care more for what you think than any of them. Your words are severe; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are just." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, this {{afternoon}} the captain may set {{the men at}} work; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would do much good, {{and there would be}} a good chance of getting a limb broken. As long as this calm holds there is no hurry, one way or the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They may not; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> suspect <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{can carry}} any {{connection}} {{they choose to}} make, and <b>I</b> mostly <b>think</b> <b>they</b> can--ten generations of Quaker ancestry--" ...|$|R
