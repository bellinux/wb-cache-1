I will present a conceptual model that links biodiversity to ecosystem function via a stage of entities organization. The model focuses on three feedback processes: 1.

The 340 B Program {{is a federal}} program that provides certain healthcare safety-net providers mandated price reductions on outpatient drugs. In 2010, critical access hospitals (CAHs) [...] small hospitals in isolated rural communities [...] became eligible for the program. This project set forth to understand the variables {{that are important to}} 340 B program enrollment and purchasing through the 340 B Prime Vendor Program (PVP), the government's contractor to represent the purchasing volume of all 340 <b>B</b> <b>entities.</b> The CAHs with a higher number of total outpatient visits, more staff in the pharmacy department, full implementation of electronic health records, in relatively more urban counties, offer chemotherapy and provide outpatient surgery have higher odds of enrolling in the 340 B Program. The CAHs that offer chemotherapy, have a contract pharmacy arrangement and have been enrolled in 340 B essentially since program eligibility began {{are more likely to have}} made 340 B purchases through the PVP. This project has also defined a typology to characterize the spectrum of 340 B use by CAHs. The 340 B typology is a systematic approach to understanding the differences in how the program may or may not be used and includes categories that range from CAHs never enrolling in the 340 B Program to CAHs that are purchasing drugs using the PVP...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{analysis}} and exploration {{of a social}} network depends {{on the type of}} relations at play. Borgatti had proposed a type taxonomy organizing relations in four possible categories. Homophily (similarity) relationships form an important categorywhere relations occur when entities of the network link whenever they exhibit similar behaviors. Examples are networks of coauthor, where homophily between two persons follows from co-authorship; or network of actors having played {{under the supervision of the}} same movie director, for instance. Homophily is often embodied through a bipartite network where entities of a given type A (authors, movie directors) connect through entities of a different type B (papers, actors). A common strategy is then to project this bipartite graph onto a single-type network with entities of a same type A, possibly weighting edges based on how the type A entities interact with the type <b>B</b> <b>entities</b> underlying the edge. The resulting single-type network can then be studied using standard techniques such as community detection using edge density, or the computation of various centrality indices. This paper revisits this type of approach and introduces a homogeneity measure inspired form past work by Burt. Two entities of type B interact when they both induce a same edge between two entities of type A. The homogeneity of a subgroup thus depends on how intensely and how equally interactions occur between entities of type B giving rise to the subgroup. The measure thus differentiates between subgroups of type A exhibiting similar topologies depending on the interaction patterns of the underlying entities of type B. The method is validated using two widely used datasets. A first example looks at authors of the IEEE InfoVis Conference (InfoVis 2007 Contest). A second example looks at homophily relations between movie actors that have played under the direction of a same director (IMDB) ...|$|E

DesignCross-sectional survey. Method :One hundred and ninety-two older adults (78 men and 114 women) from 60 to 93 years (Mage = 73. 44, SD = 7. 34) completed a series of questionnaires measuring openness to experience, implicit theories of ability, stereotypes about older people and physical activity, attitude toward own aging, physical self-worth, physical activity level, self-rated health and education level. Results :The main results showed that (a) openness to experience positively predicted physical activity level through incremental theories, endorsement of aging stereotypes relative to benefits, attitude toward own aging, and physical self-worth; and (<b>b)</b> <b>entity</b> theories negatively predicted physical activity level through endorsement of aging stereotypes relative to risks, attitude toward own aging, and physical self-worth.

We examine how to incorporate instances from related tasks, with the appropriate penalty in the loss function to optimize performance on the hold out sets. We present a regularized manifold approach {{that allows us to}} learn a distance metric for the different instances directly from the data. This approach allows incorporation of information from related task examples, without prior estimation of cross-task coefficient covariances.
