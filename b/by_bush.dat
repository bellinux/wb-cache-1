5|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear information, but did {{not initially}} combine their efforts. British officials did not reply to an August 1941 offer <b>by</b> <b>Bush</b> and Conant to create a combined British and American project. In November 1941, Frederick L. Hovde, {{the head of the}} London liaison office of OSRD, raised the issue of cooperation and exchange of information with Anderson and Lord Cherwell, who demurred, ostensibly over concerns about American security. Ironically, it was the British project that had already been penetrated by atomic spies for the Soviet Union.|$|E

It discussed {{the acquisition of}} land for the project's production facilities, which the Army recommended be {{in the vicinity of}} Knoxville, Tennessee, with the Boston firm of Stone & Webster as the project's principal contractor. The meeting on July 30, 1942, was devoted to reviewing progress on isotope separation by the centrifugal and gaseous diffusion methods. The August 26, 1942, meeting considered Lawrence's electromagnetic separation project, and expansion of the program to produce heavy water.|$|E

Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 1991, where he was greeted <b>by</b> <b>Bush</b> amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised in a manner much differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity {{and the source of}} great curiosity by the general public. He was quick to award praise and medals to the troops, part of what he saw as restoring pride in the U.S. armed forces after the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|The American effort {{increased}} {{rapidly and}} soon outstripped the British as the American authorities {{were reluctant to}} share details with their British counterparts. However, separate research continued in each country with some exchange of information. Several of the key British scientists visited the United States early in 1942 and were given full access {{to all of the}} information available. They were astounded at the momentum that the American atomic bomb project had then assumed. The British and American exchange of information and efforts continued but the nations did not combine their efforts, leading their programmes separately. Furthermore, in 1941 the British Government rebuffed and vetoed attempts and proposals <b>by</b> <b>Bush</b> and Conant to strengthen cooperation between Great Britain and America.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{faced the}} sixteenth–ranked Fresno State Bulldogs, led by ninth–year head coach Pat Hill and quarterback Paul Pinegar. The Bulldogs took an early lead on a Pinegar {{touchdown}} pass that was answered by LenDale White's rushing touchdown for the Trojans {{to leave the}} game tied {{at the end of}} the first quarter. After a rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs, the Trojans could only answer with a Mario Danelo field goal. A second passing touchdown by Pinegar and another Danelo field goal closed out the half with the Bulldogs leading 21–13. The Trojans seemed to take control of the game in the third quarter with a Leinart touchdown run, a Reggie Bush touchdown run, and a Leinart touchdown pass that gave the Trojans a 13-point lead. Pinegar answered for the Bulldogs with his third touchdown pass of the game, but a 50-yard touchdown rush <b>by</b> <b>Bush</b> allowed the Trojans to keep the same lead, Two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, Pinegar's fourth touchdown pass and a second rushing touchdown for the Bulldogs, gave them a 1-point lead with nineminutes left in the game. After a 65-yard run <b>by</b> <b>Bush,</b> White scored for the Trojans, who missed on a two–point conversion attempt. A Danelo field goal gave the Trojans a 50–42 lead, and the Trojans won after intercepting Pinegar with a minute left in the game. Bush set a Pac-10 record with 513total yards in the game, including almost 300yards rushing, and the Trojans increased their winning streak to 33games.|$|E
5|$|Against Oakland, the Bears scored 23 {{unanswered}} {{points in}} the first half, along with outgaining the Raiders 222 yards to 34 with a little over 10 minutes remaining in the first half. The Bears scored first off Forte's 32-yard touchdown, followed <b>by</b> <b>Bush</b> scoring two rushing touchdowns of ten and one yard each, and the first half ended with a 27–3 lead for Chicago. Meanwhile, the defense forced four turnovers off Tim Jennings and Isaiah Frey intercepting Matt Flynn and C. J. Wilson and Jerry Franklin intercepting Matt McGloin. As for Oakland, Terrelle Pryor replaced Flynn in the second half, and led the Raiders to two touchdowns and a field goal to narrow the gap to 27–20. The Bears retaliated with Michael Ford scoring a 15-yard touchdown, and the Raiders responded with McGloin's 5-yard touchdown pass to Jaime Olawale, but failed the two-point conversion, and the Bears sealed the game with Franklin's interception to win 34–26.|$|E

5|$|In September 1942, the {{director}} of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), Vannevar Bush, suggested Styer be appointed director of the Manhattan Project, but Somervell did not wish to lose his services, and engineered the appointment of Groves instead. On 23 September 1942, Styer {{became a member of the}} Military Policy Committee, a group chaired <b>by</b> <b>Bush</b> (with James B. Conant as his alternate) with Rear Admiral William R. Purnell as its third member. As director, Groves was answerable to the Military Policy Committee, which was responsible for the higher direction of the Manhattan Project. When the Combined Policy Committee was formed in September 1943 by the Quebec Agreement, its chairman, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, had Styer appointed as his deputy. Styer also became chairman of its technical subcommittee, which included America's Richard Tolman, Britain's James Chadwick and Canada's C. J. Mackenzie. The technical subcommittee became very influential, as it furnished most of the data on which the Combined Policy Committee based its decisions.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{views on}} the United States and the Middle East have evolved over time. Despite the anti-American views of some right-wing forums in the 1970s and 1980s (that chiefly were rooted in worries over US {{cultural}} expansion and hegemonic role in world politics {{at the expense of}} Europe), the FPÖ were more positively inclined towards the United States under Haider's leadership in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, this changed in 2003 following Haider visiting Saddam Hussein {{on the eve of the}} Iraq War; he subsequently condemned US foreign policy and derided George W. Bush for not being very different from Hussein. This move was strongly criticised by the FPÖ, which was part of the then-current government. Nevertheless, in the mid- to late 2000s the FPÖ too criticised US foreign policy as promoted <b>by</b> <b>Bush,</b> which it saw as leading to increased levels of violence in the Middle East. The party also became more critical of Israel's part in the Israel-Palestine conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{second test}} match, on 23 July at the Exhibition Ground in Brisbane, started well for Australia. In the first quarter, a kick from Wickham towards the British corner {{was picked up}} by Pat McEvedy, the New Zealand-born winger playing for Britain, and he was tackled into touch by the Australian forward Alec Burdon. The ball then came to Verge, who kicked towards the British halfback Bush, and Burdon took it and ran over the tryline for the opening score, with no conversion. The British {{levelled}} the score {{at the start of the}} second half with an unconverted try <b>by</b> <b>Bush,</b> and then immediately after, he scored a drop goal to put the visitors 3–7 ahead. The British added a further ten points to their tally, and won the match 3–17. Verge kicked well in this game, according to The Sunday Times. Verge was not selected to play in the third test, and returned to play for the University team.|$|E
