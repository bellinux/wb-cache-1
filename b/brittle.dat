5|$|Building {{techniques}} {{that are more}} ductile than <b>brittle,</b> like the contained earth type of earthbag, or tire walls of earthships, may better avoid collapse than <b>brittle</b> unreinforced earth. Contained gravel base courses may add base isolation potential.|$|E
5|$|A {{divalent}} oxide BkO {{has been}} reported as a <b>brittle</b> gray solid with a face centered cubic (fcc) structure and a lattice constant a = 496.4 pm, but its exact chemical composition is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} {{typically have}} high melting and boiling points, and are hard and <b>brittle.</b> As solids {{they are almost}} always electrically insulating, but when melted or dissolved they become highly conductive, because the ions are mobilized.|$|E
5000|$|After {{apparently}} {{failing in}} both missions, <b>Brittles</b> returns with the troop to Fort Starke to retire. His lieutenants continue the {{mission in the}} field, joined by <b>Brittles</b> after [...] "quitting the post and the Army". Unwilling to see more lives needlessly taken, <b>Brittles</b> takes {{it upon himself to}} try to make peace with Chief Pony That Walks (Chief John Big Tree). When that too fails, he devises a risky stratagem to avoid a bloody war by stampeding the Indians' horses out of their camp, forcing the renegades to return to their reservation.|$|R

60|$|<b>Brittles</b> {{replying}} in the affirmative, {{and pointing}} out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion {{to put up the}} gig: while <b>Brittles</b> lighted them, in a state of great admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were.|$|R

Gainey as Big John <b>Brittle,</b> Cooper Huckabee as Lil Raj <b>Brittle,</b> Doc Duhame as Ellis <b>Brittle,</b> Jonah Hill as Bag Head #2, {{a member}} of a Ku Klux Klan-like group; Lee Horsley as Sheriff Gus (Snowy Snow), Rex Linn as Tennessee Harry, Misty Upham as Minnie, Danièle Watts as Coco and Clay Donahue Fontenot as Luigi. Zoë Bell, Michael Bowen, Robert Carradine, Jake Garber, Ted Neeley, James Parks, and Tom Savini play Candyland trackers, while Michael Parks and John Jarratt, {{alongside}} Tarantino himself in a cameo appearance as Frankie, play the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company employees.|$|E
5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become <b>brittle.</b> The <b>brittle</b> titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time the engine was powered up and brought to operating temperature and finally broke open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E

5|$|Typical {{metalloids}} have {{a metallic}} appearance, {{but they are}} <b>brittle</b> and only fair conductors of electricity. Chemically, they behave mostly as nonmetals. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature. Metalloids are usually too <b>brittle</b> to have any structural uses. They and their compounds are used in alloys, biological agents, catalysts, flame retardants, glasses, optical storage and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and electronics.|$|E
5|$|A {{reduction}} in fracture toughness {{may also be}} attributed to the embrittlement effect of impurities, or for body-centred cubic metals, from a {{reduction in}} temperature. Metals and in particular steels have a transitional temperature range where above this range the metal has acceptable notch-ductility while below this range the material becomes <b>brittle.</b> Within the range, the materials behavior is unpredictable. The reduction in fracture toughness is accompanied by a change in the fracture appearance. When above the transition, the fracture is primarily due to micro-void coalescence, which results in the fracture appearing fibrous. When the temperatures falls the fracture will show signs of cleavage facets. These two appearances are visible by the naked eye. <b>Brittle</b> fracture in steel plates may appear as chevron markings under the microscope. These arrow-like ridges on the crack surface point towards the origin of the fracture.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and <b>brittle</b> metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. The name of the element {{is derived from the}} Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.|$|E

5|$|Chromium, unlike such metals as {{iron and}} nickel, does not suffer from {{hydrogen}} embrittlement. However, it does suffer from nitrogen embrittlement, reacting with nitrogen from air and forming <b>brittle</b> nitrides {{at the high}} temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.|$|E
5|$|Covalent bonding {{takes place}} {{when one of}} the {{constituent}} atoms loses one or more electrons, with the other atom gaining the electrons, resulting in an electron cloud that is shared by the molecule as a whole. In both ionic and covalent bonding the location of the ions and electrons are constrained relative to each other, thereby resulting in the bond being characteristically <b>brittle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies are}} {{commonly}} parasitized by the ascomycete Hypomyces lactifluorum, transforming {{them into an}} edible known as a lobster mushroom. In this form, {{the surface of the}} fruit body develops into a hard, thin crust dotted with minute pimples, and the gills are reduced to blunt ridges. The flesh of the mushroom—normally <b>brittle</b> and crumbly—becomes compacted and less breakable.|$|E

5|$|Gallium attacks {{most other}} metals by {{diffusing}} into the metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making them very <b>brittle.</b> Gallium easily alloys with many metals, {{and is used}} in small quantities in the plutonium-gallium alloy in the plutonium cores of nuclear bombs to stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{specimens}} of widgiemoolthalite {{tend to be}} bluish-green though may also be grass-green in rare cases. Widgiemoolthalite is transparent in hand sample with a silky luster and a pale bluish-green streak. The mineral is <b>brittle</b> and breaks along its fiber contacts. Its observed specific gravity is 3.13 while its calculated specific gravity is 3.24, with a hardness of 3.5 on the Mohs scale.|$|E
5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} {{is a hard}} {{steel-grey metal}} that is often <b>brittle</b> and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough {{that it can be}} worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} candies, desserts, and {{confections}} {{are made with}} caramel: <b>brittles,</b> nougats, pralines, crème brûlée, crème caramel, and caramel apples. Ice creams sometimes are flavored with or contain swirls of caramel.|$|R
5|$|Lanthanum reacts exothermically with {{hydrogen}} {{to produce}} the dihydride LaH2, a black, pyrophoric, <b>brittle,</b> conducting compound with the calcium fluoride structure. This is a non-stoichiometric compound, and further absorption of hydrogen is possible, with a concomitant loss of electrical conductivity, until the more salt-like LaH3 is reached. Like LaI2 and LaI, LaH2 is probably an electride compound.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is a silvery-gray {{metal that}} resembles iron. It is hard and very <b>brittle,</b> {{difficult}} to fuse, but easy to oxidize. Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic. Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes ("rusts") like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids are too <b>brittle</b> to {{have any}} {{structural}} uses in their pure forms. They and their compounds are used as (or in) alloying components, biological agents (toxicological, nutritional and medicinal), catalysts, flame retardants, glasses (oxide and metallic), optical storage media and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors and electronics.|$|E

60|$|The {{adventures of}} the {{previous}} night were still under discussion; for Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; Mr. <b>Brittles,</b> with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it.|$|R
