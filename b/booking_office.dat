5|$|The {{next day}} in Mumbai, two motorcycle-borne MNS {{supporters}} hurled bottles at Amitabh Bachchan's bungalow at Juhu. A group of MNS workers barged inside the <b>booking</b> <b>office</b> of the Grant Road railway station, damaged the <b>booking</b> <b>office</b> windows and tore off posters of a newly released Bhojpuri film put up there. Party workers resorted to stone throwing {{in some parts of}} Kandivli, a North-Mumbai suburb that has a sizeable North Indian lower middle-class population. In the Central-Mumbai suburb of Bandra, a clash ensued when MNS workers tried to plant party flags at an open market dominated by North Indians.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} growth of long-distance railway traffic {{led to a}} major expansion along the station's west side starting in 1887. The work involved rerouting Cardington Street over a burial ground; to avoid public outcry, the graves were re-interred at St Pancras Cemetery. Two extra platforms (Nos.4–5) opened in 1891, and four further departure platforms (now Nos.12–15) opened on 1 July 1892, bringing the total to fifteen, along with a separate <b>booking</b> <b>office</b> on Drummond Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt {{in the early}} 1930s {{to cope with the}} {{relaying}} of the line west from Temple Meads with four tracks instead of two. Considerable engineering works were needed to cope with the widening of the station, including the removal of a short tunnel {{to the west of the}} station. The two new island platforms opened on 21 May 1933, and the station name was changed to simply Parson Street in November 1933. The new station included covered waiting shelters, and a <b>booking</b> <b>office</b> on the road bridge. Again, no goods facilities were provided.|$|E

5|$|Work on {{the second}} bridge {{commenced}} on 8 June 1965, increasing {{the height and width}} in accordance with Ministry of Transport requirements. Around this time, the station itself was upgraded: the platforms were demolished and replaced, and new waiting shelters were erected. A new <b>booking</b> <b>office,</b> facing Station Road and approached by a flight of stairs, was built alongside a new booking lobby, toilets and staff accommodation. New entrances to the platforms were built, and the entire station was installed with electric lighting. Station Road was significantly widened and rerouted slightly in 1967 in a further attempt to accommodate increasing traffic.|$|E
5|$|A {{joint line}} through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had {{approached}} the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a <b>booking</b> <b>office</b> in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} situated at a passing loop, {{with a single}} platform {{on the north side}} of the line. The building, which is noted as having been architecturally superior to other stations on the line, contained a <b>booking</b> <b>office,</b> porters' rooms, and an office for the line superintendent. The platform was covered along its entire length. A single-road engine shed was sited at the east end of the station from 1875, but burnt down in 1900. The initial service was six trains per day in each direction, however trains did not stop at Shirehampton on Sundays due to opposition from a local church, but this practice ended in May the same year following complaints from other residents and businesses.|$|E

5|$|The station’s first {{expansion}} came in 1850 {{when the}} new East Lancashire line used new platforms staffed and managed by the East Lancashire Railway, with their own entrance and <b>booking</b> <b>office</b> in Butler Street. From 1863, trains between London and Scotland, having no dining cars, were scheduled to allow 20 minutes at Preston for passengers {{to eat in the}} station’s dining room. The pressure on catering staff was increased when northbound and southbound trains would often arrive about the same time. The condition of the station deteriorated to the extent that on 18 August 1866 part of the roof on the East Lancashire side collapsed injuring three people, one seriously. By then, 150 trains a day passed through the station.|$|E
5|$|The new station {{had four}} {{platform}} faces - two outer platforms, and two inner platforms sharing an island between the southbound line from Patchway and the westbound line to London. The western platforms served trains between Bristol and Wales, while the eastern platforms served trains {{on the new}} line. The platforms were linked by a subway {{which led to the}} <b>booking</b> <b>office,</b> situated on ground level by the main entrance {{on the east side of}} the station. The approach road led south from the main entrance, towards the A4174. There were waiting rooms and large canopies on each of the platforms. There were goods facilities to the south of the road, on the west side of the line and covering the site of the first station. There was a goods shed with a loading platform on a passing loop, as well as a north-facing covered loading platform and a south-facing siding. An additional south-facing siding for coal traffic was added after the First World War. Opposite the goods yard was Filton Junction Signal Box, which controlled the junction and by 1948 had more than 70 levers.|$|E
5|$|The station, {{owned by}} British Rail, opened on 1 May 1972. Services were {{operated}} by the Western Region until British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, after which Parkway was served by the InterCity and Regional Railways divisions. The original structures, built by Stone & Co. of Bristol, were basic – two island platforms connected by an open metal footbridge, with a wood and brick building containing the booking facilities and waiting rooms. Platform 1 (the modern platform 3), {{on the north side}} of the tracks, was for trains towards London and Birmingham, and platform 2 was for trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads. The station opened with a 600-space car park and a fastest journey to London of 95 minutes, which was subsequently reduced to 75 minutes with the introduction of the new High Speed Trains in the mid-70s. Platform canopies were added in 1973, along with a cover for the footbridge. Further minor improvements were implemented over the next thirty years, including a new <b>booking</b> <b>office</b> and small extensions to the car park.|$|E

5|$|When it opened, {{the station}} {{had a single}} platform, {{on the west side}} of the track. Road access was through a large {{forecourt}} to the west from Clanage Road / Rownham Hill, now the A369. There was a two-storey building facing the road, the ground floor of which had a single long room, partitioned into a waiting room, <b>booking</b> <b>office</b> and station master's office. The ground floor also housed a coal-fired boiler and washing facilities, while upstairs was spacious living accommodation accessed by a private staircase. A single north-facing bay platform for goods vans was at the north end of the station. The station was noted as having an excellent garden alongside the platform. The nearby Rownham Ferry allowed passengers to cross the river to Hotwells and Clifton. Services on the Portishead railway were operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, with six trains per day in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays. The operation of these transferred to the Great Western in 1876, when they took over the Bristol and Exeter, and in 1884 the Great Western took ownership of the Bristol and Portishead. The station was visited by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, a new {{stationmaster}}'s {{house was}} built at Sea Mills, {{at a cost of}} £240. The stationmaster is recorded as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. Increased levels of traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 {{to the west of the}} tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the same length as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a booking hall, <b>booking</b> <b>office,</b> toilets and a ladies' waiting room. A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general waiting room. The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a hosepipe and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|The Preservation Society {{celebrated its}} 50th anniversary in 2001, {{and as part}} of the year of {{celebrations}} a major new project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included {{the construction of a new}} two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and <b>booking</b> <b>office.</b> Work began on the first phase of the project in January 2002. In 2003 the railway received a £682,500 Heritage Lottery grant towards the £1,170,000 cost of redeveloping Wharf station, and the new station and museum were officially opened by Prince Charles and The Duchess of Cornwall on 13 July 2005. The railway has seen a steady increase in passengers carried since the turn of the millennium, with nearly 51,000 passenger bookings and 95,500 passenger journeys recorded in 2006, although this figure is still only around half the peak figure carried in 1973. In 2011, the railway celebrated 60 years of preservation, and received an Engineering Heritage Award from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in recognition of its importance in Welsh industrial heritage.|$|E
