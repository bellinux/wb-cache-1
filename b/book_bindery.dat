25|$|Addams and Starr {{were the}} first two {{occupants}} of the house, which would later become the residence of about 25 women. At its height, Hull House was visited each week by some 2,000 people. The Hull House was a center for research, empirical analysis, study, and debate, {{as well as a}} pragmatic center for living in and establishing good relations with the neighborhood. Residents of Hull-house conducted investigations on housing, midwifery, fatigue, tuberculosis, typhoid, garbage collection, cocaine, and truancy. Its facilities included a night school for adults, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a gym, a girls' club, a bathhouse, a <b>book</b> <b>bindery,</b> a music school, a drama group and a theater, apartments, a library, meeting rooms for discussion, clubs, an employment bureau, and a lunchroom. Her adult night school was a forerunner of the continuing education classes offered by many universities today. In addition to making available social services and cultural events for the largely immigrant population of the neighborhood, Hull House afforded an opportunity for young social workers to acquire training. Eventually, Hull House became a 13-building settlement complex, which included a playground and a summer camp (known as Bowen Country Club).|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{injuries}} and suffering, Litten strove {{to maintain his}} spirits. At one point, in 1934, his situation improved a little bit when he was moved to Lichtenburg. Initially, it was the same, with more beatings, but then {{he was allowed to}} work in the <b>book</b> <b>bindery</b> and the library. On occasion, he was able to listen to music on the radio on Sundays. He was well liked and respected by his fellow prisoners for his knowledge, inner strength and courage. One prisoner wrote about a party (allowed by the SS) at which a number of SS men were in attendance. Unafraid of their presence, Litten recited the lyrics of a song that had meant a lot to him in his youth, [...] "Thoughts are free" [...] (in German, Die Gedanken sind frei). The prisoner said that apparently the SS men did not grasp the significance of the words.|$|E

For many years the Press was located in a converted squash court in Pierson Tower, designed by Charles Willard Moore of the Yale School of Architecture. During the renovation of the college in 2004, it was relocated to enhanced facilities in the basement, where it now shares space with the Davenport Press in a greatly expanded Book Arts Center that includes half a dozen presses, over 1000 cases of hand type, a <b>book</b> <b>bindery,</b> paper mill and more.

5000|$|Our Lady of Guadalupe Trappist Abbey is {{a monastery}} {{in a rural}} area of the U.S. state of Oregon. The monks are members of the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, {{commonly}} called the Trappists. It is located in Yamhill County north of Lafayette about 30 mi southwest of Portland. [...] Currently the Abbey is home to about 28 monks. The monks live communally in the abbey. Their day is balanced by prayer, work, reading, and contemplation. The Abbey is located on 1300 acre of forestland in low hills of the western Willamette Valley. The forest adds to the spiritual setting for the community, acts as a buffer to neighbors, and allows for cloistered retreat. It is also the basis for a sustainable forestry enterprise that provides income to the monks. Other income-generating enterprises include a <b>book</b> <b>bindery,</b> a wine warehouse for local wineries, and a fruitcake bakery.|$|E

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Sandwich, Massachusetts, the {{youngest}} child of Elihu and Abigail (Dillingham) Bassett. The Bassetts moved to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1810, and Ancel's father died there in 1814. He became a Christian at age twelve and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. [...] While attending school in Cincinnati, {{he was able to}} study Greek, as well as work in a <b>book</b> <b>bindery</b> in the evenings and on Saturdays. [...] In 1827 he observed some of the debates of the Methodist reform movement, and when the movement formally seceded from the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1828 over the issue of bishops and representation of the laity, he left the church to join the new Methodist Protestant Church. [...] After meeting him, Asa Shinn, a minister and leader in the Methodist Protestant Church, encouraged him to enter the ministry, and he was licensed to preach in Cincinnati in 1830. Three years later he was elected to serve as Secretary of the Ohio Conference, which he did for seven consecutive years, and then he was elected to serve as President of the Conference, which he did for five years.|$|E
50|$|The bookstore flourished and the Brumders added a small {{printing}} {{department and}} <b>book</b> <b>bindery</b> and began publishing {{books for the}} Lutheran Church, especially the Wisconsin Synod. Around the same time, a group of prominent German immigrants formed the German Protestant Publishing Company and selected the name Germania for their name of their first publication, a weekly and daily newspaper. That venture ran into financial difficulty due to cost overruns and limited circulation and the group sought Brumder's assistance. Under his stewardship, the publication eventually thrived. Brumder bought out controlling interest in the company in 1874. In 1897, Brumder bought the Milwaukee daily Abend-Post and Sontags Journal and changed the name of Germania to Germania Abend-Post. Brumder acquired several other papers over the years including the Lincoln Freie Presse (1904) and the daily Milwaukee Herold (1906). Brumder eventually controlled most of Milwaukee's German language newspapers and also owned German papers in Chicago and Lincoln, Nebraska, {{as well as in}} several other Wisconsin towns. He was also president of the Germania National Bank (1903-1910) and of the Concordia Fire Insurance Company (1897-1909). Among other business ventures, Brumder briefly owned the American League Boston Red Sox from 1903 to 1904, during their first pennant win.|$|E
5000|$|It may be {{that his}} {{reputation}} as an artist will rest upon his figure pictures, although his very numerous portrait paintings involved much of the effort {{of his life and}} are most certainly characterized but simple and strong composition, great technical execution and a masterful use of colors. It may also follow that he will yet achieve his most memorable honors from the interpretations which he has made of great paintings, but from the stand point of those whose minds and hearts are won by considerations of local history the highest interest will be assigned to works in which Wood included characters from his native place. As examples of his work in this direction the following may be mentioned: The Yankee Pedlar had for its model a tin peddler known as [...] "Snapping Tucker", a resident of Calais, Vermont. When this work was sold for a large sum, Tucker promptly claimed his share upon the grounds of his intrinsic worth and natural capacity as a poser. The Village Post Office was taken from the interior of the old Ainsworth store in Williamstown, Vermont, but the figures were mostly taken from Montpelier people. Wood's uncle Zenas was the postmaster and the group around the store, Boyden, Whittier and Bullock, were old-time residents. Their clerk was Horace Scribner, long esteemed as a generous country musician and as the organist of Christ Church. This painting was bought by Mr. Charles Stewart Smith, ex-president of the New York Chamber of Commerce. The scene for The Quack Doctor was located in front of the old arch which once spanned the head of State Street leading to East State. The old brick building, the home of Montpelier <b>Book</b> <b>Bindery,</b> still stands. This picture was bought by Mr. George I. Seneg for $2,000 and after his death was included in the sale of his entire collection.|$|E
