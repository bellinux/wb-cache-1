40|$|Abstract: This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} ovarian fluid turbidity as a potential indicator of landlocked fall Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha egg survival. A total of 21 females were spawned, with nine of the spawns containing between one and ten <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> per spawn. Ovarian fluid turbidity ranged from 55. 1 to 159 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), and egg survival to the eyed-stage of egg development ranged from 0 to 68 %. There was no significant correlation between ovarian fluid turbidity and egg survival. Mean survival of eggs from the spawns containing <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> was 12. 3 %, which was {{significantly lower than the}} 32. 9 % mean survival from spawns without <b>broken</b> <b>eggs.</b> These results indi-cate ovarian fluid turbidity cannot be used to predict egg survival in spawns of landlocked fall Chinook Salmon, but the presence of even a small number of <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> may be indicative of poor survival to the eyed-egg stage of development...|$|R

60|$|If green {{woodpeckers}} {{alone had}} existed, {{and we did}} not know that there were many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to conceal this tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was a character of importance, and had been acquired through natural selection; as it is, the colour is probably in chief part due to sexual selection. A trailing palm in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest service to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, and which, as {{there is reason to believe}} from the distribution of the thorn-bearing species in Africa and South America, serve as a defence against browsing quadrupeds, so the spikes on the palm may at first have been developed for this object, and subsequently have been improved and taken advantage of by the plant, as it underwent further modification and became a climber. The naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally considered as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked.

A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest service to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth, and have been subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> directly {{depends on the}} quality of the shell. It is important to consider that the problem of <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> is not due to a single factor but a combination of factors. Shell defects, irregularities in shell shape, texture and surface are commonly observed during a regular egg laying cycle and the causes are varied. The incidence of downgraded eggs still represents an important source of economic loss for the egg industry due to products damage and need for further processing. It is possible to obtain significant reduction in the number of eggs lost due to the inferior quality of the shell attempting to an adequate nutrition, disease control, good management practices, and use of genetic lines with higher quality eggshell traits...|$|R

40|$|Our {{trial was}} aimed {{to study the}} effect of {{different}} dietary non-phytin phosphorus (NPP) levels with and without phytase enzyme supplementation on laying performance and eggshell quality of Tetra SL-LL in the last 25 weeks of the long-term (17 months) egg production. A total of 69 Tetra SL-LL layers were allocated into 3 dietary treatments. Two diets with different levels of NPP (2. 45 or 2. 15 g/kg, HP and LP, respectively) were formulated, and 0 or 300 FTU/kg phytase enzyme was added to low NPP feed (LP and LP+E, respectively). Dietary Ca was uniformly adjusted (38. 2 g/kg) to feed in each treatment. In {{the course of the}} trial, intensity of egg production (%), egg weight (g/egg), number of the <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> and feed intake (g/d/bird) were recorded. Every 2 weeks 20 eggs per treatment were broken to determine the shell strength and thickness. Our results show that low NPP diet had detrimental effect on the intensity of egg production (P< 0. 05) and phytase added to the LP diet resulted the lowest number of <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, NPP content of the layer diet can be reduced from 2. 45 to 2. 15 g/kg in the last 25 weeks of the elongated laying term (12 - 17 month of laying), if supplemented with 300 FTU/kg phytase enzyme without compromising the egg production, and in the same time it can improve eggshell quality and reduce the number of <b>broken</b> <b>eggs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two {{remedial}} {{treatments to}} reduce {{the high incidence of}} <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> in the furnished cages of our experimental layer farm were investigated: lining the nest floor with artificial turf (to increase nest acceptance) and lowering perch height ({{to reduce the}} chance of egg breakage of outside-nest eggs). A 2 x 2 factorial design was used with low (7 cm) or high (24 cm) perches, and with nest floors lined with artificial turf or plastic mesh. Eight cages, each housing 8 hens initially (aged 40 to 56 wk), were used per treatment. Egg location and percentage of <b>broken</b> <b>eggs</b> were recorded. Hen position (cage floor, nest, or perch) was recorded by direct scan-sampling observations. In addition, 8 cages (4 high + 4 low) each containing 8 hens (aged 54 to 56 wk) were videorecorded to determine perch use and behavior during the light period. Data were mainly analyzed using logistic regression and mixed models with cage as the experimental unit. Nest floor material did not influence the percentage of <b>eggs</b> <b>broken</b> or laid outside the nest. The proportion of outside-nest eggs (2. 6 vs. 10. 6 %, P = 0. 004), and consequently also of total eggs (2 vs. 4. 6 %, P = 0. 016) broken, was lower for low than high cages. Perch use increased during the observation period, more so for the high cages during the light period and the low cages during the dark period. Perch bout duration (P < 0. 001), the likelihood of ending a perching bout voluntarily (P = 0. 013), and time spent sitting during perching (P = 0. 007) were lower in low vs. high cages. In this study, replacing plastic mesh nest floor lining with artificial turf was not an effective remedy for the already-high rate of <b>broken</b> <b>eggs,</b> but the prevalence of <b>broken</b> outside-nest <b>eggs</b> was lower in cages with low versus high perches. However, perching behavior during the light period was more disturbed in cages with low perches...|$|R
