5000|$|When social {{interactions}} amongst birds are absent or inadequate, abnormal social behaviour may develop. For example, a study regarding parrots {{that had been}} isolated in cages demonstrated that most birds showing this social deprivation had significant behavioural disturbances, such as aggressive behaviour, feather picking, self-mutilation, restlessness, screaming, apathetic behavior, and stereotypies. [...] Cannibalism often occurs in large animal husbandry systems, which are usually impoverished environments {{with a lack of}} opportunities. In addition, studies of caged canaries have revealed two common stereotypies. These include spot picking, where birds repeatedly touch a particular spot in the environment with the tip of their beak, and route tracing, a pacing behaviour associated with physical restrictions in movement imposed by the cage. The absence of song learning in zebra finches has also been implicated as a <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality.</b> In these birds, the social interaction of a young male with his song tutor is important for normal song development. Without the stimulus, the song, which is necessary for mating behavior, will not be learned.|$|E

Four were managed with only antioedema measures including corticosteroids, of which one recovered completely and 3 partially. One of the patients on chronic corticosteroid therapy died because of staphylococcal septicemia. Cysticidal therapy in patients with numerous cerebral cysticercii may be dangerous.

40|$|Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) are {{a widely}} used model species in {{parasitology}} and epilepsy research. Under standard laboratory housing conditions gerbils develop stereotypic digging, a <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality,</b> {{which is caused}} by the lack of a burrow in the laboratory cage. Here we show that gerbils reared with access to an opaque artificial burrow (nest-box with access tube) develop significantly less stereotypic digging than those reared with transparent artificial burrows. Subadult gerbils also preferred opaque artificial burrows to transparent ones. Based on these findings we developed an artificial burrow system that could be integrated into laboratory Makrolon Type IV cages to prevent the development of stereotypic digging in gerbils by addressing their behavioural needs. Faecal cortisol levels were measured as a non-invasive method of comparing stress reactions in gerbils given access to the new integrated artificial burrow system or to an equivalent transparent burrow. Behavioural differences were observed between gerbils in the two housing conditions, but faecal cortisol levels were unaffected. We conclude that simple refinement of housing is effective in improving gerbil welfare in the laboratory...|$|E

APPSwe/PS 1 dE 9 transgenic mice were fed with normal AIN- 93 G diet (control diet), AIN- 93 G diet with 0. 07 % curcumin or diet with 2 % GSE beginning at 3 months of age for 9 months. Total phenolic content of GSE was 592. 5 mg/g dry weight, including gallic acid (49 mg/g), catechin (41 mg/g), epicatechin (66 mg/g) and proanthocyanidins (436. 6 mg catechin equivalents/g). Long-term feeding of GSE diet was well tolerated without fatality, <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality,</b> changes in food consumption, body weight or liver function. The Aβ levels {{in the brain and}} serum of the mice fed with GSE were reduced by 33 % and 44 %, respectively, compared with the Alzheimer’s mice fed with the control diet. Amyloid plaques and microgliosis in the brain of Alzheimer’s mice fed with GSE were also reduced by 49 % and 70 %, respectively. Curcumin also significantly reduced brain Aβ burden and microglia activation. Conclusively, polyphenol-rich GSE prevents the Aβ deposition and attenuates the inflammation in the brain of a transgenic mouse model, and this thus is promising in delaying development of AD.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the effect of}} {{estrogen}} on facial pain, we first compared the face-rubbing evoked by a formalin injection in the lip of aromatase-knockout (ArKO) mice, lacking endogenous estrogen production, 17 beta-estradiol-treated ArKO mice (ArKO-E 2) and wild-type (WT) littermates. During the 'acute' phase of pain the time spent rubbing was similar in the three groups, whereas during the following 'interphase' and the second phase of pain, grooming was increased ill ArKO mice. Estradiol-treatment restored a behaviour similar to WT group. To better understand estrogens modulation on pain processes, we examined changes in 5 -HT and CGRP innervations of trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) in ArKO, ArKO-E 2 and WT groups sacrified during the interphase. Whereas serotonin and CGRP immunoreactivities were comparable in WT and ArKO non-injected control groups, our data showed that 9 min after formalin injection, the density of serotoninergic terminals increased significantly in WT, but not in ArKO mice, while that of CGRP-immunoreactive fibers was lower in WT than in ArKO mice on the injected side. Estradiol-treatment only partially reversed these changes in ArKO-E 2 mice. We conclude that estrogen deprivation in ArKO mice can be responsible for increased nociceptive response and that it is accompanied by transmitter changes favouring pro- over anti-nociceptive mechanisms in TNC during interphase of the formalin model. That estradiol-treatment completely reverses the <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality</b> Suggests that estrogens absence produces chiefly functional activation-dependent changes. However, the fact that the immunohistochemical abnormalities were not totally normalized by estradiol-treatment suggested that some permanent developmental alterations may occur in ArKO mice.

40|$|Psychosis {{occurring}} in epileptics {{has always been}} an area of research interest, particularly, because of possible link of mental illness, organic lesions, convulsive process and behavioural abnormlity, all occuring together in the same subject. Vast amount of investigation on this subject has been done with a view to understand something more fundamental in 'Brain-Behaviour Connection'. Occurance of interictal phase of psychosis long after cessation of seizure has driven investigators to conclude the two being unrelated, which has brought important issues of brain pathology and <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality</b> into focus of research from dimensions of genetics, neuroendocrine and environmental influences. The aspects of behavioural neurology, behavioural genetics, genetics of epilepsy and 'shared common genetic diathesis for development of psychosis, possibly converge in the neuropsychiatric model of'psychosis in relation to epilepsy'. E. E. G. spiking and regional slow waves in inter- ictal phase are emerging as correlates determining behaviour. Status of prolactin- dopamine relationship and its correlation to neuro- cognition may be another pointer in guiding some of these complex issues. It is expected that current focus of research should be able to develop on the profile of ' psychotic brain ' also. One of the major clinical issue is identifying epileptic subjects prone to develop psychosis with precision of nature and type, not only because such developments jeopardises and compromises the state of art treatment done for epilepsy, but also because of devastating deterioration in quality of life of patients and relatives, besides having pharmacoeconmic devaluations.

40|$|Flank sucking is a <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality</b> of {{compulsive}} {{nature that}} occurs {{almost exclusively in}} Doberman pinchers and is frequently accompanied by other abnormal behaviours, such as acral lick dermatitis, blanket sucking and pica. A 2. 5 -year old, intact male, Doberman pinscher was presented because of a two-month long history of persistent right flank sucking. The dog was up-to-date with vaccinations and lived exclusively outdoors with his mother. The onset of the problem coincided with a period of crate restraining, where a short chain was used to avoid copulation with his mother, {{when she was in}} oestrus. Since then, the abnormal behaviour occurred on a daily basis and was not associated with neurological signs. In addition, the dog presented blanket sucking and pica that had first appeared during puppyhood. No clinical abnormalities were detected and the dog did not show signs of anxiety, aggression or fear during physical examination and blood sampling. Later-on and while remaining calm in the waiting room of the Clinic, the dog started chasing, chewing and sucking his right flank for over three minutes, but stopped immediately after his owner's verbal intervention. Primary diagnosis was compulsive flank sucking; differential diagnosis included Trichuris vulpis infestation, allergic dermatitis and psychomotor seizures. Results of haematological and serum biochemical examinations were unremarkable, whereas serological examination for Leishmania and faecal parasitological examination did not reveal significant results.

40|$|Canine acral lick {{dermatitis}} is {{a complicated}} and challenging syndrome occurring in companion animal dermatology. Skin lesions are caused by intense and prolonged licking of a localized area, usually on the lower parts of the limbs that progressively may result in plaque or nodule formation with alopecia, erythema, hyperpigmentation, exudation, erosion and ulceration. Acral lick dermatitis develops more often in male dogs of large breeds and has a multifactorial aetiology. The underlying causes may be broadly separated into organic (e. g., pruritic skin diseases, painful conditions) and psychogenic. The former subset includes mainly deep bacterial pyoderma, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, foreign bodies, sensory neuropathies and painful bone and articular diseases. The psychogenic subset may be either a primary (e. g., the result of long-standing anxiety, boredom, attention-seeking or stereotypic behavior) or a psychosomatic <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality.</b> Regardless of the aetiology and the primary role it may play, the most common complication in the psychogenic acral lick dermatitis is actually the deep bacterial pyoderma observed {{in the majority of}} the cases. Diagnosis of the disorder is reached after exclusion of similar-looking skin diseases, such as ringworm kerion, demodicosis, leishmaniosis, sterile granulomas and neoplasia. An extensive list of diagnostic tests is necessary to identify the underlying cause(s) and includes cytological examination, bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing, histopathological examination, imaging of the affected area and hypoallergenic food trial. A prerequisite to diagnosing the psychogenic subset of the disease is to rule-out potential organic causes, coupled with persistence of skin licking, despite resolution of deep bacterial pyoderma. Regardless of the underlying cause, therapy should always include mechanical restrain, as well as the long-term topical and systemic use of antimicrobials that ideally should be selected {{based on the results of}} antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Specific treatment in also warranted to resolve potential organic causes of the syndrome, whereas, management of its psychogenic subset should be based on avoidance of the causative and triggering factors, desensitization and counter-conditioning, along with the administration of psychotropic medication. Alternative therapeutic modalities, considered supplementary or employed when everything else fails, may include topical glucocorticoids, dimethyl sulfoxide, capsaicin or tacrolimus, as well as cryosurgery, laser surgery, acupuncture or radiation therapy...|$|E
40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a complex}} {{psychiatric}} illness which is caused by multiple genes and gene-environment interactions. This complex etiology has {{a negative impact on}} the power of molecular genetic studies. To improve this situation, attempts are made to define traits that are more intimately related to the genetic factors of schizophrenia, and have a more straightforward genotype-phenotype relationship. These traits are called endophenotypes. The deficit of patients to suppress reflexive saccades during antisaccades has been suggested as endophenotype for schizophrenia. Recent evidence suggests that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) -brain activation maps can further strengthen the genotype-phenotype relationship. In a series of studies, the suitability of brain activation maps during antisaccades as endophenotype for schizophrenia is assessed. In the first study, an event related fMRI design was developed for measuring the brain activation associated with saccades and saccadic inhibition. This study demonstrated that fMRI could pick up brain activation in all areas that are known to be involved in oculomotor functioning from studies in primates. In addition, {{the results of this study}} stress the importance of using event related fMRI for this particular saccade paradigm. An endophenotype should be related to the illness. In the second study, the fMRI design was used to find the functional brain abnormalities that underlie the saccadic inhibition deficit in schizophrenia. It was found that patients did not activate the striatum during inhibition of saccades. These results indicate that the impairment of patients in saccadic inhibition can be related to a dysfunction in the striatum, or in the frontostriatal circuitry. An endophenotype is more frequently present in those with genetic risk for schizophrenia. Accordingly, the third study found the same striatal abnormality in healthy siblings of patients during antisaccades. However, the siblings did not demonstrate an <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality,</b> suggesting that fMRI activation maps can increase sensitivity. When subjects are phenotyped based on brain activation, age differences between subjects can ad noise to the data. In the fourth study, effects of aging on brain activation during the antisaccade paradigm were assessed in a group covering a broad age range. Age did not only alter the cognitive strategy for the task, but also the neuronal vascular coupling. Good endophenotypes should be stable traits. The fifth study assessed the reproducibility of brain activation during antisaccades over a one week period in a group of healthy subjects. The results demonstrated large differences between subjects in the test-retest reliability of brain activation maps, which was caused largely by stable differences between subjects in signal to noise ratios. Differences between subjects in signal to noise can result in overestimation of between subject variance. In conclusion, fMRI is capable of detecting saccade related brain activation and abnormalities in patients and their siblings, even when no behavioural abnormalities could be detected. Hence the use of fMRI could potentially strengthen the genotype-phenotype relationship. Although fMRI is not yet capable of to obtain reliable activation maps in all subjects, this situation is likely to improve in the future with increasing MR-field strengths and more sophisticated acquisition techniques...|$|E

40|$|Among {{its various}} {{biological}} functions, NAD metabolism regulates axon degeneration, {{which is an}} early and often causative event {{in a variety of}} neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington’s disease (HD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our research group previously found that reducing the levels of the NAD precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) pharmacologically with the NMN-synthesizing enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) inhibitor FK 866 or genetically by expressing the bacterial enzyme NMN deamidase in mammalian neurons remarkably reduces axon degeneration after acute injury. Here, we asked whether FK 866 could also improve axonal pathology and behavioral symptoms in in vitro and in vivo models of HD and AD, and compared its effect to that of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist with a well-defined neuroprotective action. An inducible PC 12 cell line expressing wild type (Q 21 PC 12 cells) and HD-associated mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) protein (Q 72 PC 12 cells) was used as an in vitromodel of HD, while amyloid-beta (Aβ) treatment in mouse cortical neurons was used to mimic AD-associated Aβ toxicity in vitro. We found that FK 866 in combination with nicotinic acid (NA) that maintains NAD levels while reducing NMN levels significantly rescued axonal pathology and ameliorated nuclear morphology in HD and AD cellular models. NMN added together with FK 866 /NA significantly reverted FK 866 -mediated axonal protection. In contrast, memantine improved nuclear abnormalities while showing no effect in the axonal compartment. The similarity between our result in cellular HD and Aβtoxicity models and that observed in a model of Wallerian degeneration (Di Stefano et al. 2014) suggests that FK 866 -induced neuroprotection is linked to the reduction in NMN production and it is not due to off-target effects of FK 866 and underlines shared mechanisms between axon pathology in disease and that after an acute injure. I tested FK 866 efficacy in vivo using HdhQ 140 mice, a knock-in mouse model of HD, and APPswe/PS 1 dE 9 mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD, crossed with the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) -H transgenic mouse line. In these mice, YFP protein is expressed in restricted subsets of neurons, allowing imaging of individual neuronal structures. The point here is to see at which neuronal compartment pathology begins. Consistent with previous reports (Adalbert et al. 2009; Marangoni et al. 2014), I found that axonal swellings and dystrophies appear early in HdhQ 140 /YFP-H mice and in APPswe/PS 1 dE 9 /YFP-H mice and were the major structural abnormalities detected in these mice at the time-point considered. FK 866 in combination with NA significantly decreased the number of axonal swellings detected in HdhQ 140 /YFP-H mice and that of axonal dystrophies detected in APPswe/PS 1 dE 9 /YFP-H mice without causing any alteration in nuclear or dendritic morphology of these mice. In addition, FK 866 significantly reduced APPswe/PS 1 dE 9 /YFP-H mice hyperactivity, a known <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormality</b> in these mice. On the other hand, memantine significantlyrestored the reduction in locomotor activity of HdhQ 140 /YFP-Hmiceand improved the sensorimotor gating abnormalities of APPswe/PS 1 dE 9 /YFP-H mice. Our results underlines potential mechanistic similarities between axonal abnormalities induced by mHTT and Aβin vitroand in in vivo and those after acute injury, and they highlight the possible therapeutic value of limiting NMN levels with FK 866...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT for the CREATIVE ADJACENCIES conference Archaeologist of Meanings Architecture exists, it {{does not}} always need a design. Sometimes you need to build to see Architecture, {{sometimes}} you need to destroy it. In a best case (and certainly from an ecological point of view) {{you need to do}} nothing. The architect is no artist. The art of Architecture emerges from a conjunction of special actions undertaken by people and elements. The architect only tells a part of the story. His main task is to conduct others’ stories. In that sense he is more an archaeologist of meanings than an artist. (Carl Bourgeois RTS session II) about here now – there then : Put aside the everyday world and come with us Into the realm of imagination… U (U-N) N (L-L-L) K-L-E [...] (Uncle - UNKLE Main Title Theme Lyrics | MetroLyrics) 	 In the recent studiowork (eAD* sem 1 / 2012 - 13 ‘drift’ eAD sem 1 / 2013 - 14 ‘ticket to nothingness’) my colleague Annelies De Smet (architect and artist) and I mentored students to investigate the tension between sedentary architectural space and the dream of nomadism. Being on the move {{and at the same time}} being somewhere in a place, resulted in designs for hotels or dachas or refuges wherein ontological aliënation in these catatonic spaces. (**) was elaborated. On a Meta level we search for architectural accountability of the designer towards build environment in a world in which we believe to much is already designed. The studio uses a method of ‘designing in reverse’: we start with creating a construction with a minimum number of parameters, just to focus on the build. We call this step ‘formation’. In later steps (each approx. 3 weeks) we question this quickly created ‘construct’ by using three methods : a) ‘observation’(relook in order to improve); b ‘transformation’ (remake in order to radically change).); c) ‘criticality’ (unmasking the hidden potentials of a design and its relation to reality) These methods could be seen as trans-disciplinary tools adjacent to the arts as well as to design. about honesty : A physical truth has also been valued: a sense of honesty in design with respect to the structure and materials employed being used in ways appropriate to her properties and characteristics and not in ways which involve pretence. (Peter Downtown, Design Research, RMIT university press 2003, p. 58) We should question the value of beauty in a world that seems sick of cleaning, control, comfort and functionality. Poetry - just as bacteria - arise in a crack. 	(Carl Bourgeois RTS session I) The studio questions beautiful architecture. Form and aesthetics seem of very little importance. We state that architecture is an answer to a series of issues that have to be translated into opportunities. Improving environmental experience and adding trans-banal stories is our goal. I see architectural practice as a way of surfing waves of information (program, regulations, ambitions of clients) and finding out what aspect of these waves could be highlighted and transformed into consequent content. It is like zooming in on elements that tend to be unimportant but which are capable of embodying specific significance. In that sense ‘knowing’ for instance how to build, is only the basic. My interest goes towards the unknown, the ungraspable, the mystery, something beyond…   about proprietorship : There were too many of us We had access to too many, uh, too much money Too much equipment, and little by little we went insane (Uncle - UNKLE Main Title Theme Lyrics | MetroLyrics) 	 Architects and designers always seem to struggle with clients (private or governments). In Adolf Loos ‘ vision, that is where one should seek the difference between the architect and the designer : the artist is free to explore conflict, the architect has to seek comfort and adapts space. Nevertheless I believe in a certain ‘conflictzone’ between the designer and the user. Good architecture seeks friction and discomfort. about the conference : With this pedagogy of ‘de-stabilising’ (constantly questioning and rethinking) we try to educate students to be self-confident with a strong belief in their own design-capacities. But why should we not - if we so strongly believe in participative design –rather train them as compromising diplomats? And is there a conflict between the artistic emotional self and the creation of new (explicit or tacit) knowledge? How can increasingly scarce space be reloaded with new (additional) meaning and what role can the designer play by rethinking proprietorship and designing user scripts instead of systematically creating new build environment. I would like to elaborate on these topics in further paper and possible conference participation, together with my colleague Annelies De Smet.

After admission, somnolence developed. Intravenous anti-hypertensive therapy was started immediately. The hyponatraemia was treated with i. v. sodium supplementation. The cause of this syndrome proved to be fibromuscular dysplasia of the left renal artery. Finally, a left nephrectomy was performed. With this therapy, blood pressure and serum sodium normalised and the girl promptly regained normal consciousness and behaviour. CONCLUSION: <b>Behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in the history of a child without any other neurological symptoms might {{be one of the first}} signs of hypertensive encephalopathy. In combination with hyponatraemia, these symptoms should alert the physician to consider the hyponatraemic hypertensive syndrom...|$|R
50|$|The colour of {{the coat}} {{is white and}} orange, but the orange should never {{appear to be a}} red colour. The dog's skin is the same colour as the fur, orange under the orange fur and white under the white fur. Faults are listed as {{physical}} or <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> and a dog with such faults should not be bred.|$|R
40|$|Thirteen treated {{psychotic}} cases comprising {{of eight}} schizophrenic, four M. D. P. (manic type) and one M. D. P. (depressive type), who were clinically symptom free, were studied {{in respect of}} their hormones and <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> under effect of total solar eclipse. Of the hormones studied viz., T „ T 4, TSH, Cortisol and proclactin, it is prolactin which showed an increase in titre associated with <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in concerned patients during and immediately after the total solar eclipse. Deflection in both prolactin and behaviour gradually seemed to normalise over the post eclipse period. OBJECT OF STUDY Natural phenomena have been working {{as some of the}} most important influencing factors on behaviour of animals and parti-cularly on that of human beings. Not only the external manifest behaviour but also the internal homeostasis is likely to be affected in order to produce change for adaptation to the natural setting. Eclipse...|$|R
40|$|Deletions of the {{chromosomal}} region 2 q 37 cause brachydactyly-mental retardation syndrome (BDMR), {{also known as}} Albright hereditary osteodystrophy-like syndrome. Recently, histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC 4) haploinsufficiency has been postulated to be the critical genetic mechanism responsible for the main clinical characteristics of the BDMR syndrome like developmental delay and <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in combination with brachydactyly type E (BDE). We report here on the first three generation familial case of BDMR syndrome with inheritance of an interstitial microdeletion of chromosome 2 q 37. 3. The deletion was detected by array comparative genomic hybridization and comprises the HDAC 4 gene and two other genes. The patients of this pedigree show a variable severity of psychomotor and <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in combination with a specific facial dysmorphism but without BDE. Given that {{only about half of}} the patients with 2 q 37 deletions have BDE; we compared our patients with other patients carrying 2 q 37. 3 deletions or HDAC 4 mutations known from the literature to discuss the diagnostic relevance of the facial dysmorphism pattern in 2 q 37. 3 deletion cases involving the HDAC 4 gene. We conclude that HDAC 4 haploinsufficiency is responsible for psychomotor and <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> in combination with the BDMR syndrome-specific facial dysmorphism pattern and that these clinical features have a central diagnostic relevance.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} (ID) is {{the most}} common nutritional deficiency in childhood (Dallman et ai, 1980). Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in children less than 2 years causes <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and developmental delay (Lozoff et ai, 1991). Prevalence figures are therefore needed to estimate the scope of the problem and identification of potential risk factors associated with 10 and IDA will help to formulate preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|Monozygotic twins, {{identical}} by serological studies, with Huntington's {{disease are}} described who {{were raised in}} separate households from birth. Age at onset, landmarks of the disease, and <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were strikingly similar. Previously reported twin studies in Huntington's disease are reviewed.

40|$|Parkinson's disease {{encompasses}} {{a variety of}} motor and non motor symptoms whose assessment and therapy {{become more and more}} complex as the disease progresses. Besides motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, gait impairment and postural instability, patients may exhibit many other problems including orthostatic hypotension, constipation, incontinence, sleep difficulties, depression, <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and cognitive decline. In this article, current therapeutic strategies aiming at improving these complications in individual patients are briefly reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Genetic and {{environmental}} factors are both likely to contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASDs (autism spectrum disorders). In this study, we examined the combinatorial effect of two factors thought {{to be involved in}} autism – reduction in the expression of the extracellular matrix protein reelin and prenatal exposure to an organophosphate pesticide, CPO (chlorpyrifos oxon). Mice with reduced reelin expression or prenatal exposure to CPO exhibited subtle changes in ultrasound vocalization, open field behaviour, social interaction and repetitive behaviour. Paradoxically, mice exposed to both variables often exhibited a mitigation of abnormal behaviours, rather than increased <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities</b> as expected. We identified specific differences in males and females in response to both of these variables. In addition to <b>behavioural</b> <b>abnormalities,</b> we identified anatomical alterations in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. As with our behavioural studies, anatomical alterations appeared to be ameliorated in the presence of both variables. While these observations support an interaction between loss of reelin expression and CPO exposure, our results suggest a complexity to this interaction beyond an additive effect of individual phenotypes...|$|R
