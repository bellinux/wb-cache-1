40|$|My {{thesis is}} {{designed}} to explore the challenges female jazz flutists have faced breaking into the jazz world. This is important because not many flutists, especially females, {{are involved in the}} jazz world as soloists, bandleaders, or composers. The primary purpose of this thesis is to increase understanding and awareness of the flute as a jazz instrument. I also hope to increase interest in jazz in my flute colleagues. I researched the history of the flute in jazz, focusing on female jazz flutists; specifically, Ali Ryerson, Holly Hofmann, and Jamie Baum, among others. I looked at their influences and background in jazz, what struggles they may have overcome, and what accomplishments and contributions they have made in their field. I also conducted personal interviews with female jazz flutists in person at the 2014 National Flute Convention, by telephone, and by email to increase my understanding and to hear firsthand {{what it is like to}} be a female flutist playing jazz. In addition, as part of my goal to increase knowledge of and interest in the flute as a jazz instrument, I chose a standard jazz <b>band</b> <b>chart,</b> “Things Ain’t What They Used to Be”, and arranged it for jazz flute big band. I worked with the Northern Iowa Flute Choir and volunteer members of a standard rhythm section to rehearse and perform the work at my thesis presentation...|$|E
