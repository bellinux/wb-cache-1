5000|$|Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{is a set}} of {{communication}} standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network. It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT red book. [...] Prior to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. The ISDN standards define several kinds of access interfaces, such as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI), Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN), and <b>Broadband</b> <b>ISDN</b> (B-ISDN).|$|E
50|$|The DQDB {{standard}} IEEE 802.6 {{was developed}} while ATM (<b>Broadband</b> <b>ISDN)</b> {{was still in}} early development, but there was strong interaction between the two standards. ATM cells and DQDB frames were harmonized. They both settled on essentially a 48-byte data frame with a 5-byte header. In the DQDB algorithm, a distributed queue was implemented by communicating queue state information via the header. Each node in a DQDB network maintains a pair of state variables which represent {{its position in the}} distributed queue {{and the size of the}} queue. The headers on the reverse bus communicated requests to be inserted in the distributed queue so that upstream nodes would know that they should allow DQDB cells to pass unused on the forward bus. The algorithm was remarkable for its extreme simplicity.|$|E

While many methods for coding and compressing this video have been proposed, it is likely that the MPEG standard will be commonly used for the delivery of new video services over high speed networks, such as the <b>Broadband</b> <b>ISDN.</b> In this paper, we explore the effect of the MPEG Group of Pictures (GOP) structure on the performance of a multiplexer carrying this video traffic from a number of independent sources. We conclude that the alignment between the GOP structures of the different sources will have a major impact on network performance and lead to difficulties concerning the Connection Admission Control and the Usage Parameter Control of MPEG video sources.

40|$|Histogram {{comparison}} {{is a popular}} technique for image and video indexing. The complexity of the technique can be reduced by representing the histogram by its moments. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve the performance of basic histogram/moment-based technique. First, we propose to use orthogonal Legendre moments for representing histograms. Since Legendre moments are orthogonal, they provide superior indexing performance compared to regular moments at a similar complexity. Secondly, we propose to compare the histograms of wavelet coefficients at different scales. The wavelet coefficients provide important directional information, and hence improve {{the performance of the}} basic histogram-based technique. The proposed scheme can be easily extended to color images and also be integrated into a wavelet-based image coder. I.

Switches constructed from shared buffer switching elements (SE) no longer suffer from the head of line blocking which is a common problem in simple input buffering. The analysis models the state of the entire switch and extends the model introduced by Turner to global flow control with backpressure mechanism. It is shown that buffer utilization is better and throughput improves significantly compared with the same network using local flow control policy.

40|$|A {{connection}} has to {{be opened}} before data can be transmitted over an ATM network. The connection can be permanent, semipermanent or switched.

Thanks to the development of digital switching technology, such a demand can be met. ISDN is the answer to it which has already been deployed in the United States, Europe and Japan.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the demand for broadband services in Greece and to estimate the price elasticity of the demand for ADSL and ISDN services as well as the cross-price elasticity between the two services. The empirical analysis uses the 384 Â kbps connections since for the period examined, over 85 % of the total ADSL customers in Greece are connected at this bandwidth. The empirical analysis is based on an ad-hoc specification of the demand equation, with no reference to the utility maximization problem of the representative consumer. The results of the analysis show that both demands are inelastic. In addition, cross-price elasticity for ADSL is negative, indicating that ISDN is a complement to ADSL, whereas the demand for ISDN is almost neutral to ADSL. <b>Broadband</b> ADSL <b>ISDN</b> Own-price elasticity Cross-price elasticity...|$|R

In this thesis, several issues on speech transmission over ATM network have been studied, such as packetization delay, network queuing delay, digital speech encoding algorithms and PVR algorithm. A packetized speech emulation device is proposed to provide the capability of subjective speech transmission quality evaluation over ATM network or other kind of packetized network. The boundary of speech transmission quality degradation that human hearing can tolerate against information loss rate, delay fluctuation and encoding mechanism are found through emulation. The echo effect in ATM network, which is a primary issue in speech communications is also discussed in the thesis. In particular, the emphasis is given to the specification, design and implementation of ATM speech emulator which consists of two subsystems: ATM Network Simulator (ATMNS) and Speech Transmission Emulator (STE). ATMNS has been specified according to the results of ATM network performance analysis, and STE is based on ATM specifications recommended by CCITT. A prototype of the emulator has been implemented on a personal computer and DSP 5600 development system with a special designed audio interface to interconnect phone sets to the DSP 5600 AD input. The software had been written in "C" and DSP assembly language. Subjective evaluation are conducted in terms of the following factors: Cell discarding rate, different network queuing delay and fluctuation to different PVR algorithms. These factors are basic issues which may affect ATM speech transmission quality in an ATM network. Finally, test results under different network conditions are given...|$|E

Thus {{the design of the}} signalling system is a fundamental issue for the creation of the future <b>Broadband</b> <b>ISDN</b> out of ATM switching technology. Today 2 ̆ 7 s telecommunication networks use common channel signalling networks (standardised in SS 7) which are often separate from the bearer or transport network. With an ATM based <b>Broadband</b> <b>ISDN</b> (B-ISDN), it is anticipated that both signalHng and user traffic will share the underlying ATM layer.

To design such an error monitor, the delay performance of ATM signalling links during errored periods must be determined. This requires a model for the delay performance of the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP), the link level protocol to be used on ATM signalling links.
