Chris immediately becomes friends with the store owner, Carl, and he {{is given a}} large promotion which Carl originally promised to Meg. When Meg takes issue with this, she is fired. Lois, to whom Meg has told of her plight, explains the situation to Chris and tells him to stand up for Meg by getting her job back. Chris is able to do this after bribing Carl by withholding his opinions of movies he and Carl normally discuss until Carl re-hires her. Meg, in turn, rejects working at the store again, as she only had Chris get her job <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if he would stand up for her.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, the American {{government}} was becoming increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was sent}} to the Mediterranean in May 1795 under Captain John Pakenham, who had taken command in August the {{previous}} year. Joining Admiral William Hotham's fleet on 14June, Gibraltar fought in an action off the Hyères Islands in July. The fleet was re-victualling in San Fiorenzo bay on 8July when a small squadron under Commodore Horatio Nelson approached, followed by the French Fleet from Toulon. The British fleet was not able to put to sea immediately due to contrary winds but was spotted by the French, who abandoned their chase. Hotham finished refitting and supplying his ships, and finally managed to set off after his quarry at 21:00; almost twelve hours later. Following a storm, the British were carrying out repairs when they sighted the French fleet at dawn on 13July. At 03:45 Hotham gave the order to make all possible sail in pursuit of their enemy, five miles off and heading for Fréjus. The two fleets were close enough to exchange fire at 08:00 when the British van engaged the rearmost French ships, one of which struck after six hours. However, she caught fire and exploded before the British could take possession of her. Just as Gibraltar was joining the action, Hotham signalled to disengage, believing the fleet to be running out of sea-room but being too far <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that this was not the case. Hotham resigned his position early the following year and was eventually replaced by Admiral John Jervis.|$|E

Taylor eventually became the third president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Richards had escaped all harm except for a bullet grazing his ear.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{they visit}} Johnny at the {{hospital}} when he is in critical condition. On their way home, Pony spots Cherry and they talk. Cherry says she is unwilling to visit Johnny in the hospital because he killed her boyfriend. Pony calls her a traitor, but after explaining herself, they come to good terms. After escaping the hospital, Dally shows up {{just in time for}} the rumble. The Greasers win the fight. Afterward, Pony and Dally hurry <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Johnny. He dies while they are in the hospital and a maniacal Dally runs out of the room. Pony returns home that night feeling confused and disoriented. Dally calls the house to say that he has robbed a store and is running from the police. The Greasers find him, but see that Dally is pointing an unloaded gun at the police. They shoot Dally and he dies instantly. Ponyboy becomes overwhelmed and faints. He regains consciousness and is sick in bed for several days due to a concussion. When the hearing finally approaches, the judge is generous and Pony is free from responsibility for Bob’s death. Pony will be allowed to remain at home with Darry and Soda.|$|E

500|$|In May 1963 Fleming wrote a {{piece for}} Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] Benson identified {{what he described as}} the [...] "Fleming Sweep", the use of [...] "hooks" [...] at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what Anthony Burgess calls [...] "a heightened journalistic style" [...] to produce [...] "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".|$|E
500|$|Fleming had {{previously}} mentioned to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for Books and Bookmen magazine in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." ...|$|E
500|$|Once Fleming and {{his wife}} arrived at Goldeneye, he started work on the second Bond novel. In May 1963 he wrote an article for Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] As he had done with Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend, the writer William Plomer, who reacted favourably to the story, telling Fleming that [...] "the new book held this reader like a limpet mine & the denouement was shattering". On {{a trip to the}} US in May 1953 Fleming used his five-day travelling time on RMS Queen Elizabeth to correct the proofs of the novel.|$|E

500|$|Rocky Horror {{is one of}} {{the last}} few western rites left that pertain to the carnivalesque. Annual Rocky Horror {{conventions}} are held in varying locations lasting days. Tucson, Arizona has been host a number of times, including 1999 with [...] "El Fishnet Fiesta", and [...] "Queens of the Desert" [...] held in 2006. Vera Dika wrote that to the fans, Rocky Horror is ritualistic and comparable to a religious event, with a compulsive, repeated cycle of going home and coming <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film each weekend. The audience call backs are similar to responses in church during a mass. Many theatre troupes exist across the United States that produce shadow-cast performances where the actors play each part in the film in full costume and props as the movie plays on the big screen in a movie theatre. These showings are typically once a week or once a month on a Saturday at midnight.|$|E
500|$|In June 1956 {{the author}} Ian Fleming began a {{collaboration}} with the producer Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series, Commander Jamaica, which was to feature the Caribbean-based character James Gunn. [...] When the project foundered, and Fleming could not fashion a new plot for his next Bond novel, he used the idea {{as the basis for}} Dr. No. By January 1957 he had published four Bond novels in successive years from 1953—Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker and Diamonds Are Forever. A fifth, From Russia, with Love, was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write Dr. No. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day."

Now, she carries a diary with her which she writes in every day the events of that day so that the next day, after she had forgotten everything, she will be able to remind herself of what happened the previous day.

She calls the number, pretends to be the Jamaican dental receptionist, and asks the man to come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Dr. Kaplan. At the appointed time, she returns to the dentist's office, but does not recognize anyone there; so she calls the number again. When the man (Michael Sheen) answers, she sees him and hangs up. Unbeknownst to Liz, her number is already listed in his cellphone under [...] "future wife". He calls her back upon seeing she called, and they arrange a date; she learns that his name is Wesley. On their date, the two fail to hit it off: they find each other annoying and share many flaws but few interests. Later, at the 30 Rock studios, Liz discovers that Wesley was the person who retrieved NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) wallet, after Kenneth threw it out of a window earlier. Because of this coincidence, Liz and Wesley decide to go on another date.|$|E
500|$|In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, {{travelled}} {{to their}} Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, {{which had been}} published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening.

[...] By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that {{he felt like he}} was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, [...] "This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years." [...] He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he [...] "had to more or less graft {{the first half of the}} book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length".|$|E
