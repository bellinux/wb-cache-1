5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI <b>beam</b> <b>approach</b> (AIBA).|$|E
5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was {{essentially}} a UK version of the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or Standard <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach</b> as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off {{the far end of}} the active runway that was alternately connected to one of two slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E

50|$|An astrophysical jet is {{an astronomical}} {{phenomenon}} where outflows of ionised matter are emitted as an extended beam along {{the axis of}} rotation.

25|$|During {{development}} of the earlier Mk. IV system, new versions of the Standard <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach</b> radios were developed that operated on the 1.5m band, known as <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach</b> Beacon System, or BABS. This was also the band that the earlier IFF Mk. II worked on, and {{was similar to the}} new IFF Mk. III bands. For the Mk.

50|$|The pulsed {{particle}} beam emitted {{by such a}} weapon may contain 1 gigajoule of kinetic energy or more.

25|$|The UK had {{for some}} time used a blind landing system known as Standard <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach,</b> an {{adaptation}} of a pre-war German system known as a Lorenz beam. Lorenz, and Standard, used two radio transmissions that were picked up by conventional voice radio sets. The signals were sent from two directional antennas positioned {{at the end of}} the active runway, switching back and forth between the two, spending 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E
25|$|The flight {{had taken}} off from London-Northolt Airport at 18:09 GMT (19:09 British Summer Time) on a short haul flight to Glasgow-Renfrew Airport in Scotland.

The last radio contact was at 20:01 when the crew requested confirmation that the outer marker was operative. As the aircraft neared the airport it hit a hill nose first and broke into 3 parts; the engine and the left wing also broke off. Although the plane burst into flames all 20 passengers and crew managed to escape, and all survived. Thirteen people were injured in the accident.|$|E
25|$|By 1942, {{there was}} no longer a need for an {{additional}} fighter airfield. With its name changed to RAF Lulsgate Bottom, the airfield was declared operational on 15 January 1942. The Miles Masters, Airspeed Oxfords and Hawker Hurricanes of No. 286 (AA Cooperation) Squadron became resident, with the duty of providing realistic exercises for ground anti-aircraft defences. However, as the site lacked some basic facilities, No. 286 moved to RAF Zeals in May. From 1 June 1942, the airfield was under No. 23 Group of Flying Training Command, and initially became a satellite airfield for No. 3 (Pilot) Advanced Flying Unit (3 (P)AFU), based at RAF South Cerney, flying Oxfords. In March 1943, No. 1540 <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach</b> Training Flight (1540 BATF) was formed at Lulsgate, again flying Oxfords. On 27 September 1943, 3 (P)AFU left Lulsgate for RAF Southrop, and was replaced on 1 October 1943 by No. 3 Flying Instructors School (3 FIS), which was previously headquartered at RAF Hullavington. 3 FIS flew mostly Oxfords and some Masters.|$|E
40|$|When {{accelerating}} gold ions in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) {{the transition}} energy must be crossed. For this purpose, RHIC uses {{a set of}} correction quadrupoles and special power supplies which can reverse polarity in less than 40  ms.

25|$|Originally {{constructed}} from October 1940 onwards as a relief landing ground for RAF Hixon, the base at Wheaton Aston was completed {{six months before}} Hixon was. Instead Wheaton Aston became a satellite airfield of RAF High Ercall {{under the auspices of}} the Service Flying Training School (SFTS) at RAF Shawbury and a training base for No. 11 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit ((P)AFU). Because of the upturn in training at the base, it eventually went on to have 5 Relief Landing Grounds/Satellite sites of its own (RAF Bratton, RAF Peplow, RAF Perton, RAF Seighford & RAF Tatenhill). Throughout its existence, RAF Wheaton Aston was parented by RAF Shawbury and was dedicated to (P)AFU and <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach</b> Training (BAT). BAT was an early form of instrument landing system using radio beams. Training units based here were No. 11 (P)AFU, No 11 SFTS, No.21 (P)AFU, No. 1511 BAT Flight, No. 1517 BAT Flight and No. 1545 BAT Flight. No. 11 (P)AFU was structured into six flights, three were based at RAF Shawbury with one each at RAF Condover, RAF Perton and Wheaton Aston.|$|E
25|$|In June 1940, a German {{prisoner}} of war was overheard boasting that the British would never find the Knickebein, {{even though it was}} under their noses. The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. R. V. Jones, who started a search which discovered that Luftwaffe Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones began a search for German beams; Avro Ansons of the <b>Beam</b> <b>Approach</b> Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30MHz receiver. Soon a beam was traced to Derby (which had been mentioned in Luftwaffe transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines. The counter-operations were carried out by British Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison, No. 80 Wing RAF. The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals became known as Meaconing using masking beacons (meacons). Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that subtly widened its path, making it harder for bomber crews to locate targets and confidence in the device was diminished by the time the Luftwaffe was ready to conduct big raids.|$|E

50|$|Electron beam {{lithography}} or Electron-Beam Direct-Write Lithography (EBDW) scans {{a focused}} {{beam of electrons}} on a surface covered with an electron-sensitive film or resist (e.g. PMMA or HSQ) to draw custom shapes.

This form of direct-write, maskless lithography has high resolution and low throughput, limiting single-column e-beams to photomask fabrication, low-volume production of semiconductor devices, and research&development. Multiple-electron <b>beam</b> <b>approaches</b> have as a goal an increase of throughput for semiconductor mass-production.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{optical fiber}} {{consists}} of a thin inner cylindrical core of glass or plastic with a similar material layered in a thin coating around it.

50|$|But {{the real}} {{genius of the}} idea is that the <b>beams</b> <b>approached</b> the metal plate from {{different}} angles.
