5|$|Initially, Brătianu {{approached}} Averescu {{using their}} shared displeasure over the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod Romanian National Party (PNR)-Peasants' Party (PȚ) cabinet; the National Liberals managed {{to obtain the}} general's renunciation of his goal to prosecute their party for alleged mis-management of Romania <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> war, {{as well as his}} promise to respect the 1866 Constitution of Romania when carrying out the planned land reform.

5|$|The 1996 United States {{campaign}} finance controversy was an alleged {{effort by the}} People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself. The Chinese government denied all accusations.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics {{focus on}} human {{struggle}} and self-determination, A Beautiful Lies lyrics are more personal {{and the music}} introduces screaming vocals. The transformation that resonates throughout the album reflects the personal and artistic changes experienced by the band members <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> creation of the record. The album widened the band's sound by combining elements from progressive rock, hard rock and emo. Such alternative rock style {{has been compared to}} bands like The Cure, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins.|$|E

5|$|After the 2011 season, Edsall fired {{both his}} {{offensive}} coordinator Gary Crowton and his defensive coordinator Todd Bradford. Mike Locksley, {{who had been}} fired in 2011 from his head coaching position at New Mexico, was hired {{to be the new}} offensive coordinator. Locksley had previously worked at Maryland under head coaches Vanderlinden and Friedgen, and was the recruiting coordinator for Maryland <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> three consecutive 10+ win seasons under Friedgen. Brian Stewart, who had been the defensive coordinator for the Houston Cougars, was hired to replace Bradford as the new defensive coordinator.|$|E
5|$|Ausonia {{began her}} {{existence}} as a turbine-powered passenger steamer, ordered by Italian Sitmar in 1914. The ship {{was built in}} the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, under construction number 236. At the time, the only German seaplane carrier was the armored cruiser , which carried two planes. The leadership of the German Navy believed that zeppelins were much more effective than seaplanes, both for reconnaissance and attack. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the architect of the German Navy, was particularly unimpressed by the performance of fixed-wing aircraft. Nevertheless, the Navy developed several naval aircraft <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> war, including a pair of seaplane fighters, the W.12 and the W.29, both built by Hansa-Brandenburg. Twin-engined torpedo-floatplanes were also designed.|$|E

According to Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General James L. Jones {{it was not the}} lack of combat troops and the caveats were the problem, but the lack of adequate helicopters and military intelligence to support airlift and on-the-ground operations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi {{political}} organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> war. The most significant were DeVlag, Verdinaso and Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV) in Flanders {{as well as the}} Catholic Rex movement in Wallonia. Each of these movements had subtly different ideologies, their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers. These organisations were also instrumental in encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German Army. Unlike the German-style National Socialist agenda of DeVlag, VNV appealed directly to a Flemish separatist agenda, though this message was never the main source of their popularity. Infighting between the groups, particularly VNV and DeVlag, was considerable.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place {{all day on}} Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then {{transmitted}} live—with a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It {{was one of the}} last major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.|$|E

5|$|Following Romania's {{transition}} to a Socialist Republic, the monarchy was excoriated by communist officials. Several biographies {{of the royal family}} described Marie either as a drunkard or as a promiscuous woman, referring to her many alleged affairs and to orgies she had supposedly organised <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> war. In the years preceding the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Marie's popularity recovered and she was offered as a model of patriotism to the population. Marie is primarily remembered for her work as a nurse, but is also known for her extensive writing, including her critically acclaimed autobiography.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, {{with the passage of}} the Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the barest}} {{outlines}} of Theramenes' life outside {{the public sphere}} have been preserved in the historical record. His father, Hagnon had {{played a significant role}} in Athenian public life in the decades before Theramenes' appearance on the scene. He had commanded the group of Greek colonists who founded Amphipolis in 437–6 BC, had served as a general on several occasions <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnesian War, and was one of the signers of the Peace of Nicias. Hagnon's career overlapped with his son's when he served as one of the ten commissioners appointed by the government of the 400 to draft a new constitution in 411 BC.|$|E

5|$|Part of {{the wider}} Operation Barclay, Mincemeat {{was based on the}} 1939 Trout memo, written by Rear Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division, and his {{personal}} assistant, Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming. With the approval of the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and the overall military commander in the Mediterranean, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the plan began with transporting the body to the southern coast of Spain by submarine, and releasing it close to shore. It was picked up the following morning by a Spanish fisherman. The nominally neutral Spanish government shared copies of the documents with the , the German military intelligence organisation, before returning the originals to the British. Forensic examination showed they had been read, and decrypts of German messages showed the Germans fell for the ruse. Reinforcements were shifted to Greece and Sardinia both <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> invasion of Sicily; Sicily received none.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{concerns}} over security led to Henry II investing heavily {{in a new}} castle structure on the site between 1171 and 1174. It was unusual for a new royal castle {{to be built in}} this part of England during the 12th century, and Henry appears to have been driven by the military threat from Scotland <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Great Revolt of 1173 to 1174. Henry II spent almost £600 on the castle between 1170 and 1187, most of it in the first few years, rebuilding the older structure {{under the supervision of the}} Count of Brittany's local tenants, Torfin, Osbert and Stephen of Barningham.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury {{has also}} been home to {{contributors}} to literature. In {{the early years of}} the 18th century, the Irish dramatist George Farquhar resided in the town while acting as a recruiting officer for the Army. He drew on this experience in writing the comedy The Recruiting Officer. Prior to the First World War, the poet Wilfred Owen lived in the town. The romantic novelist Mary Webb is buried there. Michael Palin, the writer, actor and comedian attended Shrewsbury School. Other actors with associations with the town include Nick Hancock, presenter of They Think It's All Over, who, like Palin, was educated at Shrewsbury School. Nick Conway is another actor connected to the town, and was born in it in 1962. Actor Jason Bateman's mother was born in Shrewsbury. Comedian George Robey lived in the town, near Lord Hill's Column, <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Second World War.|$|E
