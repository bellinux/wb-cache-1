25|$|Newspapers often refine {{distribution}} of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change {{to reflect the}} location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising—the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial—or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, {{in which it is}} often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising rate card provides a good example of editioning.|$|E

The designs of costumes were altered, according to Bryant, to reflect the general fashion development and changes in mainstream pop culture during the 1960s.

[...] He added, [...] "if there's any justice in this world, McMahon will pay dearly for what his organization has done to further pain the Harts". Some fans were also upset with the decision to carry on with the show. One man, who left the event with his children upon hearing that Hart had died, claimed, [...] "It was disgusting.... For kids to see that, {{for this to be}} so-called family entertainment, for them to just carry on as if nothing had happened, is just sad." [...] Martha Hart, Owen's wife, refused to criticize McMahon publicly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} her husband's death. She said that McMahon [...] "absolutely should be there" [...] at the funeral. She also stated, [...] "I'm a very forgiving person and I'm not bitter or angry, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a day of reckoning".

500|$|Some things {{explored}} in the album were Radke's personal experiences, which include his mother, {{the corruption of}} Las Vegas, and his incarceration in prison due to multiple run-ins with the law involving narcotics and battery charges related {{to the death of}} Michael Cook.

I do have love, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a lot of songs about just what I’ve been through." [...] Several songs focused on his departure from Escape the Fate after they kicked him out and replaced him with former Blessthefall singer Craig Mabbitt, with songs on the album that directly attacked both Mabbitt and Escape the Fate bassist Max Green. Prior to the album's release, Radke discussed what he intended to say about Escape the Fate on certain tracks, stating {{in an interview that he}} believed that the band's first album without Radke, This War Is Ours, was named after the conflict over Mabbitt taking over Radke's position in Escape the Fate. The band has since claimed it was not written about Radke, but he did not believe them.|$|E

500|$|Feige {{felt that}} the visuals of the film needed [...] "to be a Ditko/Kubrick/Miyazaki/The Matrix mind-trip", and said that [...] "You don't get into it in Harry Potter, but if a {{scientist}} went to Hogwarts he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not {{going to spend a}} lot of time on that, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds." [...] In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like Fantasia and Harry Potter, wanting [...] "to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that." [...] Feige called Doctor Strange the [...] "doorway" [...] into the supernatural side of the MCU, a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the Doctor Strange comics [...] "broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the Marvel multiverse". Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' [...] "Earth-616 and Earth 617", but would instead feature [...] "dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them", like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.|$|E

At the SF Site, Steven H Silver observed that the book's parodying of action films is [...] "masterful", and commended Pratchett for how [...] "fresh" [...] the humor was—while conceding that [...] "reader(s) may not laugh out loud ... <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> plenty of internal chuckling".|$|E

This allows the spheres of the new row to slide in closer to the first row until all spheres in the new row are touching two spheres of the first row. Since the new spheres touch two spheres, their centers form an equilateral triangle with those two neighbors' centers. The side lengths are all 2r, so the height or y-coordinate difference between the rows is r. Thus, this row will have coordinates like this: ...|$|E
