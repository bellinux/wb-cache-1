5|$|Redback spiderlings cohabit on the {{maternal}} web {{for several days}} to a week, during which time sibling cannibalism is often observed. They then leave by <b>being</b> <b>carried</b> on the wind. They follow light and {{climb to the top}} of nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens high in the air and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as ballooning or kiting. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and <b>being</b> <b>carried</b> off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.|$|E
