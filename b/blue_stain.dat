5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{produces}} basidiospores {{that are}} ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore shape {{is one of}} the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 micrometres(μm). The average spore length is 5.25μm, while the average width is 4.14μm. The spores have thick cell walls, and are hyaline. They are strongly cyanophilous, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl <b>blue</b> <b>stain.</b> In addition, they are weakly dextrinoid, meaning that they will stain slightly reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped basidia, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7μm. There are also basidioles, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.|$|E

30|$|To {{confirm the}} {{presence}} of AptHER 2 -MNS in the tumor histologically, Prussian <b>blue</b> <b>staining</b> was conducted (Fig.  5 f). In Prussian <b>blue</b> <b>stained</b> tissue, nucleus and cytoplasm were stained as deep or light pink color, and several blue colored dots were observed around tumor cells. We assumed that the tumor tissues <b>stained</b> <b>blue</b> in color if AptHER 2 -MNS targeted the tumor. In {{the results of the}} Prussian <b>blue</b> <b>staining,</b> the <b>blue</b> dots were observed in the tumor tissues, and the tissue slides of AptHER 2 -MNS had approximately 3 -folds as much the number of blue dots as those of WMNCs. Prussian <b>blue</b> <b>staining</b> can detect the Fe ion in tissues; thus, it was used to confirm the accumulation of the contrast agent based on IONPs in the tumor tissues [44, 49, 50].|$|R

500|$|The spores {{are roughly}} spherical to broadly [...] in shape, covered with small wart-like {{projections}} (tubercules), and have dimensions of 6–8.5 by 5.5–8µm. Viewed microscopically, they are hyaline, meaning they appear translucent or colorless. Chemical tests {{may also be}} used to help distinguish the spores: in the presence of potassium hydroxide (KOH), the spores turn slightly green; the spores are not amyloid, meaning they do not take iodine when treated with Melzer's reagent; the spores are acyanophilous, meaning they do not readily absorb methyl <b>blue</b> <b>stain.</b> The cystidia that comprise the hymenium are [...] and 3–4µm wide by 28–40µm long. The outer tissue layer of the cap—the cuticle, or pileipellis—is made of interwoven hyphae, and stains olive-green in KOH. Clamp connections are present, but not at all the cell partitions. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are 32–38 by 5–6µm and four-spored.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith's {{party was}} the biggest spender on press {{advertising}} in the 1997 campaign; it spent {{three times as much}} as the Conservatives and five times as much as Labour on press adverts. Its media profile greatly eclipsed that of UKIP. Goldsmith also used his financial resources to deliver a videocassette to five million UK households in March 1997. This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: [...] "The most important video you'll ever watch", [...] "The story the politicians don't want you to hear", and [...] "If you care about Britain, please pass this video on." [...] The 12-minute film, presented by the former That's Life! presenter Gavin Campbell, warned of a coming [...] "federal European super-state". In his analysis of the video, scholar David Hass argued that the film was deliberately designed to elicit fear in the viewer, something achieved through [...] "eerie sound effects", the image of a <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> spreading across a map of Europe, and slow-motion shots of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl striding towards the screen. In Hass' view, the film [...] "manifestly reduced that complex issue of Europe to the lowest common denominator, and aimed to shock." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herbivores {{are unable}} to digest complex {{cellulose}} and rely on mutualistic, internal symbiotic bacteria, fungi, or protozoa to break down cellulose {{so it can be}} used by the herbivore. [...] Microbial symbionts also allow herbivores to eat plants that would otherwise be inedible by detoxifying plant secondary metabolites. [...] For example, fungal symbionts of cigarette beetles (Lasioderma serricorne) use certain plant allelochemicals as their source of carbon, in addition to producing detoxification enzymes (esterases) to get rid of other toxins. Microbial symbionts also assist in the acquisition of plant material by weakening a host plant's defenses. [...] Some herbivores are more successful at feeding on damaged hosts. As an example, several species of bark beetle introduce <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> fungi of the genera Ceratocystis and Ophiostoma into trees before feeding. The <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> fungi cause lesions that reduce the trees' defensive mechanisms and allow the bark beetles to feed.|$|E

2500|$|Mountain pine beetles affect {{pine trees}} by laying eggs under the bark. The beetles {{introduce}} <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> fungus into the sapwood that prevents the tree from repelling and killing the attacking beetles with tree pitch flow. The fungus also blocks water and nutrient transport within the tree. On the tree exterior, {{this results in}} popcorn-shaped masses of resin, called [...] "pitch tubes", where the beetles have entered. The joint action of larval feeding and fungal colonization kills the host tree {{within a few weeks}} of successful attack (the fungus and feeding by the larvae girdles the tree, cutting off the flow of water and nutrients). When the tree is first attacked, it remains green. Usually within a year of attack, the needles will have turned red. This means the tree is dying or dead, and the beetles have moved to another tree. In three to four years after the attack, very little foliage is left, so the trees appear grey.|$|E
2500|$|Wood from beetle-affected trees {{retains its}} {{commercial}} usefulness for 8 to 12 {{years after the}} tree has died, but its value drops rapidly, for within several months, the escaping moisture blows large checks and cracks from the outer perimeter of the wood deep {{into the heart of}} the tree. The remaining moisture escapes more slowly, causing small cracks throughout the timber. [...] This causes difficulties for modern high-output automated sawmill operations and greatly increases the lumber losses and the labor to produce high quality wood products. [...] This so-called ‘shelf life’ is dependent on a number of factors, including economic and stand site conditions. The trees remain commercially viable longer under drier conditions. In areas where it is wetter, the trees tend to rot at the base and fall faster, especially if they are larger. The fungus that is carried by the beetles and kills the trees causes blue staining of the sapwood at the perimeter of the tree, but it does not affect the wood’s strength, nor are there any harmful human health effects. [...] <b>Blue</b> <b>stain</b> is, however, considered to be a defect in the lumber grading standards and thus is considered a 'down-grade' resulting in a lower commodity market price. [...] All these factors have severely limited the production of blue-stain wood products.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the selectivity {{and strength of}} intraoperative trypan <b>blue</b> <b>staining</b> during removal of epiretinal membranes (ERMs) and the internal limiting membrane. Methods: Based on intraoperative videos, 51 consecutive chromovitrectomies in 51 patients with macular holes, macular pucker, vitreomacular traction syndromes, or persistent macular edema were retrospectively studied. Fifteen subjects underwent trypan blue, 14 indocyanine green, and 22 brilliant blue G chromovitrectomy. The main outcome measure was the color contrast between stained internal limiting membrane or ERM and the underlying unstained tissue by means of objective, quantitative, semiautomated chromaticity difference measurements. Results: Trypan <b>blue</b> <b>stains</b> both ERM and the internal limiting membrane (average chromaticity scores 8. 51 and 7. 09, respectively; P = 0. 48).
