5|$|The city {{is divided}} into two {{distinctive}} geographic regions: the dry eastern side which includes majority of the urban area {{of the city and the}} western region which borders the Nilgiris, Anaimalai and Munnar ranges. Palghat Gap, a mountain pass which connects the neighbouring state of Kerala to Tamil Nadu, lies to the west of the city. Because of its location in the biodiversity hotspot of the Western Ghats, it is rich in fauna and flora. The Coimbatore urban wetlands harbours around 116 species of birds, of which 66 are resident, 17 are migratory and 33 are local migrants. The spot-billed pelican, painted stork, openbill stork, ibis, spot-billed duck, teal and <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt</b> visit the Coimbatore wetlands on their migration. Apart from the species common to the plains, various threatened and endangered species such as Indian elephants, wild boars, leopards, Bengal tigers, gaurs, Nilgiri tahr, sloth bear and black-headed oriole are found in the region.|$|E
25|$|Resident {{bird species}} include purple swamphen, common moorhen, pheasant-tailed jacana, purple heron, <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt,</b> common coot, spot-billed duck, spot-billed pelican, prinias, common {{kingfisher}}, pied kingfisher, pied crested cuckoo, white-breasted kingfisher and grey heron.|$|E
25|$|The {{wintering}} {{species that}} visit the estuary are <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt,</b> common sandpiper, wood sandpiper, black-tailed godwit, little ringed plover, lesser sand plover, Pacific golden plover, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern, little egret and great egret.|$|E

50|$|A recent {{appearance}} were {{a family}} of <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilts.</b> These were a male and female, with two juveniles. They had bred at Medmerry RSPB in July 2014 and shortly afterwards they moved to Pulborough Brooks.|$|R
25|$|During winter {{one can see}} Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian brown flycatcher, brown-breasted flycatcher, Indian pitta, Blyth's {{reed warbler}} in the TS gardens, and in the estuary herons, egrets, sandpipers, <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt,</b> godwits and plovers can all be seen.|$|E
25|$|Sicily {{has a good}} {{variety of}} fauna. Species include fox, least weasel, pine marten, roe deer, wild boar, crested porcupine, hedgehog, common toad, Vipera aspis, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, hoopoe and <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt.</b> Sicily is an important habitat {{for the survival of}} several species, an example being the subspecies of hooded crow Corvus cornix which is only found in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica.|$|E
25|$|The {{black-necked stilt}} is {{distinguished}} from non-breeding vagrants of the Old World <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt</b> {{by the white}} spot above the eye. Vagrants of the northern American form in turn {{is hard to tell}} apart from the resident Hawaiian stilt, in which only the eye-spot is markedly smaller. But though many stilt populations are long-distance migrants and during their movements can be found hundreds of miles offshore, actual trans-oceanic vagrants are nonetheless a rare occurrence.|$|E
50|$|Species seen: whinchat, redstart, pied flycatcher, woodchat shrike, Sardinian warbler, nightingale, Audouin's gull, blue rock thrush, crag martin, black vulture, Thekla lark, Marmora's warbler, Cory's shearwater, purple swamphen, great reed warbler, moustached warbler, <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilts,</b> bee-eater, cirl bunting.|$|R
5000|$|Sambhar hosts {{a variety}} of avian species. Popular species of birds sighted here are coots, <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilts</b> and redshanks. During the monsoon season, {{a huge number of}} Siberian pink {{flamingos}} carpet the Sambhar Salt Lake making it wonderfully pinkish.|$|R
50|$|The IBA {{supports}} large {{populations of}} sarus cranes and over 1% {{of the world}} populations of brolgas, Australian bustards, black-tailed godwits, great knots, eastern curlews, sharp-tailed sandpipers, lesser sand plovers, grey-tailed tattlers, little curlews, pied oystercatchers, broad-billed sandpipers, red-necked stints and <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilts.</b>|$|R
25|$|It {{is often}} {{treated as a}} {{subspecies}} of the common or <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt,</b> using the trinomial name Himantopus himantopus mexicanus. However, the AOS has always considered it a species in its own right, and the scientific name Himantopus mexicanus is often seen. Matters are more complicated though; sometimes all five distinct lineages of the Common Stilt are treated as different species. But the white-backed stilt from southern South America (H. melanurus when the species is recognized), parapatric and intergrading to some extent with its northern relative where their ranges meet, would warrant inclusion with the Black-necked stilt when this is separated specifically, becoming Himantopus mexicanus melanurus. Similarly, the Hawaiian stilt, H. m. knudseni, is likely {{to belong to the}} American species when this is considered separate; while some treat it as another distinct species, the AOS, BirdLife International and the IUCN do not.|$|E
25|$|Several {{bird species}} thrive on Niʻihau. The largest lakes {{on the island}} are Hālaliʻi Lake, Halulu Lake and Nonopapa Lake. These {{intermittent}} playa lakes on the island provide wetland habitats for the ʻalae keʻokeʻo (Hawaiian coot), the āeʻo (<b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt),</b> and the koloa maoli (Hawaiian duck). The critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi) is found in high numbers on Niʻihau's shores. Robinson states that Niʻihau's secluded shoreline offers them a safe haven from habitat encroachments. According to Robinson, conditions there are better than the government refuges of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. When the Robinsons originally purchased Niʻihau, no monk seals were present, because {{they lived in the}} northwestern part of the Hawaiian island chain, Necker and Midway islands. They have been relocated to the main Hawaiian island chain by NOAA fisheries over the past thirty years, and some have found homes on Niʻihau.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 143 species of fish, amphibians, birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been seen}} in the park and the number is expected to go up to 200 once the project is completed. More than 85 different kinds of birds, including rare black bittern, cinnamon bittern, black-winged kite, white-bellied sea eagle, pied kingfisher, yellow wagtails, egret, chestnut-winged cuckoo, and <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilt</b> have been spotted by ornithologists in the green expanse. After the northeast monsoon of 2011, painted storks have been spotted in the park after several years. Butterflies, including the rare painted lady and black rajah and blue-tailed green darner dragon fly, have been among those spotted here. Crows, mynahs, blue rock pigeons and water paddybirds walk on the sand near the waterbodies. Non-poisonous snakes, soft and hard shell turtles, painted frogs and green pond frogs can also be seen in the park. The restoration has also improved the quality of water, which according to Central Pollution Control Board norms, is suitable for propagation of wildlife.|$|E
50|$|The Valli di Comacchio {{are home}} to the {{greatest}} variety of birds of Italy. There are over 300 species of birds such as flamingos, <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilts,</b> egrets and other herons and kingfishers. In addition, there are fish such as bream, eels, sea bass, mullet, and sole. Foxes are common.|$|R
50|$|Relatively, the Hawaiian stilt has {{among the}} longest legs of any {{bird in the}} world. Its eyebrows, cheeks, chin, breast, belly and vent are white. Immature birds have a {{brownish}} back and a cheek patch like the adult black-necked stilt. Downy chicks are well camouflaged in tan with black speckling. Young look identical to both black-necked and <b>black-winged</b> <b>stilts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its {{position}} on the North Sea coast makes it a prime site for migratory birds in autumn. It consequently is home to two adjoining nature reserves, one owned by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust and the other by the Norfolk Ornithological Association.

40|$|Levels of {{exposure}} to pesticides in rice fields can be significant depending on the environmental policies practiced. The aim of European Union integrated management policy is to reduce pesticide use and impact on environment. Rice fields provide an alternative breeding habitat for many waterbirds that {{are exposed to the}} pesticides used and therefore can be valuable indicators of their risk for wildlife. To evaluate integrated management success we examined exposure of <b>Black-winged</b> <b>Stilts</b> (Himantopus himantopus) to cholinesterase-inhibiting pesticides in rice fields under different types of management by measuring plasma cholinesterase activity. Cholinesterase activity was lower in birds sampled in (a) 2008 after a period of intense pesticide application, than in (b) 2005 - 2007 and 2011 in rice fields subject to integrated management in Doñana (SW Spain) and (c) in control natural wetlands in Spain and Morocco. During 2009 and 2010, cholinesterase activity was lower in rice fields in Doñana than in rice fields in Larache and Sidi Allal Tazi (NW Morocco). Our results suggest that integrated management successfully reduced the exposure of <b>Black-winged</b> <b>Stilts</b> to pesticides in most of the years. Care should be taken to implement mosquito and pest crop controls on time and with environmentally friendly products in order to reduce its impact on wildlife.
