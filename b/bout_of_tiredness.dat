40|$|An {{investigation}} into technologies to detect impaired performance due to driver fatigue was undertaken. From this, a new forced-choice stimulus-reaction device was developed specifically to detect driver impairment in operators of haul trucks in open cut mines. The device {{was developed in}} conjunction with personnel from the mining industry to suit the harsh conditions of the mining environment. The technology was trialled in three open cut mines and in a driving simulator at Murdoch University in Western Australia. Data were collected {{on the performance of}} drivers and analysed to validate the technology. A significant positive correlation was found between measures of reduced operator reaction performance and measures of eye closure. It was found that the device detected few false alarms and missed few <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> as indicated by eye closures. It is suggested that the device would be a useful tool to assist with the detection of driver fatigue in open cut mining environments. The forced-choice reaction-monitoring device was used to assess the performance of drivers in a gold mine in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. The fly-in-fly-out haul truck drivers worked 14 consecutive 12 -hour night shifts, had a day off, then worked 13 consecutive 12 -hour day shifts. A total of more than 3, 500 hours of real-time objective performance data were collected and analysed. The main findings were that the objective performance data showed patterns of low performance that did not fit some of the performance data that would be expected from examination of past literature. Many findings are discussed in light of these anomalies. Another important finding is that the subject's background and sleep pathology is a possible predictor for poor performance on the forced-choice reaction task. The system was also used to measure the performance of drivers with rising blood alcohol levels in a driving simulator. Subjects drank vodka with a mixer while driving for two hours starting at both 20 : 00 hrs and 22 : 00 hrs, with a week in between the two trials. The fatigue monitor detected reaction times slower than 3 SD of baseline performance at low levels of BAC. Performance at 22 : 00 hrs was marginally more impaired than performance at 20 : 00 hrs. Drivers at low BAC levels tended to compensate easier on the reaction task at 20 : 00 hrs compared to at 22 : 00 hrs. The ARRB fatigue monitor shows good capacity to detect poor performance due to low and medium measures of BAC. The research undertaken within this thesis has provided data that challenges contemporary research that generally suggests that time on task {{is one of the largest}} influences of fatigue at work. It appears that both circadian influences and individual lifestyle habits will have an equal or greater impact on fatigue risk at work...|$|R

40|$|People with {{insomnia}} often exhibit interpretive biases to cues {{associated with}} their condition. This study examined whether individuals with insomnia display an interpretive bias, such that they misperceive facial attributes <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> in a disorder-consistent manner. The efficacy of providing feedback related {{to the accuracy of}} participants’ perception on later judgements <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> was further examined. Forty participants, 20 with DSM- 5 -defined insomnia disorder and 20 normal-sleepers, participated. The perception of one's own facial appearance <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> was assessed twice over two consecutive days using a visual task whereby participants indicated when a morphing image of their face represented their current level <b>of</b> <b>tiredness.</b> Visual and verbal feedback, related to participants’ degree of misperception, was provided on completion of Day 1 testing. Overall, individuals with insomnia perceived their own face as significantly more tired than a baseline neutral photograph was, whereas normal-sleepers perceived themselves as appearing more alert. This pattern of results was only apparent on Day 1. Although no group × day interaction was established, mean scores suggest an improvement in perception on Day 2 amongst individuals with insomnia only. These findings suggest that individuals with insomnia exhibit a misperception of their facial attributes <b>of</b> <b>tiredness,</b> interpreting them in a disorder-consistent manner. This finding adds to the body of literature on cognitive models of insomnia, demonstrating more general cognitive biases in the disorder. Further, the results provide suggestive evidence that this misperception may be reformed...|$|R
40|$|Classic {{theories}} {{interpret the}} phenomena <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> {{as a consequence}} of biochemical changes appearing in the whole organism or in active organs. From operational point of view we can define tiredness as a reversible psychophysical condition appearing under the influence of expanded time of activities, which is manifested a series of negative changes on physiological, psychological and behavioral plan. Physiological nature was primarily related by the scientists to lack of oxygen and other nutritional material in blood or blood plasma andloading of different waste material and metabolism products On those bases, three classical theories were founded, such as: theory of suffocation, theory of exhaustion, and theory of saturation, united in one general name as hormonal theories <b>of</b> <b>tiredness.</b> Lately, with extending of findings on the role of reticular formation, there are activation theories <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> being developed. Supporters of these theories have discovered a series of complex connections and relations existing through tiredness and different forms of brain work such as: exhaustion of neural cells during their activity, neural influences determining arrival of nutritious material into work active organs, disruption of harmony in neurophysiological processes, role of inhibition process etc. For explanation <b>of</b> mental <b>tiredness,</b> central brain theory <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> is dominantly used.

40|$|Recently it was {{hypothesized}} that the antidepressant response to total sleep deprivation (SD) results from a disinhibition process induced by the increase <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> in the course of SD. In the present study, the role <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> in the antidepressant response to SD is further investigated, Seventy-two depressed patients scored subjective tiredness and depressed mood three times daily (in the morning afternoon, and evening) on the days preceding and following SD. It was found that averaged tiredness on the day prior to SD was related to the SD response, when the severity of depression prior to SD had been held statistically constant. Also, when both severity of depression and diurnal variation of mood prior to SD were partialed out, tiredness showed a positive correlation with the SD response: patients who reported a relatively low degree <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> on the day preceding SD improved by SD. This result suggests that tiredness has an influence on SD effects, and that this influence is independent from that of the severity of depression, The findings are in accordance with current ideas on the role <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> as a mediating factor in the induction of the therapeutic effects of SD...|$|R

Fifty-six normal sleepers and 58 individuals with insomnia symptoms observed 98 facial photographs (49 neutral, 49 tired). Using a visual analogue scale, participants were required to rate {{the extent to which}} each face appeared as tired and alert. Tired faces were created by manipulating neutral photographs to include previously identified facial tiredness cues. All participants rated sleep-related faces as more tired and less alert relative to neutral photographs. A significant Group[*]×[*]Face[*]×[*]Rating interaction demonstrated that, compared with normal sleepers, the insomnia symptoms group showed lower ratings for the expression <b>of</b> <b>tiredness,</b> but not alertness, whilst observing the tired faces. The findings suggest that the presence of insomnia symptoms is associated with reduced ratings of expression intensity for sleep-related facial photographs displaying tiredness. These outcomes add to the body of literature on how facial cues <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> are perceived by those with insomnia symptoms. Further work is required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between insomnia symptoms and reduced perceptions <b>of</b> facially expressed <b>tiredness...</b>|$|R

40|$|National audienceTiredness is a {{frequent}} complaint in the labour sphere, but difficult to analyse. Works that sought to produce an explanatory theory <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> ran up indeed against the subjective and multidimensional dimension of the phenomenon. From there comes the will of many specialists in tiredness at work to concentrate their studies on what would constitute the psychosocial dimension <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> in the industrialized and tertiarized economies : boredom, monotony and mental suffering. If these researches {{made it possible to}} widen our comprehension of the question <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> at work, they remain marked by an implicit representation of a human being equipped with invariant psychological and social needs. Thus they do not make it possible to account for the variations in the meaning of the various difficulties the workers meet, nor in the imposition of the feeling of discomfort which might result. A more constructivist approach, holding into account the collective representations, the stakes and the specific balance of power to each professional environment, shows that the categories used to think tiredness at work and the experience <b>of</b> this <b>tiredness</b> by the employees are not easily dissociable. The examples of the musculo-skeletal disorders in the industrial companies and of the burn out of the hospital nurses make it possible to illustrate the complexity of the interactions between specific forms <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> and particular contexts of work. La fatigue, le stress et la souffrance psychologique constituent des états difficiles à objectiver et à faire reconnaître. C'est pourquoi les catégories à travers lesquelles ces états vont être mis en forme et interprétés contribuent si fortement à déterminer la réalité des phénomènes en question, même si elles sont l'objet d'enjeux et d'intérêts qui dépassent la simple réflexion scientifique. A partir de l'exemple du burn out des infirmières hospitalières françaises, cet article s'efforce de montrer comment une telle catégorie émerge au croisement de logiques d'actions hétérogènes et éclaire ainsi sur l'impact social que peut avoir une nouvelle entité psychologique. Finalement, le burn out des infirmières apparaît comme une notion largement dépendante du contexte dans lequel elle est apparue et s'est développée, ce qui en montre les dimensions socialement construites...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Previous {{research}} {{reveals that}} two factors influence the perception <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> in a face: {{the height of}} the upper eyelid (pretarsal show, both increased and decreased), and increased eyebrow elevation. We aimed to design, develop and validate a set of stimuli to differentiate the characteristics that increase perception of a tired face. Methods A hand-drawn picture of a neutral face was modified using imaging software to create a series of ten images, varying in degrees of pretarsal show, upper/lower lid depression and elevation, and eyebrow shape and position. Participants (n= 63) from the general population were presented with the images and asked to quantify on a scale of 0 - 10 the presence of eight emotions or states – “surprise”, “anger”, “tiredness”, “sadness”, “disgust”, “alertness”, “fear” and “happiness” with 0 being the lowest and 10 being the highest rating. Results One way repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to determine, for each image, which emotions were rated significantly differently from each other. For the images with increased pretarsal show and upper lid depression, tiredness was rated significantly higher than other emotions (F[4. 04, 173. 6]= 33. 67,p<. 001; and F[3. 84, 165. 3]= 67. 63, p<. 001, respectively). Furthermore, paired samples t-tests compared ratings <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> and alertness in each modified face to that of the neutral face to further confirm the presence of tiredness/alertness compared to the neutral image. Ratings <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> were greater for images containing an increased pretarsal show t(43) = 6. 06,p<. 001, and upper lid depression t(43) = 10. 46, p<. 001. Conclusion The present study found perception <b>of</b> <b>tiredness</b> was greatest for images in which pretarsal show and upper lid depression were increased. These findings inform us as to the elements that constitute a tired face, and highlight the elements of pictorial facial stimuli to be manipulated to create a ‘tired’ facial expression, for the utilization in future research...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} how single <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> exercise may differentially modulate neuroelectric correlates of attentional orienting and processing. Using a within-participants design, ERPs and task performance were assessed {{in response to}} a perceptually challenging three-stimulus oddball task prior to and following a <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise or seated rest during two separate, counterbalanced sessions. Findings revealed that, following a single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise, attentional processing was sustained relative to pretest whereas prolonged sitting resulted in attentional decrements. Focal attention resulting from attentional orienting, in contrast, {{does not appear to be}} sensitive to the influences <b>of</b> single <b>bouts</b> <b>of</b> physical activity. These findings suggest that acute exercise-induced changes in cognition do not originate from an overall modulation of attention but instead are specific to aspects of attentional processing.
