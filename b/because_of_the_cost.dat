5|$|Critics in {{the media}} noted BA's build quality faults, such as {{inconsistent}} gaps between trim sections and joints, although other commentators praised the interior design and craftsmanship. In the used car market, BA Falcons tend to suffer from poor depreciation rates, due to influxes of ex-fleet models entering the second-hand market and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of importing sterile IV fluids {{and the absence of}} a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).|$|E
5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after its}} establishment, OCX decided to limit {{construction}} costs to $70million, a figure {{which is in}} addition to approximately $50million of plans, permits, and right-of-way donated by Avatar, who will not be reimbursed. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> limit, {{the decision was made}} to build a two-lane highway initially, using a design that will easily permit the road to be widened to a four- or six-lane expressway in the future. In July 2013, a design-build contract for the highway was awarded to Jr. Davis Construction Company, based in Kissimmee. The total contract amount was $69,013,443.76, representing $68,788,000.00 for the original contract and $225,443.76 for changes to the project after bidding.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle was built by one of the earls of Chester, partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> and partly because Cheshire was a palatine county and the earl had {{authority}} over who was permitted to build castles. The earls were involved in the civil war of King Stephen’s reign {{in the middle of the}} 12th century commonly known as the Anarchy and the revolt against Henry II in 117374, both of which may have prompted castle building. Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester wanted control of the earldom of Carlisle but during the Anarchy it and much of northern England come under Scottish control. The construction of Buckton Castle may have been to safeguard Cheshire. These civil wars and rebellions would also have provided a context for the deliberate destruction of the castle. Alternatively the castle could have been built by William de Neville when he held the lordship of Longdendale under the earl of Chester between 1181 and 1186, though he may not have had the financial means to do so.|$|E

5|$|Human Entertainment's Dance Aerobics was {{an early}} rhythm-based video game {{released}} in 1987, and allows players to create music by stepping on Nintendo's Power Pad peripheral for the NES video game console. The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper has been credited as the first true rhythm game, and {{as one of the}} first music-based games in general. It requires players to press buttons in the order that they appear on the screen, a basic mechanic that formed the core of future rhythm games. The success of PaRappa the Rapper sparked the popularity of the music game genre. In 1997, Konami released the DJ-themed rhythm game Beatmania in Japanese arcades. Its arcade cabinet features buttons similar to those of a musical keyboard, and a rubber pad that emulates a vinyl record. Beatmania was a surprise hit, inspiring Konami's Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game, and to begin experimenting with other rhythm game concepts. Its successes include GuitarFreaks, which features a guitar-shaped controller, and 1998's Pop'n Music, a game similar to Beatmania in which multiple colorful buttons must be pressed. While the GuitarFreaks franchise continues to receive new arcade releases in Japan, it was never strongly marketed outside of the country. This allowed Red Octane and Harmonix to capitalize on the formula in 2005 with the Western-targeted Guitar Hero. In general, few Japanese arcade rhythm games were exported abroad <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of producing the peripherals and the resulting increases in retail prices. The 1999 Bemani title DrumMania featured a drum kit controller, and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions. Similarly, this concept was later appropriated by Harmonix for their game Rock Band.|$|E

25|$|Making {{comparisons}} between wind {{and other sources}} of energy can be difficult <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> profiles associated with wind developments. The {{vast majority of the}} costs associated with wind developments are upfront capital costs. The operating costs are relatively low, with each additional unit of wind power costing very little to produce. By comparison, conventional gas and coal developments have large capital costs, as well as significant operating costs. The difference in cost profiles creates difficulties when trying to compare the cost of alternative energy sources.|$|E
25|$|Early {{proposals}} {{planned to}} extend SkyTrain west along the Broadway corridor, but stopped {{well short of}} UBC <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost,</b> estimated at $700 million in 1999. However, the Provincial Transit Plan, released in February 2008, included funding for the entire Broadway corridor to UBC. The line would replace the region's busiest bus routes, where over 100,000 trips are made daily. The line would also include an interchange with the Canada Line at Cambie Street. In 2008, the new line was estimated to cost $2.8 billion, with an expected completion date of 2020.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the reforms}} of 1729, the treasury's income {{increased}} from 32,622,421 taels in 1721 to about 60 million taels in 1730, surpassing the record set during the Kangxi Emperor's reign; but the pacification of the Qinghai {{area and the}} defence of border areas were heavy burdens on the treasury. Safeguarding the country's borders cost 100,000 taels per year. The total military budget came up to about 10 million taels a year. By the end of 1735, military spending had depleted half the treasury, leaving 33.95 million taels.

25|$|The {{original}} U.S. Navy Polaris had {{not been}} designed to penetrate anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defenses, but the Royal Navy had to ensure that its small Polaris force operating alone, and often with only one submarine on deterrent patrol, could penetrate the ABM screen around Moscow. The result was a programme called Chevaline that added multiple decoys, chaff, and other defensive countermeasures. Its existence was only revealed in 1980, partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> overruns of the project, which had almost quadrupled the original estimate given when the project was finally approved in January 1975.

25|$|The {{next section}} was to Broken Hill, which the railway reached in 1906. BSAC was assured {{that there would}} be much traffic from its lead and zinc mines, but this did not {{materialise}} because technical mining problems. The railway could not meet the costs of the construction loans, and the company faced major financial problems, which were already serious <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of widening the Beira railway. The only area likely to generate sufficient mineral traffic to relieve these debts was Katanga. Initially, the Congo Free State had concluded that Katanga's copper deposits were not rich enough to justify the capital cost of building a railway to the coast, but expeditions between 1899 and 1901 proved their value. Copper deposits found in Northern Rhodesia before the First World War proved uneconomic to develop.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{issued an}} architectural design competition {{to rebuild the}} hill; Julien De Smedt's proposal was selected among 104 entrants. At the time, {{it was estimated that}} the new national arena would cost NOK653 million. Demolition of Holmenkollbakken started on 16 October 2008. The World Cup tournament in 2009 was held at Vikersundbakken instead of Holmenkollen because of the reconstruction. By 2008, the cost had accelerated to NOK1.2 billion, and by the following year it had reached NOK1.8 billion. City Commissioner For Business and Culture, Anette Wiig Bryn of the Progress Party, had to leave her position <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> overruns. A consultant report ordered by the municipality concluded that the pressure to find cost savings to stay within the budget, which was underestimated to start with, resulted in slower progress, which again resulted in higher costs.|$|E
