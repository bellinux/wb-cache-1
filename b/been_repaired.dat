5|$|Although {{the site}} was {{restored}} during the archaeological investigations, it suffered considerable damage in the 1976 Guatemala earthquake. This resulted in destruction {{of some of the}} restoration work, although some of the damage has now <b>been</b> <b>repaired.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Round Island Lighthouse {{is located}} {{just south of}} the island on the small, {{uninhabited}} Round Island. The light was built in 1894 and automated in 1924. Extensive restoration efforts began in the 1970s and the exterior and structure have since <b>been</b> <b>repaired.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} has <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> several times. Initially in 1777 {{and again}} in 1828 and then in 1879, each time the repairs were funded by Granville's descendants. Note that the original spelling was Bevil Granville but today Grenville or Greville are commonly used.|$|E
3000|$|We {{prove the}} claim using {{induction}} on ℓ. Note {{that a single}} erasure can <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> by {{using one of the}} local constraints the erased code symbol participates in. Now assume that at most ℓ− 1 erasures can <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> by using local constraints defined by the graph [...] G. We now show that any set of ℓ erasures can also <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> using local constraints.|$|R
40|$|Sacral {{fractures}} in 2 dairy cattle <b>were</b> <b>repaired</b> surgically for cosmetic reasons. A heifer had a Salter-Harris type-I fracture {{of the fifth}} sacral vertebra, which <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> with a 4. 5 -mm narrow dynamic compression plate. A cow had complete fracture of the fourth sacral body, which <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> with 2 extra-large plastic spinous process plates. Both fixations were successful in restoring the dorsal contour of the sacrococcygeal region...|$|R
5000|$|The {{exterior}} of the house <b>was</b> cleaned and <b>repaired</b> in 2006, before which it <b>was</b> last <b>repaired</b> over 100 years before. During the renovation, the front facade <b>was</b> <b>repaired,</b> the wrought iron grating was replaced, the limestone paving stones were replaced and the interior <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> and renovated. [...] As of 2009, the building is privately owned and is occupied by two businesses and two apartments.|$|R
5|$|Between 2004 and 2005, the aqueduct's {{surviving}} arches were {{restored and}} a lighting system was installed, {{at a total}} cost of Lm 140,000. Some of the arches {{are in need of}} restoration once again, mainly because of pollution since a major road now runs alongside the aqueduct. A section of the aqueduct was extensively damaged in December 2013 due to a car crash, but the damage has since <b>been</b> <b>repaired.</b>|$|E
5|$|Northampton Museum {{maintains}} a Concealed Shoe Index, which by 2012 contained 1900 reports of discoveries, mostly from Britain and almost half from the 19th century. The overwhelming majority have been worn, {{and many have}} <b>been</b> <b>repaired.</b> Most finds are of single shoes, {{about half of them}} belonging to children.|$|E
5|$|Operation Mascot was an {{unsuccessful}} British carrier air raid conducted against the German battleship Tirpitz at her anchorage in Kaafjord, Norway, on 17 July 1944. The attack {{was one of}} a series of strikes against the battleship launched from aircraft carriers between April and August 1944, and was initiated after Allied intelligence determined that the damage inflicted during the Operation Tungsten raid on 3 April had <b>been</b> <b>repaired.</b>|$|E
50|$|The station's windows, some {{of which}} had {{deteriorated}} or become damaged, <b>were</b> <b>repaired</b> with Parks Canada contributing matching funding to the project. In 2008, a new foundation was rebuilt, and in 2015 the roof <b>was</b> <b>repaired.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{automobile}} {{repair shop}} (also {{known as a}} garage) <b>is</b> a <b>repair</b> shop where automobiles <b>are</b> <b>repaired</b> by auto mechanics and technicians.|$|R
50|$|In 1892 {{the west}} door was {{opened and the}} 15th century font moved to its present {{position}} under the west tower, and the 15th century pulpit <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> and lowered to its original level. The spire <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> in 1972.|$|R
5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and tenon joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> in later years.|$|E
5|$|After her reacquisition, the Ward Line placed SS Siboney in transatlantic {{service on}} a New York to Havana, Tenerife, Bilbao, Santander, and Vigo route. On 9September 1920, the ship ran aground {{in the harbor}} at Vigo. Initial efforts to re-float her were unsuccessful, but by late October, Siboney had <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> {{enough to make it}} to Shields. Despite {{considerable}} damage, Siboney was refitted and placed in service again and, by March 1921, the Ward Line was advertising passage to Spain via Havana aboard her. The Ward Line, however, abandoned the New York–Cuba–Spain service later in 1921 {{due to a lack of}} passengers.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1941, Empire Simba, with a {{completely}} new crew, had <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> enough to set out in a Liverpool – Freetown convoy, but evidently returned to Liverpool the same day. After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to Freetown over the next 18 months, including convoy SL 125. Twice, when setting out with convoys, Empire Simba {{had to return to}} port with unspecified problems. In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her to collide with another convoy ship, Empire Scott, and on 1 August Empire Simba straggled and dropped out of the convoy.|$|E
5000|$|The fire-ravaged [...] <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> in August 1967 {{before her}} return to the United States for a {{complete}} overhaul. Destroyers , , [...] and , damaged by North Vietnamese shore batteries, <b>were</b> <b>repaired,</b> as <b>were</b> amphibious assault craft, river patrol boats and other small craft.|$|R
40|$|Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells were}} exposed in vitro to {{combinations}} of bleomycin and misonidazole under hypoxic conditions. Only one drug {{was present at}} any given time and cells were washed before being exposed to the second drug. Both drugs induced potentially lethal damage (PLD). This damage <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> under hypoxic conditions very rapidly, and bleomycin-induced PLD <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> more rapidly than misonidazole-induced PLD. If, after the combined treatment, cells are kept in hypoxia, much of the damage can <b>be</b> <b>repaired...</b>|$|R
50|$|The statue <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> and re-erected.|$|R
5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little direct {{damage to the}} outer hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, {{the shock of the}} explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|Keeler was {{responsible}} for the restoration of Baltimore's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, America's first cathedral. The project cost approximately $32 million. The funds were raised entirely from private donations and not from the Archdiocese's treasury. It lasted from 2004 until November 2006, and was finished in time for a celebration honoring the 200th anniversary of the groundbreaking. By the time the restoration was completed, the Basilica had <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> and restored to its more original appearance.|$|E
5|$|Nagato was {{selected}} to participate as a target ship in Operation Crossroads, a series of U.S. nuclear weapon tests held at Bikini Atoll in mid-1946. In mid-March, Nagato departed Yokosuka for Eniwetok, but her hull had not <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> from the underwater damage sustained during the attack on 18 July and she leaked enough that her pumps could not keep up. The ship had a list of seven degrees to port by the time tugboats from Eniwetok arrived. She reached the atoll on 4 April and Bikini in May.|$|E
50|$|This route <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> in 1993.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>repaired</b> in 1624, and {{subsequently}} widened in 1819 by John Stone. It <b>was</b> further <b>repaired</b> in 1866 and in 1952-1953 after flood damage.|$|R
30|$|Component failure <b>is</b> <b>repaired</b> {{immediately}} after detection.|$|R
5|$|Placed symmetrically in {{the north}} and south sides of the church are two nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows. Between the two windows on the church's north {{elevation}} is an exterior concrete block chimney. The layout of the east-facing rear elevation of the church is also symmetrical, and features three nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, with the center window placed above and between the other two windows. The church's windows have <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> using materials consistent with original construction.|$|E
5|$|The XR-1, having <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> in the meantime, {{was once}} again flying, and a {{contract}} had been awarded to Platt-Lepage {{for the construction of}} seven pre-production aircraft, to be built to an improved version of the XR-1A design, and designated YR-1A. Motivated by Congressional concerns about potential favouritism towards Sikorsky Aircraft, which had in the meantime been given a contract for development of an improved version of their VS-300 experimental helicopter, the contract called for delivery of the first YR-1A to the Army in January 1945. However, due to continued financial and flight-testing problems, Platt-Lepage proved incapable of meeting this schedule.|$|E
5|$|The citadel's three gates {{are located}} on the north, east and west sides of the citadel. The first two are the work of Al-Adil, {{although}} the northern gate has <b>been</b> <b>repaired</b> in the Mamluk period, while the current west gate is of later date. The northern gate was primarily reserved for military matters; the eastern gate was in civic use. During the Mamluk period, the eastern gate {{was one of two}} locations, the other being the Umayyad Mosque, where official decrees were posted, and this is reflected in a number of inscriptions that have been found here.|$|E
50|$|The hull will <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> when possible.|$|R
50|$|Aortic {{ruptures}} can <b>be</b> <b>repaired</b> surgically via open aortic {{surgery or}} using endovascular therapy (EVAR), regardless of cause, just as non-ruptured aortic aneurysms <b>are</b> <b>repaired.</b> An aortic occlusion balloon {{can be placed}} to stabilize the patient and prevent further blood loss prior to the induction of anesthesia.|$|R
30|$|Components <b>are</b> <b>repaired</b> {{individually}} (there <b>is</b> one repairman).|$|R
5|$|The {{tower was}} closed in 1914 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, for the duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal. Controversy still surrounds the decision to dismantle the tower after the war ended; some still believe the structure was safe and could have <b>been</b> <b>repaired.</b> Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold to scrap dealers.|$|E
5|$|A replica Arrow {{built by}} Allan Jackson {{was used in}} The Arrow, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began {{building}} a full-scale replica of the Arrow in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica {{could be used for}} the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since <b>been</b> <b>repaired,</b> but is no longer on public display.|$|E
5|$|Continuing southwards, {{the river}} passes the gallops which {{are part of}} Coombelands Racing Stables, {{situated}} on the eastern bank, and Park Mount, a motte and bailey dating {{from the time of}} the Norman conquest. It is one of the best-preserved monuments of this type in south east England. The river is crossed by Stopham Bridge, a fine medieval stone bridge built in 1422-23. The centre arch was raised as part of the improvements made to the navigation in 1822. It is a Grade I listed structure, and also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It was damaged by army lorries in the Second World War, but has <b>been</b> <b>repaired,</b> and the heavy traffic on the A283 road was diverted onto a new bridge just upstream of it in the 1980s.|$|E
