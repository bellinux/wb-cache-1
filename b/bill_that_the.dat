Article 100 was intended to address this perceived lacuna in the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E

25|$|In 1857 the Village of New Rochelle was {{established}} within {{the borders of}} the Town of New Rochelle and in 1861 a group of volunteers created the first fire service named ‘The Enterprise Hook/Ladder/Bucket Company #1’. A bill creating the New Rochelle City Charter was signed by Governor Theodore Roosevelt in 1889. It was through this <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Village and Town of New Rochelle were joined into one municipality. Davids’ Island became the site of Fort Slocum in 1896, named for General Henry Warner Slocum, a Huguenot descendant and a Civil War officer. Fort Slocum became one of the largest recruiting stations in the country, with greatest use during World War I and World War II. In 1899 Michael J. Dillon narrowly defeated Hugh A. Harmer to become New Rochelle's first mayor. The recently established city charter designated four wards, a board of aldermen (two from each ward), and 10 elected from the city at large.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1932–33 season, Shankly {{received}} a telegram from Carlisle United {{asking him to}} return {{as soon as possible}} because another club wanted to sign him. Arriving at Carlisle, he discovered that the interested club was Preston North End who had offered a transfer fee of £500. The terms for Shankly personally were a fee of £50 plus a £10 signing-on fee and wages of five pounds a week. Shankly's initial reaction was that it was not enough and the deal nearly fell through. Shankly's brother Alec pointed out to him that Preston were in the Second Division and a bigger club than Carlisle with the potential to regain First Division status. Alec convinced <b>Bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> opportunity was more important than what he would be paid immediately: [...] "it's what you're going to get later that counts". Shankly took his brother's advice and signed the Preston contract in a railway carriage.|$|E
500|$|When it {{was time}} to call a vote, the {{presiding}} magistrate could bring up whatever proposals (in whatever order) he wished, and every vote was between a proposal and its negative. Quorums were required for votes to be held, and it is known that in 67 BC the size of a quorum was set at 200 senators (by the lex Cornelia de privilegiis). At any point before a motion passed, the proposed motion could be vetoed. Usually, vetoes were handed down by plebeian tribunes. If the Senate proposed a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plebeian tribune (the magistrate who was the chief representative of the people) did not agree with, he issued a veto, which was backed by the promise to literally [...] "'interpose the sacrosanctity of his person'" [...] (or intercessio) if the Senate did not comply. If the Senate did not comply, he could physically prevent the Senate from acting, and any resistance could be criminally prosecuted as constituting a violation of his sacrosanctity. If the vetoed motion was proposed the next day, and the plebeian tribune who had vetoed it the day before was not present to interpose himself, the motion could be passed. In general, the plebeian tribune had to physically be present at the Senate meeting, otherwise his physical threat of interposing his person had no meaning. Ultimately, the plebeian tribune's veto was based in a promise of physical force.|$|E

2500|$|The New York state {{government}} affected many interests, {{and the power}} to make appointments to policy-making positions was a key role for the governor. Platt insisted that he be consulted on major appointments; Roosevelt appeared to comply, but then made his own decisions. Historians marvel that Roosevelt managed to appoint so many first-rate men with Platt's approval. He even enlisted Platt's help in securing reform, such as in the spring of 1899, when Platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association called [...] "superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in America".|$|E
2500|$|On February 22, at a {{press conference}} in Yangon, the {{students}} accused the government for violating the agreements as the government submitted the Ministry of Education’s version of the amendment bill alongside with the one agreed upon at the quadripartite meetings. Earlier that week on February 17, the Ministry of Education presented two proposed bills, claiming that the ministry crafted one of them. The <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Education proposed, according to Thein Lwin, the chairman of NNER, was the one presented at first at the quadripartite meeting but agreed to be discarded by the government. The competing drafts in the parliament might delay the process and could take up to a month according to Phyo Min Thein, a member of parliament representing the NLD. [...] Despite concerns from the students, the two proposed bills seemed to have some features in common. They both stated that schools and universities will be independent from the National Education Commission; that the school system would cater to students with disabilities; that the students would have the right to choose subjects they want to study except for those mandatory to pass the matriculation; that students and teachers would have the right to form unions and if necessary with financial help from university administration; that schools would be able to choose which language to teach; and that the government would increase the funding to 20% of the national budget in five years.|$|E
