5|$|A pilot {{episode was}} {{commissioned}} on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted {{different parts of}} the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in stereo sound. To win the latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in stereo, and BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} during a transitory time in musical history when songs {{first began to}} <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> for the phonograph. It was among the earliest pieces of popular music to <b>be</b> <b>recorded.</b> Dresser's inability to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders led him and his company to join other composers to petition the United States Congress to expand federal copyright protections over the new technology.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is {{the central}} unifying concept in {{behavioural}} ecology. Behaviours can <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> as traits and inherited {{in much the same}} way that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness.|$|E
60|$|Chest. But it <b>is</b> <b>recorded,</b> woman; it <b>is</b> <b>recorded,</b> said Justice Chester; {{as if it}} must be of {{necessity}} true, because it <b>was</b> <b>recorded.</b> With which words he often endeavoured to stop her mouth, having no other argument to convince her, but it <b>is</b> <b>recorded,</b> it <b>is</b> <b>recorded.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Animals' Christmas <b>was</b> <b>recorded</b> between December 23, 1984 and December 12, 1985. The {{orchestra}} <b>was</b> <b>recorded</b> at CTS Studios in Wembley, England.

5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{the group}} wrote around 40 new {{compositions}} in Rishikesh, 26 {{of which would}} <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in very rough form at Kinfauns, Harrison's home in Esher, in May 1968. Lennon wrote {{the bulk of the}} new material, contributing 14 songs. Lennon and McCartney brought home-recorded demos to the session, and worked on them together. Some home demos and group sessions at Kinfauns were later released on the 1996 compilation Anthology 3.|$|E

5|$|Examination by {{a severe}} weather {{team from the}} Bureau of Meteorology {{examined}} the damage in the Bucca and Kolan region and recorded it as an 'F4' on the Fujita scale. This corresponds to the tornado being able to produce winds between 331 and 417 kilometres per hour and of 'devastating' intensity. This is the first tornado ever to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> as an F4 in Australian history.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal's double envelopment at Cannae {{is often}} viewed {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} battlefield maneuvers in history, and is cited as the first successful use of the pincer movement within the Western world to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in detail.|$|E
5|$|In March 2017 it was {{announced}} by the MCC that the law on handled the ball would be completely removed and subsumed into the law on obstructing the field. This means {{that the act of}} handling the ball will still result in the batsman's dismissal, but will now always <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> as obstructing the field. The new law is due to come into effect on 1 October 2017.|$|E

5|$|In South Africa {{cylinders}} may {{be filled}} {{for commercial purposes}} by {{a person who is}} competent {{in the use of the}} filling equipment to be used, who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations, and has written permission from the owner of the cylinder to fill it. The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of the cylinder must be made, and specified details of the cylinder and fill must <b>be</b> <b>recorded.</b> If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> by the filler and signed by the customer. If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty, as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{these trends}} have continued, and several new {{approaches}} {{have come into}} prominence, including multielectrode recording, which allows the activity of many brain cells to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> {{all at the same}} time; genetic engineering, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; genomics, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in DNA properties and neuroimaging.|$|E
5|$|Lily van Java {{continues}} to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> {{as the first}} Chinese-produced film of the area. Although the Wongs went on hiatus, other ethnic Chinese became involved in film. Several Chinese owned start-ups are recorded from 1929 on, including Nancing Film with Resia Boroboedoer (1928) and Tan's Film with Njai Dasima (1929). By the early 1930s Chinese-owned businesses were the dominating force in the country's film industry.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{data sets}} may be {{necessary}} for certain phasing methods. For example, MAD phasing requires that the scattering <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths of the incoming X-ray radiation. A single crystal may degrade too much during the collection of one data set, owing to radiation damage; in such cases, data sets on multiple crystals must be taken.|$|E
5|$|The French Limousin breed {{standard}} is applied by international breed associations in slightly different forms. These range from mandatory compliance before an animal can <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in a country's herd book (mainly European countries) to voluntary application in others. For example, in Belgium, application of its {{breed standard}} mirrors in most detail the French use, {{and in the}} UK, compliance with its version of the Limousin breed standard is required by the UK breed association's bye-laws.|$|E
5|$|The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement {{extended}} both {{commercial and}} military cooperation into the post-war period.

5|$|The first Brahmousin cattle were {{produced}} from a multiple embryo transfer from a French-imported Limousin dam. The resulting progeny were then crossed with Brahman cattle {{to achieve an}} F1 hybrid. Further crosses over a broader base led {{to the production of}} the 5/8 Limousin – 3/8 Brahman Brahmousin purebred, a mix which {{has been found to be}} the most widely accepted and most useful for the majority of the USA. The American Brahmousin Council allows animals that are not purebred to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> as percentage animals as long as they are at least one-quarter Limousin and one-quarter Brahman. In order to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> as a purebred Brahmousin, the animal must then be sired by a registered purebred or fullblood Limousin bull, registered Brahman bull or a registered purebred Brahmousin bull.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} the first one to <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> for the medley, which was {{conceived}} by McCartney and producer George Martin as a finale for the Beatles' career.
