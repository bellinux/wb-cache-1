5|$|After the day's play, former Australian Test leg spinner <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> {{and former}} {{teammate}} of Bradman, now a journalist, consulted Bedser on {{his use of}} leg theory. O'Reilly had much experience in attacking leg stump in his career and helped Bedser refine his leg trap plan to ensnare Bradman.|$|E
5|$|These {{performances}} led former Test leg spinner <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> {{to compare}} him to Bradman and former Test opening batsman Jack Fingleton to lament his non-selection for the South African tour and its {{reflection on the}} plight of Australian cricket.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{defeated}} South Africa 4–0 {{and senior}} {{players such as}} <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A group of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he would additionally be sitting in judgement of their abilities {{in his role as}} a selector.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{continued}} {{campaigning in}} Iowa and New Hampshire visiting {{up to four}} different cities in one day. Political commentator <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> slammed Dodd after he appeared on The O'Reilly Factor in August, characterizing him as a kool-aid drinker and blind follower of the far left. O'Reilly chastised Dodd and branded him a traitor for his perceived betrayal of fellow Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman during the 2006 Senatorial election.|$|E

5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the best he ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> {{at the height of his}} form. However, it was the end of an era. The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E
5|$|Merv Harvey {{broke into}} the Victorian state team during the 1940–41 season and played in three {{first-class}} matches. The highlight of {{the first phase of}} his career for Victoria was a rapid 70 in one hour against a New South Wales attack containing <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly,</b> regarded as the best bowler in the world at the time. However, the outbreak of World War II in the Pacific caused the suspension of top-level cricket and halted Harvey’s progress. Harvey then served in the Royal Australian Air Force as an airframe fitter, losing his best cricketing years to the war.|$|E
5|$|A spin-off, The Colbert Report, was {{announced}} in early May 2005. The show starred former correspondent Stephen Colbert, and served as Comedy Central's answer to the programs of media pundits such as <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly.</b> Colbert, Stewart, and Ben Karlin developed {{the idea for the}} show based on a series of faux television commercials that had been created for an earlier Daily Show segment. They pitched the concept to Comedy Central chief Doug Herzog, who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without first creating a pilot. The Colbert Report premiered on October 17, 2005 and aired following The Daily Show for nine years. Initial ratings satisfied Comedy Central and less than three weeks after its debut the show was renewed for a year. The Colbert Report was produced by Jon Stewart's production company, Busboy Productions.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test at Lord's. Bradman elected to bat, allowing Lindwall {{more time to}} recover from a groin strain before being required to bowl. Hassett came in to join Morris at 2/87 when Bradman fell soon after lunch on the first day. The new ball was available, but England had declined to take it. Bedser beat Hassett second ball with a delivery that moved back in, but the appeal for lbw was turned down. However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain finally called for a replacement ball. Journalist and retired Australian cricketer <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> said that the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a failure to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly was honoured {{with several}} accolades {{late in his}} life. In 1980, he was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his {{services}} to cricket {{as a player and}} writer. In 1985, the oval in Wingello was renamed in his honour, and in 1988, a grandstand at the SCG was named the <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> Stand. In the same year, the oval in White Cliffs was renamed, and The Sydney Morning Herald renamed the medal they awarded to the best player in grade cricket in O'Reilly's honour. During the celebrations for the Australian Bicentenary, O'Reilly was named among the 200 people, and only 21 living, who had contributed the most to the country since European settlement.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing {{a few feet from}} U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an audience}} of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> and Sean Hannity.|$|E
5000|$|On CNNNN, {{broadcast}} in 2003 and 2004, {{he played a}} role as host of the fictional segment [...] "The Firth Factor", parodying journalistic styles used by the American Fox News commentator <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly's</b> prime time show The O'Reilly Factor.|$|R

5|$|Tallon {{made his}} Test debut in a one-off Test against New Zealand at Wellington in March 1946, {{although}} the match was only given Test accreditation two years later. On a wet wicket, New Zealand were dismissed for 42 and 54 against the slow bowling of <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> and Ernie Toshack. Tallon made a stumping, a {{run out and}} took a catch. He scored only five runs as Australia won by an innings and 103runs. Tallon had rarely kept to O'Reilly's leg spin and impressed the bowler, who compared him with Oldfield. During the tour of New Zealand, Australia won all of their five matches, four by an innings. Tallon scored 123 runs at 41.00 and made 12 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|Before the Tests, Fingleton {{expected}} the English batsmen to struggle against Miller and Lindwall; he believed that, accustomed to prolific scoring against low-quality bowling in county cricket, these batsmen {{would be unable}} to adapt to the demands of facing world-class opposition. England won the toss and batted first on the opening morning of the First Test at Trent Bridge. There had been overnight rain, which meant that the pitch would initially be favourable towards fast bowlers. Opening the bowling with Lindwall, Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it went to ground. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton with a faster ball, leaving England at 1/9. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad, but praised Miller for his ability to make occasional deliveries skid on faster, surprising the batsman.|$|E
5|$|Harold Larwood {{maintained}} {{great respect}} for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing {{him to be a}} great man. Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler shortly before he emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton admitted that he had liked Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done their job on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, a quality that caused problems in Australia. <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him agreeable and even charming.|$|E
50|$|Heartland {{was similar}} in format to <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly's</b> news program The O'Reilly Factor.

5|$|Harvey {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Victoria against Queensland at the Gabba in 1940–41. In the first innings, he made 25 before being caught by wicket-keeper Don Tallon from the bowling of Jack Ellis as the visitors took first innings {{points in a}} drawn match. In the next match, he made an impression. After making 35 in the first innings, he scored 70 in an hour's batting in the second innings at the SCG against New South Wales. In both innings, he was dismissed by leg spinner <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly,</b> the leading bowler in the world, but Victoria managed to prevail by 24 runs. The teams met again three weeks later, and this time, New South Wales turned the table, winning by 235 runs. Harvey made 14 in the first innings, bowled by O'Reilly for the second innings in a row. In the second innings he made 38 before being removed by another leg spinner, Cec Pepper. Harvey ended the season with 182 runs at 36.40.|$|E
5|$|Tom Dollery {{was called}} into the team after a run of heavy scoring for Warwickshire on {{difficult}} pitches at Edgbaston. He had made two centuries and seven fifties in 12 first-class matches for the season. Batsman Charlie Barnett was dropped after scoring only eight and six in the First Test. Joe Hardstaff junior was also left out; he had scored a duck and 43 in the First Test, and had a toe infection, so the selectors were spared the predicament of deciding whether to drop him on performance grounds. With Wright in for Young, and Coxon selected {{in place of a}} specialist batsman, England had a more attacking bowling line-up, something the retired Australian Test leg spinner <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> praised. He also thought the selection of Coxon was beneficial, as his swing bowling would ease the workload of batsman Bill Edrich, who had opened the bowling in the previous Test. O'Reilly regarded Edrich as a mediocre bowler and thought the extra burden with the ball was detracting from his main duty, batting.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test at Headingley. Middle-order batsman Neil Harvey {{replaced}} the injured opener Sid Barnes, who had collapsed while fielding during the Third Test after being hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot. Australia declined to replace Barnes with the reserve opener Bill Brown, instead opting to use vice-captain Lindsay Hassett as a makeshift opener rather than in his customary position in the middle-order. Harvey had scored an unbeaten 73 and a 95 in the recent tour matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire respectively. Ron Saggers replaced first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test, and he exacerbated the injury during the match against Middlesex. Former Australian Test leg spinner <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> criticised the Australians for opting to use only one spinner, pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist spinner, had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited a further instance of an Ashes Test at the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia. He wanted {{at least one of}} the two leg spinners, Colin McCool or Doug Ring, to have played alongside off spinner Ian Johnson, the only specialist spinner to have played in the three preceding Tests.|$|E
50|$|In the non-fiction arena, two {{broadcasts}} in 2013, {{adaptations of}} <b>Bill</b> <b>O’Reilly’s</b> books Killing Kennedy and Killing Lincoln both delivered record ratings for National Geographic channel, while the documentary series, Crimes of the Century was featured on CNN. Also notable, the Emmy-winning documentary special, Gettysburg, was produced for the History Channel.|$|R
5000|$|Shirley led {{a team of}} Reagan {{historians and}} Reagan White House {{veterans}} to challenge the veracity and truthfulness of <b>Bill</b> <b>O'Reilly's</b> book, Killing Reagan. In coordination with various Reagan institutes, Shirley also forced the cancellation of auction of Reagan's blood and the turning over of the vial to the Reagan Foundation.|$|R

He also appears in Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life, the Academy Award nominated documentary by Michael Paxton.|$|R
