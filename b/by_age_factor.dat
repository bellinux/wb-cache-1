40|$|Retirement is {{time where}} {{somebody}} would have work relation dissolution caused <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>factor.</b> In this time, somebody would experience total {{change in his}} / her life pattern. Life pattern change could cause some people experienced anxiousness in this retirement. Here the emotional intelligence of the person has important role, since basically, somebody who owed a high emotional intelligence could deal with his / her emotion and face the demand and environmental pressure. Anxiousness in facing retirement is a condition or unhappy condition since worry, nervous, panic, and un-ready in facing retirement signed by somatic, behavior, emotion, and cognitive symptom. Emotional intelligence is an ability to find out and understand self-feeling and somebody else feeling, able to motivate himself / herself, ability to control emotion, defend against frustration {{and work with the}} other people. The research was co-relational research aimed to find out the relation between emotional intelligence with anxiousness in facing retirement. The research was population research with population 27 employees of PTP N XII (Persero) region III located in NGRANGKAH PAWON garden with 52 to 55 years old respondents. Data collection technique used were emotional intelligence scale and anxiousness scale facing retirement and using Product Moment Correlation from Karl Pearson. Data analysis with SPSS (Statistic Program for Special Science) support showed that correlation coefficient (r) = - 0. 598, fault probability (p) = 0. 000, p < 0. 01 and determinant coefficient (r 2) = 0. 358. So that could be concluded that there was significant negative relation between emotional intelligence with anxiousness in facing retirement, which means that higher the emotional intelligence, lower the anxiousness in facing retirement. In the contrary, lower the emotional intelligence, there would be higher anxiousness in facing retirement. The hypothesis was accepted with effective contribution 35. 8...|$|E

The author´s objective is to verify, whether there exists any relationship of the population <b>ageing</b> <b>factors</b> and the GDP growth rate, social expenditures growth rate and the consumption growth rate. Econometric models are based on theoretical specifications of Faruqee´s life-cycle model and Prettner´s R&D model with overlapping generations. The degree of economic development is also taken into account. Furthermore, the author modified the R&D model by incorporation of the poverty indicator and its application on available datasets. The research is focused on five European countries in 1995 - 2013. The Ordinary Least Squares method is used to gain estimated results in regression analyses. The author managed to prove an existing relationship between the old age dependency ratio and the social expenditures in all countries except Switzerland. The impact of the population <b>ageing</b> <b>factor</b> on the consumption growth rate {{turned out to be}} significant in all of those countries.

Young animals were more susceptible than adults and although the most susceptible age varied with the epidemic phase, it corresponded in general with the period of weaning. The influence of physiological status was further indicated by the increased susceptibility incident to lactation. Racial variations in susceptibility were obscured <b>by</b> <b>age</b> <b>factors</b> in young animals, but were of profound importance in the adult population and formed the most significant feature of the analysis. A high degree of conformity was found in the susceptibility of racially related breeds, and this similarity in behavior increased with the proximity of relationship.

40|$|Background: Fluticasone {{propionate}} (FP) Diskus® {{is generally}} regarded as an {{easy to use and}} efficacious inhaled device. This study clinically evaluated whether its easy handling and inhalation process were affected <b>by</b> the <b>aging</b> <b>factor</b> or not, compared with those of the FP Diskhaler® and Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP). Methods: Twenty-four elderly patients with stable moderate asthma (12 aged 65 - 74 years and 12 aged 75 years or older) who were accustomed to using the Diskhaler® were evaluated by measuring the required time for finishing one-time inhalation with the device, compared with 7 patients aged less than 65. Ten elderly patients (5 aged 65 - 74 years, and 5 aged 75 years or older), who used the BDP, were also similarly evaluated and compared with 8 patients aged less than 65. All subjects then switched to use with the Diskus® and the required time for finishing one-time inhalation was measured soon after and 2 weeks after the change. The patients' usage impressions were also questioned. Results: The mean required times (seconds) were significantly different between patients aged 75 years or older, and with patients less than 65 years of age; 45. 8 ± 8. 1 vs. 31. 8 ± 12. 3 (p = 0. 046) in the BDP group, and 56. 8 ± 25. 3 vs. 33. 3 ± 18. 5 (p = 0. 047) in the Diskhaler®, respectively. Soon after changing to the Diskus®, those times became insignificant in both groups. After 2 weeks, the required time for using the Diskus® was significantly shortened in all age groups. 50. 0 % patients in the BDP group and 79. 2 % in the Diskhaler® group finally chose the Diskus®.

However, <b>ageing</b> <b>factors</b> related to the brain and to neural and non-neural ocular structures could {{explain some of the}} previously reported results, in particular the claimed impairment within the koniocellular pathway. This study addressed visual impairment attributable to the magno- (luminance), parvo- (red-green) and koniocellular (blue-yellow) pathways in a population of Parkinson's disease patients. To avoid potentially confounding factors, all subjects underwent a full neurophthalmological assessment which led to exclusion of subjects with increased intraocular pressure, diabetes {{even in the absence of}} retinopathy, and ocular abnormalities (from a total of 72 patients' eyes, 12 were excluded). Both parvo- and koniocellular pathways were studied by means of contrast sensitivity (CS) measurements along protan, tritan and deutan axes and also by fitting chromatic discrimination ellipses using eight measured contrast axes. Magnocellular function was assessed, using stimuli that induce a frequency doubling illusion, in 17 locations in the fovea and periphery. Achromatic (luminance modulation) thresholds were significantly higher in Parkinson's disease both in foveal and peripheral locations. A significant impairment was observed along protan and deutan axes, but only marginally along the tritan axis. These results were corroborated by a significant elongation of chromatic discrimination ellipses in our Parkinson's disease group. Correlation analysis showed that achromatic and chromatic CS measures were independent, which implies that multiple visual pathways are affected independently in Parkinson's disease. Magnocellular impairment was significantly correlated with age and disease stage, in contrast to the measured chromatic deficits. We conclude that in Parkinson's disease, independent damage occurs in the early magno- and parvocellular pathways. Furthermore, traditional koniocellular probing strategies in Parkinson's disease may be confounded <b>by</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>factors,</b> which may reconcile the previously reported controversial findings concerning chromatic impairment in Parkinson's diseas...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{relevance}} of cavernous carotid artery calcification on unenhanced CT scans {{of the brain}} has recently been investigated {{against the backdrop of}} the widespread implementation of coronary artery calcification scoring. We sought to determine whether the degree of cavernous carotid artery calcification correlated with scores of white matter hyperintensity seen on MR images. In so doing, we sought to establish a relative risk for future stroke on the grade of carotid calcification. METHODS: Neuroradiologic findings in 187 patients who underwent CT and MR imaging examinations within 1 month of each other were retrospectively reviewed. The degree of circumfer-ential calcification and thickness of calcification were graded for the cavernous carotid arteries on the basis of CT findings. Using the scale developed by the Cardiovascular Health Study, the white matter was graded for degree of disease on the basis of MR findings. Correlation tests and regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of age, race, and sex on results. RESULTS: Although the cavernous carotid calcification scores and the MR imaging white matter scores showed good correlation (P <. 001), the effect was mediated <b>by</b> <b>age.</b> With <b>age</b> <b>factored</b> in as a covariant, no correlation was shown between CT calcification scores and M...|$|R

40|$|Protein misfolding, whether caused <b>by</b> <b>aging,</b> {{environmental}} <b>factors,</b> or genetic mutations, is {{a common}} basis for neurodegenerative diseases. The misfolding of proteins with abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions causes several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s disease (HD). Although many cellular pathways have been documented to be impaired in HD, the primary triggers of polyQ toxicity remain elusive. We report that yeast cells and neuron-like PC 12 cells expressing polyQ-expanded huntingtin (htt) fragments display a surprisingly specific, immediate, and drastic defect in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -associated degradation (ERAD). We further decipher the mechanistic basis for this defect in ERAD: the entrapment of the essential ERAD proteins Npl 4, Ufd 1, and p 97 by polyQ-expanded htt fragments. In both yeast and mammalian neuron-like cells, overexpression of Npl 4 and Ufd 1 ameliorates polyQ toxicity. Our results establish that impaired ER protein homeostasis is a broad and highly conserved contributor to polyQ toxicity in yeast, in PC 12 cells, and, importantly, in striatal cells expressing full-length polyQ-expanded huntingtin...|$|R

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis is a {{commensal}} bacterium {{of the human}} nasopharynx. In rare cases, it penetrates the mucosa, entering the blood stream and causing various forms of disease. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines can prevent invasive disease not only by direct effect in vaccinated individuals but also by herd protection, preventing acquisition of carriage, which interrupts transmission and leads to protection of unvaccinated persons. In 2010 in Salvador, Brazil, an outbreak of group C meningococcal disease led to a mass meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccination drive, targeting those < 5 and 10 - 24 years of age. The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of and identify factors associated with N. meningitidis carriage among adolescents from Salvador, Brazil, in the post-vaccination period. In spring 2014, we performed a cross-sectional study involving 1, 200 public school students aged 11 - 19 years old. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected to identify N. meningitidis. Of the 59 colonized participants, 36 (61. 0 %) carried non-groupable N. meningitidis, while genogroup B (11. 9 %), Y (8. 5 %), E (6. 8 %), Z (5. 1 %), C (3. 4 %), and W (3. 4 %) were also detected. The overall prevalence of N. meningitidis carriage was 4. 9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 6 - 6. 1 %); the prevalence of N. meningitidis genogroup C was 0. 17 % (95 % CI, 0. 0 - 0. 40 %). There was no difference <b>by</b> <b>age.</b> <b>Factors</b> associated with carriage were having only one, shared, bedroom in the household (PR, 2. 02; 95 % CI, 0. 99 - 4. 12, p = 0. 05); the mother being the only smoker in the home (PR, 2. 48; 95 % CI, 1. 16 - 5. 29; p = 0. 01); and going to pubs/parties more than 5 times/month (PR, 2. 61; 95 % CI, 1. 38 - 4. 92; p = 0. 02).

40|$|Background: Atherosclerosis of {{coronary}} arteries {{is the most}} com-mon cause of myocardial infarction (MI), which is initiated from childhood and progresses gradually <b>by</b> <b>aging.</b> Several risk <b>factors</b> influence its progress, and are categorized as classic, traditional and novel factors. The role of unknown risk factors is becoming increasingly more significant recently. The {{aim of this study}} is to underscore the novel risk factors despite the importance of classic factors and consider these factors for future studies. Methods: This is a prospective study on 180 myocardial infarction cases, conducted in the cardiology ward and CCU of Imam-Reza hospital (Mashad-IRAN). A number of risk factors identified and evaluated in these patients included: hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, activity, stress, hair of external ear canal and ear lobe crease, age, and sex. Then patients without any risk factor o...|$|R
50|$|The Bolognese often {{appears on}} lists of dogs that {{allegedly}} do not shed (moult). It {{is true that}} these dogs do not seasonally moult or lose large amounts of fur as many other breeds do. However, they do eventually lose and replace individual hairs, similar to human hair growth cycles. Each hair grows from a hair follicle, which has a three phase cycle, as do most mammals. These cycles are: anagen, growth of normal hair; catagen growth slows, and hair shaft thins; telegen, hair growth stops, follicle rests, and old hair fall off—is shed. At {{the end of the}} telegen phase, the follicle begins the cycle again. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies <b>by</b> <b>age</b> and other <b>factors.</b> There {{is no such thing as}} a completely non-shedding breed.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities in the {{coagulation}} pathway {{are often}} {{included in the}} diagnostic work-up of stroke patients, especially in young adults with cryptogenic stroke. METHODS: Three common genetic variants within the coagulation cascade were investigated in 500 control subjects and in 167 patients with ischemic stroke defined by TOAST subclassification. Analysed variants were factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210 G [...] >A and factor XIII Val 34 Leu. RESULTS: The factor V Leiden mutation was over-represented in patients with cardioembolic stroke for trend, whereas the prothrombin 20210 G [...] >A variant and the factor XIII polymorphism Val 34 Leu were not associated with stroke of any subtype. The three polymorphisms showed no association with stroke in subgroups of patients defined <b>by</b> <b>age</b> (A and <b>factor</b> XIII Val 34 Leu is not a useful diagnostic procedure in the work-up of ischemic stroke...|$|R
