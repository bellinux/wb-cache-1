5|$|In 2009 the RBS Group {{announced}} that it would divest all 311 RBS <b>branches</b> in England and Wales (until 1985, Williams and Glyn's) together with the seven NatWest <b>branches</b> in Scotland as a standalone business, to comply with European Commission state aid requirements. In August 2010, it was {{announced that}} the <b>branches</b> would be sold to Santander UK, along with the accounts of 1.8million personal customers and 244,000 SME customers. Santander withdrew from the sale in October 2012. On 27 September 2013, the RBS Group confirmed it had agreed to sell 308 RBS <b>branches</b> in England and Wales and 6 NatWest <b>branches</b> in Scotland to the Corsair consortium. This figure was reduced to 307 by May 2015. The <b>branches</b> were to have been separated from the group in 2016 as a standalone business operating under the previously dormant Williams & Glyn's brand.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are <b>branches</b> of {{the common}} carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the cavernous sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two <b>branches,</b> the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These <b>branches</b> travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as <b>branches.</b> The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final <b>branches</b> arise. The middle cerebral arteries send <b>branches</b> along their length.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the trunk and <b>branches,</b> but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off <b>branches,</b> girdling the stem; as a result whole <b>branches</b> may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E

5|$|Cacti show a {{wide variety}} of growth habits, which are {{difficult}} to divide into clear, simple categories. They can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many <b>branches.</b> In the genus Pereskia, the <b>branches</b> are covered with leaves, so the species of this genus may not be recognized as cacti. In most other cacti, the <b>branches</b> are more typically cactus-like, bare of leaves and bark, and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without <b>branches,</b> such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. Cacti may also be described as shrubby, with several stems coming from the ground or from <b>branches</b> very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas {{sometimes}} {{cause damage}} to amenity shrubs and trees, {{mainly in the}} form of scarring left on tree <b>branches</b> where the females laid their eggs. <b>Branches</b> of young trees may die as a result.|$|E
