5|$|Exocomets {{beyond the}} Solar System {{have also been}} {{detected}} and may be common in the Milky Way. The first exocomet system detected was around Beta Pictoris, a very young A-type main-sequence star, in 1987. A total of 10 such exocomet systems have been identified , using the absorption spectrum caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> clouds of gas emitted by comets when passing close to their star.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E
5|$|Amid renewed rumours of an {{impending}} Rhodesian UDI, Smith travelled to meet Wilson in London {{at the start}} of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both the British and the Rhodesians were surprised <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its Twenty-Four Hours evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked this at the last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.|$|E
5|$|By May 1878, {{all three}} Preussen-class ships {{were ready for}} the annual summer {{maneuvers}} of the armored squadron. The three ships were joined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> armored frigate , and operated {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Batsch. Friedrich der Grosse missed the maneuvers after running aground off Nyborg, leaving Batsch just three vessels. While steaming in the English Channel on 31 May, König Wilhelm accidentally rammed Grosser Kurfürst; the latter quickly sank with the loss of between 269 and 276 men. Her loss spurred a series of investigations into the circumstances of the collision, which ultimately resulted in the acquittal of both Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch, the squadron commander, and Count Alexander von Monts, the captain of Grosser Kurfürst. Political infighting over the affair led to ouster of Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner from the navy.|$|E

5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|Following the Norman {{invasion}} of Wales, {{the area around}} the village of Raglan was granted to William FitzOsbern, the Earl of Hereford. Some historians, such as John Kenyon, suspect that an early motte and bailey castle may have been built on the Raglan site during this period: the location had strategic importance and archaeologists have discovered the remains of a possible bailey ditch on the site. The local manor was held by the Bloet family from the late 12th century until the late 14th century, and the family built a manor house somewhere on the site during this period, surrounded by a park. By the late medieval period the Raglan site was surrounded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> deer parks of Home Park and Red Deer Park, the latter being enclosed {{at the end of the}} period.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of Dunedin's settlement, much of the city's growth was on two areas of {{reasonably}} flat land close to the harbour, separated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> Bell Hill and an area of low swampy land. The northern of these two flat areas surrounded the floodplain of the Water of Leith, a small river that runs through Dunedin. As the city grew the swamp was drained to become the new city's centre, and the hill was lowered by excavation to allow access between the two areas of settlement. A street grid was set up with the main road split in two by the city centre (now The Octagon) - Princes Street to the south and George Street to the north. As with many of the city's other place names, both these names and that of the Water of Leith reflect the names of places in Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be confused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra {{has been suggested}} by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E
5|$|Maiden Castle has {{provided}} inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers. In the 1930s, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations {{were carried out}} under Niall Sharples, which added {{to an understanding of}} the site and repaired damage caused in part <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in the canopy of trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E

With the family's finances in jeopardy, Richard travelled regularly to northwest England, where most of his clients were. In 1893 the Pankhursts closed the store and returned to Manchester. They stayed for several months in the seaside town of Southport, then moved briefly {{to the village of}} Disley and finally settled into a house in Manchester's Victoria Park. The girls were enrolled in Manchester Girls' High School, where they felt confined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> student population and strictly regimented schedule.|$|E
5|$|Routes22 and 55 {{continue}} their long curve {{into the town}} of Dover, past the Harlem Valley–Wingdale station next to the road across from the now-closed buildings of Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center. The NY55 concurrency ends when that road heads towards Connecticut at Wingdale. The road continues through Dover Plains and into Amenia, where an overlap with NY343 begins. The railroad line ends at Wassaic, the most distant Metro-North station from the city in direct miles. Route343 remains joined with Route22 into the hamlet of Amenia, where it separates and heads towards state line. At the same junction, US44 comes in from Millbrook to begin an overlap with Route22. The valley opens up as the southern Taconics loom ahead. Shortly after crossing into the Town of North East, the highway passes <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> Coleman Station Historic District.|$|E

His successor, Jahleel Brenton, fought a number of actions against Spanish forces off Gibraltar. Her last captain, Lord Cochrane, forced the surrender {{of a much larger}} Spanish warship, the Gamo. Speedy was finally captured by a powerful French squadron in 1801 and donated to the Papal Navy by Napoleon the following year. She spent five years with them under the name San Paolo, but was struck around 1806.|$|E
