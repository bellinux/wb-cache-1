5|$|A pH {{indicator}} is a {{weak acid}} or weak <b>base</b> <b>that</b> changes colour {{in the transition}} pH range, which is approximately pKa±1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent pKa values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.|$|E

With his third no-hitter in three years, Koufax became only the second pitcher of the modern era (after Bob Feller) to pitch three no-hitters.|$|E

5|$|Amanita onusta, {{commonly}} known as the loaded Lepidella or the gunpowder Lepidella, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of mushrooms. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical, pyramidal, or irregular gray warts. The stipe is whitish-gray with woolly or wart-like veil remnants, and at the base is a spindle- or turnip-shaped <b>base</b> <b>that</b> is rooted somewhat deeply in the soil. The species is distributed in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and may be found growing on the ground in deciduous forests, particularly those with oak, hickory and chestnut. Fruit bodies smell somewhat like bleaching powder, and their edibility is unknown, but possibly toxic.|$|E

A ten-minute black-and-white opening sequence featuring interviews with actual scientists, including Freeman Dyson discussing off-Earth life, was removed after an early screening for MGM executives. The text survives in the book The Making of Kubrick's 2001 by Jerome Agel.|$|E

Hydra double-agent, and S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoner, Grant Ward tells Agent Skye of secret frequencies Hydra uses to communicate, and Agent Billy Koenig intercepts Creel's next directive—to use the family of Brigadier General Glenn Talbot as leverage to find the Obelisk. Agent Melinda May, Skye, Hunter, and Hartley help Talbot fight off Creel, before abducting Talbot and deceiving him into giving them access codes for a U.S. military base near Washington, D.C. that contains numerous confiscated S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.|$|E

5|$|Back in Lisbon, the 'Armed Revolutionary Action' {{branch of}} the Portuguese Communist Party, which {{was created in the}} late 1960s, and the Revolutionary Brigades (BR), a left-wing organisation, worked to resist the colonial wars. They had carried out {{multiple}} sabotages and bombings against military targets, such as the attack on the Tancos air <b>base</b> <b>that</b> destroyed several helicopters on March 8, 1971, and the attack on the NATO headquarters at Oeiras in October of the same year. The attack on the Portuguese ship Niassa illustrated the role of the colonial wars in this unrest. Niassa (named after a Mozambican province) was preparing to leave Lisbon with troops to be deployed in Guinea. By the time of the Carnation Revolution, 100,000 draft dodgers had been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the <b>base</b> <b>that</b> uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives {{the motion of the}} filament, which acts as a propeller.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, {{the remains of the}} king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the <b>base</b> <b>that</b> recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing <b>base</b> <b>that</b> had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
5|$|Capturing one of {{the alien}} troops and {{conducting}} the interrogation reveals vague information about another type of alien called the Outsiders, artificially-created crystalline beings encountered aboard UFOs, that appear to serve as pilots and navigators. Dr. Vahlen then requests that XCOM capture an Outsider for study. Upon capturing {{one of the}}se, the examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave {{in a manner similar}} to antennas, receiving a signal broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth. XCOM dispatches a team to investigate the signal; it is found to be coming from a <b>base</b> <b>that</b> the aliens have secretly established on Earth, where experiments are performed on abducted humans.|$|E

5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus <b>base</b> <b>that</b> there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{original}} concept {{included an}} underground <b>base</b> <b>that</b> connected {{all of the}} levels, but this element was scrapped by publisher Psygnosis due to financial constraints.

Following Walkers launch in February 1993, Dunlop began working on a port for the Mega Drive, which was cancelled shortly thereafter. Glancy was also recruited {{to work on a}} sequel, Walker 2, which would have overhauled the visual quality of the first game and include a customisable mech.
