To {{solve the}} {{difficulty}} and low efficiency of three-dimensional reconstruction of complex spatial form <b>bent</b> <b>tube,</b> a stereo vision method with NURBS curve to achieve three-dimensional reconstruction of <b>bent</b> <b>tube</b> is presented.

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis has been performed for three-dimensional developing turbulent ow in a 180 ◦ bend tube with straight inlet and outlet section used by an algebraic Reynolds stress model. To our knowledge, numerical investigations, which show the detailed comparison between calculated results and experimental data including distributions of Reynolds stresses, {{are few and}} far between. From this point of view, an algebraic Reynolds stress model in conjunction with boundary-tted co-ordinate system is applied to a 180 ◦ bend tube in order to predict the anisotropic turbulent structure precisely. Calculated results are compared with the experimental data including distributions of Reynolds stresses. As a result of this analysis, it has been found that the calculated results show a comparatively good agreement with the experimental data of the time-averaged velocity and the secondary vectors in both the <b>bent</b> <b>tube</b> and straight outlet sections. For example, the location of the maximum streamwise velocity, which appears near the top or bottom wall in the <b>bent</b> <b>tube,</b> is predicted correctly by the present method. As for the comparison of Reynolds stresses, the present method has been found to simulate many characteristic features of streamwise normal stress and shear stresses in the <b>bent</b> <b>tube</b> qualitatively and has a tendency to under-predict its value quantitatively. Judging from the comparison between the calculated and the experimental results, the algebraic Reynolds stress model is applicable to the developing turbulent ow in a <b>bent</b> <b>tube</b> that is known as a ow with a strong convective eect.

40|$|The {{methodology}} and analysis used {{to characterize the}} performance of a sabot/rod as it is subjected to lateral and axial loading during launch is presented. The methodology described incorporates the experimental and numerical portions of the evaluation. Three separate sabot/rod designs are evaluated for their performance in the launch tube and are compared with one another. The experimental portion of the research involved full-scale testing of two separate sabot/rod designs in a 120 -mm launch tube that was slightly bent. When launched through the <b>bent</b> <b>tube,</b> the sabot/rod system was forced to negotiate lateral displacements at axial velocities of approximately 5400 fps. This combination of axial velocity and lateral displacement produced significant lateral loading on the sabot/rod system. A 2. 3 -MeV x-ray unit was used to determine the lateral displacement that occurred as the sabot/rod was forced through the <b>bent</b> <b>tube.</b> After the sabot/rod exited the launch tube, the sabot separation and rod straightness were recorded by four 150 -keV x-ray units. The in-bore radiography experiments used x-ray shielding techniques to reduce x-ray scatter, and layered indexed film and intensifier screens to record the sabot/rod image. The processed film was computer scanned with a microdensitometer and was remapped on the computer to enhance the x-ray image. Results indicated rod lateral displacement accuracy to 0. 007 in. Test results were used to benchmark the numerical analyses used to characterize the in-bore performance of each sabot/rod system studied. The numerical portion of the research involved three-dimensional modeling of the sabot/rod systems in three launch-tube environments: a perfectly straight launch tube, an existing accuracy tube, and the slightly <b>bent</b> <b>tube</b> used in the experimental program. Because of the good agreement between the experimental and numerical models, stress, strain, and displacement time histories were obtained from the numerical work and used to evaluate each of the three sabot/rod systems in three launch environments.

Due {{to the specific}} properties, the bending behaviors of LDTW commercial pure titanium (CP-Ti) tube are much more complex to achieve precise deformation. With the CP-Ti tube of 50. 8 mm (out diameter, D) × 0. 508 mm (wall thickness, t) × 101. 6 mm (bending radius, R) as a representative component, the bending behaviors of LDTW CP-Ti tube under different processing conditions were investigated. With experiments and analytical analysis, the bending characteristics of the CP-Ti tube were identified. Then, based on the orthogonal experimental design, a series of three-dimensional FE models of RDB for LDTW CP-Ti tube were established, {{and the effects of}} processing parameters on the bending behaviors were numerically investigated. The results show that: 1) Wrinkling is the primary behavior for the LDTW CP-Ti tube in RDB, and the larger the difference between the maximum wall thickening and the maximum wall thinning degrees of the <b>bent</b> <b>tube,</b> the larger the wrinkling tendency; 2) The bending behaviors of the LDTW CP-Ti tube are very sensitive to the some processing parameters, and the wrinkling is significantly affected by the mandrel shank diameter, while the wall thinning is remarkably affected by the clearance between wiper die and tube, mandrel shank diameter.

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} instabilities of long thin elastic tubes. Both initially {{straight and}} initially <b>bent</b> <b>tubes</b> are analyzed under in-plane bending. Tube response, {{a combination of}} ovalization instability and bifurcation instability (buckling), is investigated using a nonlinear finite element (FE) technique, which employs polynomial functions in the longitudinal tube direction and trigonometric functions to describe cross-sectional deformation. It is demonstrated that {{the interaction between the}} two instability modes depends on the value and the sign of the initial tube curvature. The ovalization of initially <b>bent</b> <b>tubes</b> is examined in detail and, in particular, the case of opening moments. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes on bifurcation instability. It is shown that buckling may occur prior to or beyond the ovalization limit point, depending on the value of the initial curvature. Using the nonlinear FE formulation, the location of bifurcation on the primary path is detected, post-buckling equilibrium paths are traced, and the corresponding wavelengths of the buckled configurations are calculated. Moreover, results over a wide range of initial curvature values are presented, extending the findings of previous works. Finally, several analytical approaches, introduced in previous research works, are also employed to estimate the moments causing ovalization and bifurcation instability. These approaches are based on nonlinear flexible shell theory or simplified ring analysis. The efficiency and accuracy of those analytical methods with respect to the nonlinear FE formulation are examined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
