40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} two {{periodic}} review inventory models which primarily differ {{in terms of}} how <b>backordering</b> cost is charged: time-independent <b>backordering</b> (TIB) model where the <b>backordering</b> cost is charged per unit <b>backordered</b> and is independent of the length of time for which <b>backorders</b> persist; and the time-dependent <b>backordering</b> (TDB) model where the <b>backordering</b> cost is charged {{based on the number of}} <b>backorders</b> as well as the length of time for which they are on the books (i. e., it is charged per unit per unit time). Our objective is to investigate the impact of these two different <b>backordering</b> cost structures on the optimal decisions of a firm in a stochastic and price-sensitive demand environment. In order to do so, we first develop a general framework, where both such costs exist, in a profit maximizing context. Subsequently, we analyze two special cases of this general framework with either one of the costs [...] that is, TIB and TDB models [...] and derive some analytical results regarding the values and behavior of the optimal decisions for both of them. We then concentrate on comparing the two models through extensive numerical experiments. Our investigation demonstrates that the TIB model generally results in longer review periods and lower retail prices. As far as the base stock level is concerned, we show that it can be higher in either setting; however, the safety stock is considerably lower for the TIB model. Lastly, indeed if a firm's <b>backordering</b> cost is indeed time-dependent, then use of the TIB model for making decisions results in significant profit penalty under most market/operating conditions (specifically for innovative products), except when demand uncertainty and/or the <b>backordering</b> cost are quite low (i. e., for mature, commodity products).

The first Osborne 1 shipped in July 1981, and its low price set market {{expectations}} for bundled {{hardware and software}} packages for several years to come. The company sold 11,000 Osborne 1s in the eight months after its July 1981 debut, with 50,000 more on <b>backorder,</b> although the early units had a 10 to 15% failure rate.

Osborne had difficulty meeting demand, and the company grew from two employees, Osborne and Felsenstein, to 3,000 people and $73 million in revenue in 12 months. The growth was so rapid that, in one case, an executive who returned from a one-week trade show had to search two buildings to find her relocated staff. The company announced in October 1982 a temporary bundling of Ashton-Tate's dBase II, increasing demand so much that production reached 500 units a day and severely diminishing quality control.|$|E
5000|$|The {{business}} of registering the domain names {{as they are}} deleted by the registries is known as drop catching. It is a highly competitive business. The main operators in this business typically set up a number of front companies as registrars. VeriSign, {{in the case of}} TLDs COM and NET, allows each registrar a slice of the resources that may be used to register dropped domains. VeriSign drops domains in a random order, giving registrars only a vague idea of the particular drop time of a particular domain. Sometimes a group of drop registrars often work in confederation to increase their possibility of registering a dropped domain immediately after it is deleted by the registry. [...] If the domain is caught by a confederation of registrars attempting to fulfill a domain <b>backorder,</b> then whichever domain registrar caught the domain will register it to the entity who backordered the domain. If the newly reregistered domain is captured by a company that has no customers who backordered it, the domain may be auctioned to the highest bidder by the registrar who captured it or an auction intermediary. The time between a drop and a capture is often measured in seconds or fractions thereof.|$|E

40|$|All intensively {{studied and}} widely applied {{inventory}} control policies satisfy demand {{in accordance with}} the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) rule, whether this demand is in <b>backorder</b> or not. Interestingly, this rule is sub-optimal when the fill-rate is constrained or when the <b>backorder</b> cost structure includes fixed costs per <b>backorder</b> and costs per <b>backorder</b> per unit time. In this paper we study the degree of sub-optimality of the FCFS rule for inventory systems controlled by the well-known base-stock policy. As an alternative to the FCFS rule, we propose and analyze a class of generalized base-stock policies that reserve some maximum number of items in stock for future demands, even if backorders exist.
