40|$|Biofuels are {{expected}} to {{play a significant role}} in the quest for greener energy generation. In this perspective, esters produced from biomass are promising candidates. This work presents the first computational kinetic study on n-butyl formate (BF) oxidation under combustion conditions coupled to an experimental study in a jet-stirred reactor. Absolute rate constants for hydrogen abstraction reactions by the OH radical were calculated using the G 3 //MP 2 /aug-cc-pVDZ model chemistry, in conjunction with statistical rate theory (TST). Subsequently, the fate of the <b>butyl</b> <b>formate</b> radicals was also investigated by calculating absolute rate constants for combustion relevant decomposition channels such as β-scission and hydrogen transfer reactions. The derived rate expressions were used in the presently developed detailed kinetic mechanism, which was validated over experimental data obtained in a jet-stirred reactor at 10 atm and for three different mixtures (φ = 0. 45, 0. 9, and 1. 8). Rate of production analyses were finally used to understand the oxidation kinetics of <b>butyl</b> <b>formate</b> over the temperature range of 500 – 1300 K and highlighted the importance of the unimolecular decomposition reactions of the fuel, producing formic acid and 1 -butene...|$|E
40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{area for a}} liquid–liquid system has been determined by the chemical reaction method. The saponification of <b>butyl</b> <b>formate</b> ester with 8 M sodium hydroxide {{has been used to}} this end. A correlation has been derived to describe the mole flux of ester through the interface and the kinetic rate constants have been calculated. For a continuously operated reactor a correlation has been derived for both reaction in the dispersed phase as well as reaction in the continuous phase. A viscosity factor had to be incorporated to obtain one single correlation for the Sauter mean drop diameter. The validation for this chemically enhanced reaction regime is presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} {{protection of}} one of two identical functional groups in symmetrical positions in a molecule, is an important goal in organic synthesis. In this area the preparation of monoesters of symmetrical diacids represents an important challenge, mainly when the cyclic anhydrides are not readily available. Dicarboxylic acids can be monoprotected by reaction with diazomethane or dimethyl sulfate {{in the presence of}} alumina or silica gel [1]; the transesterification approach, utilizing <b>butyl</b> <b>formate</b> in octane, is also used [2]. Here, preliminary studies concerning the monoesterification of adipic acid with methanol are reported. The reaction was tested with some commercial Al 2 O 3 powders and an ordered mesoporous alumina prepared by a surfactant assisted synthesis. The Al 2 O 3 catalysts were characterized by different techniques including nitrogen physisorption at 77 K, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD) and DRIFT-IR spectroscopy. The reaction, carried out at RT for 22 hrs, affords the adipic acid monomethyl ester in 57 % yield and 95 % selectivity. The effect of the catalyst amount {{and the role of the}} water will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the predominating lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in a spontaneous fermented wheat sourdough. At the same time, an investigation towards volatile compounds that were produced was also carried out. Lactobacillus plantarum has been identified as the dominant species of lactobacilli with characters of a facultative heterofermentative strain. The generated volatile compounds that were produced during spontaneous fermentation were isolated by solvent extraction method, analysed by gas chromatography (GC), and identified by mass spectrophotometer (MS). Butyric acid has been found to be the main volatile compound with relative abundance of 6. 75 % and acetic acid at relative abundance of 3. 60 %. Esters that were formed at relatively low amount were <b>butyl</b> <b>formate</b> (1. 23 %) and cis 3 hexenyl propionate (0. 05 %). Butanol was also found at low amount with relative abundance of 0. 60 %. The carbohydrate metabolism of Lactobacillus plantarum may contributed to the production of acetic acid in this study via further catabolism activity on lactic acid that was produced. However, butyric acid was not the major product via fermentation by LAB but mostly carried out by the genus Clostridium via carbohydrate metabolism which needs further investigatio...|$|E
40|$|Alkane-grown {{cells of}} Mycobacterium vaccae JOB 5 cometabolically degrade the {{gasoline}} oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) through {{the activities of}} an alkane-inducible monooxygenase and other enzymes in the alkane oxidation pathway. In this study we {{examined the effects of}} MTBE on the MTBE-oxidizing activity of M. vaccae JOB 5 grown on diverse nonalkane substrates. Carbon-limited cultures were grown on glycerol, lactate, several sugars, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, both in the presence and absence of MTBE. In all MTBE-containing cultures, MTBE consumption occurred and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) and tertiary <b>butyl</b> <b>formate</b> accumulated in the culture medium. Acetylene, a specific inactivator of alkane- and MTBE-oxidizing activities, fully inhibited MTBE consumption and product accumulation but had no other apparent effects on culture growth. The MTBE-dependent stimulation of MTBE-oxidizing activity in fructose- and glycerol-grown cells was saturable with respect to MTBE concentration (50 % saturation level = 2. 4 to 2. 75 mM), and the onset of MTBE oxidation in glycerol-grown cells was inhibited by both rifampin and chloramphenicol. Other oxygenates (TBA and tertiary amyl methyl ether) also induced the enzyme activity required for their own degradation in glycerol-grown cells. Presence of MTBE also promoted MTBE oxidation in cells grown on organic acids, compounds that are often found in anaerobic, gasoline-contaminated environments. Experiments with acid-grown cells suggested induction of MTBE-oxidizing activity by MTBE is subject to catabolite repression. The results of this study are discussed in terms of their potential implications towards our understanding of the role of cometabolism in MTBE and TBA biodegradation in gasoline-contaminated environments...|$|E

The temperature, T, and pressure, p, dependence of the isobaric heat capacity, C-p, for three pure alcohols and the temperature dependence at atmospheric pressure of the excess heat capacity, C-p(E), for four alcohol + ester mixtures have been measured. The branched alcohols were 3 -pentanol, 3 -methyl- 3 -pentanol, and 3 -ethyl- 3 -pentanol, and the mixtures were 1 -butanol and 3 -methyl- 3 -pentanol mixed with propyl acetate and with <b>butyl</b> <b>formate.</b> These data, together with literature data for alcohol + n-alkane and alcohol + toluene mixtures, have been analyzed using the TSAM. The model, originally formulated for the C-p of pure liquids, has been extended here {{to account for the}} C-p(E) of mixtures. To evaluate its performance, quantum mechanical ab initio calculations for the H-bond energy, {{which is one of the}} model parameters, were performed. The effect of pressure on C-p for pure liquids was elucidated, and the variety of (T) behaviors was rationalized. Furthermore, from the C-p data at various pressures, the behavior of the volume temperature derivative, (partial derivative V/partial derivative T) (p), was inferred, with the existence of a (partial derivative V/partial derivative T) (p) versus T maximum for pure associated liquids such as the branched alcohols being predicted.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate the remediation of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) and other organics in groundwater by applying photocatalysis as an in-situ process. Photocatalytic degradations of MTBE and some other organics pollutants were proved to be possible. Experimental results suggest that photocatalytic degradation is accurately described by first order kinetics. The efficiency of photocatalytic degradation was expressed as the rate constant or the quantum yield. It was found that complete photocatalytic degradation of MTBE was only possible under aerobic conditions. Intermediates, such as Tertiary <b>Butyl</b> <b>Formate</b> (TBF) and acetone were found in oxygen-limiting photocatalytic degradation of MTBE. It was experimentally deduced that the rate constant of photocatalytic degradation was linearly proportional to the light irradiance and illuminated catalyst surface and inversely proportional to the reactor volume. The quantum yields of photocatalytic degradation of 100 mg/L MTBE solution in the five reactors were measured as 0. 23 % to 0. 71 %. The equilibrium adsorption of MTBE on TiO 2 was found to be a linear isotherm. Flow experiments were conducted by circulating MTBE solution between one of the designed reactors and a reservoir. It was found that the reduction of pollutant was a function of the circulation rate, reactor volume and the batch rate constant of photocatalytic degradation in the reactor. Some soil experiments were conducted using one of the designed reactors, which was an underground reactor and some corresponding modelling was done to simulate the transport of MTBE under different flow regimes. It was found that pumping and regional flow facilitated the exchange of water between the reactor and the surrounding soil. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas mendocina KR- 1 grew well on toluene, n-alkanes (C 5 to C 8), and 1 ° {{alcohols}} (C 2 to C 8) but not {{on other}} aromatics, gaseous n-alkanes (C 1 to C 4), isoalkanes (C 4 to C 6), 2 ° alcohols (C 3 to C 8), methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), or tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA). Cells grown under carbon-limited conditions on n-alkanes {{in the presence of}} MTBE (42 μmol) oxidized up to 94 % of the added MTBE to TBA. Less than 3 % of the added MTBE was oxidized to TBA when cells were grown on either 1 ° alcohols, toluene, or dextrose in the presence of MTBE. Concentrated n-pentane-grown cells oxidized MTBE to TBA without a lag phase and without generating tertiary <b>butyl</b> <b>formate</b> (TBF) as an intermediate. Neither TBF nor TBA was consumed by n-pentane-grown cells, while formaldehyde, the expected C 1 product of MTBE dealkylation, was rapidly consumed. Similar Ks values for MTBE were observed for cells grown on C 5 to C 8 n-alkanes (12. 95 ± 2. 04 mM), suggesting that the same enzyme oxidizes MTBE in cells grown on each n-alkane. All growth-supporting n-alkanes (C 5 to C 8) inhibited MTBE oxidation by resting n-pentane-grown cells. Propane (Ki = 53 μM) and n-butane (Ki = 16 μM) also inhibited MTBE oxidation, and both gases were also consumed by cells during growth on n-pentane. Cultures grown on C 5 to C 8 n-alkanes also exhibited up to twofold-higher levels of growth in the presence of propane or n-butane, whereas no growth stimulation was observed with methane, ethane, MTBE, TBA, or formaldehyde. The results are discussed in terms of their impacts on our understanding of MTBE biodegradation and cometabolism...|$|E
40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau d'Enginyeria Química, Facultat de Química, Universitat de Barcelona, Curs: 2015 - 2016, Tutores: Montserrat Iborra Urios i Eliana Ramírez RangelBiomass is {{the only}} {{renewable}} resource on the earth that can derive liquid fuel and fine chemicals to replace the petroleum-based chemicals. In recent years, the development of bioenergy concerning the synthesis of levulinate esters from biomass via chemical/catalytic process has attracted more and more interests, and extensive research is being carried out worldwide. Levulinate esters, like methyl levulinate, ethyl levulinate, and butyl levulinate, {{are a kind of}} important intermediates and energy chemicals having high reactivity and widespread application in many fields. Alkyl levulinates are proposed as oxygenates of potential interest as diesel fuel components. In blends with commercial gasoil {{it has been shown that}} cold flow properties of blends are substantially upgraded and particulate emissions greatly decrease. These green diesel fuel enhancers can be synthesized by the acid catalysed reaction of levulinic acid with alcohol 32. Direct conversion of carbohydrates to levulinate esters using solid acids such as NaY, #$%/ZrO 2, # $%/TiO 2, are described in the literature, but direct conversion of fructose to esters of levulinic acid using ion-exchange resins has never been attempted to the best of our knowledge. In this study, the catalytic performances of ion-exchange resins (Dowex 50 Wx 2, Dowex 50 Wx 4, Amberlyst 39, Amberlyst 16, Amberlyst 15) in the direct conversion of carbohydrates such as fructose to butyl levulinate in butanol-water media were investigated. With temperature above 100 ºC, almost 100 % of fructose conversion was obtained irrespective of the catalyst employed. However, different catalysts showed different activity and selectivity towards the production of butyl levulinate. Among these catalysts employed, gel-type resins (especially Dowex 50 Wx 2) were found to be a type of potential catalysts for prospective utilization, which showed the highest selectivity and yield to butyl levulinate. The catalyst range assayed showed spurious effect on the reaction rates. The higher temperatures led to higher reaction rates but also presented higher formation of by-products such as <b>butyl</b> <b>formate</b> and BMF. Although, no humins were detected during the investigation. Catalysts with less degree of cross-linking present higher selectivity towards levulinate esters. The reuse of Dowex 50 Wx 2, after reconditioning them with deionised water and methanol, showed lesser catalytic activity after each use due to the loss of acid sites above the surface of catalyst, providing less catalytic activity for the reaction. Overall, this study indicated that acidic ion-exchange resins are promising catalysts for the direct production of levulinate esters from fructose and can be employed for the large-scale synthesis of butyl levulinate from renewable carbohydrates in the futur...|$|E
