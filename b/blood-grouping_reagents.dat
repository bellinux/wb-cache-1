Laboratories titrated reconstituted 99 / 836, in parallel with as many commercial anti-D <b>blood-grouping</b> <b>reagents</b> as were available to them, in tube tests according to specified haemagglutination methodology for low-protein (e. g. monoclonal IgM) and high-protein (e. g. polyclonal) reagents. The ratios of the mean end-point titres of the reagents to that of 99 / 836 within each laboratory were calculated. The ratios of the mean titres of the low-protein reagents to the mean titre of 99 / 836 within a laboratory fell between 0. 25 and 2 for 43 of the 45 low-protein anti-D reagents tested (i. e. the potencies of the low-protein reagents compared with 99 / 836 were between a 1 : 4 dilution of 99 / 836 to twice as potent as 99 / 836). The ratios of the mean titres of the high-protein reagents to the mean titre of 99 / 836 within a laboratory fell within 0. 125 and 1 for eight out of the 10 high protein reagents tested. By international consensus, a 1 : 3 dilution of reconstituted 99 / 836 was deemed appropriate to define a recommended minimum acceptable potency of low-protein anti-D <b>blood-grouping</b> <b>reagents.</b> A 1 : 8 dilution of reconstituted 99 / 836 was deemed appropriate to define a recommended minimum acceptable potency of high-protein anti-D <b>blood-grouping</b> <b>reagents.</b> On the basis of the results presented here, 99 / 836 was established by the World Health Organization as the 1 st International Standard for specifying the minimum potency of anti-D <b>blood-grouping</b> <b>reagents,</b> in tube test...|$|E
