Seropositivity in pigs was determined in 760 <b>blood</b> <b>serums,</b> or in 2. 17 %.

Moreover, the coefficients between paired results for <b>blood</b> lead and <b>serum</b> creatinine and <b>blood</b> lead and <b>serum</b> urea nitrogen were positively statistically significant (<b>serum</b> creatinine vs. <b>blood</b> lead, r = 0. 35, p < 0. 05; serum urea nitrogen vs. blood lead, r = 0. 48, p < 0. 05). With respect to the effects of sex and age on the <b>blood</b> lead, <b>serum</b> creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen levels, data analysis revealed there was a tendency for higher <b>blood</b> lead, <b>serum</b> creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen levels in females than in males, and the levels of <b>blood</b> lead, <b>serum</b> creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen increased among older residents.

5|$|B. bufo {{is part of}} {{a species}} complex, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are {{believed}} to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (B. spinosus), the Caucasian toad (B. verrucosissimus) and the Japanese common toad (B. japonicus). The European common toad (Bufobufo) seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred {{as a result of the}} development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A serological investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the <b>blood</b> <b>serum</b> proteins of Bufoverrucosissimus and Bufospinosus. It found that the differences between the two were not significant and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom {{for a long period of}} time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom. The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the <b>blood</b> <b>serum.</b> In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E

While the {{potential}} toxicity of metals in humans is a well-established fi eld of research, {{there are few}} studies that examine circulating concentrations of metals in large population-based samples. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze levels of heavy metals and trace elements in both whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> in an elderly population, and to examine if gender, kidney function, haemoglobin or serum albumin could impact the distribution of metals between whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum.</b> Methods. Whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> samples from 1016 70 -year-olds living in Uppsala, Sweden, were analyzed for aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, chromium, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead, and zinc using inductively coupled plasma-sector fi eld mass spectrometry (ICP-SFMS). Distribution between whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> was evaluated by the ratio between whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> concentration (B/S-ratio). Results.

The highest B/S-ratios were found for lead (27), zinc (9), manganese (6), and nickel (4). Copper (0. 86), cobalt (0. 84), and molybdenum (0. 86) showed B/S-ratios 1. Especially the B/S-ratios for chromium, mercury and nickel correlated with kidney function (GFR) (r 0. 21, 0. 21 and 0. 36 respectively, p 0. 0001). Conclusions. The distribution between whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> varied considerably for different metals.

The median concentration of W in blood was < 0. 2 mug/l (below the detection limit) and in serum 0. 087 mug/l. The median concentrations of Cd, Rh, Pd, Pt and TI were below the detection limits. Statistically significant correlations were found between the concentrations in <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> for Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, W, Hg and Pb.

40|$|Metal ions {{generated}} from joint replacements are {{a cause for}} concern. There is no consensus on the best surrogate measure of metal ion exposure, and both <b>serum</b> and whole <b>blood</b> measurements are used in clinical practice. This study provides a guideline for interpretation of metal ion analysis in clinical practice. In a prospective trial comparing hip resurfacing (HR) with a conventional metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty (THA) cobalt and chromium levels were determined for whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> in 343 paired samples at regular intervals up to 24 months postoperatively. Cobalt whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> levels increased significantly after both procedures. Cobalt concentrations were significantly higher for the HR group compared to the THA group, at 3, 6 and 12 months, for whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum.</b> At 24 months cobalt levels decreased and differences between HR and THA were no longer significant. In contrast, chromium whole blood levels remained significantly higher for HR until 24 months. Whole <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> levels {{could not be used}} interchangeably. The mean differences for cobalt and chromium between <b>blood</b> and <b>serum</b> values were + 0. 13 microg/L and - 0. 91 microg/L respectively.

Cobalt and chromium levels were significantly higher for HR versus THA, especially during the run-in phase of one year. Overall, the metal ion levels were well below 5 microg/L.
