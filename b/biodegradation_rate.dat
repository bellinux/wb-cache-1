50|$|As {{biodiesel}} {{becomes more}} widely used, {{it is important}} to consider how consumption affects water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Research examining the biodegradability of different biodiesel fuels found that all of the biofuels studied (including Neat Rapeseed oil, Neat Soybean oil, and their modified ester products) were “readily biodegradable” compounds, and had a relatively high <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rate</b> in water. Additionally, the presence of biodiesel can increase the rate of diesel biodegradation via co-metabolism. As the ratio of biodiesel is increased in biodiesel/diesel mixtures, the faster the diesel is degraded. Another study using controlled experimental conditions also showed that fatty acid methyl esters, the primary molecules in biodiesel, degraded much faster than petroleum diesel in sea water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{theoretical}} {{analysis was}} performed to examine the role of naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) enzymes in determining differences in biodegradability and <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rates</b> of two- to four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via oxy-genation and desaturation reactions. Investigation of the thermodynamics of PAH biodegradation reactions catalyzed by NDO revealed that enthalpies of reaction can explain reaction patterns or regioselectivity of the enzyme in limited cases. Molecular modeling analysis of {{the size and shape}} constraints of PAH–enzyme interactions suggests that PAHs bigger than approximately four rings and compounds with a substituents or other structural features contributing to increased width {{at the end of the}} substrate near the active site are expected to have binding difficulties. This explains some regioselectivity observations, in that thermody-namically favorable sites on some PAH molecules cannot be positioned correctly to be oxidized at the active site. The enzyme fit analysis also suggests that slower <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rates</b> are expected for compounds with larger widths because of the unique positioning that is required for reaction to occur. An inverse relationship between a molecular descriptor of compound width and previously obtained <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rates</b> suggests that this descriptor may be valuable for predicting relative <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rates</b> of PAHs with dioxygenases other than NDO.

40|$|LNAPLs are {{a common}} {{contaminant}} in the environment. When a LNAPL infiltrates the soil, it leaves behind a trail of immobile ganglia in the pore spaces. When the groundwater table is reached, the LNAPL forms a film {{on top of the}} groundwater, where it generally migrates laterally, subjected to the groundwater flow. LNAPLs are toxic to humans by ingestion, adsorption through skin and inhalation. The combination of mobility and toxicity classify the contamination as a high risk. However, soil microorganisms are able to remediate LNAPLs. The rate of this remediation depends on several factors like temperature, soil moisture content, initial concentration and soil type. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the impacts of the environmental factors on the rate of bioremediation of a LNAPL. The BTEX component toluene was used as a representative for this group of contaminants. Numerous batch experiments were performed under controlled conditions to reach these objectives.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{potential}} impact of plant species richness on ecosystems, we studied non-additive effects of different plant litters on the <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rate</b> of dissolved organic matter (DOM) when mixing plant leaf-derived DOM derived from different plant species. A full factorial biodegradation experiment (31 possible singular and multiple combinations of five litter type-derived DOM sources) was conducted using plant litters from the five most abundant plant species in a subtropical watershed ecosystem, from which dissolved organic carbon (DOC) disappearance was measured. Loss of DOC over time was considered biodegradable DOC. We tested whether DOM diversity, measured as source species richness and composition, would affect biodegradation rates. Overall, we found significant non-additive (synergistic) effects of DOM diversity on biodegradation rates of DOM, which were explained both by plant species richness and composition. Across all treatments, a significantly higher <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rate</b> was correlated with the presence of DOM from higher nitrogen (N) containing plant litters; conversely, the presence of lower N decreased these rates. The N content and chemical characteristic of DOM might influence the magnitude of the synergistic effect. Our results suggest that loss of plant litter species diversity would not affect DOC <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rate,</b> provided that at least two species are conserved. However, the variability in DOC <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rate</b> across the treatments decreased with increased DOM diversity at three incubation time points. Our results also indicate that in an ecosystem with low plant biodiversity, loss of key species such as Lophostemon confertus could reduce the synergistic effects on DOC <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rate.</b> No Full Tex...|$|E

Using {{a combination of}} static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS), we characterized the resultant nanoparticles and studied their biodegradation {{in the presence of}} enzyme lipase PS. The results revealed that the <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rate</b> was mainly dependent on the enzyme concentration. The scattering intensity decreased as the degradation proceeded, but there was no change in size of the remaining nanopar-ticles, indicating that the degradation of each particle was fast and the enzyme con-sumed the nanoparticles individually.

Phenol accumulated to concentrations higher than those in controls only in the 2 CP consortium with added Cu(II) at 1. 2 ppm but was subsequently degraded. There was no effect on benzoate, and little effect on acetate intermediates was observed. In most cases, methane yields were reduced by 23 to 97 %. Thus, dehalogenation, aromatic degradation, and methanogenesis in these anaerobic consortia showed differential sensitivities to the heavy metal ions added. These data indicate {{that the presence of}} heavy metals can affect the outcome of anaerobic bioremediation of aromatic pollutants. In addition, a potential exists to use combinations of anaerobic bacterial species to bioremediate sites contaminated with both heavy metals and aromatic pollutants...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly the utilization of biological processes in the bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soils. In this regard, the effects of the contaminant bioavailability and the redox environment on the biodegradation process have been investigated. First, the mineralization of naphthalene in soil/water systems under denitrifying conditions has been studied. Results showed that naphthalene mineralization is influenced by its availability to the microbial population, which in turn {{is a function of the}} compound initial concentration, the sorption/desorption characteristics of the soil/contaminant complex and the organic content of the soil. Second, the biodegradation of four PAH compounds, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, fluorene and anthracene, in a soil/water system under four redox environments has been studied. Both aerobic and denitrifying environments supported appreciable PAH <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rates.</b> The denitrifying environment was chosen for a further experiment to investigate the performance of a bioreactor system in treating PAH-contaminated soils. Results showed that by enlarging the scale of the reactor by approximately eight times and simultaneously reducing the mixing intensity of the soil slurry, the <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rates</b> of the PAH compounds remained virtually unchanged...|$|R
40|$|The US Department of Energy and the Institute for Ecology of Industrial Areas of Poland {{demonstrated}} bioremediation {{techniques for}} the clean up of acidic petroleum sludge impacted soils at an oil refinery in southern Poland. The waste {{was composed of}} high molecular weight paraffinic and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Benzo(a) pyrene and BTEX compounds were identified as the contaminants of concern. Approximately 3, 300 m 3 of contaminated soil (TPH ~ 30, 000 ppm) was targeted for treatment. A biopile design which employed a combination of passive and active aeration in conjunction with nutrient and surfactant application was used to increase the biodegradation of the contaminants of concern. Over the 20 month project, more than 81 % (120 metric tons) of petroleum hydrocarbons were biodegraded. Despite the fact the material treated was highly weathered and very acidic, <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rates</b> of 121 mg/kg soil/day in the actively aerated side (82 mg/kg soil/day in the passive side) were achieved in this biopile. Microbial counts and dehydrogenase measurements gave the best correlation with the <b>biodegradation</b> <b>rates.</b> Costs were competitive or significantly lower when compared with other ex situ treatment processes. 2...|$|R
