5|$|In contrast, the {{grooming}} hypothesis {{emphasized that}} all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly {{suited for the}} mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote <b>bacterial</b> <b>growth</b> and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more {{important role in the}} use of the toothcomb than food procurement.|$|E
5|$|Several {{measures}} {{can be taken}} to control infection in aquaculture once an S.iniae outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce mortality rates, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the fish stock increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress to fish and inhibit <b>bacterial</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>growth</b> follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent <b>bacterial</b> <b>growth.</b> There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E

In 1976 Edward Shortliffe, the developer of the MYCIN system, reported a number of serious problems with the prescribing of antibiotics [1, p 41 - 44]. These included overprescribing, prescribing of inappropriate antibiotics and prescribing of inappropriate dosages. There is little evidence that the situation has improved since then. In some respects the current situation is worse. Due in part to inappropriate use of antibiotics many strains of bacter [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The ethanol {{produced}} through fermentation acts as {{an important}} co-solvent to the non-polar compound that water cannot dissolve, such as pigments from grape skins, giving wine varieties their distinct color, and other aromatics.

40|$|Betamethasone is an {{anti-inflammatory}} steroid drug used {{in case of}} anaphylactic and allergic reactions, of Alzheimer and Addison {{diseases and}} in soft tissue injuries. It modulates gene expression for anti-inflammatory activity suppressing the immune system response. This latter effect might decrease the effectiveness of immune system response against microbial infections. Corticosteroids, in fact, mask some symptoms of infection and during their use may occur superimposed infections. Thus the use of glucocorticoids in patients with sepsis remains extremely controversial. In this study we analyzed the in vitro effect of commercially formulation of betamethasone (Bentelan) on several Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria of clinical relevance. It {{is found to be}} an inhibitor of the growth of most of the strains examined. Also the effect of betamethasone in combination with some classes of antibiotics was evaluated. Antibiotic-steroid combination therapy is, in such cases, superior to antibiotic-alone treatment to impair <b>bacterial</b> <b>growths.</b> Such effect was essentially not observable at all on Staphylococcus aureus or Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of automated visual inspection systems generally involves a time consuming investigation of appropriate preprocessing and filtering techniques, {{a search for}} `good' features and selection of a suitable classifier for the feature vectors.

We have compared these two approaches on the problem of detecting <b>bacterial</b> <b>growths</b> on microbiology plates.
