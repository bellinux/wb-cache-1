5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Written by James Follett, this {{involved}} monsters {{attacking a}} race of beings who live inside Halley's Comet, unaware that there is anything beyond it they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> world is the sum and total of the universe. Into the Comet would have used the companions of Romana and K9. Follett was a novelist who pitched this idea to script editor Douglas Adams circa September 1979 when they met up and discussed the forthcoming return of Halley's Comet. Unfortunately the storyline was rejected by Adams. Follett resubmitted Into the Comet to new script editor Christopher H. Bidmead around May 1980, but once again the storyline was not pursued.|$|E

5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E

25|$|Perceived {{organizational}} support (POS) is {{the degree}} to which employees <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being and fulfills socioemotional needs. POS is generally thought to be the organization's contribution to a positive reciprocity dynamic with employees, as employees tend to perform better to reciprocate received rewards and favorable treatment. This idea bloomed from Eisenberger and Rhoades' organizational support theory.|$|E

Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns, but others are original Rasta creations.|$|E
25|$|Stanford University {{political}} scientist Professor Rob Reich wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can probably result in biased students, as many homeschooling parents view {{the education of}} their children as a matter properly under their control and no one else's. He also claims that most parents choose to educate their children at home because they <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> children's moral and spiritual needs will not be met in campus-based schools.|$|E

25|$|A {{study by}} Masao Matsuhashi and Mark Hallett, {{published}} in 2008, {{claims to have}} replicated Libet's findings without relying on subjective report or clock memorization {{on the part of}} participants. The authors <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> method can identify the time (T) at which a subject becomes aware of his own movement. Matsuhashi and Hallet argue that this time not only varies, but often occurs after early phases of movement genesis have already begun (as measured by the readiness potential). They conclude that a person's awareness cannot be the cause of movement, and may instead only notice the movement.|$|E
25|$|Most Hasidim {{use some}} {{variation}} of Nusach Sefard, {{a blend of}} Ashkenazi and Sephardi liturgies, based on the innovations of Rabbi Isaac Luria. Many dynasties have their own specific adaptation of Nusach Sefard; some, such as the versions of the Belzer, Bobover, and Dushinsky Hasidim, are closer to Nusach Ashkenaz, while others, such as the Munkacz version, are closer to the old Lurianic. Many sects <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> version reflects Luria's mystical devotions best. The Baal Shem Tov added two segments to Friday services {{on the eve of}} Sabbath: Psalm 107 before afternoon prayer, and Psalm 23 at the end of evening service.|$|E
25|$|Locus {{of control}} is a salient factor in the {{successful}} academic performance of students. During the 1970s and '80s, Cassandra B. Whyte did significant educational research studying locus of control as related to the academic achievement of students pursuing higher education coursework. Much of her educational research and publications focused upon the theories of Julian B. Rotter {{in regard to the}} importance of internal control and successful academic performance. Whyte reported that individuals who perceive and <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> hard work may lead to more successful academic outcomes, instead of depending on luck or fate, persist and achieve academically at a higher level. Therefore, it is important to provide education and counseling in this regard.|$|E

25|$|Many Korean Christians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> {{values have}} had a {{positive}} effect on various social relationships. Traditional Korean society was hierarchically arranged according to Confucian principles under the semi-divine emperor. Women had no social rights, children were totally subservient to their parents, and individuals had no rights except as defined by the overall social system. This structure was challenged by the Christian teaching that all human beings are created in the image of God and thus that every one of them is equal and has essential worth. According to Kim Han-sik, this concept also supported the idea of property being owned by individuals rather than by families (or by the heads of families).|$|E
25|$|Chinese alchemy {{was closely}} {{connected}} to Taoist forms of traditional Chinese medicine, such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion, and to martial arts such as Tai Chi Chuan and Kung Fu (although some Tai Chi schools <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> art {{derives from the}} philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not Alchemical). In fact, in the early Song dynasty, followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest mercuric sulfide, which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide. Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom {{and access to the}} Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan, mastering of the qi, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Some {{critical}} scholars {{oppose the}} view that the sacred texts, including the Hebrew Bible, were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the documentary hypothesis and suggest that the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts. Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods. Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism. In this view, it was only by the Hellenic period that most Jews came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.|$|E

25|$|For decades, the Rosenbergs' sons Michael and Robert Meeropol {{and many}} other {{defenders}} maintained that Julius and Ethel were innocent of spying on their country and victims of Cold War paranoia. After {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, much information concerning them was declassified, including a trove of decoded Soviet cables, code-named VENONA, which detailed Julius's role as a courier and recruiter for the Soviets and Ethel's role as an accessory. Their sons' current position is that Julius was legally guilty of the conspiracy charge, though not of atomic spying, while Ethel was only generally aware of his activities. The children <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> father did not deserve the death penalty and that their mother was wrongly convicted. They continue to campaign for Ethel to be posthumously and legally exonerated.|$|E
25|$|The 14th prince, Yinti, born to {{the same}} mother as the Yongzheng Emperor, was {{recalled}} to Beijing from his military post. The emperor selected Nian Gengyao to replace Yinti as {{the commander of the}} northwestern expeditionary force. Yinti, who expected to be placed on the throne himself, was reluctant to recognise the Yongzheng Emperor's succession as legitimate. Yinti was accused of violating imperial decorum at the funeral proceedings of the late emperor, and placed under house arrest by the Yongzheng Emperor at the imperial tombs in western Beijing. Historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> mother, Empress Dowager Renshou, favoured Yinti partly because she raised him herself, while she did not raise the Yongzheng Emperor. Nonetheless the increasingly sharp conflict between her two surviving sons caused their mother great sorrow. She died less than six months after the Kangxi Emperor.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} {{has become more}} efficient in its Internet regulations since the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen protest. On June 3, 2013, Weibo quietly suspended usage of the candle icon from the comment input tool, which netizens used to mourn the dead on forums. Some searches related to the protest on Chinese website services no longer come up with blank results, but with results {{that the government had}} “carefully selected.” These subtle methods of government censorship may cause netizens to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> searched materials were not censored. The government, however, is inconsistent in its enforcement of censorship laws. Netizens reported that searches of some censored terms on Chinese web services still resulted in blank pages with a message that says “relevant laws, regulations and policies” prevent the display of results related to the searches.|$|E
