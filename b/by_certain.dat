5|$|The Krishna {{stories have}} {{played a key role}} in the history of Indian theatre, music, and dance, {{particularly}} through the tradition of Rasaleela. These are dramatic enactments of Krishna's childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. One common scene involves Krishna playing flute in rasa leela, only to be heard <b>by</b> <b>certain</b> gopis (cowheard maidens), which is theologically supposed to represent divine call only heard <b>by</b> <b>certain</b> enlightened beings. Some of the text's legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in Gita Govinda.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into five volumes.

5|$|Bumblebees, {{despite their}} ability to sting, are eaten <b>by</b> <b>certain</b> predators. Nests may be dug up by badgers and eaten whole, {{including}} any adults present. Adults are preyed upon by robber flies and beewolves in North America. In Europe, birds including bee-eaters and shrikes capture adult bumblebees on the wing; smaller birds such as great tits also occasionally learn to take bumblebees, while camouflaged crab spiders catch them as they visit flowers.|$|E

In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E
5|$|Durian {{flowers are}} large and {{feathery}} with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers pollinated <b>by</b> <b>certain</b> species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E
5|$|Focal {{seizures}} {{are often}} preceded <b>by</b> <b>certain</b> experiences, known as auras. They include sensory (visual, hearing, or smell), psychic, autonomic, and motor phenomena. Jerking activity may start {{in a specific}} muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it {{is known as a}} Jacksonian march. Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential tool in modern astrophysics.

Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted <b>by</b> <b>certain</b> types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether {{it would be possible to}} create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were put to use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors <b>by</b> <b>certain</b> fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya {{was influenced by}} Finnish, an agglutinative language, but much more by Latin, a synthetic and fusional language, and also Greek, from which he probably took {{the idea of the}} diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety: the Parmaquesta, used only in certain situations such as literature. Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired <b>by</b> <b>certain</b> aspects of Finnish, but this is not easily recognised.|$|E
