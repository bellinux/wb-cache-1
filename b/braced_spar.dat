50|$|It was a {{high wing}} {{monoplane}} with a two part, straight-edged, unswept wing of constant chord out to angled tips. Each half-wing was built around two spars and was fabric covered. On each side a pair of faired struts <b>braced</b> the <b>spars</b> to the lower fuselage longerons. Its overhung ailerons were aerodynamically balanced.|$|R
50|$|The Challenger's wing {{was built}} in two parts, both {{rectangular}} in plan out to semi-elliptical tips, which met {{on top of the}} fuselage and were mounted with 1.5° dihedral. They had wooden structures built around two box spars and were fabric covered. Parallel struts from beyond mid-span <b>braced</b> the <b>spars</b> to the lower fuselage longerons and the rear struts were also braced near their midpoints to the upper longerons; all struts were enclosed in wide, airfoil section fairings. Its inset ailerons were long and narrow.|$|R
2500|$|The Margarete was a wood framed {{aircraft}} with a high, <b>braced,</b> two <b>spar</b> wing with ply covering {{from the}} front spar to the leading edge and fabric covered aft. The wing had a thick and cambered profile inboard of the tips, which had a thinner and more symmetric profile. [...] Initially the wing plan was rectangular, with triangular ailerons mounted on straight hinges which were attached to the front spar at the tips, reaching the trailing edge inboard. [...] Later, the aileron area was reduced, partly by cropping them inboard and also by tapering their trailing edges and rounding their tips. [...] Each wing was braced from the lower fuselage with an asymmetric, V-form, streamlined strut to the two spars at about one-third span.|$|R
50|$|In {{urban areas}} where the ground area around the pole is restricted, a {{variation}} called a sidewalk guy is often used. In this type the guy line extends diagonally {{from the top of}} the pole to a horizontal <b>spar</b> <b>brace</b> extending out from the middle of the pole, and from this it continues vertically to the ground. Thus the bottom part of the guy is vertical and does not obstruct headroom, so a sidewalk can pass between the pole and the guy.|$|R
50|$|The S.XII had a braced, high, two part wing. Each half-wing was {{rectangular}} in plan out to elliptical tips. They were wooden structures, with {{pairs of}} spruce box spars and plywood skinning. Narrow-chord ailerons filled the entire trailing edges; the inner parts {{could also be}} lowered as camber-changing flaps. On each side a pair of parallel tubular struts from the lower fuselage longeron <b>braced</b> the wing <b>spars.</b> The rear struts, the longer of the two, were aluminium inside wooden streamlined metal fairings; the forward struts, which formed part of the landing gear, were steel and metal-faired.|$|R
25|$|The Dongó's wings {{were simply}} braced {{compared}} with most biplanes of the day, with an arrangement {{made possible by}} the narrow chord and large stagger. A single, vertical, faired interplane strut on each side <b>braced</b> the rear <b>spar</b> of the upper wing to the lower forward spar. Towards its top a metal faired-in oblique strut braced the forward, upper spar and there was a similar arrangement at its foot to the rear spar. To minimise drag, there were no conventional cross bracing flying wires but instead a single, faired diagonal strut from the top of each interplane struts to the corresponding lower fuselage longeron.|$|R
50|$|The Grunau 8, {{designed}} by Wolf Hirth and Edmund Schneider, was a wood and fabric tandem two-seat training glider with a strut-braced high wing, swept back at 5° and with 1.5° of dihedral, built around two raked spars. It was fabric covered {{apart from a}} plywood-skinned leading edge. Constant-chord inner sections occupied some 40% of the span, <b>braced</b> from the <b>spars</b> near the panel ends to the lower fuselage longerons by two parallel lift struts. The forward pair of these struts was streamlined and had near vertical jury struts. The outboard panels were straight tapered to rounded wing tips, the aft spar running straight from the wing root to tip and mounting slightly tapered ailerons.|$|R
5000|$|The Howard Wright 1910 biplane was a two-bay pusher biplane of {{what was}} then {{referred}} to as the [...] "Farman type", two pairs of booms in front of the wings bearing a single elevator and four wire-braced wooden booms behind the wings carrying a single rudder half above and half below a fixed horizontal surface bearing a second elevator. The wings had a mahogany main <b>spar</b> <b>braced</b> with piano-wire and a series of short sheet-metal king posts. Removable extensions could be fitted to the upper wing, each of these being braced from by a pair of additional king posts. The undercarriage consisted of a pair of skids each bearing a pair of wheels attached by shock cords.|$|R
25|$|The Schwalbe was {{a single}} bay biplane with thick section, unequal span wooden wings which were built around twin spars and fabric covered. The wings had marked stagger and were <b>braced</b> between the <b>spars</b> with forward leaning, steel tube, N-form interplane struts. The lower wing was {{attached}} directly to the lower fuselage, from which the inner upper wing was braced with an outward leaning pair of parallel struts to the spars and held over the upper fuselage {{by a pair of}} inverted V-struts, one on each side, to the forward spar alone. The wings were straight-tapered in plan, with only slight sweep on the leading edge, out to rounded tips. They also tapered in thickness. The Schwalbe had ailerons on both wings, externally connected with vertical rods. The upper ailerons had large balances to serve both surfaces.|$|R
50|$|France's only {{rigid airship}} was {{designed}} by Alsatian engineer Joseph Spiess and constructed by Société Zodiac at the Aérodrome de Saint-Cyr-l'École. It had a framework of hollow wooden <b>spars</b> <b>braced</b> with wire, and was given the name Zodiac XII but had the name SPIESS painted {{along the side of}} the envelope. It was 113 m (370 ft 9 in) long, with a diameter of 13.5 m (44 ft 3 in) and was powered by a single Chenu 200 hp engine that drove two propellers. It first flew on 13 April 1913, but it became clear that it was underpowered and required more lift, so it was lengthened to 140 m 459 ft 4 in) to accommodate three more gas cells and a second engine was added. Spiess then presented the airship to the French government as a gift. After further trials it was not accepted by the French military, because their view was that smaller non-rigid types would be more effective. The Spiess airship seems to have been broken-up in 1914.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Spiess {{was born}} on 10 September 1838, {{the son of a}} printer, in the city of Mulhouse, Haut-Rhin département, in the Alsace region of France. [...] He served as a warrant officer in the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1871, and when Alsace-Lorraine was annexed by the German Empire, Spiess opted to retain his French nationality.Shortly before World War I, there was public {{pressure}} for France to emulate Germany's airship fleet, and construction of Spiess's airship, with state assistance, was started by Société Zodiac at the Aérodrome de Saint-Cyr-l'École. It had a framework of hollow wooden <b>spars</b> <b>braced</b> with wire, and was given the name Zodiac XII but had the name [...] "SPIESS" [...] painted {{along the side of the}} envelope. It was 113 metres long, with a diameter of 13.5 metres, powered by a single Chenu 200 horse power engine that drove two propellers. It first flew on April 13, 1913, but it became clear that it was underpowered and required more lift, so the envelope was extended to 140 metres to accommodate three more gas cells and a second engine was added. Spiess then presented the airship to the French government as a gift. After further trials it was not accepted by the French military, because their view was that smaller non-rigid types would be more effective. The Spiess airship seems to have been broken-up in 1914.The first appearance of the Spiess airship over Paris initially caused consternation as it was mistaken for a German Zeppelin; however, when it was found to be a French machine, Spiess became something of a national celebrity and was nominated for Chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur in June 1913. Joseph Spiess died on 31 March 1917, and is buried with other family members in the Cimetiere du Pere-Lachaise in Paris; his gravestone has a bronze frieze depicting his airship.|$|R
