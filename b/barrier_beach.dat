Plymouth Beach guards Plymouth Harbor and mostly {{consists}} of a three-mile (5km) long, ecologically significant <b>barrier</b> <b>beach.</b> Clark's Island, a small island in Plymouth Bay, is the only island in Plymouth. It is {{off the coast of}} Saquish Neck and has nine summer houses but no year-round inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The Edgartown Harbor Light {{at the end}} {{of north}} Water Street defines the {{entrance}} to the Harbor. The harbor is large and entered through a modest sized channel on the North side of Edgartown. It opens into Katama Bay, created by a <b>barrier</b> <b>beach</b> that sometimes connects the south end of Chappaquiddick to the remainder of Edgartown, The <b>barrier</b> <b>beach</b> opened during a spring storm in 2007. This has led to a 3 knot current through Katama Bay and Edgartown Harbor. This protected body of water provides ample mooring for small and large boats. The opening of the harbor will accommodate large sailing and motorized boats, but will not accommodate large ships or yachts which may anchor outside the harbor.|$|E
25|$|The town of Edgartown {{includes}} the smaller island of Chappaquiddick, sometimes {{connected to the}} rest of Martha'a Vineyard only by a <b>barrier</b> <b>beach</b> which can be breached during storms. Chappaquiddick is separated from the town center by Edgartown Harbor and Katama Bay. The town is close to Nantucket's Muskeget Island, which is seven miles east of Wasque Point, the southeasternmost point of Chappaquiddick.|$|E
5000|$|These {{estuaries}} are semi-isolated from {{ocean waters}} by <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches</b> (<b>barrier</b> islands and barrier spits). Formation of <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches</b> partially encloses the estuary, with only narrow inlets allowing {{contact with the}} ocean waters. Bar-built estuaries typically develop on gently sloping plains located along tectonically stable edges of continents and marginal sea coasts. They are extensive along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the U.S. in areas with active coastal deposition of sediments and where tidal ranges are less than 4 m. The <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches</b> that enclose bar-built estuaries have been developed in several ways: ...|$|R

The A354 road passes down the Portland end of the beach and then over the Fleet Lagoon by bridge to the mainland. Portland and Weymouth together form the borough of Weymouth and Portland. The population of Portland is 12,400.|$|E
500|$|Miri is {{situated}} on the alluvial plain of the Miri River on the western shore of northern Sarawak {{on the island of}} Borneo. Because of the prevailing southerly off-shore current, beach drift has built up the Peninsula Road as a <b>barrier</b> <b>beach</b> between the Miri River and the shore causing a [...] "Yazoo effect" [...] where the river runs parallel to the coast before breaking through into the South China Sea. The city is predominately located on the inland (east) side of the Miri River with only a few scattered residential neighbourhoods, a Golf Club and a small airstrip on the Peninsula Road.|$|E
5000|$|The eastern {{coastline}} is {{punctuated by}} a number of lakes connecting (but not always) to the Tyrrhenian Sea, the remnant of an ancient system of lagoons behind <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches.</b> The Corsicans refer to them under the name of Étang, [...] "pool", although most are larger by far than an English pool. Marshland is also extensive on the coast requiring that cities be built inland from it. Malaria has historically been a problem near the marshlands and swamps of eastern Corsica. The fine <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches</b> are a recreational attraction.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, Long Island Sound {{separates}} Long Island {{from the}} eastern shores of the Bronx, Westchester County, and southern Connecticut, but on the Atlantic Ocean side of Long Island, the body of water between Long Island and its <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches</b> is termed the Great South Bay. Pamlico Sound is a similar lagoon that lies between North Carolina and its <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches,</b> the Outer Banks, in a similar situation. The Mississippi Sound separates the Gulf of Mexico from the mainland, along much of the gulf coasts of Alabama and Mississippi. On the West Coast, Puget Sound, by contrast, is a deep arm of the ocean.|$|R

500|$|Most of Dorset's {{coastline}} {{is part of}} the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site, which stretches for [...] between Studland and Exmouth in Devon. This coast {{documents the}} entire Mesozoic era, from Triassic to Cretaceous and is noted for its geological landforms. The Dorset section has yielded important fossils, including Jurassic trees and the first complete Ichthyosaur, discovered near Lyme Regis in 1811 by Mary Anning. The county features some notable coastal landforms, including examples of a cove (Lulworth Cove), a natural arch (Durdle Door) and chalk stacks (Old Harry Rocks). Jutting out into the English Channel at roughly the midpoint of the Dorset coastline is the Isle of Portland, a limestone island that is connected to the mainland by Chesil Beach, a [...] long shingle <b>barrier</b> <b>beach</b> protecting Britain's largest tidal lagoon.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} the {{shoreline}} varies; to the east it includes [...] high wavecut cliffs beneath the Mecca Hills over baymouth bars farther south, one of which reaches a length of [...] at the Orocopia Mountains. Even farther south shingle beaches are found, showing evidence of vigorous wave activity. At East Mesa, a [...] long <b>barrier</b> <b>beach</b> may have formed from sediments deposed by flash floods. Material eroded from the eastern and southwestern shores was deposited {{in the form of}} gravel and sand bars off the coast. As lake levels rose, at least one tributary stream had its valley filled in with Lake Cahuilla sediments. Tufas formed along shorelines, reaching maximum thicknesses of they are found especially on the northwestern shores. At the Fish Creek Mountains, beaches made up of gravel and a travertine layer on the mountain front mark the shore.|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the main {{results of the}} complex investigations of <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches</b> in the Pechora Sea including coastal dynamics and accompanying exogenous processes (eolian transportation), lithological and micropaleontological studies of the sediment sequence and radiocarbon dating.

Stationary observations on coastal dynamics and the rate of eolian sedimentation allowed estimating the rate of barrier retreat. The mechanism of formation and evolution of dune belts on these barriers is described. Composition of diatom associations and lithological data provide evidence for facial-genetic conditions of sedimentation during accumulation of barriers. Radiocarbon datings corroborate the "young" age of the modern avandune ridges of the <b>barrier</b> <b>beaches...</b>|$|R

This belt {{commonly}} known as the Chavara deposit, after the main locality, is [...] in length and about [...] wide in the north and [...] in the south. Around 60% of the Chavara <b>barrier</b> <b>beach</b> portion is composed of heavy minerals. The Chavara deposit is estimated to contain 127 million tonnes of heavy minerals with ilmenite content of 80 million tonnes from the total reserve of raw sand of the order of 1400 million tonnes. The deposit is quite rich with respect to ilmenite, rutile and zircon and the mineral-ilmenite happens to be of weathered variety analyzing 60% TiO2.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} Chesil Beach {{has been argued}} over for some time. Originally it was {{believed}} that beach [...] material was from the Budleigh Salterton pebble beds to the west and later from Portland to the south east. The differences between the pebbles on the beach and nearby sources is now put down to the Flandrian isostatic sea level rise, so the feature could also be considered a <b>barrier</b> <b>beach</b> or bar, that happens to connect the mainland to an island rather than a 'true' tombolo. Normally, tombolos are created due to the effects of the island on waves (through refraction) and to sediment transport, which usually produces a beach perpendicular to the mainland rather than parallel to it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Barrier</b> <b>beaches</b> form {{in shallow}} water and are {{generally}} parallel to the shoreline, resulting in long, narrow estuaries.
