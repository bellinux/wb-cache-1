5|$|Low-power and {{high-power}} devices remain operational {{with this}} standard, but devices using SuperSpeed {{can take advantage}} of increased available current of between 150mA and 900mA, respectively. Additionally, there is a <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> Specification (Version 1.2– December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5A but does not allow concurrent data transmission. The <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5A of current but limits the maximum current drawn to 1.5A.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{solar cell}} powered Li-ion <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> in CMOS 0. 25 um is proposed. The solar <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> {{consists}} of a DC/DC boost converter and a <b>battery</b> <b>charger.</b> The voltage generated by a solar cell is up converted from 0. 65 V to 1. 8 V, which is used as the VDD of the <b>battery</b> <b>charger.</b> In this way, the solar <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> automatically converts solar energy to electricity and stores it directly to a Li-ion rechargeable battery. In this system, a super capacitor is needed as a charge buffer between the boost converter and the charger...|$|R
40|$|A <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> {{design for}} the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) space {{platform}} has been developed and tested. The authors discuss {{the design of the}} <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> power state and its current and voltage control loops. In addition to restoring energy to the <b>batteries,</b> this <b>charger</b> regulates the spacecraft bus voltage during the posteclipse transition period. The <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> design and analysis were facilitated by use of the pulse-width-modulated (PWM) switch model and the new continuous-time model for current-mode control. Analyses of the <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> small-signal behavior are compared to hardware measurements to verify modeling accuracy...|$|R
5|$|Some devices, when {{plugged into}} {{charging}} ports, draw even more power (10watts at 2.1amperes) than the <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> Specification allows — The iPad {{is one such}} device. Barnes & Noble NOOK Color devices also require a special charger that runs at 1.9amperes.|$|E
5|$|Standard USB hub ports {{can provide}} from the typical 500mA/2.5W of current, only 100mA from non-hub ports. USB3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8A/9.0W (for {{dedicated}} <b>battery</b> <b>charging,</b> 1.5A/7.5W full bandwidth or 900mA/4.5W high bandwidth), while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60watts of power, although 10 to 20watts is more typical.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers of {{personal}} electronic devices might {{not include a}} USB standard connector on their product for technical or marketing reasons. Some manufacturers provide proprietary cables that permit their devices to physically connect to a USB standard port. Full functionality of proprietary ports and cables with USB standard ports is not assured; for example, some devices only use the USB connection for <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> and do not implement any data transfer functions.|$|E

40|$|Active {{authentication}} is {{the practice}} of continuously verifying the identity of users, based on their context, interactions with a system, and information provided by that system. In this paper, we investigate if <b>battery</b> <b>charge</b> readings from mobile devices {{can be used as}} an extra factor to improve active authentication. We make use of a large data set of <b>battery</b> <b>charge</b> readings from real users and construct two computationally inexpensive machine learning classifiers to predict if a user session is authentic: the first one only based on the <b>battery</b> <b>charge</b> at a certain time of day; the second one predicts the authenticity of the user session when a previous, recent <b>battery</b> <b>charge</b> reading is available. Our research shows that a simple two-figure <b>battery</b> <b>charge</b> value can make a useful albeit minor contribution to active authentication. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|The GCV {{was to be}} {{operable}} {{with the}} current battle command control and communications suite but would gradually use a more state-of-the-art networked integration system known as the BCT Network. It would provide exportable electrical power, and a <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> capability for external hardware including vehicles and electronics from the BCT Soldier subsystems. The system {{would be capable of}} integration with unmanned systems and dismounted soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{intent is}} to permit uniformly {{charging}} laptops, tablets, USB-powered disks and similarly higher-power consumer electronics, as {{a natural extension of}} existing European and Chinese mobile telephone charging standards. This may also affect the way electric power used for small devices is transmitted and used in both residential and public buildings. The standard is designed to coexist with the previous USB <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> specification.|$|E
5|$|These bus power {{currents}} being {{much higher}} than cables were designed for, though not unsafe, cause a larger voltage between {{the ends of the}} ground signal, significantly reducing noise margins causing problems with High Speed signaling. <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> Specification 1.1 specifies that charging devices must dynamically limit bus power current draw during High Speed signaling; 1.2 simply specifies that charging devices and ports must be designed to tolerate the higher ground voltage difference in High Speed signaling.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{photovoltaic}} (PV) power system for <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> applications. The charger uses an interleaving boost converter with a single-capacitor turn-off snubber to reduce voltage stresses of active switches at turn-off transition. Therefore, active switches of the charger can be operated with zero-voltage transition (ZVT) to decrease switching losses and increase conversion efficiency. In order {{to draw the}} maximum power from PV arrays and obtain the optimal power control of the <b>battery</b> <b>charger,</b> a perturbation-and-observation method and microchip are incorporated to implement {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT) algorithm and power management. Finally, a prototype <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> is built and implemented. Experimental results have verified the performance and feasibility of the proposed PV power system for <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> applications...|$|R

5|$|Before the <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> Specification was defined, {{there was}} no {{standardized}} way for the portable device to inquire how much current was available. For example, Apple's iPod and iPhone chargers indicate the available current by voltages on the D− and D+ lines. When D+ = D− = 2.0V, the device may pull up to 500mA. When D+ = 2.0V and D− = 2.8V, the device may pull up to 1A of current. When D+ = 2.8V and D− = 2.0V, the device may pull up to 2A of current.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, {{many of the}} world's largest {{mobile phone}} {{manufacturers}} signed an EC-sponsored Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreeing to make most data-enabled mobile phones marketed in the European Union compatible with a common External Power Supply (common EPS). The EU's common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references the USB <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> Specification and {{is similar to the}} GSMA/OMTP and Chinese charging solutions. In January 2011, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) released its version of the (EU's) common EPS standard as IEC 62684:2011.|$|E
5|$|USB <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> {{defines a}} new port type, the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, the charging ports should be labeled as such.|$|E

40|$|Battery {{is one of}} {{the media}} for power {{supplies}} in electronic devices. However, the battery�s ability supplied power limited on how big the capacity that is stored in batteries. When the <b>battery</b> <b>charge</b> runs out, it needs re-charging (charge), where the device to recharge the <b>battery</b> <b>charge</b> must consider several aspects such as <b>charging</b> current, <b>battery</b> voltage and when the charging process must be stopped, this is considering that batteries for electric bicycles 3 x 12 V/ 12 ah has a maximum current limit charging 3 A, and with charger in the sales package, not allowed to charge more than five hours. The fact is, many owners of electric bicycles do excessive <b>charging</b> so the <b>battery</b> does not last long. The solution to this problem is to use <b>battery</b> <b>charger,</b> which can be used to <b>charge</b> the <b>battery</b> <b>charge</b> to some voltage rating (12 V and 24 V). This <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> is equipped with buckboost converter for voltage and charging current regulator which way this works is based on the large PWM duty cycle generated by the microcontrolle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model predictive current control {{applied to a}} slow electric vehicle (EV) <b>battery</b> <b>charger.</b> Taking into account {{the similarities between the}} power converters inside the EV, it is possible to combine the <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> and the motor driver in a single integrated converter, thus reducing the weight and volume of the proposed solution, and also contributing to reduce the final price of the EV. Due to the bidirectional power flow capability of the integrated power converter, when working as a slow EV <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> it can operate in grid-to-vehicle (G 2 V) mode and in vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) mode, contributing to make EVs an important assets in the future smart grids. The integrated power converter working as <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> operates with sinusoidal current and unitary power factor, contributing to improve the power quality of the electrical grid. This paper provides simulation and experimental results that validate the model predictive control algorithm applied to the proposed integrated power converter working as slow EV <b>battery</b> <b>charger.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
5|$|With the {{development}} of electric power, wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences, and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electric power grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized offshore wind farms that provide electric power to national electrical networks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} are {{devices that}} convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured {{in a wide}} range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ <b>Battery</b> <b>Charging</b> Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep and wake, <b>battery</b> <b>charging,</b> trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E
