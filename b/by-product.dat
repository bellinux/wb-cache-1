5|$|Its <b>by-product</b> status {{means that}} indium {{production}} is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a <b>by-product</b> is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the <b>by-product</b> production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price.

In this scenario, slaughterhouses and sanitary inspection plays a critical role, since they allow to identify and minimize the specific hazards for human health. Through the assurance of animal well-being and through the ante and post-mortem inspection, it is possible to guarantee that products of animal origin reach the consumer in a safe way. Mainly goals of this thesis were the classification and quantification of the animal origin <b>by-products</b> obtained during health inspection and slaughter operations, as well as the assessment of the economic impact of these products for the slaughterhouse. A record was made for the weights of the <b>by-products</b> obtained monthly through the slaughtered species in Mafra´s Regional Slaughterhouse, bovine, equine, ovine and caprine, during the internship period from February to July 2015. During this period, it was possible to determine that, from the <b>by-products</b> produced over these months, more than 50 % were of category 3 <b>by-products.</b> The amount of category 1 <b>by-products</b> produced varied between 31 000 kg and 45 000 kg, the amount of category 2 <b>by-products</b> varied between 28 000 kg and 36 000 kg and the amount of category 3 <b>by-products</b> varied between 67 000 kg and 86 000 kg.
