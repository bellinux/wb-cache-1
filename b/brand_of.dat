40|$|In Japan, some fishery {{cooperative}} associations {{use their}} fishery harbor names as a brand to differentiate their own shore fish. Most notable is the <b>branding</b> <b>of</b> mackerel. In this paper, we analyze the effects <b>of</b> <b>branding</b> using a discrete/continuous model. The results are as follows. First, there is first-mover {{advantage in the}} <b>branding</b> <b>of</b> mackerel. For instance, unlike other <b>brands</b> <b>of</b> mackerel, Seki-saba as the pioneering brand can increase its brand equity. Second, other brands have opposing effects that increase and decrease the <b>brand</b> equity <b>of</b> the pioneering <b>brand.</b> We find the former is strongest {{in the early stages}} <b>of</b> fishery <b>branding</b> when there are few competing <b>brands</b> <b>of</b> mackerel, while the latter becomes stronger in later stages when many other brands emerge.

40|$|The {{ignition}} {{strength for}} a total <b>of</b> 54 <b>brands</b> <b>of</b> cigarettes was determined {{in accordance with the}} ASTM E 2187 - 02 b standard test method. Fifty-two (52) <b>brands</b> <b>of</b> cigarettes sold in Canada and 2 <b>brands</b> <b>of</b> Philip Morris's Merit cigarettes sold in the U. S. were tested. On the 15 -layer filter paper assembly, 51 <b>brands</b> <b>of</b> the cigarettes sold in Canada produced 90 to 100 % full-length burning. These cigarettes plus those 10 <b>brands</b> <b>of</b> the cigarettes tested previously (which produced 95 to 100 % full-length burning) have a relatively high propensity to ignite upholstered furniture if lit and dropped on soft furnishings. These high percentages of full-length burns demonstrate the need to make cigarettes less prone to cause fires. Only 3 <b>brands</b> <b>of</b> the cigarettes tested were found to have a low ignition propensity. The More Menthol cigarettes produced 15 % full-length burns on the 15 -layer filter paper assembly and 27. 5 % full-length burns on the 3 -layer filter paper assembly. The Merit Ultra Light cigarettes produced 15 % full-length burns on the 15 -layer filter paper assembly and 45 % full-length burns on the 3 -layer filter paper assembly. The Merit Ultima cigarettes produced only 5 % full-length burns on the 15 -layer filter paper assembly. i TABLE OF CONTENTS 1. ...|$|R
