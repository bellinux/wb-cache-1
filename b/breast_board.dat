40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} plexiglass <b>breast</b> <b>board</b> (BB) and vacuum bed (VB) effects on dose distribution {{and reliability of}} treatment planning system (TPS) calculations. METHODS: Measurements were performed by placing BBs and VBs of varying thicknesses and air gaps onto water and solid phantoms. CT scans of the solid phantom mechanism were transferred to TPS for dose calculation. RESULTS: 2. 6 %, 3. 9 % and 5. 5 % dose decreases were observed for 10, 15 and 20 mm plexiglass at 5 cm depth. Maximum dose decrease was 1. 5 % for VB. TPS calculations were within 1 % for both systems. Skin dose increased in accordance with thickness. A maximum 6. 3 % difference was found between calculation and measurements for increasing air gaps, but the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: BB must be positioned {{so as to avoid}} beam entry. Otherwise, it must be included into the CT scan for better calculation. If using VBs, it must be considered that skin doses increase with thickness...|$|E
40|$|Greater use of 3 D conformal, Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and {{external}} beam partial breast irradiation following local excision (LE) {{for breast cancer}} has necessitated {{a review of the}} effectiveness of immobilisation methods to stabilise breast tissue. To identify the suitability of currently available breast (rather than thorax) immobilisation techniques an appraisal of the literature was undertaken. The aim was to identify and evaluate the benefit of additional or novel immobilisation approaches (beyond the standard supine, single arm abducted and angled <b>breast</b> <b>board</b> technique adopted in most radiotherapy departments). A database search was supplemented with an individual search of key radiotherapy peer-reviewed journals, author searching, and searching of the grey literature. A total of 27 articles met the inclusion criteria. The review identified good reproducibility of the thorax using the standard supine arm-pole technique. Reproducibility with the prone technique appears inferior to supine methods (based on data from existing randomised controlled trials). Assessing the effectiveness of additional breast support devices (such as rings or thermoplastic material) is hampered by small sample sizes and a lack of randomised data for comparison. Attention to breast immobilisation is recommended, as well as agreement on how breast stability should be measured using volumetric imaging.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore feasibility, tumor control and acute and late toxicity of a specific hypo-fractionated 3 D-CRT when treating postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer with partial breast irradiation, using five fractions in five consecutive days. Materials and Methods: Ten patients, aged ≥ 70 underwent breast conservative surgery for invasive breast carcinoma with a complete microscopic resection; no lymphovascular invasion was found and negative axillary node status was assessed. Metal clips were positioned in the surgical bed at the time of surgery. All of the patients provided an informed consent for breast irradiation. Seven patients received Tamoxifen.

The dose fractionation schedule was 3000 cGy delivered to the isocenter in 5 fractions (600 cGy/fr) using 6 MV photons. According to the linear quadratic model and an α/β ratio of 4 Gy this prescription is equivalent to 50 Gy in a standard 2 -Gy fractionation schedule. Patients were treated in the supine position. A comercial <b>breast</b> <b>board</b> was used as immobilization device in order to keep the arms of the patient raised. The clinical target volume (CTV) was drawn with a uniform 1 -cm three-dimensional margin around the surgical clips. The CTV was limited to 3 mm from the skin surface and 3 mm from the lung-chest wall interface. A three-dimensional margin was added to the CTV to obtain the planning target volume (PTV). The ipsilateral and controlateral breast, the ipsilateral and controlateral lung, heart and spinal cord were contoured as organs at risk (OAR). The treatment was developed using Precise Plan Treatment Planning System and four no-coplanar fields. The constraints used have been: uninvolved breast (ipsilateral breast-PTV) : V 15 ≤ 50 %; heart: V 3 ≤ 10 %; ipsilateral lung: V 10 ≤ 20 %; controlateral lung: V 5 ≤ 10 % and controlateral breast: maximum dose ≤ 1 Gy. We required PTV coverage of ≥ 90 %. Patient set-up was verified every day before treatment using portal images. No tumour bed boost was delivered. Clinical assessments of early normal tissue reaction were carried out every day during radiotherapy and 10 days after the end of the treatment. After radiotherapy, we visited all patients every 3 months during the first 2 years and every six month thereafter. Frontal and lateral pictures of the breast were taken on the first day of treatment (baseline), at the end of treatment, 10 days after the end of treatment and at the first follow-up. Any change in breast appearance compared with the baseline picture was scored on a four-point RTOG for acute and late radiation morbidity scoring scale. Results: No local or distant recurrences was observed and then confirmed by mammograms performed every year and breast ultrasound performed every six months. For acute and late toxicity, only 2 patients developed acute effects at the end of the treatment. Conclusion: The clinical outcomes observed in ten patients demonstrate a good feasibility of the schedule adopted both in terms of tumour control and acute and late toxicity, with good cosmetics results.

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} the deep inspirational breath-hold (DIBH) technique and its dosimetric advantages over the free breathing (FB) technique in cardiac (heart and left anterior descending artery [LAD]) and ipsilateral lung sparing in left-sided post-mastectomy field-in-field conformal radiotherapy. DIBH is highly reproducible, and this study aims to find out its dosimetric benefits over FB. Materials and Methods: Nineteen left-sided mastectomy patients were immobilized using <b>breast</b> <b>boards</b> with both arms positioned above the head. All patients had 2 sets of planning CT images (one in FB and another in DIBH) with a Biograph TruePoint HD CT scanner in the same setup. DIBH was performed by tracking the respiratory cycles using a Varian Real-Time Position Management system. The target (chest wall and supraclavicular region), organs at risk (OARs; ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung, heart, LAD, and contralateral breast), and other organs of interests were delineated as per the RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) contouring guidelines. The single-isocenter conformal fields in the field treatment plans were generated with the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (Varian Medical Systems) for both FB and DIBH images, and the doses to the target and OARs were compared. The standard fractionation regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks was used for all patients in this study. Results and Discussion: The target coverage parameters (V 95, V 105, V 107, and Dmean) were found to be 97. 8 ± 0. 9, 6. 1 ± 3. 4, 0. 2 ± 0. 3, and 101. 9 ± 0. 5 % in the FB plans and 98. 1 ± 0. 8, 6. 1 ± 3. 2, 0. 2 ± 0. 3, and 101. 9 ± 0. 4 % in the DIBH plans, respectively. The plan quality indices (conformity index and homogeneity index) also showed 1. 3 ± 0. 2 and 0. 1 for the FB plans and 1. 2 ± 0. 3 and 0. 1 for the DIBH plans, respectively. There was a significant reduction in dose to the heart in the DIBH plans compared to the FB plans, with p values of nearly 0 for the V 5, V 10, V 25, V 30, and Dmean dosimetric parameters. The difference in ipsilateral lung doses between FB and DIBH showed statistically significant p values, and the differences in mean doses were found to be 7, 15. 7, 11. 8, and 10. 7 % for V 5, V 20, V 30, and Dmean, respectively. There was a significant reduction in dose to the LAD in the DIBH compared to the FB plans. Conclusions: DIBH resulted in significant reductions in doses to the heart, LAD, and lungs, since with this technique there was an increase in the distance between the target and the OARs. With appropriate patient selection and adequate training, the DIBH technique is acceptable and achievable for radiotherapy to the chest, and therefore should be considered for all suitable patients, as this could result in fewer radiotherapy-related complications. However, this technique is time-consuming, since the setup is complex, results in an increased time for treatment delivery, and needs patient cooperation and technical expertise...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Adjuvant {{drug therapy}} can extend {{survival}} {{for breast cancer}} patients, but the balance between costs and benefits {{may be difficult to}} estimate. Software programs have been developed for this purpose and recently have become available online. Here, we describe our experience using a web-based program to support adjuvant decision making at a multidisciplinary <b>breast</b> cancer Tumor <b>Board</b> in a university-affiliated oncology center. Patients and Methods: One hundred two adjuvant breast cancer cases were discussed by the Tumor Board over a four-month period, with a provisional treatment plan being formulated after each discussion. Program data predicting 10 -year risks and benefits were shared with board members after each provisional plan and any change in recommendation was recorded. A user survey was conducted to assess the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the program. Results: Treatment decisions were changed in 12. 7 percent of cases (13 / 102) after consideration of data from the program. Most of these (76. 9 percent) were node-negative ER-positive cases, with the most common reason for change being a lower-than-expected added survival benefit from less intensive chemotherapy regimens (ACx 4 or CMF; 81. 8 percent). In certain recurrent scenarios, the program was perceived to have limitations that led to retention of the original management plan despite data that might otherwise have favored different treatment. On completion of the study period, clinicians' attitudes to the program ranged from enthusiasm to caution. Conclusion: Although not replacing clinical judgement, these findings support the value of this web-based program as a decision making adjunct that can help clinicians to separate risk and benefit, compare the added value of different therapeutic interventions in a given clinical context, and present more balanced information about treatment options to patients.

40|$|On-board image guidance, such as cone-beam CT (CBCT) and kV/MV 2 D imaging, is {{essential}} in many radiation therapy procedures, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). These imaging techniques provide predominantly anatomical information for treatment planning and target localization. Recently, {{studies have shown that}} treatment planning based on functional and molecular information about the tumor and surrounding tissue could potentially improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy. However, current on-board imaging systems are limited in their functional and molecular imaging capability. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a candidate to achieve on-board functional and molecular imaging. Traditional SPECT systems typically take 20 minutes or more for a scan, which is too long for on-board imaging. A robotic multi-pinhole SPECT system was proposed in this dissertation to provide shorter imaging time by using a robotic arm to maneuver the multi-pinhole SPECT system around the patient in position for radiation therapy. A 49 -pinhole collimated SPECT detector and its shielding were designed and simulated in this work using the computer-aided design (CAD) software. The trajectories of robotic arm about the patient, treatment table and gantry in the radiation therapy room and several detector assemblies such as parallel holes, single pinhole and 49 pinholes collimated detector were investigated. The rail mounted system was designed to enable a full range of detector positions and orientations to various crucial treatment sites including head and torso, while avoiding collision with linear accelerator (LINAC), patient table and patient. An alignment method was developed in this work to calibrate the on-board robotic SPECT to the LINAC coordinate frame and to the coordinate frames of other on-board imaging systems such as CBCT. This alignment method utilizes line sources and one pinhole projection of these line sources. The model consists of multiple alignment parameters which maps line sources in 3 -dimensional (3 D) space to their 2 -dimensional (2 D) projections on the SPECT detector. Computer-simulation studies and experimental evaluations were performed as a function of number of line sources, Radon transform accuracy, finite line-source width, intrinsic camera resolution, Poisson noise and acquisition geometry. In computer-simulation studies, when there was no error in determining angles (α) and offsets (ρ) of the measured projections, the six alignment parameters (3 translational and 3 rotational) were estimated perfectly using three line sources. When angles (α) and offsets (ρ) were provided by Radon transform, the estimation accuracy was reduced. The estimation error was associated with rounding errors of Radon transform, finite line-source width, Poisson noise, number of line sources, intrinsic camera resolution and detector acquisition geometry. The estimation accuracy was significantly improved by using 4 line sources rather than 3 and also by using thinner line-source projections (obtained by better intrinsic detector resolution). With 5 line sources, median errors were 0. 2 mm for the detector translations, 0. 7 mm for the detector radius of rotation, and less than 0. 5 ° for detector rotation, tilt and twist. In experimental evaluations, average errors relative to a different, independent registration technique were about 1. 8 mm for detector translations, 1. 1 mm for the detector radius of rotation (ROR), 0. 5 ° and 0. 4 ° for detector rotation and tilt, respectively, and 1. 2 ° for detector twist. Simulation studies were performed to investigate the improvement of imaging sensitivity and accuracy of hot sphere localization for breast imaging of patients in prone position. A 3 D XCAT phantom was simulated in the prone position with nine hot spheres of 10 mm diameter added in the left breast. A no-treatment-table case and two commercial prone <b>breast</b> <b>boards,</b> 7 and 24 cm thick, were simulated. Different pinhole focal lengths were assessed for root-mean-square-error (RMSE). The pinhole focal lengths resulting in the lowest RMSE values were 12 cm, 18 cm and 21 cm for no table, thin board, and thick board, respectively. In both no table and thin board cases, all 9 hot spheres were easily visualized above background with 4 -minute scans utilizing the 49 -pinhole SPECT system while seven of nine hot spheres were visible with the thick board. In comparison with parallel-hole system, our 49 -pinhole system shows reduction in noise and bias under these simulation cases. These results correspond to smaller radii of rotation for no-table case and thinner prone board. Similarly, localization accuracy with the 49 -pinhole system was significantly better than with the parallel-hole system for both the thin and thick prone boards. Median localization errors for the 49 -pinhole system with the thin board were less than 3 mm for 5 of 9 hot spheres, and less than 6 mm for the other 4 hot spheres. Median localization errors of 49 -pinhole system with the thick board were less than 4 mm for 5 of 9 hot spheres, and less than 8 mm for the other 4 hot spheres. Besides prone breast imaging, respiratory-gated region-of-interest (ROI) imaging of lung tumor was also investigated. A simulation study was conducted on the potential of multi-pinhole, region-of-interest (ROI) SPECT to alleviate noise effects associated with respiratory-gated SPECT imaging of the thorax. Two 4 D XCAT digital phantoms were constructed, with either a 10 mm or 20 mm diameter tumor added in the right lung. The maximum diaphragm motion was 2 cm (for 10 mm tumor) or 4 cm (for 20 mm tumor) in superior-inferior direction and 1. 2 cm in anterior-posterior direction. Projections were simulated with a 4 -minute acquisition time (40 seconds per each of 6 gates) using either the ROI SPECT system (49 -pinhole) or reference single and dual conventional broad cross-section, parallel-hole collimated SPECT. The SPECT images were reconstructed using OSEM with up to 6 iterations. Images were evaluated as a function of gate by profiles, noise versus bias curves, and a numerical observer performing a forced-choice localization task. Even for the 20 mm tumor, the 49 -pinhole imaging ROI was found sufficient to encompass fully usual clinical ranges of diaphragm motion. Averaged over the 6 gates, noise at iteration 6 of 49 -pinhole ROI imaging (10. 9 µCi/ml) was approximately comparable to noise at iteration 2 of the two dual and single parallel-hole, broad cross-section systems (12. 4 µCi/ml and 13. 8 µCi/ml, respectively). Corresponding biases were much lower for the 49 -pinhole ROI system (3. 8 µCi/ml), versus 6. 2 µCi/ml and 6. 5 µCi/ml for the dual and single parallel-hole systems, respectively. Median localization errors averaged over 6 gates, for the 10 mm and 20 mm tumors respectively, were 1. 6 mm and 0. 5 mm using the ROI imaging system and 6. 6 mm and 2. 3 mm using the dual parallel-hole, broad cross-section system. The results demonstrate substantially improved imaging via ROI methods. One important application may be gated imaging of patients in position for radiation therapy. A robotic SPECT imaging system was constructed utilizing a gamma camera detector (Digirad 2020 tc) and a robot (KUKA KR 150 -L 110 robot). An imaging study was performed with a phantom (PET CT Phantom TM), which includes 5 spheres of 10, 13, 17, 22 and 28 mm in diameter. The phantom was placed on a flat-top couch. SPECT projections were acquired with a parallel-hole collimator and a single-pinhole collimator both without background in the phantom, and with background at 1 / 10 th the sphere activity concentration. The imaging trajectories of parallel-hole and pinhole collimated detectors spanned 180 degrees and 228 degrees respectively. The pinhole detector viewed a 14. 7 cm-diameter common volume which encompassed the 28 mm and 22 mm spheres. The common volume for parallel-hole was a 20. 8 -cm-diameter cylinder which encompassed all five spheres in the phantom. The maneuverability of the robotic system was tested by navigating the detector to trace the flat-top table while avoiding collision with the table and maintaining the closest possible proximity to the common volume. For image reconstruction, detector trajectories were described by radius-of-rotation and detector rotation angle &# 952;. These reconstruction parameters were obtained from the robot base and tool coordinates. The robotic SPECT system was able to maneuver the parallel-hole and pinhole collimated SPECT detectors in close proximity to the phantom, minimizing impact of the flat-top couch on detector to center-of-rotation (COR) distance. In no background case, all five spheres were visible in the reconstructed parallel-hole and pinhole images. In with background case, three spheres of 17, 22 and 28 mm diameter were readily observed with the parallel-hole imaging, and the targeted spheres (22 and 28 mm diameter) were readily observed in the pinhole ROI imaging. In conclusion, the proposed on-board robotic SPECT can be aligned to LINAC/CBCT with a single pinhole projection of the line-source phantom. Alignment parameters can be estimated using one pinhole projection of line sources. This alignment method may be important for multi-pinhole SPECT, where relative pinhole alignment may vary during rotation. For single pinhole and multi-pinhole SPECT imaging onboard radiation therapy machines, the method could provide alignment of SPECT coordinates with those of CBCT and the LINAC. In simulation studies of prone breast imaging and respiratory-gated lung imaging, the 49 -pinhole detector showed better tumor contrast recovery and localization in a 4 -minute scan compared to parallel-hole detector. On-board SPECT could be achieved by a robot maneuvering a SPECT detector about patients in position for radiation therapy on a flat-top couch. The robot inherent coordinate frames could be an effective means to estimate detector pose for use in SPECT image reconstruction. Dissertatio...|$|R
