50|$|Roller <b>ball</b> <b>pens</b> or rollerball pens are <b>pens</b> {{which use}} <b>ball</b> point writing {{mechanisms}} with water-based liquid or gelled ink, {{as opposed to}} the oil-based viscous inks found in ballpoint pens. These less viscous inks, which tend to saturate more deeply and more widely into paper than other types of ink, give roller <b>ball</b> <b>pens</b> their distinctive writing qualities. The writing point is a tiny ball, usually 0.5 or 0.7 mm in diameter, that transfers the ink from the reservoir onto the paper as the pen moves.|$|R

5000|$|Roller <b>ball</b> <b>pens</b> with liquid-ink {{are more}} likely to [...] "bleed" [...] through the paper. Liquid ink is more readily absorbed into the paper due to its lower {{viscosity}}. This viscosity also causes problems when leaving the tip on the paper (to pause for a thought for example). The bleed-through effect is greatly increased as the ink is continually absorbed into the paper, creating a blotch. This does not affect gel-ink roller <b>ball</b> <b>pens</b> as much. This is one way through which the thickness of gel-ink gives it an advantage, in that it isn't as prone to being absorbed. Though the bleed-through effect of a gel-ink roller ball is greater than that of a ballpoint, it is usually not too significant.|$|R
5000|$|Liquid {{ink roller}} <b>ball</b> <b>pens</b> flow {{extremely}} consistently and skip less than gel ink pens do. The lower viscosity of liquid ink {{increases the likelihood}} of consistent inking of the ball, whereas the higher viscosity of gel ink produces [...] "skipping", that is, occasional gaps in lines or letters.|$|R

5000|$|Roller <b>ball</b> <b>pens</b> {{generally}} {{run out of}} ink {{more quickly}} than ballpoints because roller balls use a greater amount of ink while writing. This {{is especially true of}} liquid-ink roller balls, due to gel ink having a low absorption rate {{as a result of its}} thickness. Neither lasts as long as a ballpoint.|$|R
