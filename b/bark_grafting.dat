40|$|To {{determine}} a suitable method {{and time of}} top-working for inferior walnut trees, a preliminary {{study was conducted to}} compare nine different grafting or budding methods. Two promising methods including modified <b>bark</b> <b>grafting</b> and cleft grafting at two times (early April and mid April) were further evaluated during 2001 - 2006, in terms of grafting percentage and subsequent impact on growth and fruiting using a completely randomized block design. The modified <b>bark</b> <b>grafting</b> on main branches in the mid April showed the highest grafting success and survival percentage (76 - 93 %). The number of nut, kernel color and weight was increased significantly in the top worked shoots compared to the non-top worked shoots (p< 0. 01). Using modified <b>bark</b> <b>grafting</b> method, 15 local walnut genotypes were successfully top worked in a collection in 2004. The <b>bark</b> <b>grafting</b> method was also evaluated under different orchard conditions in west Azarbaijan during 2008 - 2009. Grafting success varied between 30 - 100 % (averaged 67. 7 %), indicating the higher capability of this method for top working of walnut trees. Therefore, the modified <b>bark</b> <b>grafting</b> method on main branches {{in the second half of}} April could be recommended for walnut top working, especially in young, newly established seedling orchards...|$|E
40|$|As {{phytoplasmas}} are non cultivable micro-organisms, {{the research}} on phytoplasmal diseases can only be achieved with infected hosts. Biological indexing (by grafting) is the simplest detection method for phytoplasmal diseases. We tested four different grafting techniques for inoculation of apple trees or periwinkles in greenhouse, including whip graft, bark graft, budding and chip-budding. All techniques were tested on apple trees (six trees per phytop-lasma isolates) in insect-proof greenhouse. The whip and <b>bark</b> <b>grafting</b> were not feasible for periwinkle plants, because of fineness and fragility of their tissues: only the chip-budding was performed (four plants per isolate). In apple trees, the best and soonest positive results were obtained by chip and <b>bark</b> <b>grafting.</b> Except for seven transplants not-grown after grafting, 100 % efficiency of inoculation was obtained by both methods. Nevertheless, the transmission of phytoplasma from transplant not-grown to rootstock was sometimes recorded (28. 6 %). The earliest phytoplasma symptoms after whip or <b>bark</b> <b>grafting</b> appeared after 3 months. Symp-toms were obtained much later with budding and chip-budding. In case of periwinkles, in-fected apple and periwinkle materials were used as inoculum sources. Transmission of phy-toplasma from periwinkle to periwinkle was successfully carried out by chip-budding grafting...|$|E
40|$|The major {{hypotheses}} regarding tree {{responses to}} wounding are reviewed. Particular {{emphasis is placed}} on cellular activity, and callus formation, in relation to the isolation of damaged and diseased wood in living trees. Four models, that describe the development and subsequent restriction of decay in living trees, are identified and discussed. While the pool of knowledge regarding tree responses to wounding and damage is substantial, understanding of the processes involved is incomplete. Having considered existing scientific literature, a series of trials investigated an alternative approach to wound treatment. Conventional arboricultural practice dictates that limb removals should be just outside the branch collar to encourage maximum callus formation and speedy wound closure. Large trunk wounds should have the wound edges clear of ragged tears so that callus growth will eventually enclose the site. In some instances large wounds can be treated with bridge grafts. The trials undertaken investigated the possibility of using <b>bark</b> patch <b>grafts</b> to treat wound sites on living trees. Trial 1 involved six tree species; Acacia dealbata, Banksia integrifolia, Eucalyptus viminalis, Platanus acerifolia, Pinus radiata and Quercus robur. Trial 2 involved only two tree species; Corymbia maculata (syn. Eucalyptus maculata) and Populus deltoides X tricocarpa. At the completion of both trials it was apparent that <b>bark</b> patch <b>grafts</b> successfully reattach and that they may assist the rate of callus formation after wounding. The use of <b>bark</b> patch <b>grafts,</b> as tree wound treatments, is therefore acceptable as an arboricultural technique.

40|$|The Malling 9 (M. 9) dwarfing {{rootstock}} {{is widely used}} in apple breeding and commercial cultivation to shorten the juvenile period, reduce vegetative growth and increase flowering of the scion. A segment of M. 9 stem (interstock) or M. 9 <b>bark</b> <b>grafted</b> into a compound tree can cause significant dwarfing of the scion, suggesting that the dwarfing signal may be vascular derived. To better understand how the M. 9 rootstock alters the growth {{and development of the}} scion, we compared gene expression in vascular-enriched tissue from dwarfing and vigorous rootstocks. RNA sequencing indicated that key flowering genes were upregulated in M. 9 relative to a vigorous rootstock, Malling 793 (M. 793). An in-depth analysis of the apple FT/TFL 1 gene family identified four new members: MdMFTa, MdMFTb, MdBFTa and MdBFTb. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the higher expression of MdFT 1 / 2, MdBFTa/b, MdCO, MdGI, and MdSOC 1 in two different {{dwarfing rootstock}}s (M. 9 and Malling 27 (M. 27)) relative to M. 793. Both MdFT 1 / 2, and MdBFTa/b were expressed at higher levels in multiple dwarfing rootstock accessions relative to more vigorous genotypes. In perennial species, FT promotes flowering, and has additional roles in accelerating the transition from juvenility to maturity, and regulating cycles of seasonal growth and termination. Apple dwarfing rootstocks reduce the juvenile phase and promote both flowering and early shoot termination. Our work supports a role for MdFT in promoting flowering and earlier shoot termination. We suggest that upregulation of a suite of flowering genes including MdFT, and possibly MdBFT, in the vasculature is part of the underlying mechanism of apple dwarfing rootstocks. Genes involved with response to biotic and abiotic stress and disease were also upregulated in the M. 9 rootstock, suggesting that stress, possibly mediated by JA and ABA signalling, also plays a role in the M. 9 -induced phenotype...|$|R

5000|$|The {{rootstock}} {{that the}} cherry is grafted onto {{can play a}} significant role in the disease symptoms seen. Rootstocks of Mahaleb cherry exhibit different symptoms from stocks of Colt, Mazzard, or Stockton Morello. When the scion is grafted onto Mahaleb, symptoms consistent with Phytophthora root rot can be seen. To distinguish between root rot and x-disease the wood under the <b>bark</b> at the <b>graft</b> union should be examined. If it is x-disease the wood at the union will have grooves and pits this causes a browning of the phloem and shows the cells in decline. This rapid decline is caused by the rootstock cells near the graft union dying in large quantities. Foliage begins to turn yellow and the curl upward and inward toward the leaf midrib. Trees infected with Mahaleb rootstock die by late summer or early the following year.|$|R
