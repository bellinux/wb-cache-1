5|$|Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as Jean-Paul Ngassa and Thérèse Sita-Bella {{explored}} similar themes. In the 1960s, Mongo Beti, Ferdinand Léopold Oyono {{and other}} writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and {{the recovery of}} African identity. Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa and Daniel Kamwa dealt with the conflicts <b>between</b> <b>traditional</b> and post-colonial society. Literature and films {{during the next two}} decades concentrated more on wholly Cameroonian themes.|$|E
5|$|Tension <b>between</b> <b>traditional</b> Khitan {{social and}} {{political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was {{a defining feature of}} the dynasty. This tension led to a series of succession crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, while {{much of the rest of}} the Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is based}} upon Cochrane's {{doctoral}} thesis, which was completed at the London School of Economics, and builds upon subjects he had discussed in previous publications, including his first book. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. It was published by Columbia University Press as the second book in their series Critical Perspectives on Animals, edited by Gary Francione and Gary Steiner. Critics {{from a variety of}} backgrounds responded positively to the book, focussing on how Cochrane had found a middle ground <b>between</b> <b>traditional</b> animal rights philosophy and utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|The {{first modern}} Indonesian novels {{published}} by the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies Balai Pustaka were often written to show intergenerational conflict and conflict <b>between</b> <b>traditional</b> (adat) and modern culture. These novels, published beginning in the 1920s, spearheaded the use of Indonesian as a national language. This national awakening, which was also realised through political actions, was followed in July 1933 {{with the establishment of}} the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe (New Writer). The literary magazine, which Belenggus author Armijn Pane helped establish, was the first written mainly in Indonesian and with exclusively Indonesian editors.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} is very uneven and, with few exceptions, is heavily slanted toward organisms with hard parts, leaving most groups of soft-bodied organisms {{with little to}} no fossil record. The groups {{considered}} {{to have a good}} fossil record, including a number of transitional fossils <b>between</b> <b>traditional</b> groups, are the vertebrates, the echinoderms, the brachiopods and some groups of arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict <b>between</b> <b>traditional</b> Confucian values (such as the implication that the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E

5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} the Slender Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} <b>between</b> <b>traditional</b> folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, {{the fact that the}} Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E
