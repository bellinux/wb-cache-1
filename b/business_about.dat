25|$|Toshiba - 東芝 電力システム社 原子力事業部 Toshiba has {{maintained}} a large nuclear business focused mostly on Boiling Water Reactors. With {{the purchase of the}} American Westinghouse by 5.4 Billion USD in 2006, which is focused mainly on Pressurized Water Reactor technology, it increased the size of its nuclear <b>business</b> <b>about</b> twofold. On 29 March 2017 Toshiba placed Westinghouse in Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of $9 billion of losses from its nuclear reactor construction projects, mostly the construction of four AP1000 reactors in the U.S.. Toshiba still has a profitable maintenance and nuclear fuel supply business in Japan, and is a significant contractor in the Fukushima clean-up.|$|E
25|$|In 1808, the American Fur Company was {{organized}} by German-born John Jacob Astor. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day Fond du Lac on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with Lake Vermillion to the north, and with the Mississippi River to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor {{got out of the}} <b>business</b> <b>about</b> 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.|$|E

[...] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was [...] "almost nil", he and Ditko had [...] "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas.

2500|$|Schulz {{decided to}} produce {{all aspects of}} the strip himself from the script to the {{finished}} art and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of Peanuts. Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz's frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing [...] "its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions." [...] Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: [...] "This is not a crazy <b>business</b> <b>about</b> slinging ink. This is a deadly serious business." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 9, 1956, Presley {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on The Ed Sullivan Show (after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the Dorsey Brothers, Milton Berle, and Steve Allen), even though Sullivan had previously vowed never to allow Presley on the show. According to biographer Michael David Harris, [...] "Sullivan signed Presley when the host was having an intense Sunday-night rivalry with Steve Allen. Allen had the singer on July 1 and trounced Sullivan in the ratings. When asked to comment, the CBS star said that he wouldn't consider presenting Presley before a family audience. Less than two weeks later {{he changed his mind}} and signed a contract. The newspapers asked him to explain his reversal. 'What I said then was off the reports I'd heard. I hadn't even seen the guy. Seeing the kinescopes, I don't know what the fuss was all about. For instance, the <b>business</b> <b>about</b> rubbing the thighs.

It was like a party in the studio, the energy was so high and chemistry was genuine". The song was included on the soundtrack of the Brazilian soap opera Ti Ti Ti (2010). The song officially impacted the radios on January 19, 2010. However, the full single release was postponed, so that [...] "Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)" [...] could be pushed forward as the fourth single. Keys and Knowles recorded their respective parts in same studios with engineer Ann Mincieli. [...] "Put It in a Love Song" [...] was recorded in two studios at Oven Studios and MSR Studios in New York City.|$|E
