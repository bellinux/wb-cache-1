40|$|The {{investigation}} {{objects are}} the engine-tractor sets (ETS) on {{base of the}} DT- 175 S tractor and its modification with DPM and pneumohydraulic mounting. The aim {{of the work is}} to increase the efficiency of functioning ETS at the expense of applying SPE with free air induction and pneumohydraulic elastic element in the tractor mounting mechanism. The stand and service tests have been performed. The mathematical models of tractor operation with SPE and pneumohydraulic elastic element in mounting in the operation conditions have been created; the method of Diesel engine deforcing in SPE and method decreasing the dynamic tractor loading {{at the expense of the}} elastic elements have been developed. The recommendations on applying three traction range stages of the transmission in DT- 175 S with SPE and also torque converter with its automatic <b>block-system</b> and pneumohydraulic mounting have been developed. The recommendations have been introduced in the Open Type Joint-Stock Companies "Volgogradsky Traktorny Zavod" and "Volgogradsky motorny Zavod", in the Joint-Stock Company "Volgo-Don" and in educational process. The increase of productivity by 6 - 14 % and efficiency by 8 - 14 % is provided. The application of pneumohydraulic mounting increases additionally these indices by 4 - 10 % and 4 - 20 %, correspondingly.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction of}} parallel iterative solvers for finite element approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations on unstructured grids using domain decomposition methods. The iterative method used is FGMRES, preconditioned by a parallel adaptation of a recent block preconditioner proposed by Kay, Loghin and Wathen. The parallelisation is achieved by adapting the technology of our domain decomposition solver DOUG (previously used for scalar problems) to <b>block-systems.</b> An application of the resultant linear solver to the stability assessment of flows is briefly indicated...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{solution}} techniques of Newton-multigrid type for the resulting nonlinear saddle-point <b>block-systems</b> if higher order continuous Galerkin-Petrov (cGP(k)) and discontinuous Galerkin (dG(k)) time discretizations {{are applied to}} the nonstation-ary incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In particular for the cGP(2) method with quadratic ansatz functions in time, which lead to 3 rd order accuracy in the L 2 -norm and even to 4 th order superconvergence in the endpoints of the time intervals, together with the finite element pair Q 2 /P disc 1 for the spatial approximation of velocity and pressure leading to a globally 3 rd order scheme, we explain the algorithmic details as well as implementation aspects. All presented solvers are analyzed {{with respect to their}} numerical costs for two prototypical flow configurations...|$|R

The parallelization is achieved by adapting the technology of our domain decomposition solver DOUG (previously used for scalar problems) to <b>block-systems.</b> The iterative solver is applied to shifted linear systems that arise in eigenvalue calculations. To illustrate {{the performance of the}} solver, we compare several strategies both theoretically and practically for the calculation of the eigenvalues of large sparse non-symmetric matrices arising in the assessment of the stability of flow past a cylinder.
