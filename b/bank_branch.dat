5|$|At Euston, major {{reconstruction}} {{works were}} undertaken {{to incorporate the}} new Victoria line platforms so that cross-platform interchanges could be provided with the Northern line's Bank branch—the former C route to King's Cross and Bank. Unlike the former CCE platforms, which were in separate tunnels with side platforms, the <b>Bank</b> <b>branch</b> tracks served an island platform in a single large tunnel. These platforms suffered from dangerous overcrowding at peak times. To provide cross-platform interchange, a new section of tunnel was constructed for northbound <b>Bank</b> <b>branch</b> trains, which were diverted to a new platform south of the original alignment. The redundant northbound track bed in the station tunnel was filled in to form a wider southbound platform. The new Victoria line platforms were excavated between and parallel to the original and the new <b>Bank</b> <b>branch</b> tunnels. Each pair of platforms was linked via a concourse served by escalators.|$|E

30|$|This paper used ATM and <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> data to {{construct}} the financial inclusion index in the SAARC countries. The use of ATM and <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> data {{in the context of}} geography and demography showed the density of ATM and <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> in a locality. The presence of ATM and <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> in a locality showed the availability of ATM facilities and <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> in the locality and among the people. The accessibility of ATMs and <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> reduces transaction costs and saves customers’ time, which ultimately encourages them to conduct more financial transactions with the banks. Furthermore, for the construction of financial inclusion in SAARC countries, the study used the data related to credit and deposits as a percentage of GDP, showing the usability of banking services among the people.|$|R

25|$|After {{purchasing}} the PSFS <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> and the PSFS name from Meritor, Mellon began operating its <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> as Mellon PSFS.

5|$|Although the C {{was well}} used, low ticket {{prices and the}} {{construction}} cost of the extensions placed a strain on the company's finances. In 1913, the C {{became part of the}} Underground Group of railways and, in the 1920s, it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of the Group's railways, the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway, forming a single London Underground line called the Morden-Edgware line. In 1933, the C {{and the rest of the}} Underground Group was taken into public ownership.

40|$|Abstract Econometric {{estimates}} {{of the level of}} efficiency at <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> are likely to provide detailed insight into the overall level of efficiency in banking. Therefore this paper uses Bayesian stochastic frontier analysis to assess the production efficiency of 61 <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> in the nine provinces of the Republic of South Africa. We find that every branch is operating at increasing returns to scale and that the level of production efficiency of <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> is lower than it could be. We also find that at current levels of output, on average, <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> can reduce their costs by about 17 % if they improve the level of efficiency. In addition, we find that Gauteng Province has the lowest average level of returns to scale, while the Free State Province has the highest average level of the nine provinces. In addition, via {{estimates of}} the posterior mean for shares and price elasticities, we find that the price of capital is the largest predicted proportion of costs. These findings suggest that <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> could also obtain cost reductions by increasing the level of output. Regulatory policy reforms and competitive incentives to enable banks to meet this objective should be encouraged.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to find regularities and {{patterns}} of <b>banking</b> <b>branches</b> distribution in particular regions. In {{the first part of}} the work there is a detailed overview of location behaviour of the selected banks in the Czech regions and districts. The second part represents simple process of finding ideal location for future <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> establishing. This process is also applied to case studies, which are part of this thesis as well. The results show that geographical distribution of selected banks corresponds to the urban system of the Czech Republic. The capital city of Prague proved to be exceptional considering urban structure of the Czech republic. The analysis shows quite high differences in <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> distribution in Czech districts. Very high concentration in relation to number of inhabitants was recorded in border districts of Plzeňský region and Jihočeský region. On the other hand, Most district and Ústí nad Labem district still offer high potential for <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> expansion. We can expect continuing of <b>bank</b> <b>branches</b> expansion, because branches still have irreplaceable position regarding bank operations and creating new bank accounts...|$|R
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing the lifts. The escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line <b>Bank</b> <b>branch</b> platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level so as to avoid the need to use the escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway. The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell was {{admitted}} to the Harrison County bar on June 1, 1848 and began to practice law soon after. During the early years of his legal career, he provided legal services in Braxton, Gilmer, Lewis, and Upshur counties. He relocated to Doddridge County in 1852 and established a law practice in West Union. While practicing in West Union, he served two terms as the Commonwealth's attorney for Doddridge County. Maxwell was named as an authorized superintendent to receive capital stock when the assembly permitted the establishment of a <b>bank</b> <b>branch</b> in West Union on March 15, 1856 and March 27, 1858. Maxwell, seeking to expand his law practice, and wanting greater opportunities for advancement, moved to Clarksburg in 1857, where he established a law partnership with Burton Despard creating the law practice of Despard and Maxwell. Despard and Maxwell offered their legal services to clients in Doddridge, Harrison, Lewis, Ritchie, and Taylor counties. In 1865, Nathan Goff, Jr. joined their law partnership, after which it was known as Despard, Maxwell, and Goff. Goff later became a United States Circuit Judge and served as a United States Senator from West Virginia.|$|E
