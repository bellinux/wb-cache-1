25|$|Finding all {{solutions}} to the eight queens puzzle {{is a good example}} of a simple but nontrivial problem. For this reason, it is often used as an example problem for various programming techniques, including nontraditional approaches such as constraint programming, logic programming or genetic algorithms. Most often, it is used as an example of a problem that can be solved with a recursive algorithm, by phrasing the n queens problem inductively in terms of adding a single queen to any solution to the problem of placing n1 queens on an n-by-n chessboard. The induction <b>bottoms</b> <b>out</b> with the solution to the 'problem' of placing 0 queens on the chessboard, which is the empty chessboard.|$|E

U.S. Navy policy {{was to use}} its best combat pilots to train newer pilots, {{in contrast to the}} Japanese practice of keeping their best pilots flying combat missions. Ensign Edward L. [...] "Whitey" [...] Feightner, who served with O'Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O'Hare passed on to him, was [...] "If you ever jump one of these Zeros and you surprise him, remember, the first thing he's going to do is a loop. Don't follow him into it! By the time you go into it a second time, he'll be behind you. The first thing you should do when he starts up the loop is make a hard right turn and keep turning. You'll come right around, and when he <b>bottoms</b> <b>out</b> of the loop, you'll be right on his tail!" [...] O'Hare also related [...] "First of all, remember, in today's world, whenever you take off and engage the enemy, you're going to be outnumbered.

40|$|The impact {{properties}} of six foam materials used for energy absorption as the liner of children’s helmets, reported by Gimbel and Hoshizaki are considered further. In high-energy impacts, almost complete compression {{of the energy}} absorbing material (<b>bottoming</b> <b>out)</b> may occur, and {{the severity of the}} impact increases greatly. Too soft a material means <b>bottoming</b> <b>out</b> occurs at low speeds, but if it is too stiff, the material itself is injurious. The fitting of equations to results in‘no bottoming out’ and ‘bottoming out’ conditions may help assessment of what compromise is appropriate. The equations in this article correspond to peak acceleration being proportional to power functions of impactor speed and mass. 1. When there was no <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> peak acceleration was found to be proportional to mˆ(c- 1). vˆ(2 c), with c being approximately 0. 25. 2. For <b>bottoming</b> <b>out,</b> peak acceleration was found to be proportional to mˆ(p). vˆ(q), with p and q being approximately 2 and approximately 3. 3. The constants of proportionality were related to material density in a regular way. Timothy Paul Hutchinso...|$|R
