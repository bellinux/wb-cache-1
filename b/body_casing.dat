The {{authors have}} been {{operating}} a real-environment speech-oriented information guidance system named "Takemarukun" daily at the Ikoma City North Community Center. The system introduces an example-based one-question-one-answer strategy, noise rejection and an adult versus child user discrimination mechanism. As a result, it realizes robust response generation since its initial operation in Nov. 2002. Following {{the success of}} “Takemaru-kun”, two additional systems were developed and installed in a railway station, side by side, since Apr. 2006. Although the three systems share the same core software, “Takemaru-kun” and “Kita-chan” employ CG agents and “Kita-robo” has a robot-like <b>body</b> <b>casing.</b> At the railway station, users can talk to the system of their preference. In this paper, we introduce the two later information guidance systems and report their initial operational results including an analysis of user utterances according to age groups. An analytical result shows that children’s utterances to the robot are {{twice as many as}} those to the CG agent. In addition to that, it is observed that children do not make difference in question topics between the systems, but adults do...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste computers {{is an issue that}} is gaining increasing interest around the world. In this paper, results from the fast pyrolysis in a fluidized bed reactor of three different waste computer monitor casings composed of mainly acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) copolymer and two different waste computer body casings composed of mostly poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) type polymers are presented. Preliminary characterization of the waste plastics was investigated using coupled thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TGA-FT-IR). The results showed that the plastics decomposed in two stages. For the ABS-containing monitor casings, aromatic and aliphatic material were released in the first and second stages. The PVC-containing computer <b>body</b> <b>casing</b> samples showed a first-stage evolution of HCl and a second stage evolution of aromatic and aliphatic material and further HCl. In addition, each of the five plastics was fast-pyrolyzed in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor at 500 °C. The fluidized bed pyrolysis led to the conversion of most of the plastics to pyrolysis oil, although the two PVC computer body cases produced large quantities of HCl. The pyrolysis oils were characterized by GC-MS and it was found that they were chemically very heterogeneous and contained a wide range of aliphatic, aromatic, halogenated, oxygenated, and nitrogenated compounds...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibration}} of {{the railway}} superstructure is mainly influenced by its quality, by the operational technical conditions, climatic phenomena {{and above all}} by the dynamic load by the pair of wheels of the rail vehicles and also {{by the quality of}} railway subgrade. Simultaneously, the dynamic parameters also depend on the speed of rail vehicles, on the arrangement of axles, their spring mounting and on the spring mounting of the <b>body</b> <b>casing</b> or on the weight acting on the axle, and last but not least, also {{on the quality of the}} running surface of the wheel tyre. The dynamic effects of sets of wagons are transferred through the rails to the rail pads below the base of the rails, then to the sleepers or bearers and fastening system, then to the ballast bed and also to the superstructure construction. This fact applies especially for turnout structures. In turnout rigidity is changed and also there is a place where the wheel passes over a gap (in case of fixed crossings). In particular of above mentioned reasons, turnout is a place where high dynamic effects occurre and that is why often defects occurre. Dissertation thesis will be focused on measurement and analysis of the dynamic effects on turnout. The point of the thesis will be updating recent system (observing of the geometrical parameters and wear of the rails in turnouts) for dynamic effect observe. Methodology of the measurement and convenient mathematical apparatus for analysing dynamic effect will be proposed...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{processes}} used for retreading tires, called Mold Cure and Pre Cure. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as shearograph to locate non-visible damage and embedded debris and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires {{over the life of}} the tire <b>body.</b> <b>Casings</b> fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.|$|R

30|$|For the {{straight}} {{part of the}} well, the ground compaction would cause large, plastic, and compressive strain in the casing connections in the pay zone. Once the reservoir compacts, the displacement {{at the top of}} the reservoir can cause significant tensile strain along the casing above the pay zone. If the connection between casings is not as strong as the <b>casing</b> <b>body,</b> joint failure can occur in compression in the pay zone. In a reservoir, compressive strain will quickly yield the casing and joints, while the tensile strain in the overburden generally will stay elastic, but can exceed the joint strength if the connection is weak in tension. A huge axial load from <b>casing</b> <b>body</b> can also cause the joint failure. So, the joints need to be as good as the <b>casing</b> <b>body</b> in both tension and compression within the pay zone and for a few hundred feet above the pay zone. It is always good to meet this criterion during the casing design to avoid unnecessary risks for the well.|$|R
50|$|It {{presents}} interesting {{properties that}} promise substantial improvements in system efficiency. Due to its high fluid density, s enables extremely compact and highly efficient turbomachinery. It can use simpler, single <b>casing</b> <b>body</b> designs while steam turbines require multiple turbine stages and associated casings, {{as well as}} additional inlet and outlet piping. The high density allows for highly compact, microchannel-based heat exchanger technology.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} clearly {{distinguish}} the steel grade, tubing, casing and its coupling should be painted with color codes respectively. Color bands should be painted on tubing and <b>casing</b> <b>body</b> longer than 600mm to either end. The whole outer-body of the coupling {{needs to be}} painted color and then color codesAPI 5B and 5CT provide various steel grades and color codes of each grade, offering detailed and overall information of casing and tubing, which help you clearly pick out the most suitable products for different well application.|$|R

40|$|When {{the thermal}} {{stresses}} induced in a geothermal well’s casing string exceed the yield {{strength of the}} casing material, the fatigue behavior of the latter {{can be defined as}} low cycle fatigue (LCF). The connection threads in the <b>casing</b> <b>body</b> amplify the local stress distribution and lower LCF resistance. A theoretical approach is presented to evaluate LCF resistance and compared with preliminary results from experiments on a large diameter buttress connection. The latter is commonly used in geothermal well completions. This paper shows that, under extreme loads, the LCF resistance of the buttress thread connection can be as low as 10 cycles...|$|R

The sensing assembly is immersed within a casing which is mounted to the structural member. The sensing assembly includes a support body and an accelerometer mounted to the support body for measuring movement of the structural member. The accelerometer is aligned with an anticipated line of motion such that measurements can be made along this line of motion. A pair of lever arms are pivotally mounted to the support body for removably securing the support <b>body</b> within the <b>casing.</b> A spring is mounted between the support body and lever arms for continuously biasing the lever arms to a position perpendicular with the support body...|$|R
30|$|Local {{buckling}} is buckling {{along the}} casing wall while the center {{line of the}} casing stays straight. This contrasts with column buckling where the center line of the casing bends. It occurs at very short lengths, when the casing is sufficiently well supported to prevent column buckling. Also, {{it is more likely}} to occur in the <b>casing</b> <b>body</b> near the connection. However, if {{there is a lack of}} support, critical column buckling would occur and dominate the casing damage prior to any significant local buckling. So, local buckling is believed to be not a problem for working through the casing. This is especially true if certain provisions are considered in the wellbore completion such as protection casing as will be discussed later in this paper.|$|R
5000|$|Multi-jet meters {{are very}} {{accurate}} in small sizes and {{are commonly used}} in ⅝" [...] to 2" [...] sizes for residential and small commercial users. Multi-jet meters use multiple ports surrounding an internal chamber to create multiple jets of water against an impeller, whose rotation speed depends on the velocity of water flow. Multi-jets are very accurate at low flow rates, {{but there are no}} large size meters since {{they do not have the}} straight-through flow path needed for the high flow rates used in large pipe diameters. Multi-jet meters generally have an internal strainer element that can protect the jet ports from getting clogged. Multi-jet meters normally have bronze alloy <b>bodies</b> or outer <b>casings,</b> with internal measuring parts made from modern thermoplastics and stainless steel.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{traditional}} Malay lore, {{the human soul}} (semangat or essence) {{is about the size}} of a thumb and appears as a miniature form of the <b>body</b> (sarung or <b>casing)</b> in which it resides. Able to fly and quickly [...] "flash" [...] from one location to another, the soul is often compared to and addressed as if it were a bird. It temporarily leaves the person's body during sleep, trance and sickness, before departing permanently at death. When the soul leaves the body it assumes the form of a sort of homunculus, and in this form can feed on the souls of others. At death, the soul usually passes into another person, animal or plant. The spirit or ghost, usually called the Anitu or Hantu, continues to linger and may be harmful to its survivors.|$|R
50|$|There {{were similar}} aspects {{to all the}} murders. Each of the bodies had been {{deliberately}} posed face-down with their hands behind their backs, covered by a pyramidal frame of sticks and ferns. Forensic study determined that each had suffered multiple stab wounds to the torso. The killer had evidently spent considerable time with the victims both {{during and after the}} murders, as campsites were discovered close to the location of each <b>body</b> and shell <b>casings</b> of the same calibre were also identified at each site. Walters and Schmidl had been stabbed, whereas Clarke and Neugebauer had been shot numerous times in the head and stabbed post-mortem. Habschied had been decapitated and other victims showed signs of strangulation and severe beatings. Speculation arose that the crimes were the work of several killers, at least two.|$|R
50|$|The grenade was a three-piece weapon, {{consisting}} of the plunger (or nostril), <b>casing</b> (<b>body</b> or orange shell, containing main charge), and tailpiece. The slightly convex metal plunger was removed to set the percussion cap on the nipple within the casing; the plunger was refitted through means of depressing by the striking of something hard and solid to drive it back. This proved to be difficult, especially in the fray of battle. The wood tailpiece was removed to place the powder charge inside the shell, and then set firmly back in to hold the powder within. Trajectory had to be an arc {{in order for the}} plunger to detonate the piece. A small pressure spring attached {{to the side of the}} plunger stem held the plunger in place during flight. The grenade was stabilized by four thin paper fins set into a wood tailpiece protruding from the rear of the projectile.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, noise {{reduction}} is improved by housing electrodes in box-shaped metal casings. The {{distance from the}} tip of each electrode to its dedicated amplifier is kept short at ~  10  cm, amplifiers are mounted inside the metal electrode casings, and those metal casings cover the entire region near the heart to act as noise shielding. Further, since electrodes are pushed into the interior of the housings with <b>body</b> contact, metal <b>casings</b> are drawn closer to the body-surface to increase noise shielding during measurement. Effective shielding has been demonstrated up to 71.92 μT, which is {{in the vicinity of the}} 60  Hz, 83.3 μT guideline value of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Further, when measurements were made intentionally exposing the measurement platform to high amplitude electromagnetic radiation (noise), some noise effects were observable but large differences in measurement values between the high-noise and normal environment were not observed. Accordingly, noise shielding is sufficient to measure body-surface potential under normal (low radiation) conditions. In addition, electrode casings are joined in a ball-joint fashion allowing independent movement and rotation. Each electrode casing can incline independently to conform to the contour of the body making it easy to establish reliable contact with accurate electrode positioning.|$|R
5000|$|Homer [...] "Sonny" [...] Hickam, Jr. {{lives in}} a small coal mining town in West Virginia named Coalwood. Sonny, after seeing the Russian {{satellite}} Sputnik, decides to join the American team of rocket engineers called the Missile Agency when he graduates from school. (Note: In the book Rocket Boys, the main character is always called Sonny. In the movie October Sky, he is called Homer.) Sonny's older brother, Jim Hickam, excels at football and expects to get a college football scholarship. Sonny, however, is terrible at sports and has no special skill that would get him [...] "out of Coalwood". Sonny's mother is afraid {{that he will have}} to work in the mines after high school. Sonny's first attempt at rocketry consists of a flashlight tube and model airplane <b>body</b> as a <b>casing.</b> It is fueled by flash powder from old cherry bombs. It explodes violently, destroying his mother's fence. After that, Sonny enlists the help of Quentin Wilson, Roy Lee Cooke, Sherman Siers, Jimmy [...] "O'Dell" [...] Carroll, and Billy Rose to help build rockets while forming the BCMA (Big Creek Missile Agency). Their first real rocket, powered by black powder, is named Auk 1. This an allusion to the great auk, which is a flightless seabird that became extinct in the mid-19th century. Auk 1 flies six feet before the solder melts, and the nozzle, a washer, separates from the casement. They call themselves [...] "Rocket Boys" [...] and call the place where they are launching their rockets [...] "Cape Coalwood", in honor of Cape Canaveral. The Rocket Boys enjoy mixed success during their three-year rocket launching campaign (1957 to 1960). They employ several fuel mixtures including rocket candy and a mixture called [...] "zincoshine", which is composed of zinc dust and sulfur, along with alcohol from moonshine, supplied by a local bootlegger, as a binder for the mixture. They launch a total of 35 rockets, all sequentially numbered Auk I-XXXI. (There are five different Auk XXIIs.) They also win a National Science Fair gold medal for their rockets, for their project titled [...] "A Study of Amateur Rocketry Techniques." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{contains the}} detailed calculations {{that support the}} spray leak accident analysis in the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). The consequence analyses in this document {{form the basis for}} the selection of controls to mitigate or prevent spray leaks throughout TWRS. Pressurized spray leaks can occur due to a breach in containment barriers along transfer routes, during waste transfers. Spray leaks are of particular safety concern because, depending on leak dimensions, and waste pressure, they can be relatively efficient generators of dispersible sized aerosols that can transport downwind to onsite and offsite receptors. Waste is transferred between storage tanks and between processing facilities and storage tanks in TWRS through a system of buried transfer lines. Pumps for transferring waste and jumpers and valves for rerouting waste are located inside below grade pits and structures that are normally covered. Pressurized spray leaks can emanate to the atmosphere due to breaches in waste transfer associated equipment inside these structures should the structures be uncovered {{at the time of the}} leak. Pressurized spray leaks can develop through holes or cracks in transfer piping, valve <b>bodies</b> or pump <b>casings</b> caused by such mechanisms as corrosion, erosion, thermal stress, or water hammer. Leaks through degraded valve packing, jumper gaskets, or pump seals can also result in pressurized spray releases. Mechanisms that can degrade seals, packing and gaskets include aging, radiation hardening, thermal stress, etc. An 1782 other common cause for spray leaks inside transfer enclosures are misaligned jumpers caused by human error. A spray leak inside a DST valve pit during a transfer of aging waste was selected as the bounding, representative accident for detailed analysis. Sections 2 through 5 below develop this representative accident using the DOE- STD- 3009 format. Sections 2 describes the unmitigated and mitigated accident scenarios evaluated to determine the need for safety class SSCs or TSR controls. Section 3 develops the source terms associated with the unmitigated and mitigated accident scenarios. Section 4 estimates the radiological and toxicological consequences for the unmitigated and mitigated scenarios. Section 5 compares the radiological and toxicological consequences against the TWRS evaluation guidelines. Section 6 extrapolates from the representative accident case to other represented spray leak sites to assess the conservatism in using the representative case to define controls for other postulated spray leak sites throughout TWRS. Section 7 discusses the sensitivities of the consequence analyses to the key parameters and assumptions used in the analyses. Conclusions are drawn in Section 8. The analyses herein pertain to spray leaks initiated due to internal mechanisms (e. g., corrosion, erosion, thermal stress, etc). External initiators of spray leaks (e. g., excavation accidents), and natural phenomena initiators (e. g., seismic events) are to be covered in separate accident analyses...|$|R
