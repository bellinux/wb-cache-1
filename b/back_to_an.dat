5|$|According to Martin Noth, {{a scholar}} of the Hebrew Bible, the {{narratives}} of Isaac date <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> older cultural stage {{than that of the}} West-Jordanian Jacob. At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").|$|E
5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} {{subscribe to}} a young-earth creationist point of view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times {{that he did not}} take the Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E
5|$|Mrs. Tiggy-winkle {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Potter's most positive creations, but critics consider Lucie an artistic failure. Although Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is set in an identifiable place and time period, the tale is mythologized by reaching <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> age when household chores were performed manually and without the aid of modern mechanical inventions. The simple dwellings, rustic pathways, and stone fences enhance the tale's timeless aspect and suggest an unchanging countryside and its way of life.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} Amara {{can be traced}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> area of low {{pressure}} embedded within a monsoon trough southeast of Diego Garcia on December13, 2013. Computer models suggested that surrounding atmospheric conditions would later become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the course of the day, the localized area of circulation remained sheared, though convection remained persistent. Despite the hindering atmospheric environment, the system organized faster than anticipated, and was classified as a tropical disturbance by Météo-France at 1200UTC on December14. Shortly after development, the disturbance underwent a reformation phase and consequently a new center of circulation developed, allowing the system to reach tropical depression status early on December15. Nonetheless, the storm's overall structure remained ill-defined due to the presence of wind shear and multiple mesovortices.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Doria are traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> area of {{disturbed}} weather off the northeastern coast of Florida on September 4. For several days, the low pressure system meandered as its central barometric pressure gradually fell. The storm {{is estimated to}} have organized into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 8. At the time, it was situated north of Grand Bahama Island. Drifting westward, the cyclone attained tropical storm intensity early the next day. Doria turned northeastward and accelerated as it moved away from Florida. On September 10, the tropical storm achieved hurricane force. Cold air became entrained into the hurricane's circulation by September 11, causing it to weaken to a tropical storm. However, its forward motion slowed and it once again strengthened.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of manumission is confirmed to have existed in Chios from the 6th century BC. It probably dates <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> earlier period, {{as it was}} an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, either at the theatre or before a public tribunal. This practice was outlawed in Athens {{in the middle of}} the 6th century BC to avoid public disorder.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{became the}} District line of London Transport. From 23 October 1933 a Piccadilly line service {{replaced}} the Harrow to Uxbridge District shuttle. In 1923 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) {{had taken over}} the L railway's outer circle service from Earl's Court and by the Second World War this had been cut <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> electrified Earl's Court to Willesden Junction shuttle. Following bombing of the West London Line in 1940 the LMS and the Metropolitan line services to Addison Road were both suspended. After the war, to serve the Kensington exhibition halls a District line shuttle service started from Earl's Court to Addison Road, now renamed Kensington Olympia.|$|E
5|$|While {{the name}} Sigyn is found {{as a female}} {{personal}} name in Old Norse sources (Old Norse sigr meaning 'victory' and vina meaning 'girl-friend'), and though in surviving sources she is largely restricted to a single role, she appears in the 9th century skaldic poem Haustlöng from pagan times, written by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir. Due to this early connection with Loki, Sigyn has been theorized as being a goddess dating <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> older form of Germanic paganism.|$|E

5|$|William Shakespeare {{was the son}} of John Shakespeare, an {{alderman}} and {{a successful}} glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning farmer. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day. This date, which can be traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616. He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.|$|E
5|$|A Vision of the Last Judgement is a {{painting}} by William Blake that was designed in 1808 before becoming a lost artwork. The painting was to be shown in an 1810 exhibition with a detailed analysis added to a second edition of his Descriptive Catalogue. This plan was dropped after the exhibition was cancelled, and the painting disappeared. Blake's notes for the Descriptive Catalogue describe {{various aspects of the}} work in a detailed manner, which allow the aspects of the painting to be known. Additionally, earlier designs that reveal similar Blake depiction of the Last Judgement have survived, and these date <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> 1805 precursor design created for Robert Blair's The Grave. In addition to Blake's notes on the painting, a letter written to Ozias Humphrey provides a description of the various images within an earlier design of the Last Judgement.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{organized}} into a tropical cyclone in the Andaman Sea, {{the origins of}} the 1999Odisha cyclone can be traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> area of convection that began developing in the Sulu Sea on October21. Despite some signs of development, wind shear suppressed outflow and prevented any significant organization. Tracking westward, the disturbance encountered a more favorable environment in the South China Sea; as a result, thunderstorm activity began to increase. Prompted by these changes, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 02:00UTC on 23October. However, the system failed to develop any further before wind shear reemerged in the Gulf of Thailand, causing convection to diminish and resulting in the cancellation of the TCFA. On 24October, the storm crossed the Malay Peninsula and moved into the Andaman Sea by 03:00UTC the following day. Although the environment remained moderately unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis, the disturbance organized, developing fair outflow, a strong rainband, and additional convection. At 06:00UTC on 25October, the system became a tropical depression while centered 550km (340mi) east of Port Blair. As such, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as BOB03. With the storm now steadily organizing, the JTWC once again issued a TCFA at 19:30UTC on 25October; early the following day, the IMD assessed that the nascent depression had strengthened into a cyclonic storm. At the time, the storm was located 325km (200mi) south-southeast of Rangoon, Myanmar.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the campaigning {{season of}} 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama. Their {{marriage}} {{was never to}} be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill-conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, just south of Nashville, Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised, after his horse was shot out from under him. Accounts later {{said that he was}} found just inside the Federal line and his body carried <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> aid station along the Columbia Turnpike.

5|$|The 1999 Odisha cyclone (IMD {{designation}} BOB 03, JTWC designation 05B) was {{the strongest}} recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and among the most destructive in the region. The 1999Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25October, though its origins could be traced <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior. The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day. Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28October before peaking with winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a record-low pressure of 912mbar (hPa; 26.93inHg). The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29October. The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1November over the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) also {{collected}} {{intelligence on}} Labuan {{and other parts}} of the Brunei Bay area during May. On the first of the month several RAAF PBY Catalina aircraft carrying SRD personnel overflew Labuan. These aircraft later landed near two native prahu and questioned their crews; two sailors were flown <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Allied base for further questioning. On 15 May two Malays working for the SRD were landed in Brunei Bay by a Catalina, and sailed to Labuan on board a prahu. These agents recruited a local civilian from Labuan, and the party was extracted by a Catalina near the mainland village of Kampong Mengalong on 19 May. The intelligence gained from these operations provided the Australians with a good understanding of Labuan's geography and infrastructure. In addition, civilians who had been recruited by the SRD's SEMUT 2 team (which had been parachuted into Borneo during April) provided intelligence on the size and movements of Labuan's garrison force.|$|E
