5|$|During the night, Sideshow <b>Bob</b> {{reaches the}} {{houseboat}} and cuts it {{loose from the}} dock. Sideshow <b>Bob</b> then ties up Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Santa's Little Helper to ensure they will not interfere with his plan. Sideshow <b>Bob</b> enters Bart's room, ready to kill him. Bart flees {{out the window and}} tries to escape, but he cannot jump off the boat. Sideshow <b>Bob</b> catches up to Bart and offers him a last request. Having noticed a sign saying that Springfield is fifteen miles away, Bart gets an idea; he compliments Sideshow <b>Bob</b> on his beautiful voice and asks him to sing the entire score of the H.M.S. Pinafore, to stall for time as the houseboat floats to Springfield. After the performance, Sideshow <b>Bob</b> advances on Bart again, but the boat runs aground, interrupting Sideshow <b>Bob</b> before he can finish him off. Sideshow <b>Bob</b> is arrested, and the Simpsons return home.|$|E
5|$|In prison, Sideshow <b>Bob</b> calls local right-wing {{talk show}} host Birch Barlow and {{complains}} about being unfairly imprisoned. Barlow and Springfield's residents pressure Mayor Quimby into releasing Sideshow <b>Bob.</b> Sideshow <b>Bob</b> is soon unveiled as the Republican candidate for the Springfield mayoral election. Determined to keep Sideshow <b>Bob</b> from becoming mayor, Bart and Lisa decide to campaign for Mayor Quimby. Unfortunately, due to Sideshow Bob's charisma and Mayor Quimby's drowsy, overmedicated appearance at a televised debate, Sideshow <b>Bob</b> wins the election by a massive margin.|$|E

He makes an {{appearance}} at a Krusty the Clown telethon and makes amends; Lisa encourages Bart to forgive Sideshow <b>Bob,</b> but {{he refuses to}} believe he has changed.

5|$|The {{next night}} is Krusty's {{farewell}} special, and as Krusty describes {{the history of}} his career, <b>Bob</b> straps Bart with explosives in order to kill Krusty. Bart attempts to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks to the audience about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow <b>Bob,</b> holding himself responsible of turning <b>Bob</b> into a ruthless criminal. Krusty even goes far by singing a song on behalf of <b>Bob,</b> stating how very remorseful he is of mistreating him. Upon witnessing this, <b>Bob</b> is touched and develops a change of heart, but does {{not have time to}} stop his original plan from being carried out. Luckily, Krusty's trained chimp Mr. Teeny sees the life-threatening explosives, which he throws into the network executives' office, killing all the executives, though they would later reanimate themselves like the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Bart comes out of his hypnotic state and he and his family serve dinner with Krusty, <b>Bob</b> and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and <b>Bob</b> reconcile, police decide to execute <b>Bob</b> by guillotine for his plot of attempted murder, although he argues with Chief Wiggum that he should have a trial for it at least.|$|E

Hungry and not wanting to be rude by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and <b>Bob</b> having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and <b>Bob</b> finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and <b>Bob</b> seductively put food in each other's mouths.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that concerted human activity such as bouncing or <b>bobbing</b> can excite cantilever grandstands. Crowd coordination can be unwitting {{and may be}} exacerbated by structural motion caused by resonant structural response. This {{is an area of}} uncertainty in the design and analysis of modern grandstands. This paper presents experimental measurement and analysis of rhythmic crowd <b>bobbing</b> loads obtained from tests on a grandstand simulator with two distinct support conditions; (a) rigid, and; (b) flexible. It was found that significant structural vibration at the <b>bobbing</b> frequency did not increase the effective <b>bobbing</b> load. Structural motion at the <b>bobbing</b> frequency caused a reduction in the dynamic load factor (DLF) at the frequency of the second harmonic while those at the first and third harmonics were unaffected. Two plausible reasons for this are: (a) the <b>bobbing</b> group were unable to supply significant energy to the system at the frequency of the second harmonic; (b) the <b>bobbing</b> group altered their <b>bobbing</b> style to reduce the response of the grandstand simulator. It was deduced that the <b>bobbing</b> group did not absorb energy from the dynamic system. Furthermore, dynamic load factors for groups of test subjects <b>bobbing</b> on a rigid structure were typically greater than those of synthesised groups derived from individuals <b>bobbing</b> alone, possibly due to group effects such as audio and visual stimuli from neighbouring test subjects. Last, the vibration levels experienced by the test subjects appear to be below levels likely to cause discomfort. This is to be expected as the test subjects were themselves controlling the magnitude and duration of vibration for the <b>bobbing</b> tests considered. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
5|$|<b>Bob</b> {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies {{about why they}} are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. <b>Bob</b> demands proof, and Sidney tells <b>Bob</b> to watch what happens in the wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. <b>Bob</b> sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. <b>Bob</b> drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bob</b> left {{extensive}} damage throughout New England in its wake, totaling approximately $1.5billion (1991 USD, $ USD). This made {{it one of}} the costliest United States hurricanes at the time; as of 2013, it ranked thirty-second in the category. In addition, seventeen fatalities were reported in association with <b>Bob.</b> The loss of life and most of the damage occurred as a result of high winds and rough seas. There were six confirmed tornadoes during its passage. <b>Bob</b> is the most recent hurricane to hit the New England states directly as a hurricane.|$|E
