40|$|Problem statement: The South and South East Asian {{countries}} {{are characterized by}} their rich biodiversity as well as cultural diversity. Agricultural expansion for livelihood security is leading {{to an increase in}} pesticide application in this region. It has been observed that because of the hot and humid conditions prevalent in this region, most farmers and pesticide applicators do not use proper protective gear, thereby exposing themselves to the hazards of pesticide poisoning. Another important issue is the exposure of infants and children to toxic pesticides, especially in congested urban slums and tenements. Approach: The biodiversity contained in the six biodiversity hotspots located in this region was also at considerable risk from the toxic effects of pesticides from agricultural fields as well as plantations of tea, coffee, rubber, oil palm, which were often present in close proximity of protected areas. Though a large number of countries in this region had ratified and/or signed important international conventions on pesticide manufacture, export-import and trans boundary movements such as the Stockholm, the Rotterdam and the <b>Basel</b> <b>conventions.</b> Results: A large number of hazardous pesticides was still in use in this region and require to be phased out. Information was lacking on the use status of several pesticides in smaller countries, thereby retaining a certain amount of ambiguity. Conclusion: Despite the grave nature of the pesticide use regulation issue in the Asia-Pacific, clear and uniform policy response is lacking in most countries of this region. These issues need to be addressed through dialogues and mutual cooperation both at national as well as international levels...|$|R

British forces in the Caribbean in 1796 had already taken French colonies such as Saint Lucia and later Dutch colonies in South America; Demerara and Essequibo. With the Spanish now at war with Great Britain, the general Ralph Abercromby thought it was right to necessarily render Spain's colonies an immediate object of attack.His first target was the Spanish island of Trinidad which being close proximity to Tobago which had been captured early in the war. The island had been Spanish since the third voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1498 and since 1777 was a province of the Captaincy General of Venezuela.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper will}} examine some {{commonly}} adopted {{approaches to the}} measurement of risk in finance and the various shortcomings implicit in the underpinnings of these approaches: early views {{on the nature of}} risk and uncertainty (Hume, Bernoulli, Knight, Keynes and Ramsey); the adoption of a mean variance decision choice criteria as a central foundation in financial economics and its accompanying limitations; the various approaches in financial econometrics to modelling volatility (ARCH, GARCH, stochastic volatility, realised volatility and attempts to capture ‘tail risk’); the measurement of risk implicit in applications of option pricing models and implied volatility (in particular the VIX index); the <b>Basel</b> Agreements and <b>convention</b> of modelling risk in a value at risk (VaR) framework; and the attractions of conditional value at risk (CVaR) as an alternative metric. I shall conclude with a consideration of the shortcomings of these various approaches when faced with a system wide shock as recently experienced in the global financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Portfolio Credit Risk Modelling for a Canadian SME Loans Portfolio Jade Michel Haddad The Basel II Capital Accords make {{strong and}} {{controversial}} assumptions on the behaviour of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in a credit portfolio. Benefiting from a rich, {{and as such}} rare, dataset of default and credit risk events, we measure the portfolio credit risk characteristics {{of one of the}} riskiest segments of the Canadian SME market. The depth of our data allows for robust segmentations of the data along dual dimensions, including risk grade and size of borrowers, not commonly found in the literature. This, in turn, allows for an SME-specific calibration of models for portfolio credit risk. In particular, we use the Merton-type asset value model (AVM) and the CreditRisk+ frameworks to present empirical estimates of the correlations that underline the relationship among borrower segments in the portfolio. In addition, we present loss distribution estimates for our SME portfolio under various extensions to the AVM and CreditRisk+. These extensions include a Multiple Correlated Sectors implementation of CreditRisk+ and simulation-based, as well as analytical implementations of both frameworks. Our results allow for a thorough testing of Basel II assumptions for portfolio credit risk and its application to SME borrowers. In particular, we present evidence in contrast to Basel II specifications on SME asset correlations, and quantify the impact of the single sector and infinite granularity assumptions in the Basel II Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach to portfolio credit risk. Our work is undertaken within a consistent calibration of the AVM and CreditRisk+ frameworks and presents an SME-specific calibration refinement for CreditRisk+. Finally, we focus on capital allocations under the Basel II framework and present a partial implementation analysis quantifying the impact of the application of various <b>Basel</b> II <b>conventions</b> to our SME portfolio. Capital allocations from our internally-calibrated portfolio credit risk frameworks reveal a misallocation of capital among SME segments under Basel II. Given our thorough assessment of both Basel II and the credit risk characteristics underlying SME portfolios, we provide suggestions for an improved SME portfolio credit risk management framework...|$|R
25|$|Because the United States has not {{ratified}} the <b>Basel</b> <b>Convention</b> or its Ban Amendment, and has few domestic federal laws forbidding {{the export of}} toxic waste, the Basel Action Network estimates that about 80% of the electronic waste directed to recycling in the U.S. does not get recycled there at all, but is put on container ships and sent to countries such as China. This figure is disputed as an exaggeration by the EPA, the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, and the World Reuse, Repair and Recycling Association.|$|E

25|$|Basel {{has often}} been the site of peace {{negotiations}} and other international meetings. The Treaty of Basel (1499) ended the Swabian War. Two years later Basel joined the Swiss Confederation. The Peace of Basel in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the First Coalition against France during the French Revolutionary Wars. In more recent times, the World Zionist Organization held its first congress in Basel from August 29 through August 31, 1897. Because of the Balkan Wars, the Second International held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the <b>Basel</b> <b>Convention</b> was opened for signature {{with the aim of}} preventing the export of hazardous waste from wealthy to developing nations for disposal.|$|E
25|$|E-waste is {{a growing}} problem, {{accounting}} for 20–50 million metric tons of global waste per year according to the EPA. It is also the fastest growing waste stream in the EU. Many recyclers do not recycle e-waste responsibly. After the cargo barge Khian Sea dumped 14,000 metric tons of toxic ash in Haiti, the <b>Basel</b> <b>Convention</b> was formed to stem the flow of hazardous substances into poorer countries. They created the e-Stewards certification to ensure that recyclers are held to the highest standards for environmental responsibility and to help consumers identify responsible recyclers. This works alongside other prominent legislation, such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the EU the United States National Computer Recycling Act, to prevent poisonous chemicals from entering waterways and the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|According to the Vietnamese Legislation, {{the entire}} {{population}} owns the water resources and single users and organizations are legally allowed to use {{them in order to}} meet their daily life and production. Apart from that, they are obligated {{to take care of a}} responsible water use and are supposed to protect all water resources. Nevertheless, the management of water resources is uniformly organized by the state. The legal framework concerning the management of water resources in general and the irrigation framework in particular is quite complicated in structure. Mainly, there are two documents providing rules and regulations for the use of water resources for irrigation. These are the Law on Water Resources (from the year 1998) and the Law on Land (replaced 1993). Especially for irrigation, there is the ordinance for the Exploitation and Protection of Irrigation Works and there are different secondary regulations concerning water use and the protection of water resources. Besides, Vietnam has approved of and ratified different international conventions. The most important ones are the Ramsar convention (1989), the International Convention on Biodiversity (1993), the Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong River Basin (1195), the <b>Basel</b> <b>Convention</b> (1995), the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2002), the UN Framework on Climate Change (2002), the Kyoto Protocol on the Clean Development Mechanism (2002).|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to large}} amounts of {{asbestos}} aboard the ship (mostly in machine and bulkhead areas), the Norway {{was not allowed to}} leave Germany for any scrap yards due to the <b>Basel</b> <b>Convention.</b> After assuring the German authorities that the Norway would go to Asia for repairs and further operation in Australia, she was allowed to leave port under tow. It was reported that the art from her two dining rooms, children's playroom, stairtower, and library were removed and placed in storage, to possibly be utilized on board a revitalized , or another ship in the NCL fleet. [...] Later photos of the Norway at the scrapyards of Alang, India, would prove this statement to be untrue.
