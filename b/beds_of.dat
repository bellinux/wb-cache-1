5|$|The oldest <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> this {{formation}} {{belong to}} the Dinosaur Canyon Member, a reddish, slope-forming rock layer with thin <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> siltstone that are interbedded with mudstone and fine sandstone. The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, ponds and large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils.|$|E
5|$|Dark, dumpy, aquatic {{birds that}} {{are able to}} forage for food on the <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> rivers. There are five species worldwide, with one {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
40|$|The <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be very useful {{in the design of}} new confined gap waveguide appearing between parallel metal plates with texture, as well as for removing cavity modes in microstrip circuit packages. As the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails is bulky at low frequencies due to the required height of the nails, a new version of this periodic structure is proposed herein, based on helices instead of nails. Thus, the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails is replaced by a <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> springs. The <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> springs is much more compact for use at low frequencies, and its bandwidth turns out to be similar. Thus, the new spring mattress approach is more comfortable than the Fakirs <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails at low frequencies...|$|R

5|$|I. hoggi (also spelled I. boggii or hoggii), {{named by}} Owen for a lower jaw from the Tithonian–Berriasian-age Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous Purbeck <b>Beds</b> <b>of</b> Dorset in 1874, has been reassigned {{to its own}} genus, Owenodon.|$|E
5|$|Its basal {{beds are}} {{found within the}} {{uppermost}} <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> the Onondaga Limestone or Needmore Shale, and the uppermost ash bed within the lowermost part of the Marcellus or Millboro Shale.|$|E
40|$|After the use <b>of</b> the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails for {{removing}} cavity modes in microstrip circuit packages, we propose herein {{a new version}} of this periodic structure, based on helices (springs) instead of nails. This new structure, named <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> springs, is much more compact, and this allows its use at low frequencies where the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails is not suitable as it is too bulky due to the required height of the nails (pins). The bandwidth of the proposed structure turns out to be similar to the case <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails. Parametric studies are presented as a design tool and a demonstrator is manufactured and measured...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Beds</b> <b>of</b> Nogon-Tsav are {{considered}} to be the same age as the Nemegt Formation. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of the}} Late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus {{iron ore}} was {{actively}} mined in south Central Pennsylvania from its discovery {{in the late}} 18th century, until it was supplanted by the rich ore <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> the Iron Range of Minnesota in the early 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Many {{believe that}} the {{acupressure}} mat originated from the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails used by ancient gurus and yogis for healing and meditation. The <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails is made of an oblong piece of wood with thousands nails embedded on it pointing upwards.|$|R
5000|$|... ''''Most {{motorcycles}} driven {{over the}} body whilst lying on a <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails'''' - was achieved by Simone Calati (Italy) on 12 May 2013 when he had 31 motorbikes driven over him in two minutes whilst lying on a <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails.|$|R
5|$|The Vespidae {{include the}} extinct genus Palaeovespa, seven species {{of which are}} known from the Eocene rocks of the Florissant fossil <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> Colorado and from fossilised Baltic amber in Europe. Also found in Baltic amber are crown wasps of the genus Electrostephanus.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{species is}} P. lujiatunensis, {{found in the}} lowest <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> the Yixian Formation. Over 200 specimens attributed to this genus have been recovered from these and other <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> the Yixian, the age {{of which is the}} subject of much debate. Although many early studies using radiometric dating put the Yixian in the Jurassic Period, tens of millions of years outside of the expected temporal range of Psittacosaurus, most recent work dates it to the Early Cretaceous. Using argon-argon dating, a team of Chinese scientists dated the lowest beds in the formation to about 128mya, and the highest to approximately 122mya. A more recent Chinese study, using uranium-lead dating, suggests that the lower beds are younger, approximately 123.2mya, while agreeing with an age of 122mya for the upper beds.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy loam soils, and clay loam soils in the <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay loam soils are found in the bowls and <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion during the rainy season.|$|E
5000|$|For floors, {{quarry tile}} is usually {{set in a}} thick <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> {{cementitious}} mortar. For wall applications, it can be set in either a thick <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> cementitious mortar or a thin <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> mastic. For both floors and walls, the joints between tiles are usually grouted with cementitious grout. Grout joints are traditionally about [...] inch in width. Matching trim shapes such as coves, bases, shoes, and bullnoses are available to turn corners and terminate runs of the tile.|$|R
5000|$|Preliminaries, Week 5: Block {{lay on a}} <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> {{nails and}} held a board on top of himself for his {{assistant}} to dance on and sing [...] "Anything Goes". Hasselhoff then asked to stand on Block as well, to establish that the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails was indeed real.|$|R
60|$|But what {{evidence}} have we of such sinkings? The plain {{fact that you}} have coal-seam above coal-seam, each with its <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> under-clay; and that therefore the land MUST have sunk ere the next <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> soil could have been deposited, and the next forest have grown on it.|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the above are the fossil-bearing <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of machair, a low lying dune pasture land.|$|E
5|$|Currently, no {{reliable}} pre-human fossil occurrences of Amphidromus have been recorded. Tera van Benthem Jutting (1932) reported finding several specimens of A. filozonatus {{which had been}} eaten in prehistoric times by natives, in Sampoeng Cave, central Java; {{and a few years}} later (van Benthem Jutting, 1937, pp.92–94) the same author reported a single specimen of A. palaceus from the Trinil <b>Beds</b> <b>of</b> Java. Neither record predates human occupancy, and therefore these shed no light on the pre-human history of Amphidromus.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 and 1903, Israel Russell {{became the}} first {{geologist}} to study this area while surveying it for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). In 1910, Samuel Paisley continued Russell's work and later became the monument's first custodian. Others followed and in time much of the mystery surrounding this and the other Lava <b>Beds</b> <b>of</b> Idaho was lifted.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails, {{this one}} containing about 7000 nails, {{is used to}} illustrate the distribution of weight. A subject lies on {{his back on the}} <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails, with a concrete block on his chest. The concrete block is then smashed using a heavy sledge hammer, without damage to the skin of the subject lying on the <b>bed</b> <b>of</b> nails. Because there is {{a very large number of}} nails supporting the subject, the force exerted by any one nail is insufficient to damage the clothing or skin of the subject...|$|R

5|$|Leftover {{heat from}} this hot spot was later liberated by Basin and Range-associated rifting {{and created the}} many {{overlapping}} lava flows {{that make up the}} Lava <b>Beds</b> <b>of</b> Idaho. The largest rift zone is the Great Rift; it is from this 'Great Rift fissure system' that Craters of the Moon, Kings Bowl, and Wapi lava fields were created. The Great Rift is a National Natural Landmark.|$|E
5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> tephra (volcanic ash) {{that lie}} between {{the layers of}} the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that the beds must have been formed by many floods. The purity of the tephra suggests subaerial deposition (the tephra could be mixed with the surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water), which indicates a dry period during the ash falls (and hence a hiatus between floods).|$|E
5|$|The Middle Devonian {{is divided}} into three main groups. The lower part of the sequence, mostly Eifelian in age, is {{dominated}} by lacustrine <b>beds</b> <b>of</b> the lower and upper Stromness Flagstones that were deposited in Lake Orcadie. The later Rousay flagstone formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland.|$|E
