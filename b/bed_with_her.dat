5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E

25|$|Although listing, Oceana {{was taken}} in tow by the Newhaven tug Alert, stern first, at 08:00. But by 10:00 she had {{developed}} an adverse list, enough to raise her propeller out of the water. Captain Hyde and the crew who had stayed aboard to help the tow now abandoned ship to the Alert, and watched from the tug as she sank in less than 20 minutes. Oceana sank close to the seaside resort town of Eastbourne in shallow water, settling on the sea <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> masts and the tops of her funnels showing {{out of the sea}} at low tide.|$|E

25|$|Religious and {{ceremonial}} reasons {{have also been}} a factor. Saint Veronica Giuliani (1660–1727), an Italian nun and mystic, was known for taking a lamb to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> and suckling it {{as a symbol of}} the Lamb of God. In far northern Japan, the Ainu people are noted for holding an annual bear festival at which a captured bear, raised and suckled by the women, is sacrificed. Bears were also suckled by the Itelmens of the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia but in their case for economic reasons, to benefit from the meat when the bear was grown and to obtain highly prized bear bile for use in traditional medicine.|$|E
25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 Burnett {{traveled}} to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, {{which became the}} first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England. Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London. In her rented rooms she continued the Tuesday evening salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill {{from the heat and}} the crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in <b>bed.</b> <b>With</b> <b>her</b> sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax, the only book to be published in England but not in the United States. That winter Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin's was published in the United States. She would go on to make Sara Crewe into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into ALittle Princess. In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then turned it over to cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared Phyllis for production, a stage adaptation of The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.|$|E

25|$|The {{second season}} had {{fourteen}} roles receiving star billing, out of whom eleven {{were part of}} the first season's main cast. The season sees the promotion of three former guest stars, who begin acting as series regulars from the season's first episode. The series is narrated by Brenda Strong, {{from the point of view}} of the deceased Mary Alice Young, as she observes, from a unique perspective, the lives of the Wisteria Lane residents and her former best friends. Susan Mayer, portrayed by Teri Hatcher, is divorcée and single mother, who, in her continuous search for a romantic commitment, ends up in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> former husband. Felicity Huffman portrayed Lynette Scavo, who starts neglecting her responsibilities as a mother, after the realization of her undeniable talent for advertising results in her going back to work after a six-year absence. Marcia Cross portrayed Bree Van de Kamp, whose flawless life is shaken after she starts dealing with the aftermath of her husband's death, while trying to overcome her guilt for having dated the man who killed him. Former model Gabrielle Solis, portrayed by Eva Longoria, who suffers a miscarriage just as she starts accepting upcoming motherhood. Nicollette Sheridan portrayed Edie Britt, whose commitment issues and numerous one night stands have made her an iconic character. Ricardo Antonio Chavira played Gabrielle's husband, Carlos Solis, who has to cope with the revelation of his wife's affair with their gardener, while trying to get out of jail. Mark Moses continues his role of widower Paul Young, who tries to cover up the murder of his adoptive son's biological mother. Zach Young, portrayed by Cody Kasch, finally learns about his true identity, but refuses to be a part of his father's life, whereas Julie Mayer, Susan's daughter portrayed by Andrea Bowen, deals with her parents' unexpected reconciliation. James Denton portrayed Mike Delfino, who has to deal with both his break-up with Susan Mayer, and his recently discovered biological son. Previously a recurring character throughout the last episodes of the previous season, Betty Applewhite, portrayed by Alfre Woodard, was conceived as a new resident of Wisteria Lane, whose mysterious arc is the season's main storyline. Also promoted from guest stars to series regulars were Doug Savant and Richard Burgi, who portrayed Tom Scavo and Karl Mayer, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Plans {{called for}} a first {{appearance}} at a rehearsal of Under Milk Wood at the Poetry Centre. Brinnin, who {{was director of the}} Poetry Centre, did not travel to New York but remained in Boston to write. He handed responsibility to his assistant, Liz Reitell, who was keen to see Thomas {{for the first time since}} their three-week romance early in the year. She met Thomas at Idlewild Airport and was shocked at his appearance, as he [...] "looked pale, delicate and shaky, not his usual robust self". Thomas told her he had had a terrible week, had missed her terribly and wanted to go to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Despite Reitell's previous misgivings about their relationship, they spent the rest of the day and night together. After being taken by Reitell to check in at the Chelsea Hotel, Thomas took the first rehearsal of Under Milk Wood. They then went to the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, before returning to the Chelsea Hotel.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Salke, the {{president}} of the entertainment division of NBC, encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after the cancellation of Lone Star. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. Korman was so impressed by the script that, though it was after midnight, he went into the room where his sick wife was sleeping, and got into <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Korman phoned Salke, and stated that the script was [...] "remarkable", and praised Killen claiming that [...] "for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life", he is [...] "making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to the Fox Broadcasting Company. Although it successfully made its way into the lower executive branches of the company, the script was declined by entertainment president Kevin Reilly, who felt apprehensive upon reading it. Gary Newman, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television, opted not to develop a deal with cable television networks. Newman believed that it should be a network show, and did not accept that the difference between cable and network dramas was their degree of intelligence.|$|E
50|$|Carol Miller Swain {{was born}} in Bedford, Virginia in 1954. Her father {{dropped out of school}} in the third grade and her mother dropped out in high school. Her {{stepfather}} used to beat up her mother, Dorothy Henderson, who is disabled due to infantile paralysis. Swain grew up in poverty, living in a shack without running water, and sharing two <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> eleven siblings. The second of twelve children, she did not have shoes and thus missed school whenever it snowed. She did not attend high school, dropping out in ninth grade. She moved to Roanoke <b>with</b> <b>her</b> family in the 1960s and appealed to a judge to be transferred to a foster home, which was denied; Swain instead lived <b>with</b> <b>her</b> grandmother in a trailer park.|$|R

After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of blowbacking the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. They sit {{on opposite sides of the}} door, and Naomi admits that she does need somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's cat flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|E

The adults at the table, {{including}} the Princess and the family's Jesuit chaplain, instantly know {{that the only reason}} he's leaving is to visit a brothel. [...] As the Prince is driven in his carriage into the city, he passes Tancredi's villa, worrying again that Tancredi's fallen in with bad company—specifically, with the rebels fighting to overthrow the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The Prince's thoughts vacillate between anticipation and guilt, between disgust with his wife (who crosses herself whenever they make love) and admiration of her prudery. Two hours later, his thoughts run a similar course, {{with the addition of a}} kind of disgusted satisfaction with the prostitute and a satisfied disgust with his own body. When he arrives back home, he finds the Princess in bed, thinks affectionately of her, climbs into <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> and finds he can't sleep. [...] "Towards dawn, however, the Princess had occasion to make the Sign of the Cross." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{company has}} also used pornographic actors and glamour models {{in some of}} its ads {{including}} Lauren Phoenix, Charlotte Stokely, Sasha Grey, Euguenia Diyordiychuk and Faye Reagan. Adult entertainment trade magazine Adult Video News cited the American Apparel website as [...] "one of the finer softcore websites going." [...] Some of the company's other ads, which feature nudity or sexual themes, have been banned by various advertising authorities. In 2009, an American Apparel ad which appeared in VICE Magazine was banned in the UK, because the image [...] "could be seen to sexualise a model {{who appears to be}} a child". American Apparel complied with this ruling. American Apparel also came under fire for a 2014 ad for mini-skirts, which featured a model bending over so that her underwear was prominently exposed. In 2013, the company released an ad in which the model lay on a <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> feet up in the air without wearing pants. The company also released an ad in which a model posed in a series of photos focused on her crotch, in which her face was not seen.

2500|$|The {{first season}} premiere episode shows Jules while she {{examines}} her naked {{body in the}} mirror for signs of aging. Jules, now divorced from her husband Bobby, tries to re-enter the dating world and relate to her young assistant Laurie. Jules' best friend and neighbor Ellie tries to prevent her from going out while her son is constantly being embarrassed by both of his parents. The show was originally about older women ("cougars") dating younger men, as Jules begins dating Josh (Nick Zano) and Barb is often seen [...] "hunting". Jules' relationship with Josh ends when he tells her that he loves her and Jules does not feel the same way. Later Jules begins a relationship with Jeff (Scott Foley) a client who infuriates Jules with his indecision. Her relationship with Jeff ends when the relationship becomes too serious for Jules who is not looking for anything too serious so soon after her divorce, whereas Jeff is ready to settle down {{as he has been}} [...] "playing the field" [...] for a long time. After her relationship with Jeff ends, Jules falls into <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> ex-husband Bobby (Brian Van Holt). This causes Bobby's feelings for Jules to stir even more and he later tells her that he wants her back. Jules, however, tells him that she loves him but [...] "not that way any more" [...] and that their happy ending is them as friends, raising their son Travis (Dan Byrd) together. Toward the end of the season, the simmering feelings between Jules and neighbor Grayson (Josh Hopkins) boil to the surface, and the two begin a relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Kathleen Mary [...] "Kathy" [...] Griffin {{was born}} on November 4, 1960, in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, to Mary Margaret [...] "Maggie" [...] Griffin (née Corbally; born June 10, 1920) and John Patrick Griffin (October 29, 1915 – February 17, 2007), both first-generation Irish Americans. Maggie worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce, Gary, and John. Griffin {{described}} herself during her early years as [...] "a kid who needed to talk, all the time." [...] She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and {{the place where she}} learned [...] "the power of juicy material." [...] After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours alone in the house and developed a binge eating disorder. She explained that even though eating disorders were not very well known at that time, she knew her eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbor's can. In her 2009 autobiography Official Book Club Selection, Griffin confessed that she [...] "still suffers [...] " [...] but has learned to [...] "deal with them." [...] In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was [...] "afraid of him until the moment he died" [...] due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> when he was 30 and she was 7 and [...] "whisper" [...] into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or {{be in the same room}} as him for years but didn't tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.|$|E
2500|$|Upon their marriage, Thomas {{moved into}} his wife’s house, at Chelsea Manor in London, {{where she lived}} with her step-daughter, the 14-year-old Elizabeth. Thomas was the uncle of Elizabeth's half-brother, and the newly wed husband of her step-mother, and their family roles {{regarding}} each other were, perhaps, unclear. Now, living {{under the same roof}} as Elizabeth, Thomas became more than a little familiar, if not intimate, with Elizabeth, indulging in daily romps with her, tickling her, and slapping her on her behind as she lay in her bed, or coming into her room in his nightclothes. Her governess, Kat Ashley, thought this scandalous, and reported it to Catherine. [...] Indignant, Thomas retorted, 'By God's precious soul, I mean no evil, and I will not leave it!' [...] At first, Catherine dismissed the behaviour as just innocent fun, and even joined in the romps on a few occasions. Elizabeth's feelings regarding this behaviour are unknown, but it was said that she bore Thomas some degree of affection. And though her governess, Kat Ashley, [...] "bade him go away in shame," [...] she found him more amusing than dangerous. When Catherine was pregnant in the spring of 1548, she had become concerned enough about her husband’s flirtatious relationship with Elizabeth that she sent Elizabeth away to live with Anthony Denny and his wife, Joan Champernowne (Kat Ashley's sister), in Hertfordshire. In June 1548, Catherine and Thomas Seymour moved their household from London to Sudeley Castle, the property granted to Seymour when he became Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September 1548, Catherine gave birth to a daughter, Mary Seymour. In the following days, she became uncharacteristically hostile and delusional. Thomas lay in <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> to quiet her, but she did not get better, and died of complications due to childbirth, just before Elizabeth’s 15th birthday. Upon her death, Catherine bequeathed all of her possessions to Thomas, making him one of the richest men in England. He said he was [...] "amazed" [...] at her death; yet it opened up new opportunities to him, as his eye returned to Elizabeth. From fear or shrewdness, she avoided him, returning, with her governess, Kat Ashley, to her childhood home, Hatfield House.|$|E

When her husband fought in the wars in Italy, the regency powers were exercised by his sister Anne of Beaujeu, who had held this position between 1483-1491. Anne of Brittany had a limited role in France and Brittany and sometimes had to accept being separated from her children in infancy. She lived primarily in the royal castles of Amboise, Loches and Plessis or in the towns of Lyon, Grenoble or Moulins (when the king was in Italy).

Subsequent investigations by the Department of Justice, the Virginia State Bar and the D.C. Bar vindicated Leiser of those allegations finding that the affidavit was in the public record and available to defense counsel prior to Dobkowski testifying, and that the impeaching memo was not discovered until weeks after the trial had concluded. Dobkowski had claimed that she wasn't {{a member of the}} group, while Kelly had claimed that Dobkowski set him up by switching <b>beds</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> roommate, changing her hair and entering the van voluntarily and later claiming to have been kidnapped.
