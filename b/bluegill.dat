5|$|The Fox River at Silver Springs has {{numerous}} {{species of}} freshwater fish including, <b>bluegill,</b> crappie, channel catfish, bullhead, carp, muskie and northern pike. The Loon and Beaver Lake fish population is maintained through human stocking. Channel catfish, bass, <b>bluegill</b> and crappie are stocked in both lakes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} {{are available for}} fishing. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have {{been caught in the}} stream: largemouth bass, <b>bluegill,</b> channel catfish, Rio Grande cichlid, longnose gar, green sunfish, sunfish hybrid, redbreast sunfish, and redear sunfish.|$|E
5|$|Aside from carp, {{several species}} of fish and {{amphibians}} still inhabited the creek up to the 1980s, when floods destroyed much of the remaining riparian habitat. These included the mosquito fish, <b>bluegill,</b> bass, and channel catfish, as well as {{several species of}} native frogs. After the floods, most of these species were reported to have disappeared completely.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [59]- 62) This research addressed how juvenile <b>bluegills</b> (Lepomis macrochirus) may use shaded water, vegetation, and shaded vegetation {{as possible}} refuges from largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and how light intensity may influence <b>bluegills?</b> use of vegetation. Three experiments were conducted. The first experiment {{was designed to}} address if juvenile <b>bluegills</b> use shaded water as a refuge from a largemouth bass. I used two half-shaded wading pools, one without a bass present and one with a bass present. The second experiment was designed to address how <b>bluegills</b> use artificial vegetation and shade as a refuge from a largemouth bass. I used two wading pools divided into shaded/vegetated, shaded/unvegetated, unshaded/vegetated, and unshaded/unvegetated sections, one pool without a bass present and one with a bass present. Finally, the third experiment was designed to address whether <b>bluegills</b> may alter their use of vegetation at different light intensities. I conducted the experiment in a 220 L aquarium at light intensities of 1. 5 lux, 170 lux, and 340 lux and in which {{one half of the}} aquarium had artificial vegetation. In experiment one, the <b>bluegills</b> used shaded water more than unshaded water when shade was the only refuge available; the presence of a bass did not affect the use of shaded water (greater than 70 % for both pools). However, the location of the bass did affect the use of shaded water. An unshaded bass caused the <b>bluegills</b> to use the shaded water almost exclusively (> 90 %), while a shaded bass decreased the <b>bluegills?</b> use of shade to about 60 %. In experiment two, the <b>bluegills</b> used the vegetation greater than 70 % of the time, even when open water was partially shaded. Use of shade (within vegetation) by the <b>bluegills</b> was not statistically different between the no bass and bass treatments. In experiments one and two, the <b>bluegills?</b> schooling was consistently low regardless of the presence of shade, vegetation, or bass. In experiment three, the <b>bluegills?</b> use of vegetation differed among light intentsities. The <b>bluegills</b> used the vegetation greater than 50 % at 1. 5 lux and 340 lux, but only about 35 % at 170 lux. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|Livers from <b>bluegills</b> {{exposed to}} {{increased}} soluble copper (Cu) under field and laboratory conditions were analyzed {{to determine the}} concentration and distribution of Cu in metalloproteins of different molecular size. Analyses were performed on <b>bluegills</b> collected from the impoundment of the H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant (Florence, SC) near the effluent discharge from the power plant, near the water intake to the cooling system, and from a control pond {{as well as on}} <b>bluegills</b> exposed under controlled laboratory conditions. Metalloproteins were separated into low molecular weight (LMW), intermediate molecular weight (IMW), and high molecular weight (HMW) fractions by using high-performance liquid chromatography. In the field-exposed <b>bluegills,</b> Cu concentrations in the LMW, IMW, and HMW fractions were highest in <b>bluegills</b> from the discharge site and lowest in those from the control pond. In the laboratory-exposed <b>bluegills,</b> Cu concentrations in the fractions increased with exposure concentration and time. Concentrations of Cu in the LMW protein fraction and pellet of <b>bluegills</b> exposed to 160 jig Cu/L appeared to plateau with long exposure times, whereas those in the HMW fraction continued to increase. <b>Bluegills</b> maintained in 80,ug Cu/L water at pH 5. 5 accumulated lower concentrations of Cu in the LMW and pellet fractions and higher amounts in the HMW than in those maintained in 80 jig Cu/L at pH 7. 0. Mortality was dependent on exposure concentration and duration and was higher in <b>bluegills</b> maintained in water at pH 5. 5 than at pH 7. 0...|$|R

5|$|Stocking of {{the lake}} with fish began before the {{reservoir}} was filled, with a small rearing pond being placed {{on the bottom of}} the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater fish; largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, <b>bluegill,</b> crappie, rainbow trout, striped bass, channel catfish, and shad. It is considered one of the best fisheries in California.|$|E
5|$|Cold water {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer {{than those of the}} creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, chain pickerel, bullhead catfish, northern pike, <b>bluegill,</b> and crappie.|$|E
5|$|Sulphur Creek Reservoir is {{the primary}} {{recreational}} facility in the watershed and {{is said to be}} one of the largest fisheries of Southern Orange County. The lake is annually stocked with <b>bluegill,</b> catfish, and bass. Aside from the reservoir, there is no body of water in the watershed that is navigable. There are several other parks in the watershed; these are Crown Valley Park, Sulphur Creek Park, and others. A paved trail follows Sulphur Creek from near the terminus of Crown Valley Park to near its mouth at Alicia Parkway.|$|E

5|$|Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, {{among them}} cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, {{several species of}} salmon, sucker, minnow, sculpin, and lamprey, as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 {{non-native}} species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, <b>bluegill,</b> and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American dipper, osprey, and harlequin duck. Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, a {{study found}} no fish {{species on the}} creek. However, brook trout have been {{observed}} at seven locations on Solomon Creek. Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes-Barre. Above of the South Wilkes-Barre borehole, {{a number of other}} fish species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, <b>bluegill,</b> creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog sucker, and white sucker. However, there are no species of fish downstream of the borehole. Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream miles in the watershed are home to brook trout fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only one small stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the <b>bluegill</b> fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E

25|$|Some fish {{engage in}} mobbing; for example, <b>bluegills</b> {{sometimes}} attack snapping turtles. <b>Bluegills,</b> which form large nesting colonies, were seen to attack both released and naturally occurring turtles, which may advertise their presence, drive the predator from the area, or {{aid in the}} transmission of predator recognition. Similarly, humpback whales are known to mob killer whales when the latter are attacking other species, including other cetacean species, seals, sea lions, and fish.|$|R

5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with <b>bluegill</b> and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E
5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the <b>bluegill,</b> larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby and then quickly dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E
5|$|Understanding {{traits of}} {{individual}} organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations, communities, and ecosystems. Several areas of ecology of evolution {{that focus on}} such traits are life history theory, ecophysiology, metabolic theory of ecology, and Ethology. Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction. Other traits {{may be related to}} structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a <b>bluegill</b> sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. — Threadfin shad Dorosoma petenense are {{commonly}} introduced into reservoirs to supplement prey available to piscivorous fishes. To determine how early life stages of threadfin shad {{and their potential}} competitors and predators interact, we introduced this species into two Ohio lakes—Clark and Stonelick—and evaluated how its young of year influenced young-of-year <b>bluegills</b> Lepomis macrochirus and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. After adults were stocked in April, peak abundance of young-of-year threadfin shad occurred in August in both lakes. <b>Bluegills</b> generally spawned earlier than threadfin shad, which apparently reduced competition between young of these species. In Clark Lake, young-of-year threadfin shad did not reduce zoo-plankton populations, but in Stonelick Lake, peak abundance of young-of-year threadfin shad {{was followed by a}} precipitous decline in zooplankton. Data on cladoceran birth rates indicated this decline was due to increased predation by threadfin shad. Survival of <b>bluegills</b> to a size at which they move into the littoral zone also declined in Stonelick Lake, perhaps because of the virtual elimination of zooplankton. Limited survival of <b>bluegills</b> in turn contributed to reduced growth of young-of-year largemouth bass dependent on them as prey. Given that zooplankton declined in one but not the other lake, interactions among young-of-year fishes due to annually introduce...|$|R
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and <b>bluegill</b> (Lepomis macrochirus) in central Florida {{is a major}} attraction for fishermen {{from all over the}} country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) is found only in the Ocklawaha. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare. In contrast, American eels (Anguilla rostrata) live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the Sargasso Sea {{in the middle of the}} Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them find their way back to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.|$|E
