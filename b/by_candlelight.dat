5|$|Beginning in 2000, Hi-5 have {{performed}} annually at Vision Australia's Carols <b>by</b> <b>Candlelight</b> in Melbourne, which are broadcast {{live by the}} Nine Network on Christmas Eve. The group perform a short selection of Christmas songs to entertain the younger viewers of the event, and are joined by Santa Claus, who was played for many years by Terry Gill, and Humphrey B. Bear. Several members have noted the shows as a highlight {{of their time in}} the group and over the years it became common for the performance to be the final concert of departing members. Hi-5 did not perform at the Carols between 2013 and 2015, and during this time, appeared at local Christmas events. Hi-5 returned to Carols <b>by</b> <b>Candlelight</b> in 2016 as part of their reestablished partnership with Nine.|$|E
5|$|On 29 January 1916, {{while reading}} in bed <b>by</b> <b>candlelight,</b> Markham {{set fire to}} the bedclothes and was {{overcome}} by smoke. He died the following day. His last diary entry, a few days earlier, had recorded a visit from Peter Markham Scott.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster <b>by</b> <b>Candlelight</b> {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The procession of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E
40|$|A Noh {{play was}} held in the hattou of Zuiryu Temple lit <b>by</b> <b>candlelights</b> on the anniversary of Lord Toshinaga’s death. After the Noh play the Noh stage was re-illuminated by seven candles and a few {{auxiliary}} incandescent lamps. It was gloomy and dim, so visitors’ eyes were adapted to condition of mesopic vision. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate lighting effects in the Noh stage in terms of illuminances and luminances in the work planes. As a result, impression of the subtle and profound in the Noh stage may be reinforced by non-uniform lighting produced <b>by</b> <b>candlelights...</b>|$|R

40|$|Rohsoku Noh, {{which is}} {{performed}} on the stage lit <b>by</b> <b>candlelights,</b> was held in Otsu Traditional Performing Arts Center. We took this opportunity to investigate the light characteristics of Rohsoku Noh stage. The Noh stage was lit by twelve candles and several auxiliary electric lamps, because the defused light from a candle is so beautiful, but too dim to see the details of brocade costumes and mysterious masks. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to consider the light characteristics of the Noh stage through the terms of illuminances and luminances in the work planes...|$|R
5|$|Also in 1933 Whale {{directed}} the romantic comedy <b>By</b> <b>Candlelight</b> which gained good reviews {{and was a}} modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Galsworthy. The film {{tells the story of a}} woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was required and Universal had a difficult time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Harry became {{interested}} in science fiction and read comics <b>by</b> <b>candlelight</b> (as the house had no electricity), eventually joining the Liverpool Science Fiction Society. At the age of 13, he produced his own science fiction fanzine, Biped, using a Gestetner machine to print 60 copies. His pen friend {{at the time was}} Michael Moorcock; the writer of science fiction and fantasy novels. After winning a scholarship to the Junior School of Art in Gambier Terrace, Liverpool, Harry started his first school newspaper, Premier.|$|E
5|$|In Brussels, Rodin {{created his}} first {{full-scale}} work, The Age of Bronze, having returned from Italy. Modeled after a Belgian soldier, the figure {{drew inspiration from}} Michelangelo's Dying Slave, which Rodin had observed at the Louvre. Attempting to combine Michelangelo's mastery of the human form with his own sense of human nature, Rodin studied his model from all angles, at rest and in motion; he mounted a ladder for additional perspective, and made clay models, which he studied <b>by</b> <b>candlelight.</b> The result was a life-size, well-proportioned nude figure, posed unconventionally {{with his right hand}} atop his head, and his left arm held out at his side, forearm parallel to the body.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] said Wildeve, discerning <b>by</b> the <b>candlelight</b> {{an obscure}} rubicundity of person in his companion. [...] "You are the reddleman I {{saw on the}} hill this morning--why, you are the man who--" ...|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{the minor}} success {{of her first}} two singles, Farmer, helped by Boutonnat, started working on her first album, Cendres de lune. Even though the album was almost entirely written by Boutonnat, {{it was then that}} it was decided that Farmer would write the lyrics to her songs - Boutonnat would write the music and direct the videos. [...] "Libertine", the album's lead single, was {{released}} in March 1986 and set the tone for Farmer's musical style. The sensual, romantic lyrics were inspired by 19th century literature. As for the video, which has a running time of over 10 minutes, Boutonnat was inspired by the film Barry Lyndon and the novels by Marquis de Sade, thus giving the video a cinematic style. Farmer, lit <b>by</b> <b>candlelights,</b> is shrouded in mystery and sexual ambiguity. It also was the very first video in which a French female singer appeared in full-frontal nudity. The following single, [...] "Tristana", also met with great success and its video carried the cinematic approach.|$|R
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} <b>by</b> <b>candlelight,</b> when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter <b>by</b> <b>candlelight</b> with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E
5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig <b>by</b> <b>candlelight.</b> They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The man wears dark clothing, and {{the dark}} tones {{as well as his}} shadow cast behind him and across his face from the angle of the candlelight give him a looming appearance. In contrast, the woman is lit fully in the face <b>by</b> the <b>candlelight,</b> and wears a white blouse. It is an early work by Leyster, who was only 22 years old in 1631.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Prior {{released}} her fourth studio album, Both Sides Now, which peaked at number 42. This was followed <b>by</b> Encore and <b>Candlelight</b> Christmas in 2013 and a live album in 2014 Marina Prior Live.|$|R

5|$|Only a {{few people}} visited the cave during the next decade. Among them was Thomas Condon, {{professor}} of geology at the University of Oregon. Guided by Davidson's brother, in 1884 he {{and a group of}} students hiked from Williams to the cavern, which they inspected <b>by</b> <b>candlelight.</b> Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E
5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work <b>by</b> <b>candlelight.</b> Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E
5|$|Despite Shinwell's actions {{the fuel}} supply {{remained}} insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even {{the staff at}} Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board to work <b>by</b> <b>candlelight.</b> A trade meeting with representatives from Russia and Iceland was also held without light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain. The public was reduced to queuing at gasworks to collect coke for use as fuel. Supplies of aspirin also ran low {{as it was then}} a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with the general public and received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in Tooting. Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, easing the fuel crisis.|$|E
6000|$|The clock struck two, and Brown still slept. Mr. Hamlin {{approached}} {{the table and}} took from his pocket a letter, which he read <b>by</b> the flickering <b>candlelight.</b> It contained only a single line, written in pencil, in a woman's hand,-- ...|$|R
60|$|His manner was--what man's is not?--so {{much that}} {{of one who}} would love and cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes, charges, or revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it. The season {{meanwhile}} was drawing onward to the equinox, and though it was still fine, the days were much shorter. The dairy had again worked <b>by</b> morning <b>candlelight</b> for a long time; and a fresh renewal of Clare's pleading occurred one morning between three and four.|$|R
25|$|Nouhad was a shy {{child and}} did not have many friends at school. However, she was very {{attached}} to her grandmother who lived in Debbieh (Shuf area), where Nouhad used to spend her summer holidays. Nouhad seemed to enjoy the rural village life. During the day, Nouhad would help her grandmother with house chores and fetch fresh water from a nearby water spring. She would sing {{all the way to the}} spring and back. In the evening, Nouhad would sit <b>by</b> the <b>candlelight</b> with her grandmother, who would tell her stories.|$|R

25|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century, it became fashionable to view art {{galleries}} at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio <b>by</b> <b>candlelight.</b> As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools <b>by</b> <b>candlelight,</b> to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. After a little recarving, he began to rub the statue down with pumice stone, sometimes for period longer that weeks or months. If that was not enough, he would use tripoli (rottenstone) and lead.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s Thompson {{acquired}} a large public audience as {{a critic of}} the then Labour government's disregard of civil liberties; his writings from this time are collected in Writing <b>By</b> <b>Candlelight</b> (1980).|$|E
5000|$|Caen {{continued}} to write, though less frequently. He died February 1, 1997, {{survived by his}} fourth wife and a son from a previous marriage. His funeralheld at Grace Cathedral despite his Jewish heritage("the damndest saddest, most wonderful funeral anyone ever had, but the only man who could properly describe it isn't here", said Enrico Banducci)was followed <b>by</b> a <b>candlelight</b> procession to Aquatic Park, where his will had provided for a fireworks display—climaxed by a pyrotechnic image of the manual typewriter he had long called his [...] "Loyal Royal".|$|R
60|$|We {{have already}} said that Maggot was a strong man. As he stood there, naked to the waist, holding the borer with his left hand, and plying the hammer {{with all his might}} with the other, his great breadth of {{shoulder}} and development of muscle were finely displayed <b>by</b> the <b>candlelight,</b> which fell in brilliant gleams on parts of his frame, while the rest of him was thrown into shadow, so deep that it would have appeared black, but for the deeper shade by which it was surrounded--the whole scene presenting a grand Rembrandt effect.|$|R
50|$|Doom, Gloom, Heartache & Whiskey is {{the third}} studio album by English hard rock band Viking Skull.

60|$|The {{thing which}} was terrifying {{him was a}} small thing in itself--the turning of a latch-key in the door. Before him on the table was his own--he knew of no other. Yet some one was opening, had opened his front door! He sprang to his feet at last with {{something}} which was almost a shriek.
