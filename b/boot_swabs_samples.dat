40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} antimicrobial resistance among commensal Escherichia coli isolates on household and small-scale chicken farms, common in southern Vietnam, and to investigate the association of antimicrobial resistance with farming practices and antimicrobial usage. Methods: We collected data on farming and antimicrobial usage from 208 chicken farms. E. coli was isolated from <b>boot</b> <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> using MacConkey agar (MA) and MA with ceftazidime, nalidixic acid or gentamicin. Isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials and for ESBL production. Risk factor analyses were carried out, using logistic regression, at both the bacterial population and farm levels. Results: E. coli resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins was detected on 201 (96. 6 %), 191 (91. 8 %) and 77 (37. 0 %) of the farms, respectively. Of the 895 E. coli isolates, resistance to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and third-generation cephalosporins was detected in 178 (19. 9 %), 291 (32. 5 %) and 29 (3. 2 %) of the isolates, respectively. Ciprofloxacin resistance {{was significantly associated with}} quinolone usage (OR =  2. 26) and tetracycline usage (OR =  1. 70). ESBL-producing E. coli were associated with farms containing fish ponds (OR =  4. 82). Conclusions: Household and small farms showed frequent antimicrobial usage associated with a high prevalence of resistance to the most commonly used antimicrobials.

40|$|International audiencePilgrims {{returning}} from the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) can be carriers of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR). Pharyngeal and rectal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from 98 pilgrims before and after they traveled to the Hajj in 2014 to investigate the acquisition of MDR bacteria. The bacterial diversity in pharyngeal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> was assessed by culture with selective media. There was a significantly higher diversity of bacteria in samples collected after the return from the Hajj than in those collected before (P = 0. 0008). Surprisingly, Acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from 16 pharyngeal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> (1 sample taken during the Hajj and 15 samples taken upon return) and 26 post-Hajj rectal <b>swab</b> <b>samples,</b> while none were isolated from samples taken before the Hajj.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To investigate, {{by use of}} the Amplicor PCR in {{a routine}} setting, the {{recovery}} rate of Chlamydia trachomatis in ano-rectal and pharyngeal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from males and females attending an STD clinic in relation to sexual practices, symptoms, and signs. DESIGN: Data regarding sexual practices, and symptoms and signs related to the rectum and pharynx, were obtained from 196 females and 208 males, including 31 homosexuals and eight bisexuals. <b>Swab</b> <b>samples</b> {{were obtained from the}} urethra, rectum, and pharynx from all the patients. An additional endocervical <b>swab</b> <b>sample</b> was obtained from the females. METHODS: All samples were analysed by the Amplicor PCR (Roche). SETTING: Rudolph Bergh's Hospital, a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases situated in the centre of Copenhagen, Denmark. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of urogenital C trachomatis infection was 9. 2 % (37 / 404). The specificity of the Amplicor PCR was 100 % for both ano-rectal and pharyngeal <b>swab</b> <b>samples.</b> In females three (13 %) of the 23 infections were detected only by testing an ano-rectal or throat <b>swab</b> <b>sample.</b> In homosexual males two (67 %) of three infections were detected only by the anorectal <b>swab</b> <b>sample.</b> Ano-rectal intercourse without use of condom was reported by 44 % of females and by 52 % of homosexual males. Fellatio without condom use was reported by 91 % of females, and 80 % of heterosexual males practised cunnilingus. Pharyngeal infection, however, occurred only in females, and the presence of pharyngeal symptoms or signs seemed predictive for pharyngeal C trachomatis infection, for which the time of incubation or colonisation exceeded 3 months. The presence of ano-rectal signs or symptoms was not predictive for an ano-rectal C trachomatis infection. CONCLUSION: The Amplicor PCR can be used on ano-rectal and pharyngeal <b>swab</b> <b>samples.</b> Ano-rectal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> should be obtained in females and homosexual males at high risk of being infected.

40|$|Resistances against {{antibiotics}} {{represent a}} growing challenge for {{both human and}} veterinary medicine around the globe. Plasmid-transmitted beta lactamases play {{a pivotal role in}} the development of resistances against beta-lactam antibiotics in Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterial synthesis of hydrolases with the capability of cleaving the beta lactam ring and thereby enzymatically inactivating beta lactam antibiotics is one of the most common bacterial antibiotic resistance mechanisms. In this context, a subgroup of beta lactameses termed 'extended spectrum beta lactamases' (ESBL) are of particular relevance, as they are capable of dramatically reducing the efficacy even of modern extended-spectrum cephalosporine und monobactame antibiotics. In recent years, increasing evidence of ESBLs have been described worldwide. Studies have reported of ESBL - producing E. coli, and other enterobacteriaceae; in healthy livestock in Europe. inter alia, in healthy broilers. In addition, resistant bacteria have been found in end products and foods such as meat, fish and raw milk. Due to the limited data available on the presence and potential distribution of 'ESBLs/AmpCs' in humans, animals and foods in Germany, the collaborative project RESET was launched, which is financed by assets from the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). In this project, research groups from the fields of veterinary and human medicine have collected and are continuing to collect (during a second promotion period) substantial amounts of data on the dissemination of ESBLs in the food chain. As one aspect of the RESET collaboration, the main focus of the work presented here was the analysis of the detection frequency of ESBL/AmpC - producing E. coli in conventional broiler fattening farms in Germany throughout the entire fattening period. In particular, it was the aim to achieve new insights into the colonization dynamic of the resistant bacteria as well as their distribution in the broiler fattening farm houses. An additional focus was the analysis of a variety of transmission pathways of ESBL/AmpC- producing Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli, from broiler fattening farms to the surrounding environment or vice versa. In initial investigations, the ESBL/AmpC - status of 16 broiler fattening farms was determined using <b>boot</b> <b>swab</b> <b>samples.</b> Of these 16 farms, seven ESBL/AmpC - positive broiler fattening farms were included in the long-term study on the prevalence and transmission of resistant microorganisms which is presented here. To determine the detection frequencies of ESBL/AmpC - producing E. coli in broiler fattening farms during the course of the fattening period, extensive measurements and sample collections from animals, their surroundings, the stable air and exhaust as well as the stable surroundings were carried out in each of the examined broiler fattening farms on three occasions during the fattening period (beginning, middle and end). Moreover, impingement was used to determine the presence of ESBLproducing E. coli and other microorganisms in the stable air and exhaust in order to identify potential emission pathways of ESBL/AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae, particularly E. coli, from animal farms into the environment. In doing so, the air samples from outside animal housings as well as the floor samples from the direct stable surroundings were collected in dependence of the respective wind direction. In addition, slurry samples were collected directly from the slurry pit and examined for ESBL/AmpC - E. coli. All suspected ESBL/AmpC- producing colonies isolated from MacConkey agar, containing antibiotics, gathered from these samples were identified as E. coli using MALDI-TOF and subsequently confirmed as carriers of an ESBL gene or plasmid-coded AmpC gene using PCR. In addition, selected isolates from the stable surroundings and the stable were analyzed for clonal relation using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). As a first result it should be emphasized that, at every sampling occasion, there was at least one sample from each broiler fattening farm where ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were identified and their resistance genes could be identified using PCR. Moreover, the resistant microorganisms were regularly found in the stable air, e. g. in dust or litter, as well as on the floor of the stable surroundings, the slurry and the stable air and exhaust. The detection frequencies of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in animals, from each 20 <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> from individual animals per farm varied between 0 % and 100 %. Nevertheless, the results of our work show that ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli are regularly present in cloacal swabs of clinically healthy broilers as well as their stable surroundings. In addition, high prevalences of the resistant microorganisms could even be found in day-old chicks. Moreover, our results are the first report of a significant increase of the detection frequency of resistant bacteria during the course of the fattening period. This increase in prevalence was shown during the whole fattening period in samples from individual animals as well as in samples from the animal's surroundings. Therefore, apart from the possible entry via positive day-old chicks, the current results demonstrate an influence of the stable environment on the ESBL/AmpC status of a broiler flock. As a further main result, these work strengthen the hypothesis of fecal and aerogenic dissemination from broiler farms into the environment, as PFGE analyses showed clonal matching between different isolates from inside and outside the animal housings. PFGE shows results of restriction profile analyses with 86. 3 % to 100 % clonal matching of isolates from the stables (air and slurry) in comparison to isolates from the stable surroundings. Based on these results, it can be concluded that fecal and aerogenic emission of ESBL/AmpCproducing E. coli from broiler fattening farms through, among others, distribution of contaminated slurry and stable exhaust is highly probable. However, the results of this work do not exclude that there may also be an influx of the resistant microorganisms...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented here is to investigate presence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in turkey flocks and personnel on the respective farms. MRSA For evidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS), cloaca and trachea <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> were taken from a total of 200 turkeys and dust samples from 20 turkey houses as well as <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> from the noses of 59 personnel on the respective farms. The investigations were conducted according to Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) guidelines based on Commission Decision 2008 / 55 /EG {{using a combination of}} non-selective pre-enrichment, selective enrichment and subsequent cultivation on a selective, chromogenic agar plate (Anon, 2008 a; BfR, 2009). The identification of genus and species was by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and mecA gene detection via real-time PCR. In conclusion, the isolate carrying the mecA gene was molecularbiologically characterised via spa and SCCmec typing. In each isolate of every identified spa type the MLST type was additionally determined. MRSA could be detected in 71. 5 % (143 from 200) of the examined turkeys in a total of 90 %(18 from 20) of the farms. In all 18 of the positive farms the dust <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> always tested positive for MRSA. In this way testing for MRSA bacteria presence in turkey flocks can be simplified with sufficient reliability through collecting dust <b>swab</b> <b>samples.</b> 90. 2 % of the MRSApositive birds could be identified through a trachea <b>swab</b> <b>sample</b> alone. This enables identification of MRSA presence with individual birds through testing the trachea sample only. In addition to MRSA bacteria, MRS/SA (methicillin-resistant staphylococci, with exception of S. aureus) bacteria were also present on 11 of the farms. These results showed that the examined turkeys were not only substantially infected with MRSA bacteria but also – although to a clearly lesser extent – with MRS/SA bacteria. From the 59 personnel examined via nose <b>swab</b> <b>sampling,</b> 22 of them (37. 3 %) were shown to be MRSA carriers and eight (13. 5 %) to be carriers of MRS/SA. Looking at the detection of MRSA {{in the light of the}} frequency of stay in the turkey stables so was the chance of colonization with MRSA in people who were regularly in turkey stables clearly increased, compared to people, who were rarely or never in turkey stables (OR = 3. 43). MRSA isolates belonging to the sequence type ST 398 and, with that, the livestock-associated MRSA (laMRSA), were always isolated from the tested people and isolated in the majority of the cases from the tested turkeys. VRE For detecting VRE bacteria in this study, cloaca <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> were taken from 200 living turkeys and dust <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> from 20 turkey houses as well as nose <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> from 59 humans. The detection of VRE bacteria was carried out using the method described by Ellerbroek et al. (2004). This combines an enrichment procedure using Chromocult® enteroccoci broth with subsequent cultivation of a selective agar supplemented with vancomycin. The identification of the enterococci took place with the help of biochemical parameters according to Ruoff et al. (2003) and real-time PCR was applied for identifying the vanA, vanB 1 / 2 / 3 and vanC 2 / 3 resistance genes. VRE bacteria could be identified in 27 % (54 from 200) of the examined turkeys in total 75 % (15 from 20) of the examined feeding farms. At 93. 3 % of the positive flocks was the pooled <b>swab</b> dust <b>sample</b> VRE-positive.

40|$|Neonatal piglets {{have been}} used as models to study human {{campylobacteriosis}} and helicobacteriosis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relative pathogenicities, on the basis of the duration of fecal shedding and colonization of tissues, of three Arcobacter species in 1 -day-old cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived piglets. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, two piglets each were infected per os with either Arcobacter butzleri ATCC 49616, Arcobacter cryaerophilus 1 B ATCC 43159, Arcobacter skirrowii CCUG 10374, or the three field strains of A. butzleri (approximately 5 X 10 (9) CFU per piglet). Rectal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> were taken prior to infection and daily thereafter for up to 7 days. Arcobacter spp. were detected at least once in rectal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> of all but one of the experimentally infected piglets but not in the control. At necropsy, A. butzleri was recovered from the lung, kidney, ileum, or brain tissues of the four infected piglets which had received either the field strain or the ATCC type strain of A. butzleri. A. cryaerophilus 1 B was detected in rectal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> for up to 7 days postinfection but was not cultured from tissues at necropsy. Arcobacters were detected in the rectal <b>swab</b> <b>sample</b> of the A. skirrowii-infected piglet only on day 3 postinfection; no isolates were obtained from tissues at necropsy. No gross pathological lesions were consistently noted in the experimentally infected piglets. In experiment 2, two piglets each were infected per os with A. butzleri ATCC 49616, A. cryaerophilus 1 A ATCC 43158, A. skirrowii CCUG 10374, or the single A. butzleri field strain Yard J/c (approximately 5 X 10 (9) CFU per piglet). Arcobacter spp. were cultured from rectal <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> of all but one of the experimentally infected piglets at least once. At necropsy Arcobacter spp. were cultured from the liver, kidney, ileum, or brain tissues of two of the four A. butzleri-infected piglets. However, no severe gross pathology was noted. These data suggest that Arcobacter spp., especially A. butzleri, can colonize neonatal pigs...|$|R

40|$|Clinicians still lack an {{appreciation}} of the potential importance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) in the hospitals. So this study was done in order to isolate and assess the prevalence of multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA) and pan-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (PDRPA) from the intensive care units (ICUs). A cross-sectional study was conducted for six months at the ICUs of Shahid Gangalal National Heart Centre, Kathmandu. A total of 1, 060 samples were processed out of which 700 were clinical samples directly taken from the admitted patients while 360 were the surface <b>swab</b> <b>samples.</b> The isolates were identified using routine conventional methods based upon microscopic findings, colony morphology and biochemical properties. Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. P. aeruginosa was isolated from 66 (9. 43 %) clinical samples while 60 (16. 67 %) were surface <b>swab</b> <b>samples.</b> Among clinical isolates, 56 (84. 8 %) were sensitive to cefoparazone+sublactam (CSL) followed by 42 (63. 6 %) to polymixin-B and 36 (54. 5 %) to piperacillin-tazobactam (PT), while among surface <b>swab</b> <b>sample</b> isolates more than 90 % were sensitive to most of the common antibiotics used. About 59 (89. 4 %) MDRPA were isolated from clinical samples while it was only 7 (11. 7 %) from surface <b>swab</b> <b>samples.</b> Only isolates from clinical samples (6. 1 %) yielded PDRPA. Since P. aeruginosa has shown the reduced susceptibility towards single antibiotics such as carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and cephalosporins, combined antibiotics like CSL and PT remained choice of treatment. This can eliminate potential threat of MDRPA and PDRPA in the ICUs. Key words: multi-drug resistance, pan-drug resistance, Pseudomonas aeruginos...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} the genomic DNA yield and the {{microsatellite}} and {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) genotyping success rates of genomic DNA extracted from {{a large number of}} mouth <b>swab</b> <b>samples.</b> In total, the median yield and quality was determined in 714 individuals and the success rates in 378, 480 genotypings of 915 individuals. The median yield of genomic DNA per mouth swab was 4. 1 µg (range 0. 1 – 42. 2 µg) and was not reduced when mouth swabs were stored for at least 21 months prior to extraction. A maximum of 20 mouth swabs is collected per participant. Mouth <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> showed in, respectively, 89 % for 390 microsatellites and 99 % for 24 SNPs a genotyping success rate higher than 75 %. A very low success rate of genotyping (0 %– 10 %) was obtained for 3. 2 % of the 915 mouth <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> using microsatellite markers. Only 0. 005 % of the mouth <b>swab</b> <b>samples</b> showed a genotyping success rate lower than 75 % (range 58 %– 71 %) using SNPs. Our results show that mouth swabs can be easily collected, stored by our conditions for months prior to DNA extraction and result in high yield and high-quality DNA appropriate for genotyping with high success rate including whole genome searches using microsatellites or SNPs. Genomic DNA is commonly extracted from peripheral blood samples for genetic studies of families and populations. Blood sampling, however, is expensive and an invasive procedure to which, for ethical reasons, objections may be raised. Several noninvasive DNA sampling methods using buccal cells were reported including mouth swabs, cytobrushes or rinses (Burge...|$|R
