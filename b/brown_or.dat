5|$|In summer, the fur of the Djungarian hamster on {{the back}} changes from ash-grey to dark <b>brown,</b> <b>or</b> {{sometimes}} pale brown with a tint. The face changes to grey or brown, while the mouth area, the whisker area, and the ears are slightly brighter. The outer ears and the eyes have black edges. The rest of the head is dark <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> black. From the head to the tail runs a black-brown dorsal stripe. The throat, belly, tail and limbs are white. The ears are grey with a pinkish tint with scattered black hairs. The hairs on the underside are completely white.|$|E
5|$|Sparrows {{are small}} {{passerine}} birds, typically small, plump, <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> grey with short tails and short powerful beaks. They are seed-eaters, but also consume small insects.|$|E

50|$|Hash <b>browns</b> <b>or</b> hashed <b>browns</b> are {{a simple}} {{preparation}} in which potatoes are pan-fried after being shredded, diced, julienned or riced, {{in the style}} of a Swiss Rösti. In some cultures, hash <b>browns</b> <b>or</b> hashed <b>browns</b> can refer to any of these preparations, while in others it may refer to one specific preparation. Hash browns are a staple breakfast food at diners in North America and the UK, where they are often fried on a large common cooktop or grill.|$|R

5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched with <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> grey, {{which are}} incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|Flint and <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> {{yellow brick}} is used extensively, both for {{buildings}} within the conservation area and in associated {{structures such as}} boundary walls and pavements. Some kerbs are of granite, limestone and flint, while some high-quality Yorkstone paving slabs survive, along with some red-brick pavements.|$|E
5|$|In {{shells of}} most of the species in the {{subgenus}} Amphidromus, resting stages are marked by the deposition of a <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> black radial band called a varix. This appears to be rare in the subgenus Syndromus, although the shell of A. laevus does show evidence of interruption of the spiral banding after a resting phase.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses use {{camouflage}} when hunting, and {{to avoid}} predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change {{the appearance of the}} skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. Chromatophores contain yellow, orange, red, <b>brown,</b> <b>or</b> black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.|$|E
5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the Arctic hare, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} have snow camouflage, changing their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe aztecorum is {{the type}} species of Guzmán's section Aztecorum, a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) Psilocybe {{mushrooms}} characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, when present, are hyaline (translucent). Other species classified in section Aztecorum are P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis.|$|E

5|$|The androecium {{consists}} of six stamens with filiform (thread like) filaments, which are fasciculate (in close bundles) and declinate or ascendent. The anthers are dorsifixed or versatile. In the gynaecium, the ovary is inferior and trilocular with pluriovulate locules. The style is filiform, and the stigma trifid. The fruit forms a trivalve capsule containing seeds which are dry, flattened, obliquely winged or irregularly discoid, hardly ever turgid, and globose (spherical) or subglobose, with a <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> black phytomelanous testa.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{members of}} the family are the -long bull crickets (Brachytrupes) which {{excavate}} burrows a metre or more deep. The tree crickets (Oecanthinae) are delicate white or pale green insects with transparent fore wings, while the field crickets (Gryllinae) are robust <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> black insects.|$|E
5|$|The mass of spores is blackish <b>brown,</b> <b>or</b> brown if viewed under polarised light. The {{surface texture}} ranges from almost smooth to warty, and the spores measure 7–9µm in diameter. Material {{collected}} from Oregon, however, varies from European material in several ways: the fruit body is brown; the branching of the capillitium from the columella differs (having {{primary and secondary}} branches instead of radiating branches from an expanded tip); the spore mass is tan, and individual spores measure 10–12µm.|$|E
50|$|The {{color of}} the plant and {{branches}} is grayish-green to gray, or whitish-gray, to dull <b>browns</b> <b>or</b> tinged with red. The flowers are often sparse and sometimes inconspicuous, but plants in some locales can bloom prolifically in red flowers.|$|R
50|$|The Colors are: Liver (<b>brown)</b> {{and white}} <b>or</b> {{black and white}} ticked usually with some solid patches, and solid liver (<b>brown)</b> with <b>or</b> without a white chest patch.|$|R
25|$|Microwave ovens have {{a limited}} role in {{professional}} cooking, because the boiling-range temperatures produced in especially hydrous foods impede flavors produced by the higher temperatures of frying, <b>browning,</b> <b>or</b> baking. However, additional heat sources {{can be added to}} microwave ovens.|$|R
5|$|The {{scales of}} Solomon Islands skinks are {{a dark green}} but are often {{speckled}} with light <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> black.

5|$|The size of {{the squares}} of the {{chessboard}} should be approximately 1.25 to 1.3 times {{the diameter of the}} base of the king, or 50 to 65mm. Squares of approximately 57mm (inches) normally are well-suited for pieces with the kings in the preferred size range. The darker squares are usually <b>brown</b> <b>or</b> green and the lighter squares are off-white or buff.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Louis Secretan in 1833 as Agaricus adustus var. densifolius. In 1876, Claude-Casimir Gillet transferred {{it to the}} genus Russula.

50|$|The {{dress code}} of the school for boys in 1st form to 2nd form {{includes}} short brown khaki pants. Black <b>or</b> <b>brown</b> shoes are required, along with beige socks, black <b>or</b> <b>brown</b> belt, brown shirt and nicely combed hair. Similarly, 3rd form to 5th form boys need long brown khaki pants with black <b>or</b> <b>brown</b> shoes, beige socks, black <b>or</b> <b>brown</b> belt, a brown shirt and nicely combed hair.|$|R
50|$|The western ground snake {{can grow}} {{to a total}} length (including tail) of 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm). The color and pattern can vary widely. Individuals can be <b>brown,</b> red, <b>or</b> orange, with black banding, orange <b>or</b> <b>brown</b> striping, <b>or</b> be solid-colored. The {{underside}} is typically white or gray. It has smooth dorsal scales, a small head, and the pupil of the eye is round.|$|R
50|$|Males measure 50 - 65 mm {{and females}} 59 - 72 mm in snout-vent length. The {{colouration}} is variable. Dorsal colour varies from greenish brown to dark <b>brown,</b> with <b>or</b> without dark marks. Ventral colour varies from dark brown with cream spots to cream with dark marks. Iris is coppery-golden <b>or</b> <b>brown</b> with black <b>or</b> golden punctuations.|$|R
