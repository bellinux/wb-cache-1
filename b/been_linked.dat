5|$|Cabbage has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores {{were found on}} whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two {{outbreaks of}} E.coli in the United States have <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there {{is the potential for}} further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{pesticides}} {{and a history}} of head injury have each <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> with Parkinson disease (PD), but the risks are modest. Never having smoked cigarettes, and never drinking caffeinated beverages, are also associated with small increases in risk of developing PD.|$|E
5|$|His long {{acknowledged}} {{learning disability}} {{and a possible}} intellectual disability have both <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to his severe epilepsy; recent speculation finds some behaviours consistent with autism.|$|E
50|$|AP-5 is {{the most}} {{recently}} described complex, and one reason supporting {{the idea that it}} is an authentic adaptor complex is that it is associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, as is AP-4. AP-1 <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to MEDNIK syndrome. AP-3 <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. COPI <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to an autoimmune disease. COPII <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to cranio-lenticulo-sutural dysplasia.One of the GGA proteins may be involved in Alzheimer's disease.|$|R

Amfilochia will <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> with the Ionia Odos. Amfilochia <b>is</b> not <b>linked</b> with a railway.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, the Borromean rings {{consist of}} three topological circles which <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> {{and form a}} Brunnian link (i.e., {{removing}} any ring results in two unlinked rings). In other words, no {{two of the three}} rings <b>are</b> <b>linked</b> with each other as a Hopf link, but nonetheless all three <b>are</b> <b>linked.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} deep frying food is {{generally}} detrimental to its nutritional value. The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain {{large amounts of}} fats, especially saturated fats and trans fats. Consumption of large amounts of saturated and trans fats has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to a higher risk for some cancers including prostate cancer. Eating deep-fried foods has also <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to higher cholesterol levels, obesity, heart attacks, and diabetes. Deep-fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide, a possible carcinogen.|$|E

5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in water has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to stomach tumors, {{and it may}} also cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).|$|E
5000|$|In 1938, field {{artillery}} brigades were reorganized as two 12-gun batteries. As a result, the existing 6-gun batteries <b>were</b> <b>linked</b> in pairs.

5|$|A 1000-year-old {{skeleton}} of a woman was discovered in the caves by Balch in 1912, and has also traditionally <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to the legendary witch.

5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) {{during the first}} eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental factors have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5000|$|... "Alevi" [...] is {{generally}} explained as referring to Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. The name represents a Turkish {{form of the}} word ‘Alawi (علوي) [...] "of or pertaining to Ali", just as the word Musevi <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to Musa (Moses), Isevi <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to Isa (Jesus) and Mevlevi <b>is</b> <b>linked</b> to Mevlana (Rumi).|$|R

5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was {{isolated from the}} spleen. The illness {{appeared to be a}} co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm has <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E
