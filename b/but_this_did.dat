5|$|As a British {{withdrawal}} from France {{at the earliest}} opportunity had been the original intent, the brigade boarded ships bound for Italy eleven days after landing. The operation had cost the brigade 362 casualties, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not hinder their next mission in Greece two months later. Only 126 replacements were required to bring the brigade back up to full strength.|$|E
5|$|Following the competition, both YF-23s were {{transferred}} to NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards AFB, California, without their engines.

He was appointed as the Conservative Party's Ontario co-chair for the 2004 federal election. There were rumours that Baird would leave provincial politics to contest the 2004 election, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not happen. In 2005 he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the Conservative Party.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1987 but was halted in 1992 as North Korea entered {{a period of}} {{economic}} crisis {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union. After 1992 the building stood topped out, but without any windows or interior fittings. In 2008 construction resumed, and the exterior was completed in 2011. It was planned to open the hotel in 2012, the centenary of Kim Il-sung's birth, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not happen. A partial opening was announced for 2013, but this was also cancelled. , the building remains unopened and has been called the tallest unfinished building in the world.|$|E

5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|However, British Waterways {{decided that}} their full {{restoration}} {{was an important}} aim in 2002, {{and the construction of}} the main stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics on an island formed by the rivers provided funding to construct a new lock and sluices which stabilised water levels throughout the Olympic site. It was hoped that significant amounts of materials for the construction of the Olympic facilities would be delivered by barge, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not happen. Improvements to the channels which form a central feature of the Olympic Park included the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Cantor {{was one of}} the {{distinguished}} foreign scholars invited to attend the 500th anniversary of the founding of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Cantor attended, hoping to meet Bertrand Russell, whose newly published Principia Mathematica repeatedly cited Cantor's work, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not come about. The following year, St. Andrews awarded Cantor an honorary doctorate, but illness precluded his receiving the degree in person.|$|E

5|$|Like {{some other}} British {{football}} {{stars of the}} late 20th century, Baxter drank to excess, {{and at one point}} was said to be consuming three bottles of Bacardi a day. Scotland teammate Dave Mackay unsuccessfully advised him to train harder and live more sensibly. Baxter often got falling-down drunk the night before a match, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not seem to hamper his play, and team managers took little notice of his drinking. After retiring from football Baxter became a pub licensee, an unsuitable career for a problem drinker. At the age of 55 he needed two liver transplants in four days, and promised to quit drinking.|$|E
5|$|Politically, {{however, the}} battle is {{considered}} a failure for France. Initially, France had desired a revolt against the governor of Salé to force repayment and avoid destruction of the city, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not occur. The French demanded that those who killed Christians in the city be sentenced to death, and that thieves have their hands cut off; however, the governor of Salé simply banished these people from the city.|$|E

5|$|Six of the {{cartoons}} were first reprinted by the Egyptian newspaper El Fagr on 17 October 2005, {{along with an}} article strongly denouncing them, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not provoke any condemnations or other reactions from religious or government authorities. Between October 2005 and early January 2006, examples of {{the cartoons}} were reprinted in major European newspapers from the Netherlands, Germany, Scandinavia, Romania, and Switzerland. After the beginning of major international protests, they were re-published around the globe, but primarily in continental Europe. The cartoons were not reprinted in any major newspapers in Canada, the United Kingdom, or many in the United States where articles covered the story without including them.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently {{recognised}} as {{the design}} {{from which all}} later locomotives are derived, Rocket eventually came to be {{considered one of the}} most important symbols of the Industrial Revolution.

It was loaned to the Patent Office for display in 1862. Moved to the Science Collection of the South Kensington Museum in 1876 (renamed the Science Museum in 1885), it has remained there ever since other than a brief display at the National Railway Museum.|$|E
5|$|The Government {{sought to}} use the MirageIII {{replacement}} program {{as a means to}} increase the capabilities of Australia's manufacturing industry. Accordingly, it was decided to build the aircraft in Australia, though it was recognised that this would lead to higher costs than if the fighters were purchased directly from the United States. While the first two RAAF Hornets were built in the United States, the remainder were assembled at the Government Aircraft Factories plant at Avalon Airport in Victoria, and their engines were produced by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne. Another twelve Australian companies were involved in other stages of the project. These firms were sub-contracted to McDonnell Douglas and the other major US companies that produced components for the F/A-18, and had to comply with the requirements of the FMS program. The Australian Government hoped that Singapore and New Zealand would purchase Australian-built Hornets, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not eventuate. The Canadian Government expressed interest in purchasing 25 Australian-built F/A-18As in 1988 in order to increase its force of these aircraft after they had ceased to be manufactured in the United States, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not lead to any sales.|$|E

It was initially hoped that the album would be ready for release by summer of 2012, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not come to fruition. Frontman Tom Araya later said that the album would be pushed back to a 2013 release, but this idea fell through.|$|E
5|$|The earlier Saxon Kings were {{assigned}} a gold cross {{on a blue}} shield, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not exist until the 13th century.

These arms were later used by Richard II of England out of devotion to the saint (Fraser, 44).|$|E
5|$|The {{track of}} Tropical Storm Gert was {{slightly}} {{more to the}} north than the National Hurricane Center's initial predictions, giving the storm more time to develop.
