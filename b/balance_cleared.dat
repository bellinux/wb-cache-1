On the basis of previous results, a tailored imagery script was developed to target critical flow dimensions, namely challenge-skills <b>balance,</b> <b>clear</b> goals, concentration on the task, and sense of control. It was hypothesised that the use of cognitive and motivational imagery would increase specific flow dimensions, which, in turn, would enhance flow state and competition performance. Participants in a single-case, multiple baseline A-B design study were four nationally ranked athletes. Following a 6 -week baseline phase monitoring flow state and performance and a 6 -week intervention phase, three participants showed a sustained increase in flow experiences, and all four participants improved their service performance, groundstroke performance, and ranking-list position...|$|R

Canonical correlation analysis revealed a confidence-achievement dimension underlying flow. Bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals in AMOS 20. 0 were used in examining mediation effects between source domains and dispositional flow. Results showed that sport confidence partially mediated the relationship between achievement and  self-regulation domains and flow, whereas no significant mediation was found for social climate.

These reasons include concerns over legitimizing target variations for future negotiations, real and perceived consequences of capital flows across nations, and distributional impacts within nations.

The ethical considerations involved in nanomedicine are related to risk assessment in general, somatic-cell versus germline-cell therapy, the enhancement of human capabilities, research into human embryonic stem cells and the toxicity, uncontrolled function and self-assembly of nanoparticles.

The {{study of}} European and Russian Quaternary glacial-geological {{evidence}} {{during the last}} 15 years has gen-erated sufficient data to use former glacial extent {{as a proxy for}} Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate (precipitation and temperature) at a continental scale.

40|$|Aim. The study {{aimed to}} examine 1) the {{validity}} of the nine-factor flow model in tennis competition; 2) differences in flow state between athletes who won or lost their competition match; 3) the link between flow and subjective performance; and 4) flow dimensions as predictors of performance outcome Methods. The sample consisted of 188 junior tennis players (115 male, 73 female) between 12 and 18 years of age. Participants' performance was recorded during junior ranking-list tournaments. Following the completion of a tennis competition match, participants completed the Flow State Scale- 2 and a subjective performance outcome measure. Results. Acceptable flow model fit indices of CFI, TLI, SRMR, and RMSEA were only found for winning athletes. The group of winning athletes scored significantly higher on all nine flow dimensions, except time transformation, than losing athletes, showing statistically significant differences for challenge-skills <b>balance,</b> <b>clear</b> goals, sense of control, and autotelic experience. Significant correlation coefficients were found between flow state and subjective performance assessments. The binary logistic regression revealed concentration on the task and sense of control to be significant predictors of performance outcome. The predictor variables explained 13 % of the variance in games won. Conclusion. The study showed that athletes who win or lose perceived flow state differently. Studies using retrospective assessments need to be aware that subjective experience could be biased by performance outcomes.

40|$|This essay critiques Professor Orin Kerr 2 ̆ 7 s provocative article, The Fourth Amendment and New Technologies: Constitutional Myths and the Case for Caution, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 801 (2004). Increasingly, Fourth Amendment {{protection}} is receding from {{a litany of}} law enforcement activities, and it is being replaced by federal statutes. Kerr notes these developments and argues that courts should place a thumb on the scale in favor of judicial caution when technology is in flux, and should consider allowing legislatures to provide the primary rules governing law enforcement investigations involving new technologies. Kerr 2 ̆ 7 s key contentions are that (1) legislatures create rules that are more comprehensive, <b>balanced,</b> <b>clear,</b> and flexible; (2) legislatures {{are better able to}} keep up with technological change; and (3) legislatures are more adept at understanding complex new technologies. I take issue with each of these arguments. Regarding Kerr 2 ̆ 7 s first contention, I argue that Congress has created an uneven fabric of protections that is riddled with holes and weak safeguards. Kerr 2 ̆ 7 s second contention - that legislatures are better able to update rules quickly as technology shifts - is belied by the historical record, which suggests Congress is actually far worse than the courts in reacting to new technologies. As for Kerr 2 ̆ 7 s third contention, shifting to a statutory regime will not eliminate Kerr 2 ̆ 7 s concern with judges misunderstanding technology. In fact, many judicial misunderstandings stem from courts trying to fit new technologies into an old statutory regime that is built around old technologies. Therefore, while Kerr is right that our attention must focus more on the statutes, he is wrong in urging for a deferential judicial approach to the Fourth Amendment...|$|R
