25|$|When Ritchie {{passed the}} first MiG-21, he {{recalled}} the engagement of May 10 and waited {{to see if there}} was a trailing MiG. When he observed the second MiG, which he also passed headon, he reversed hard left to engage. The Mig turned to its right to evade the attack, an unusual maneuver, and Ritchie used a vertical separation move to gain position on its rear quarter. DeBellevue obtained a solid <b>boresight</b> (dogfighting radar lock) on it while at the MiG's 5 o'clock; although fired from the edge of their flight envelopes, both AIM-7s struck home.|$|E
500|$|The optical {{nature of}} the {{reflector}} sight meant {{it was possible to}} feed other information into field of view, such as modifications of the aiming point due to deflection determined by input from a gyroscope. 1939 saw the development by the British of the first of these gyro gunsights, reflector sights adjusted by gyroscope for the aircraft's speed and rate of turn, enabling the display of a lead-adjusted sighting reticle that lagged the actual [...] "boresight" [...] of the weapon(s), allowing the <b>boresight</b> to lead the target in a turn by the proper amount for an effective strike ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{a typical}} 2 meter {{satellite}} dish operating on C band (4GHz), this formula gives a beamwidth of about 2.6°. [...] For the Arecibo antenna at 2.4GHz the beamwidth is 0.028°. [...] It {{can be seen}} that parabolic antennas can produce very narrow beams, and aiming them can be a problem. [...] Some parabolic dishes are equipped with a <b>boresight</b> so they can be aimed accurately at the other antenna.|$|E
50|$|Traditional <b>boresighting,</b> as {{the name}} suggests, {{involves}} removing the bolt and sighting down the bore of a gun to a fixed point. While the rifle is fixed in place, the scope or irons can then be adjusted to also aim at the distant object. A more modern method of <b>boresighting</b> {{is to use a}} laser rather than by visual inspection to illuminate the distant point. This method is preferable because it allows more movement in the gun, as the laser dot will not move relative to the barrel, and is a method of <b>boresighting</b> which does not require the removal of the bolt.|$|R

Hand signals enable the gunner (inside the tank) to train the main gun onto a <b>boresighting</b> target.|$|R
50|$|A more {{advanced}} method of <b>boresighting</b> uses a collimator, an optical attachment {{similar to a}} scope sight, which fits onto {{the end of the}} barrel. Using this method, the normal sight (which is fixed to the receiver) and the collimator (which is fixed to the barrel) can be sighted to match. Most collimators have grid patterns for rechecking the zero after the barrel is sighted.|$|R
2500|$|The AN/FPS-115 radar {{consists}} of two phased arrays of antenna elements mounted on two sloping sides of the 105ft high transmitter building, which are oriented 120° apart in azimuth. [...] The beam from each array can be deflected up to 60° from the array's central <b>boresight</b> axis, allowing each array to cover an azimuth angle of 120°, thus the entire radar can cover an azimuth of 240°. [...] The building sides are sloped at an angle of 20°, and the beam can be directed at any elevation angle between 3° and 85°. [...] The beam is kept at least 100ft above the ground over public-accessible land to avoid the possibility of exposing the public to significant electromagnetic fields.|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} and radar engineering, antenna <b>boresight</b> is {{the axis of}} maximum gain (maximum radiated power) of a directional antenna. For most antennas the <b>boresight</b> is the axis of symmetry of the antenna. For example, for axial-fed dish antennas, the antenna <b>boresight</b> is the axis of symmetry of the parabolic dish, and the antenna radiation pattern (the main lobe) is symmetrical about the <b>boresight</b> axis. Most antennas <b>boresight</b> axis is fixed by their shape and cannot be changed. However phased array antennas can electronically steer the beam, changing {{the angle of the}} <b>boresight</b> by shifting the relative phase of the radio waves emitted by different antenna elements, and even radiate beams in multiple directions (multiple boresights).|$|E

It can be elevated from −89 mils (−5 degrees) {{to a maximum of}} 1,333 mils (75 degrees). The panoramic telescope has a four power, fixed focus optical system, with 178 mils field of view. It contains dry nitrogen gas to retard fogging and condensation. The parallax shield used during <b>boresighting</b> protects the lens.|$|R
50|$|LITENING is an {{integrated}} targeting pod that mounts externally to the aircraft. The targeting pod contains a high-resolution, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor that displays an infrared {{image of the}} target to the aircrew; it has a wide field of view search capability and a narrow field of view acquisition/targeting capability of battlefield-sized targets. The pod also contains a CCD camera used to obtain target imagery in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. An on-gimbal inertial navigation sensor establishes line-of-sight and automatic <b>boresighting</b> capability.|$|R
50|$|Normally the {{parameter}} {{of interest}} is antenna gain. In this case the reference antenna is built {{to have a high}} degree of repeatability in its radiation pattern and <b>boresight</b> gain. A common practice is to measure the <b>boresight</b> gain of a reference antenna across its operational frequency band. Other parameters are sometimes of interest though, such as antenna efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Conical scan systems {{send out}} a signal {{slightly}} {{to one side of}} the antenna's <b>boresight,</b> and then rotating the feed horn to make the lobe rotate around the <b>boresight</b> line. A target centered on the <b>boresight</b> is always slightly illuminated by the lobe, and provides a strong return. If the target is to one side, it will be illuminated only when the lobe is pointed in that general direction, resulting in a weaker signal overall (or a flashing one if the rotation is slow enough). This varying signal will reach a maximum when the antenna is rotated so it is aligned in the direction of the target, by looking for this maximum and moving the antenna in that direction, a target can be automatically tracked.|$|E

The M3A3 {{is compatible with the}} inter-vehicular communication system of the M1A2 Abrams tank and AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopter. The commander has an independent thermal viewer and a new integrated sight unit called the Improved Bradley Acquisition System (IBAS), which allows automatic gun adjustments, automatic <b>boresighting,</b> and tracking of dual targets. The roof is reinforced with titanium armor. Many M3A3s were converted from M3A2s.|$|R
50|$|The TOW ITAS {{consists}} of three new line replaceable units: the target acquisition subsystem (TAS), the fire control subsystem (FCS), and the lithium battery box (LBB); a modified TOW 2 traversing unit; the existing TOW launch tube and tripod; and a TOW Humvee modification kit. The TAS integrates into a single housing the direct view optics, a second-generation forward looking infrared (FLIR) night vision sight (NVS), missile trackers, and a laser rangefinder. TAS electronics provide automatic <b>boresighting</b> for these components, eliminating both tactical collimation and 180-day verification requirements.|$|R
40|$|A new {{pointing}} mode {{has been}} developed for the Solar, Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) spacecraft. This pointing mode orients the instrument <b>boresights</b> perpendicular to the field lines of the Earth's magnetic field in regions of low field strength and parallel to the field lines in regions of high field strength, to allow better characterization of heavy ions trapped by the field. The new mode uses magnetometer signals and is algorithmically simpler than the previous control mode, but it requires increased momentum wheel activity.

Ryder showed agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on November 25, 1963, a tag which he claimed was in Oswald's handwriting. The undated tag, with the name OSWALD, attested that three holes had been drilled into an unspecified kind of rifle. Further, a telescopic sight had been mounted on the rifle and boresighted.
