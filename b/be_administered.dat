5|$|Local {{historic}} districts usually {{enjoy the}} greatest {{level of protection}} legally from any threats that may compromise their historic integrity because many land-use decisions are made at the local level.

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may <b>be</b> <b>administered.</b> General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of oxygenation and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Several {{treatments}} can <b>be</b> <b>administered</b> via bronchoscopy for {{the management}} of airway obstruction or bleeding.

5|$|These {{symptoms}} may {{be severe}} enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; antispasmodic medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and activated charcoal may <b>be</b> <b>administered</b> early on to bind residual toxin.

Once gastric contents are emptied, metoclopramide {{may be used in}} cases of recurrent vomiting.|$|E

The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 that over 50,000 {{medicinal plant}}s are used across the world.

5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can <b>be</b> <b>administered</b> by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week {{because of the risk}} of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and it should not be used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to <b>be</b> <b>administered</b> in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E

While 25 different medications <b>were</b> <b>administered,</b> the medication most frequently <b>administered</b> <b>was</b> methylphenidate (60 %). Medications <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> orally, per inhaler, nebulizer, topically or injected. They <b>were</b> <b>administered</b> to 189 students ages 5 - 23 with a mean age of 10. 81 years and a mode of 9 years...|$|R
