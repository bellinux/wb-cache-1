5|$|Aviation {{had been}} {{introduced}} to Greece in February 1912, when Emmanouil Argyropoulos performed a flight, with his privately owned Nieuport IV.G aircraft, around Athens. An hour later a second flight was carried on with the Prime Minister of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos as passenger. Venizelos, impressed by the potential of air warfare, suggested that Greece should take advance of this new weapon. The following months a French military mission took up the development of Greek aviation <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> fleet of four Maurice Farman MF.7 airplanes. In June 1912, aviator Dimitrios Kamperos modified one of the Farmans into a hydroplane, giving it {{the name of the}} mythical hero Daedalus.|$|E

5|$|Battle Network {{was created}} amidst {{the success of}} Nintendo's {{portable}} RPG franchise Pokémon. According to producer Keiji Inafune, the development team wanted Battle Network to identify specifically with younger gamers <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> setting resembling {{the real world and}} a gameplay model that mixes traditional action and RPG elements. Battle Network received positive reviews from critics. Its unconventional combat system was given significant praise and its presentation was well-regarded. However, its storyline was met with mixed opinions. The game was followed by a number of sequels and spin-off titles, as well as other media.|$|E

Marceline, in her evil demon form, listens to the requests of her subjects, often ignoring what they seek and instead punishing them with macabre torture. Finn and Jake are spotted by Marceline, who gives chase. After narrowly avoiding their demonic friend, the duo run into the now-benign Hunson Abadeer, who explains that he only wanted Marceline to follow in his footsteps and rule the hellish realm.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët entered electoral {{politics}} in August 1945, when {{elections for the}} Abidjan city council were held for the first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected {{would have to be}} French citizens (who were mostly Europeans) and the other half non-citizens. Houphouët reacted <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens and citizens (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E

5|$|Maria Theresa was as {{conservative}} {{in matters of}} state as in those of religion, but implemented significant reforms to strengthen Austria's military and bureaucratic efficiency. She employed Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz, who modernised the empire <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> standing army of 108,000men, paid for with 14million gulden extracted from each crown-land. The central government {{was responsible for the}} army, although Haugwitz instituted taxation of the nobility, who never before had to pay taxes. Maria Theresa oversaw the unification of the Austrian and Bohemian chancellories in May 1749.|$|E

He rose to stardom in such films as Girls Gone Wild and Chasing Through Europe, prior to expanding his business interests <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> talent agency, and a popular upscale club in Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
