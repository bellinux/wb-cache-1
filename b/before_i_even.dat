500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> heard anything and then my phone rang and I got the call. It's exciting. They told me they would call {{me as soon as}} the draft was over and we would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{getting a}} green-light from Rahman, they asked Scherzinger, the leader {{singer of the}} Pussycat Dolls, to write an {{interpretation}} of the song. Scherzinger was hesitant at first, stating in an interview that: [...] " [...] I was scared to death to touch it [...] afraid for people to hear it <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> wrote it". Scherzinger put her [...] "heart into writing the lyrics and put in themes from the film Slumdog Millionaire. Love and destiny were elements from the movie that she put into the track". She stated that she [...] "prayed every night to do this right". Fair and Iovine additionally hired Brick & Lace, The Writing Camp and Ester Dean to write their own interpretation of the song.|$|E
500|$|With the album, Badu {{sought to}} augment her music's production, expose {{the work of}} {{underground}} hip hop producers, and exceed listeners' expectations of contemporary music. She explained to Billboard that [...] "in taking on a project like this, I'm taking the responsibility to talk for my race and my planet." [...] In an interview for the New York Post, she explained the album to be about [...] "the war against self ... against your inner being", and said of her hiatus, [...] "I've always taken my time between albums. I'm a performing artist - recording is secondary to me. My performances are what drive me. It's like my therapy. I like to write a lot while I'm on the road <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> think about recording." [...] Badu also said that she now had a relevant message to express for listeners and was no longer struggling with a creative block.|$|E

500|$|The {{biological}} father of Superman. Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also {{considered for the}} role. Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El, stating that [...] "...it {{was one of those}} things where that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. And I was on the movie for three-and-a-half or four months <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> got in front of the camera." ...|$|E
500|$|Heiner {{apologized for}} any role {{members of his}} {{campaign}} may have had in perpetuating the accusations against Comer, but the story touched off a feud between Heiner and Comer that some analysts predicted would benefit Bevin. Bevin declared that Heiner's alleged connection to the Comer accusations had [...] "disqualified [...] from being the GOP nominee for governor". During a debate featuring all four Republican candidates on Kentucky Sports Radio, Bevin said, [...] "I don't know if [...] behind the Comer story, but I'm telling you his people have been pushing {{this for a long}} time. And Hal himself has personally told me months and months ago <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> got in this race, that he knew things, not had heard things, that he knew things based on conversations that his people had had about Jamie Comer." [...] Bevin also released an ad depicting Comer and Heiner as children in a food fight, with the narrator promising that Bevin would bring [...] "grown up leadership" [...] to the governor's race.|$|E
500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1996, Oasis were widely considered, {{according}} to guitarist Noel Gallagher, [...] "the biggest band in the world... bigger than, dare I say it, fucking God." [...] The commercial success of the band's two previous albums had resulted in media frenzy and an ubiquity in the mainstream press that {{was in danger of}} leading to a backlash. Oasis members were by then being invited to functions at 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Tony Blair and holidaying with Johnny Depp and Kate Moss in Mick Jagger's villa in Mustique. During their last stay on the island, Noel wrote the majority of the songs that would make up Oasis's third album. He had suffered from writer's block during the previous winter, and has since admitted he wrote only a single guitar riff in the six months following the release of (What's the Story) Morning Glory?. After a few weeks [...] "idling", he disciplined himself to a routine of songwriting where he would go [...] "into this room in the morning, come out for lunch, go back in, come out for dinner, go back in, then go to bed." [...] Noel has later said about the album [...] "...most of the songs were written <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> got a record deal, I went away and wrote the lyrics in about two weeks." [...] The band's producer Owen Morris joined Gallagher later with a TASCAM 8-track recorder, and they recorded demos with a drum machine and a keyboard.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and how she {{did not believe that}} the video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem. He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> started rapping. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was too young to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E
2500|$|Sobers went on {{his first}} {{overseas}} tour {{in the early months}} of 1956 when, aged 19, {{he was part of the}} West Indian tour of New Zealand. The series was not successful personally for Sobers, who struggled on the foreign batting wickets. West Indies pitches had little or no grass to speak of, while in New Zealand the pitches were green. [...] "I took one look and asked myself how I could possibly bat on that? How could I make runs? I was out <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> walked to the crease," [...] Sobers later wrote. Playing in all four Tests, he totalled 81 runs and two wickets. As a batsman, Sobers needed time to develop at Test level and, in nine Tests as a teenager, he scored only one half century, and averaged 29.33 with the bat.|$|E

2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger.

2500|$|In late 228, Zhuge Liang {{launched}} a second campaign against Wei and besieged the Wei fortress at Chencang (陳倉; present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi), which was defended by Hao Zhao. Cao Rui summoned Zhang He {{back to the}} capital Luoyang to discuss plans to counter the Shu invasion but they met in Henan instead. Cao Rui placed Zhang He in command of 30,000 troops and reassigned some of the Imperial Guards to serve as Zhang's bodyguards. He asked Zhang He, [...] "General, if you're late, will Zhuge Liang have already captured Chencang?" [...] Zhang He predicted that Zhuge Liang's forces could not maintain the siege on Chencang for long because they lacked supplies. He replied, [...] "Zhuge Liang will have already left <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> reach Chencang. I estimate he has less than 10 days worth of supplies." [...] He then led his troops towards Nanzheng (南鄭; present-day Nanzheng County, Shaanxi), travelling day and night. The Shu forces retreated. Cao Rui summoned Zhang He back to Luoyang and commissioned him as General of Chariots and Cavalry Who Attacks the West (征西車騎將軍).|$|E
2500|$|Doug Jones as the Faun and the Pale Man. As the Faun, Jones guides Ofelia to {{the fantasy}} world. As the Pale Man, {{he plays a}} {{grotesque}} monster with an appetite for children. Jones had previously worked with del Toro on Mimic and Hellboy, and said the director sent him an email saying, [...] "You must be in this film. No one else can play this part but you." [...] Jones responded enthusiastically to an English translation of the script, but then found out the film was in Spanish, {{which he did not}} speak. Jones says he was [...] "terrified" [...] and del Toro suggested learning the script phonetically, but Jones rejected this, preferring to learn the words himself. He said, [...] "I really, really buckled down and committed myself to learning that word for word and I got the pronunciation semi-right <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> went in," [...] using the five hours a day he spent getting the costume and make-up on to practice the words. Del Toro later decided to dub Jones with the voice of Pablo Adán, [...] "an authoritative theatre actor", but Jones's efforts remained valuable because the voice actor was able to match his delivery with Jones's mouth movements. Jones's dual casting is intended to suggest that the Pale Man (along with the toad) is either a creation of the Faun, or the Faun himself in another form.|$|E

60|$|That {{at least}} was evident; but the {{question}} how {{it was to be}} accomplished remained, for I recoiled, blinded and choking, at the first attempt, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>even</b> reached the door. I had framed it, with my own hands, of stout tenoned logs, so that it would fit tightly to keep out the frost. One of the posts loosened by the fire had settled, apparently since the last person entered the building. Another man went with me the second time, but though we managed to reach the handle the door remained immovable, and once more we reeled back beaten, when a strip of blazing thatch fell almost on our heads.

Now, though winter is almost Arctic in that region, the snow-fall is capricious and {{generally}} much lighter than that further east, though it can come down in earnest now and then. Thus, swept by the wind, the grass was bare on the levels, or nearly so, and there was no passage for steel runners, while our poor wagon, which would have carried us much more snugly swathed in wrappings, had broken down, as when wanted it usually did. So, shivering to the backbone, I swung myself into the saddle and hardened my heart to face the bitter ride.|$|E
