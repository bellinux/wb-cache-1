25|$|Even more confusingly, {{a hybrid}} cable car/funicular line once {{existed in the}} form of the {{original}} Wellington Cable Car, in the New Zealand city of Wellington. This line had both a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, and a <b>balance</b> <b>cable</b> permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the <b>balance</b> <b>cable.</b> This line was rebuilt in 1979 and is now a standard funicular, although it retains its old cable car name.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} designs for {{impedance}} matching using an autotransformer, {{which is a}} single-wire transformer with different connection points or taps spaced along the windings. They are distinguished mainly by their impedance transform ratio (1:1, 1:4, 1:9, etc., {{the square of the}} winding ratio), and whether the input and output sides share a common ground, or are matched from a cable that is grounded on one side (unbalanced) to an ungrounded (usually <b>balanced)</b> <b>cable.</b> When autotransformers connect balanced and unbalanced lines they are called baluns, just as two-winding transformers. When two differently-grounded cables or circuits must be connected but the grounds kept independent, a full, two-winding transformer with the desired ratio is used instead.|$|E
50|$|An E1 link {{operates}} over two separate sets of wires, usually Unshielded twisted pair (<b>balanced</b> <b>cable)</b> or using coaxial (unbalanced cable). A nominal 3 volt peak signal is encoded with pulses using a method avoiding long periods without polarity changes. The line data rate is 2.048 Mbit/s (full duplex, i.e. 2.048 Mbit/s downstream and 2.048 Mbit/s upstream) which is split into 32 timeslots, each being allocated 8 bits in turn. Thus each timeslot sends and receives an 8-bit PCM sample, usually encoded according to A-law algorithm, 8,000 times per second (8 × 8,000 × 32 = 2,048,000). This {{is ideal for}} voice telephone calls where the voice is sampled at that data rate and reconstructed at the other end. The timeslots are numbered from 0 to 31.|$|E
50|$|A more {{comprehensive}} {{solution is to}} use equipment that employs balanced signal lines. Ground noise can only get into the signal path in an unbalanced line, in which the ground or shield conductor serves as {{one side of the}} signal path. In a <b>balanced</b> <b>cable,</b> the signal is sent as a differential signal along a pair of wires, neither of which are connected to ground. Any noise from the ground system induced in the signal lines is a common-mode signal, identical in both wires. Since the line receiver at the destination end only responds to differential signals, a difference in voltage between the two lines, the common-mode noise is cancelled out. Thus these systems are very immune to electrical noise, including ground noise. Professional and scientific equipment often uses balanced cabling.|$|E

40|$|The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute’s (MBARI’s) 4000 meter {{remotely}} operated vehicle (ROV), Tiburon operates directly off a double helically wound steel cable {{without the use of}} a clump weight. On dives between 1500 and 4000 meters, rotationally induced hockles or tight bends in the umbilical cable have intermittently occurred. The hockles have the potential to disable and possibly even lose Tiburon. In an effort to compensate for this problem, MBARI engineers are designing a rotation sensor that clamps on the cable near the sections where hockles have occurred. A magnetic compass will take the heading of the cable and send the processed information acoustically back to the ship or vehicle. This information will appear on the ROV pilot’s display screen so that the ROV pilot can compensate for any rotation or misalignment before hockles occur. This paper describes the mechanical design and analysis of the umbilical cable rotation sensor. The goals of the mechanical design are to house the electronics and batteries in a safe and clean environment, incorporate the housings in a hydrodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>cable</b> clamp assembly and allow for easy attachment and removal from the umbilical.

40|$|In {{the first}} part is {{explained}} what actually a structured cabling is. Its beginning, from what and why it was created. Its history when at the beginning were applied unbalanced coaxial cables, those were later replaced by balanced cables. In cabling for TVs are still used coaxial cables. Balanced cables are according to type named UTP, STP, FTP, and so on. Whit growing popularity {{of this type of}} cabling and its wide spread application was necessary to set some rules, standards, specifications and demands, how to build up the cabling from project to realization. According to these rules is the system built so there are strict rules for length of subsystems and interfaces and the whole appearance of the structure cabling. Next important point is projecting of cabling that is related to the previous points and when it’s finished, we should strictly follow it. With the project is closely connected characteristic of this cabling as attenuations, cross-talks and other transmission parameters which are measured in the practical part. In the second part is spoken about all the parts of which the structured cabling consists - metallic and optical connecting elements and cables. There are also mentioned their mechanical, electrical and transmission features. In the third part is described influence of man on the quality of structured cabling and the most common causes of lower quality and the ways how to prevent this from happening and how to manipulate with cabling not to destroy it.

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} today is a heavily regulated segment, and current standard hasestablished restrictions which yields a very limited weather window for offshore cable installations. This is due to experience with cable failure in harsh weather. A limiting factor in current practice is the design criterion for the minimum allowable radius of curvature in the touchdown point. In addition, current practice does not allow for occurrence of compression in the touch down zone, since this is associated with loop formation and loss of the functionality of the cable. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the validity and conservatism of current practice, by investigating the issues related to torsion instability through a proposed design procedure. The scope of the thesis comprehends numerical analyses using the SINTEF OCEAN developed software SIMLA. The numerical studies concern a J-lay installation scenario at 100 meters water depth with an implemented cable laying vessel with realistic RAO properties. Two real-life cable cross-sections are evaluated; a single-layered cable without armoring (umbilical 1) and a torsional <b>balanced</b> <b>cable</b> with double-armoring (umbilical 2). The mechanical properties of these are calculated analytically, where the main differences lay in the torsional stiffness of the cross-sections. The effect of installation route is evaluated, and two scenarios are simulated; an end cap turn and a curved route to avoid obstacles. The results are obtained in two steps. Primarily, the critical values of torsion momentand resultant curvature with respect to loop formation are established. These parameters are determined for both a linear and a non-linear pipe material model. Subsequently a range of dynamic analyses with irregular waves are carried out. The irregular waves are applied using a Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum with Hs= 2 − 3 mandTp= 7 − 10 s with a one hour simulation time. In the dynamic analyses, the torsion moment and curvature in the cable are analyzed and compared with the capacity parameters for each scenario. For umbilical 1 it is found that the maximum resultant curvature for all sea states exceeds the critical API curvature, while the torsion moment is below the critical torsion moment. The sea states can, due to excess of the API criterion, not be classified as acceptable. It is also concluded that a contributing factor is the low magnitude of the horizontal bottom tension. The maximum resultant curvature for umbilical 2 oscillates around curvature values below the design criterion for minimum radius of curvature for all sea states. The torsion moments are lower than the critical torsion moment. All seastates for umbilical 2 are categorized as acceptable with respect to experienced resultant curvature. It is in addition investigated whether the cables experience compression in the touch down zone while subjected to irregular waves. For umbilical 1 it is found that compression occurs inthe touch down zone for all sea states for both installation scenarios. Umbilical 2 experiences compression in varying degree for all sea states except for Hs= 2 m,Tp= 7 s. The magnitude of the compressive axial force is increasing in accordance with increasing wave height andperiod. The magnitude of the compressive axial forces experienced are compared with the buckling loads associated with local helix buckling and birdcaging. None of the force values are within the range for the buckling loads for tensile armour buckling. Hence it can be concluded that its possible with occurrence of compression without necessarily associated kink formation nor local buckling. The effect of wave heading is also investigated. Changing the wave heading impacts the maximum resultant curvature. It is found that the most critical scenario occur when the waves are incoming with a heading of [π, 2 π]. This is due to the cable configuration, which experience a slight bend in the touch down zone at the initiation of the dynamics. It is also carried out a study of the effect of additional sea current. A current velocity of 4 m/s with correspondingly heading of 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, 270 ° is applied. This result in the observation that the most critical scenario is a current heading of 180 ° due to reduction of the cable effective weight. It is investigated whether a too low horizontal bottom tension is the reason of the severe curvature levels for umbilical 1. Analyses with a T 0 = 5 kN are run for the respective sea states. Resulting from this the curvature levels for umbilical 1 is lowered to acceptable levels for Hs= 2 m. The same analyses are carried out for umbilical 2, where the resulting curvatures increase compared to lower initial tension. This is due to severe yielding of the friction moment for the case of T 0 = 5 kN, inducing more severe deformation of the cable...|$|E
