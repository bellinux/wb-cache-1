25|$|Infliximab (trade names Remicade among others) is a {{chimeric}} {{monoclonal antibody}} <b>biologic</b> <b>drug</b> that works against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) {{and is used}} to treat autoimmune diseases.

It cannot be given by mouth because the digestive system would destroy the drug.|$|E
25|$|RA reduces {{lifespan}} {{on average}} {{from three to}} twelve years. According to the UK's National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, Young age at onset, long disease duration, the concurrent presence of other health problems (called co-morbidity), and characteristics of severe RA—such as poor functional ability or overall health status, a lot of joint damage on x-rays, the need for hospitalisation or involvement of organs other than the joints—have been shown to associate with higher mortality". Positive responses to treatment may indicate a better prognosis. A 2005 study by the Mayo Clinic noted that RA sufferers suffer a doubled risk of heart disease, independent of other risk factors such as diabetes, alcohol abuse, and elevated cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index. The mechanism by which RA causes this increased risk remains unknown; the presence of chronic inflammation has been proposed as a contributing factor. It {{is possible that the}} use of new <b>biologic</b> <b>drug</b> therapies extend the lifespan of people with RA and reduce the risk and progression of atherosclerosis. This is based on cohort and registry studies, and still remains hypothetical. It is still uncertain whether biologics improve vascular function in RA or not.

40|$|Similarity is {{an elusive}} and {{complicated}} concept facing comparisons of biological molecules, as even minute changes to a molecule 2 ̆ 7 s structure can dramatically affect its {{function in the}} body. Yet the flood of <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs</b> on the market will increasingly force these similarity comparisons. These concerns are particularly relevant to two groups of drugs: families of <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs</b> that closely resemble each other in structure and function, here termed 2 ̆ 2 similar-impact biologics, 2 ̆ 2 and the biosimilars, which are intended to closely approximate generic forms of <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs.</b> In bringing <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs</b> to the market, manufacturers are likely to face dual obstacles: FDA approval and patent protection. These hurdles are somewhat in tension with each other. The more similar biosimilars are to their pioneer counterparts, the more easily they may advance to market via the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act 2 ̆ 7 s (2 ̆ 2 BPCIA 2 ̆ 2) new accelerated approval pathway. While the FDA has provided some guidance about how much similarity is likely to suffice, the standard is not yet clearly defined. In contrast, the more similar two drugs are to one another, the less likely {{that they will be}} able to obtain patent protection. Further, <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs</b> pose special issues when considering various legal factors required for patentability. Resolving these questions for the optimal benefit of all stakeholders requires both fundamental institutional competency and a willingness on the part of decision makers to engage with difficult scientific questions. This Note explores these ongoing challenges, with particular focus on the clinical and litigation history of the TNFá inhibitors Humira, Enbrel, and Remicade...|$|R

50|$|In 1989 Vilček and NYU colleague, Junming Le, {{created a}} {{monoclonal}} antibody against TNF-alpha, a powerful promoter of inflammation. TNF-alpha {{is involved in}} the pathogenesis of numerous chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Collaborating with the biotechnology company Centocor, founded by Michael Wall and Hubert Schoemaker (later acquired by Johnson & Johnson and recently renamed Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Vilček and Le helped to develop the <b>biologic</b> <b>drug</b> initially termed cA2, which is now known commercially as infliximab, or Remicade. Remicade is a potent anti-inflammatory agent used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases.|$|E
50|$|Individuals with {{psoriasis}} {{may develop}} neutralizing antibodies against monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization occurs when an antidrug antibody prevents a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab from binding antigen {{in a laboratory}} test. Specifically, neutralization occurs when the antidrug antibody binds to infliximab's antigen binding site instead of TNF-α. When infliximab no longer binds tumor necrosis factor alpha, it no longer decreases inflammation, and psoriasis may worsen. Neutralizing antibodies have not been reported against etanercept, a <b>biologic</b> <b>drug</b> that is a fusion protein composed of two TNF-α receptors. The lack of neutralizing antibodies against etanercept is probably secondary to the innate presence of the TNF-α receptor, {{and the development of}} immune tolerance.|$|E
5000|$|PBMs {{have been}} strong proponents in the {{creation}} of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pathway to approve similar versions of expensive specialty drug that treat conditions like Alzheimer's, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. So-called biosimilar legislation that does not grant brand name drug manufacturers monopoly pricing power is strongly supported by PBMs, AARP, AFL-CIO, the Ford Motor Company, and dozens of other consumer, labor, and employer organizations concerned about runaway health care costs in both the private and public sector. A recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that patents for biologic products already provide enough incentives for innovation and that additional periods of exclusivity would [...] "not spur the creation of a new <b>biologic</b> <b>drug</b> or indication" [...] and [...] "imperils" [...] the benefits of the approval process.|$|E
40|$|<b>Biologic</b> <b>drugs,</b> as {{with all}} other medical technologies, are subject {{to a number of}} regulatory, marketing, {{reimbursement}} (financing) and other demand-restricting hurdles applied by healthcare payers. One example is the routine use of cost-effectiveness analyses or health technology assessments to determine which medical technologies offer value-for-money. The manner in which these assessments are conducted suggests that, holding all else equal, the economic value of <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs</b> may be determined by how much is spent on administering these drugs or trade-offs between drug acquisition and administration costs. Yet, on the supply-side, it seems very little attention is given to how manufacturing and formulation choices affect healthcare delivery costs. This paper evaluates variations in the administration costs of <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs,</b> taking care to ensure consistent inclusion of all relevant cost resources.

40|$|Introduction. Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin disease affecting approximately 2 – 3 % {{of the general}} population. It is a condition with immunological and genetic background, coexisting with psoriatic arthritis in about 25 % of cases. <b>Biologic</b> <b>drugs</b> have brought a significant improvement in managing the disease, however they are not approved {{for the treatment of}} pustular psoriasis. An increasing number of reports indicate the efficacy of biological drugs in pustular psoriasis. In some patients there are factors responsible for a worse clinical response to biologic therapy.

40|$|Biologic agents {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are able to reduce both disease activity and radiographic progression of joint disease. These drugs are directed against several proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL- 6, and IL- 1) which are involved both in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation and progression of joint structural damage and in systemic and local bone loss typically observed in RA. However, the role of <b>biologic</b> <b>drugs</b> in preventing bone loss in clinical practice has not yet clearly assessed.
