5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and were less likely to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> valuable testimony.

5|$|The Menzies {{government}} {{was reluctant to}} choose as interim replacement the A-5 or the F-4, {{which could not be}} deployed until 1966 and would cost A$120–180 million. Waiting for the TSR-2 or TFX in 1969 or 1970 seemed to pose great risk, but when considering Hancock's findings in September 1963 it wanted to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> a substantial response to the Labor party's criticism of its defence strategy. The British and American governments competed on behalf of their nations' unbuilt bombers, as both believed that export sales would increase domestic support for the aircraft. The Menzies government viewed the British promise to deploy a squadron of V bombers in Australia for interim defense until the TSR-2 was ready as unacceptable for both technical and political reasons. Beyond its cost, the Royal Air Force had not ordered the TSR-2; the Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Louis Mountbatten, who opposed it, advised the Australians against buying the aircraft and the RAAF feared being the only customer.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} (training) of Jesuits {{seeks to}} prepare men spiritually, academically, and practically for the ministries {{they will be}} called to offer the church and world. Saint Ignatius was strongly influenced by the Renaissance, and he wanted Jesuits to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> whatever ministries were most needed {{at any given moment}} and, especially, to be ready to respond to missions (assignments) from the pope. Formation for priesthood normally takes between eight and fourteen years, depending on the man's background and previous education, and final vows are taken several years after that, making Jesuit formation among the longest of any of the religious orders.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{format for}} {{contemporary}} Let's Play videos is vague, {{and at times}} may be compared or considered {{the same as a}} player completing a game via streaming video for an audience. According to Patrick Lee of The A.V. Club, a good Let's Play video distinguishes itself from straightforward streaming playthroughs when the player has sufficiently familiarized themselves with the game as to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> better commentary and show off more of the game to their audience, is able to provide the audience with personal recollections about the game, or can play through a game they have already completed under self-imposed challenges, such as completing a game without killing any enemy. Through this approach, Lee states, such Let's Play videos serve to help memorialize these games, helping those who may not have access to the titles (due to age or regional restrictions) to appreciate more obscure games.|$|E
25|$|Israel started digital {{transmissions}} in MPEG-4 on Sunday, 2 August 2009 and analogue transmissions {{ended on}} 31 March 2011. Israel {{was the first}} nation in the Middle East and the first non-European nation to shut down its analogue TV distribution system. The new service which is operated by The Second Authority for Television and Radio in Israel currently offers 6 SD TV channels and 30 national and regional (private) radio services. According to government decisions, the system will expand to include two additional multiplexes that will carry new channels and HD versions of the existing channels. There is a proposition by the Ministry of Finance to run a tender in order {{to hand over the}} maintenance of the system to a private company that, in return, will receive an extended license and will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> pay TV channels.

In Europe, bands available for LTE include, 2.6GHz (the 3G-expansion band) and 800MHz (cleared of analogue TV), with 1,800MHz appearing in a few places including the UK. In Germany, the only carrier network supported is that of T-Mobile with its 1,800MHz band allocated to LTE. Some countries in Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and others—will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> LTE connectivity via the iPhone 5 to their customers on their current LTE networks, as they have already deployed LTE in the 2.6GHz band, which the iPhone 5 does not support.

The diplomats insisted they must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> safe passage out of the UK for the gunmen, believing this to {{be the only way to}} guarantee a peaceful outcome, but the British government was adamant that safe passage would not be considered under any circumstances. Karkhouti, through whom Oan had issued his revised demands the previous day, became increasingly ill throughout the day and by the evening was feverish, which led to suggestions that the police had spiked the food that had been sent into the embassy.
