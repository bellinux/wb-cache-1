50|$|The {{distance}} from one parting {{edge to the}} other is slightly larger than the corresponding distance in the housing so that a light amount of pressure is required to install the <b>bearing.</b> This <b>keeps</b> the <b>bearing</b> in place as {{the two halves of}} the housing are installed. Finally, the shell's circumference is also slightly larger than the housing circumference so that when the two halves are bolted together the bearing crushes slightly. This creates a large amount of radial force around the entire <b>bearing,</b> which <b>keeps</b> it from spinning. It also forms a good interface for heat to travel out of the bearings into the housing.|$|R

50|$|Some {{bearings}} use a thick grease for lubrication, {{which is}} {{pushed into the}} gaps between the bearing surfaces, also known as packing. The grease is {{held in place by}} a plastic, leather, or rubber gasket (also called a gland) that covers the inside and outside edges of the <b>bearing</b> race to <b>keep</b> the grease from escaping.|$|R
50|$|For {{high speed}} and high power machines, {{a loss of}} {{lubricant}} can result in rapid bearing heating and damage due to friction. Also in dirty environments the oil can become contaminated with dust or debris that increases friction. In these applications, a fresh supply of lubricant can be continuously supplied to the bearing and all other contact surfaces, and the excess can be collected for filtration, cooling, and possibly reuse. Pressure oiling is commonly used in large and complex internal combustion engines {{in parts of the}} engine where directly splashed oil cannot reach, such as up into overhead valve assemblies. High speed turbochargers also typically require a pressurized oil system to cool the <b>bearings</b> and <b>keep</b> them from burning up due to the heat from the turbine.|$|R
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings used on oil-free centrifugal refrigeration compressors {{have lower}} stiffness than conventional oil-lubricated journal or rolling element bearings. The lower stiffness of these bearings makes them sensitive to internal flow instabilities that are precursors of rotating stall or compressor surge. At operating conditions {{far away from}} surge the internal flow is very stable and the magnetic <b>bearings</b> <b>keep</b> the shaft centered, resulting in a minimal bearing orbit. The internal flow instabilities that arise when the compressor approaches the surge limit result in some radially fluctuating forces on the shaft. The active magnetic bearings correct for these fluctuating radial forces on the shaft. The bearing orbit increases {{with the size of}} these radial forces. Optimum compressor efficiency occurs close to surge at incipient stall conditions when maximum internal flow pressure recovery occurs. The positional feedback system of the active magnetic bearing control loop system indicates the bearing orbit which relates to compressor efficiency. At high flow conditions capacity is controlled by compressor speed for the imposed pressure ratio. At low flow conditions a combination of variable speed and a means of range extension (e. g. inlet guide vanes, variable geometry diffuser, or flow recirculation) are required to control capacity at the imposed pressure ratio and guarantee stable compressor operation. The bearing orbit signal can be used to determine which speed/geometry combination gives the highest compressor efficiency. If the bearing orbit is below a minimum value the compressor runs too close to choke and a reduction in speed combined with an opening of the diffuser throat area would increase compressor efficiency. If, on the other hand, the bearing orbit is above a maximum value the compressor runs too close to surge and an increase in speed combined with a closing of the diffuser throat area is required to increase compressor efficiency and guarantee surge-free compressor. Experience with this control scheme will be illustrated for a newly developed 350 ton two-stage centrifugal compressor where the variable geometry hardware is replaced with a controlled internal flow recirculation...|$|R

40|$|For a {{magnetic}} <b>bearing</b> to <b>keep</b> on {{the clearance between}} the two magnetic poles it is necessary a controller. Though the control strategy was the output feedback control in the conventional way, in recent, for the high performance the state feedback control had realized by a digital controller of CPU. On the other hand, the magnetic force characteristic has strongly nonlinearity {{so that it is}} likely to be disappointed of the expected response with a linear controller. Thus the designers will have to do trial and error to find out common grounds. A sliding mode control strategy, one of the method of the nonlinear control, was applied to the magnetic bearing system by Nonami and others. They had showed that the sliding mode control was very robust for parameter change according to the simulation results. In this paper, the state feedback control could be realized by using a minimal order observer. And the robustness for parameter change is discussed experimentally by the use of the sliding mode control...|$|R

For instance, there are several investigations into mesoscale gas turbine generator systems and turbocompressors for fuel cells. In all ultra-high-speed machinery the bearing is a key technology. Therefore, this paper focuses {{on the design of}} a 500, 000 rpm active magnetic bearing suitable for use in a 1 kW PM machine to complete an ultra-high-speed electrical drive system. The design procedure selects the suitable magnetic <b>bearing</b> type to <b>keep</b> the system compact and small. The electromagnetic characteristics are determined, the results for the rotor dynamic analysis are presented and the air friction losses caused by the high frequency operation are evaluated. The final design is a combined radial-axial magnetic bearing with a volume of 50 cm 3. I...|$|R
40|$|As wind {{turbines}} get larger, nacelle structure that is carried by yaw bearings becomes heavier. In order to bear these increasing loads, yaw bearing {{needs to have}} more than one row of rolling elements which cause increase in weight and consequently the cost of the yaw bearing in classical design [1]. As the industry trends demand larger and larger {{wind turbines}}, the slew <b>bearing</b> costs <b>keep</b> increasing. In addition to cost, slew bearings suffer other reliability problems in very large turbines. As the turbine size keeps increasing both overall nacelle weight and wind loads acting on the yaw system (radial, axial and moment loads) get very large. During operation these heavy loads act on a single/local point on the bearing for extended periods during which heavy loads oscillate with varying wind speeds/loads. Large cyclic loads acting on a specific point on bearing race cause indentation marks which is also called Brinelling failure. As turbine capacities keep growing well beyond 10 MW with offshore units, the need for a robust low cost alternative grows. Hydrostatic bearings are well known systems that are used in large and heavy load machinery. This thesis aims to investigate applicability and feasibility of alternative hydrostatic yaw bearing design for a sample horizontal axis wind turbine. Motivation of the thesis is to develop a hydrostatic bearing design for yaw system for a 500 KW wind turbine, and demonstrate advantages and disadvantages of the hydrostatic bearing yaw system in comparison to classical rolling element bearings by evaluating load capacity, rigidity, stiffness, cost and life...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{spite of}} {{continuous}} improvements in device design and applications, the profound use of heart pump {{has been limited}} because of its high price. The available clinically applied heart pump costs mostly about 100 thousands US Dollars. The author has since long tried to develop a heart pump costing only 1000 Dollars for recovery or bridge to heart transplantation therapies. The device is a radially driven centrifugal pump with a brush-less DC motor and a streamlined impeller. Its bearing is rolling bearing using 4 to 6 needles, manufactured by special wear-proof polythene with super-high-molecular weight, thus the service life achieves more than 10 years. To avoid thrombus formation, a special purge system is introduced to the bearing, allowing the saline with heparin to be infused through the bearing into the pump. The <b>bearing,</b> therefore, <b>keeps</b> working in the saline, and absolutely no thrombus will be formed along the bearing. Animal experiments demonstrated that a 30 mL fluid infusion per hour is enough to prevent thrombus formation. With these improvements, the impeller pump has continuously run for 14 months in the laboratory, and no bearing wear can be measured. The device, weighing 150 g, is fully implantable, consumes approximately 9. 6 W, delivers a 9 Lmin- 1 blood flow against a 120 mmHg mean pressure, and reaches a highest total efficiency of 24. 7 % for the motor (including the controller) and the pump.

The company works with developing, manufacturing and marketing equipment for handling of lubricants for light and heavier industry. The work thesis {{it is based on}} a inquiry Assalub got from MacGregor which is a company within cargo solution, from port to offshore system. For unloading grain and other material from the ship cargo it is used combined inlet feeder and screw conveyor, there the inlet feeder is drilling down through the cargo and feed the screw conveyer with material to further destination. At the bottom of the screw conveyer and the inlet feeder there is a <b>bearing</b> that <b>keep</b> the parts together. However the lubrication of the bearing must be made manually. Until now the bearing was lubricated manually through a grease nipple {{from the bottom of the}} drill once a day.   The purpose of the thesis was the construction of a lubricating system namely a pump with a grease container which should be placed inside the space of the screw conveyer, so the bearing will be continually lubricated and able to work several days without any stoppage. After receiving drawings and operating data for the screw conveyer, the details for the construction was designed in CAD system Solid Edge. The solid mechanics calculations on the weakest point on the construction was made by hand and afterwards the drawings for respectively details was made. The construction was completed, but because of the time limit for this work thesis, the manufacturing, mounting and testing were not included in these weeks. The grease containers capacity is approximately seventy-two hours, although desirable should be up to seven days. According to the solid mechanics calculations, the construction should have no problem to resist the stresses it would be exposed to. Since this is a prototype there is probably some adjustments and improvements to do, but the estimating is that the system should work properly as it is now...|$|R
40|$|Two {{large-scale}} column {{experiments have}} been performed to test the hydrodynamic behaviour of unsaturated, compacted granite sawdust—a material produced during the dressing of dimension stone in Pontevedra (Spain). One of the columns was equipped with psychrometers and capacitance probes while, in the other, a radial array of 80 electrodes made possible a time-dependent 3 D electrical resistivity survey. All these devices allowed investigating and modelling the progressive saturation of the material. The study includes a straightforward methodology developed to calibrate the resistivity signals based on standard Proctor-compacted specimens. The progressive saturation of the granite sawdust reveals different stages: initially, an uneven advance of the saturation front (fingering) occurs; later on, this feature vanishes and {{is replaced by a}} more regular advance of the saturation front. Numerical analysis of the results shows that the yield capacity of the granite sawdust is ~ 0. 39 m 3 m? 3 and a saturated hydraulic conductivity ~ 2 × 10 ? 6 m s? 1. The latter, which corresponds to the specific standard Proctor compaction, is not sufficient to support the use of granite sawdust for compacted-single-layer capping structures. Nonetheless, increased compaction efforts or improved design criteria (multilayer systems or capillary barriers) can <b>keep</b> <b>bearing</b> when considering granite sawdust for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Six Sigma is an {{initiative}} launched by Motorola in 1987, focusing on reducing variation and continuously improving processes (Barney, 2002). This thesis {{was carried out}} at the Cage Factory in Gothenburg, a smaller unit within SKF Sverige AB with 124 employees. The factory manufactures the cage component in the <b>bearing,</b> which will <b>keep</b> the rollers {{in place in the}} complete bearing. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate and make comparisons between Six Sigma and the existing way of working with improvements and the organization in the Cage Factory and to give recommendations on what actions are needed to efficiently implement Six Sigma. To aid in the fulfillment of the purpose a practical DMAIC (Define- Measure- Analyze-Improve-Control) project was conducted. The project aims to reduce customer complaints and downtime caused by the turning activity in one of the production channels at the Cage Factory. Furthermore, several interviews with strategically selected individuals were conducted. The authors argue that Six Sigma could be implemented and integrated with the existing improvement approach, Total Process Management, TPMG. Six Sigma can be used to attack the most complex problems, while TPMG handles the many day-to-day issues. At the moment the implementation strategy "Strategically selected individuals and projects" is the most applicable at the Cage Factory. The authors argue that Six Sigma will provide a structure (DMAIC) and training in tools, thereby ensuring that the tools are used at the right time and in the right way at the Cage Factory. In the future, {{there has to be a}} strategy for generating possible Six Sigma projects at the Cage Factory. Also, it is important that a way for steering different problems to different problem solving activities is developed. However, some issues need to be considered if Six Sigma should work efficiently at the Cage Factory. A training venture is needed to enable the introduction of different roles in the organization. Also, all training should be connected to practical experience. It is important that the Cage Factory receives resource support from SKF Sverige and/or the SKF Group. Further, a reliable measurement system must be implemented. The authors believe that improved scrap reporting and improved use of SPC are important actions that need to be taken.

40|$|For {{the past}} few years, the Advanced Electrical Systems Branch here at NASA Glenn has been {{pursuing}} {{research in the area}} of flywheels. The purpose of these pursuits has been t o explore the potential for flywheels to replace current battery-powered systems in space. So far it has been learned that flywheels offer large momentum storage capacity, comparatively small volume, high durability, and near- complete discharge capabilities, all of which are advancements over the existing nickel hydrogen and nickel cadmium batteries. Another significant advantage of flywheels is the potential they offer for combining the function of attitude control with energy storage. During the summer of 2004, I worked with Dr. Barbara Kenny in the Advanced Electrical Systems Branch, supporting the work she is doing by analyzing and testing some new components for the new Generation- 2 flywheel. To monitor the speed and angular position of the flywheel rotor, a once-around (OAR) signal along with a sensorless algorithm is used. The OAR signal is used for the magnetic <b>bearings</b> that <b>keep</b> the flywheel suspended for frictionless operation. The sensorless algorithm is used for the flywheel motor/generator control. The OAR is generated from position sensors that monitor a circular plate. The plate has a cut down the middle such that one half of the circle is on a slightly lower level than the other. Every half-turn, or 180, the sensors detect the "cut" on the plate, and trigger the OAR, telling the computer that the rotor has made half a revolution. This, however, doesn't provide needed detailed information about the angular position of the rotor, since it only provides a signal alert every half- revolution. This is enough information for the magnetic bearing control but is insufficient for the motor/generator control. A new resolver was designed such that it would give continuous angle information rather than the 180 degree information of the OAR. The new resolver has two separate observable pieces: a flat middle section to monitor vertical motion, and an angled section around the circumference, which, when observed from above, produces a sine-wave displacement through the entire 360 " revolution. My first job when I arrived this summer was to calibrate the sensors that would be mounted on the inside of the flywheel casing to monitor the position (angular and vertical) of the shaft. After calibration, I used the sensors to evaluate voltage outputs created by position differences between two pairs of sensors on the angled portion of the resolver for eight different angular positions, moving the resolver vertically and laterally through its entire potential range of motion. The results of these tests will be used to determine the rotor angular (and axial) position from the sensor readings once the new flywheel unit is assembled. The sensorless algorighm mentioned above consists of two operations: the signal injection method and the back electro-motive force (EMF). The signal injection is meant to work at low speeds, while the back EMF algorithm is meant to work at higher speeds. Both work together to determine the correct estimate of rotor position and speed based on the measured motor/generator current. It was determined that we wanted to know exactly how accurate our estimation methods were, and so a resolver (a commercially available mechanical sensor mounted to the motor/generator shaft to measure rotor position and speed) and a "Resolver to Digital" (R 2 D) circuit board was purchased to make the comparison to the existing estimation. My work related to the R 2 D board has included the following: creating two connector cables (one to power the circuit and one to get readable output off the board), writing Simulink code to process the board's output, and building a dSpace panel to control and monitor the circuit. The next step in the process will be to perform tests to compare the estimated rotor position and speed from the sensorless algorithm to the actual rotor and speed from the resolver signal...|$|R
