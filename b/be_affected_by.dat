40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to understand the impact of  monetary variables namely inflation, interest rate, exchange rate and money supply on stock prices in five ASEAN countries namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philipinnes and Singapore. These countries has different characteristic than stock market in other countries because their stock market has experienced two big crises. Monetary policy of their government has serious impact on how these countries managed their financial markets.   It was found that there <b>were</b> different variables <b>affecting</b> stock price in these countries. In Indonesia, stock prices <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> stock prices in the past. In Malaysia, stock prices <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> exchange rate.

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} research, {{the effects}} of common types of noise on verbal and spatial information processing are still relatively unknown. Three experiments, using convenience sampling were conducted to investigate the effect of auditory interference on the cognitive performance of 24 adult men and women during the Stroop test, perception of object recognition and spatial location tasks, {{and the perception of}} object size, shape, and spatial location tasks. The data were analyzed using univariate analysis of variance and 1 -way multivariate analysis of variance. The Experiment 1 findings indicated reaction time performance for gender and age group <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between experimental conditions, and recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> only <b>by</b> experimental condition. The Experiment 2 a results showed reaction time performance for recognizing object features <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups, and recognition accuracy by experimental condition. The Experiment 2 b results demonstrated reaction time performance for detecting the spatial location of objects <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups. In addition, reaction time <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the type of interference and spatial location. Further, recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> interference condition and spatial location. The Experiment 3 findings suggested reaction time performance for assessing part-whole relationships <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups. Further, recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> interference condition between experimental groups. This study may create social change <b>by</b> <b>affecting</b> the design of learning and workplace environments, the neurological correlates of auditory and visual stimuli, and the pathologies of adults such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder...|$|R

The Ohio Department of Transportation capped funding for maintaining the Fort Steuben Bridge in 1998 at around $200,000 (US$ with inflation) per year. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 due to the weakening of the structure over time.

5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments are most likely to <b>be</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E
