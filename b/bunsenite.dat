The nickel reportedly occurs as different silicates, like kerolite or pimelite (not NiO mineral, <b>bunsenite,</b> as was reported before). Chrysoprase results from the deep weathering or lateritization of nickeliferous serpentinites or other ultramafic ophiolite rocks. In the Australian deposits, chrysoprase occurs as veins and nodules with brown goethite and other iron oxides in the magnesite-rich saprolite below an iron and silica cap.|$|E
40|$|A platinum-lined, flowing {{autoclave}} {{facility was}} used to investigate the solubility behavior of nickel(II) oxide (NiO) in deoxygenated ammonium and sodium hydroxide solutions between 21 and 315 C. Solubilities were found to vary between 0. 4 and 400 nanomolal (nm). The measured nickel ion solubilities were interpreted via a Ni(II) ion hydroxo- and amino-complexing model and thermodynamic functions for these equilibria were obtained from a least-squares analysis of the data. Two solid phase transformations were observed: at temperatures below 149 C, the activity of Ni(II) ions in aqueous solution was controlled by a hydrous Ni(II) oxide (theophrastite) solid phase rather than anhydrous NiO (bunsenite); above 247 C, Ni(II) activities were controlled by cubic rather than rhombohedral <b>bunsenite...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{chemistry}} of opaque spinel, delafossite (Cu 20 9 Fe 203), cuprite (Cu 20), cassiterite, nickel-olivine (Ni 2 SiO 4), and <b>bunsenite</b> (NiO) from some copper con-verter slags {{has been investigated}} by electron microprobe analysis. The spinel has a complex composition contain-ing up to 33. 89 ~ NiO and 47. 69 ~ SnO 2, ranging from essentially Ni 2 SnO 4 to (Ni,Fe 2 +) Fe 23 +O 4. The asso-dated elafossite contains up to 19. 18 ~ NiO and 38. 15 SnO 2. The chemical variation of the mineral phases is evaluated, {{and it appears that}} Ni 2 § enters the spinel and delafossite to charge-balance the octahedrally co-ordinated Sn 4 +. THIS paper describes the mineralogy of some slowly cooled copper converter slags, which had been cast into approximately hemispherical l dles 1 m in diameter and allowed to air-cool. From the large number of samples collected, three main mineral assemblages have been recognized: 1. nickel-olivine (Ni 2 SiO 4) +spinel+delafossite (Cu 20 - Fe 203) + cuprite (Cu 20) + cassiterite + <b>bunsenite</b> (NiO) 2. cassiterite + spinel + delafossite + cuprite 3. spinel + delafossite + cuprite. All samples contain yellow to orange-yellow coloured glass, which represents rapidly cooled residual liquid, and shows no evidence of devitrifi-cation.

The presence of the carcinogenic and easily reducible NiO phase (<b>bunsenite)</b> is detected by XRD, DR-vis and DR-NIR with a sensitivity limit well lower than 1000  ppm, which is the lower limit by law to classify a NiO-containing waste, such as spent catalysts, as dangerous. This species is also observed by XPS and FE-SEM with a similar sensitivity limit. Hardly reducible surface dispersed Ni 2 + species are also observed by DR-vis with a sensitivity limit lower than 1000  ppm. A surface spinel-like phase, with a composition NixAl 2 O 3 +x, with x ≤  0. 25 is formed at higher loadings, and is distinguished from the highly dispersed Ni 2 + species using IR and XRD. This defective surface spinel like species can be distinguished from stoichiometric bulk NiAl 2 O 4 by applying DR-NIR spectroscopy.

40|$|Novel {{nickel oxide}} {{coatings}} (100 - 600 nm in thickness) with low surface roughness (< 20 nm) and haze levels down to 6 % were deposited at a temperature not higher than 150 degrees C on FTO glass and conducting plastic films. The coatings were deposited on the substrates from water dispersions made of Ni 1 -xO pigment synthesized via the peroxo route by reaction of a H 2 O 2 /urea mixture with Ni-acetate precursor. The <b>bunsenite</b> Ni 1 -xO pigment was obtained after thermal treatment of xerogels at 400 degrees C for 24 h. Processing common for paint manufacturing {{was applied for}} the preparation of water dispersions of the Ni 1 -xO pigment, i. e., intensive milling of the pigment with dispersant. Dispersant (NiOxHy) was prepared by colloidal precipitation technique from Ni-sulfate precipitated with sodium hypochlorite. The materials (Ni 1 -xO pigment, NiOxHy precipitate, coatings) were investigated using various analytical techniques (TG, DSC, SEM, TEM. IR and optical spectroscopy), while the electrochromic properties were determined by means of in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements, applying standard electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, chronocoulometry). The results revealed a convenient, simple, and robust technique for making "electrochromic paint" coatings from pre-prepared Ni 1 -xO pigment.

40|$|In this study, {{nickel oxide}} was {{prepared}} through the calcination of extrusion dripped chitosan/nickel nitrate beads. The morphology and structural {{properties of the}} products were studied using various characterization techniques. Uniformly distributed nickel oxide was formed as observed from the studies of surface morphology where the processing parameters play a huge role on the resulting morphology. TEM results have shown that nickel oxide with crystallite sizes of 10 – 30 nm was obtained. The Fourier-transform infrared spectra studies show an intense peak at 525 cm− 1, which is attributed to the vibration of Ni–O bond. Furthermore, the XRD results show NiO diffraction peaks correspond to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) which indicates that a <b>bunsenite</b> structure with a face-centered cubic phase was produced in this study. The usage of 500 °C as the lower limit {{in this study is}} justified due to the complete removal of the templating material as seen in the thermalgravimetric analysis studies. Furthermore, it was obtained that the largest surface area of nickel oxide synthesized using this technique is 48. 024 m 2 /g with pore sizes of 19. 843 nm. The usage of chitosan as a green template for the synthesis of nanoparticles has shown promising results which allows a more economical and sustainable approach for the fabrication of nanomaterials...|$|E
40|$|Compact {{nickel oxide}} (NiO) thin films were {{prepared}} on various substrates via a simple spray pyrolysis technique. Morphological and structural characterization indicates that these NiO films are very uniform in thickness (100 nm) and possess the <b>bunsenite</b> crystal structure. Optical measurements {{show that the}} NiO films are highly transparent with a band gap of 3. 706 0. 05 eV. Mott-Schottky plots obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that the as-deposited NiO on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass behaves as a p-type semiconductor. The flat band potential of NiO {{was estimated to be}} 0. 36 V (vs. NHE) in 0. 10 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate/acetonitrile electrolytes. Cyclic voltammetric measurements of the NiO films on FTO in various redox electrolytes show that electrochemical reactions proceed in the accumulation region but are com-pletely inhibited in the depletion region, indicating the NiO films effectively block the FTO substrate. Using these NiO blocking layers, a CdS-sensitized mesoscopic NiO photocathode operating in a polysulfide electrolyte is unambiguously demonstrated for the first time. It is anticipated that NiO thin films synthesized by spray pyrolysis could find important applications as stable and transparent electron barrier layers for various optoelectronic devices.

40|$|Glycerol dry {{reforming}} {{was performed}} in a packed-bed reactor containing 20 wt. % nickel catalyst employing CO 2 -to-C 3 H 8 O 3 feed ratios of 0. 6 ⩽ CGR ⩽ 5. 0 and reaction temperatures between 923 and 1023 K for syngas (H 2 and CO) production studies. Liquid N 2 physisorption revealed a significant 32 -fold increase in the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area upon the incorporation of nickel metal onto the cement clinker support, which was also corroborated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). In addition, NH 3 - and CO 2 -temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analyses exhibited {{the presence of a}} strong pair of acid (1061. 4 μmol gcat− 1) and basic (1. 53 × 104 μmol gcat− 1) sites on the catalyst. A <b>bunsenite</b> (NiO) species with a crystallite size of 15 – 18 nm and calcium silicate were successfully identified from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. Subsequently, the results appraised from the reaction studies confirmed the absence of a direct interaction between CO 2 and the glycerol compound during the glycerol dry reforming and that the H 2 was primarily produced from the glycerol decomposition. This finding could be ascribed to the chemisorption of both compounds at different active sites, which resulted in glycerol decomposition as the primary reaction pathway. The optimum condition for H 2 production via glycerol dry reforming was at a carbon dioxide-to-glycerol ratio (CGR) of unity (at constant Pgly = 14 kPa) and 973 K. Moreover, the glycerol conversion ranged from 70 % to 80 % at a CGR of 1 – 1. 67. Glycerol dry reforming was discovered to be more feasible for Fischer Tropsch synthesis, as the H 2 :CO product ratios were < 2. 0.

40|$|International audienceElectrochromic {{nickel oxide}} (Ni 1 −xO) pigment powder {{which was made}} from nickel acetate {{reacting}} with H 2 O 2 /urea solution followed by heat treatment of xerogels at 400 °C (24 h) was milled with zirconia beads in pure water or water with added nickel oxyhydroxy precipitate acting simultaneously as the dispersant and the coating binder. The corresponding pigment particle suspensions were spin coated on FTO glass and flexible ITO-PET foils, respectively, and cured at 150 °C. The optical properties of the deposited pigment coatings on FTO glass substrates were determined with an UV VIS spectrometer, providing total direct transmittance (TT), total diffuse transmittance (DT) and haze (in %). Haze increased with the coating thickness but did not exceed 4 %. SEM micrographs of the deposited pigment coatings revealed that they consisted of agglomerated Ni 1 −xO pigment with voids. Potential cycling of Ni 1 −xO pigment coatings and Ni 1 −xO thin films was performed in 1 M LiClO 4 /PC and 0. 1 M TBA+ triflate/PC electrolytes, revealing that the pigment coatings exhibited electrochemical and electrochromic activity also in lithium free (aprotic) electrolyte, while variations of the oxidation and reduction reaction peaks at various scan rates confirmed the presence of surface electrochemical reactions. The near-grazing incidence angle reflection-absorption spectroscopic technique (IR RA) was employed for identifying surface and inner-grain Ni-O stretching modes, the former being responsible for observed electrochemical properties, which was also demonstrated from the ex situ IR RA measurements performed for coatings charged/discharged in 1 M LiClO 4 /PC and 0. 1 M TBA+ triflate/PC electrolytes. The results disclosed in {{this study suggest that}} the electrochromic effect was not in direct correlation with the de-insertion/insertion of small ions into the NiO (<b>bunsenite)</b> grains but rather the pigment coatings behave similarly to nickel oxide electrochemical capacitors. The electrochromic response of a flexible EC devices made either of PEDOT (self-standing foil) or WO 3 and Ni 1 −xO pigment coatings glued with PMMA based electrolytes without and with lithium salt were recorded for the demonstration of the possible practical application of wet deposited Ni 1 −xO pigment coatings made as "electrochromic" paints...|$|E
