Some people believe that <b>biocomputers</b> have great potential, but this {{has yet to be}} demonstrated.|$|R

5000|$|The term human <b>biocomputer,</b> {{coined by}} John C. Lilly, {{refers to the}} [...] "hardware" [...] of the human anatomy. This would include the brain, {{internal}} organs, and other human organ systems such as cardiovascular, digestive, endocrine, immune, integumentary, lymphatic, muscular, nervous, reproductive, respiratory, skeletal, and urinary systems. The <b>biocomputer</b> has stored program properties, and self-metaprogramming properties, with limits determinable and to be determined.|$|E
50|$|The {{brain is}} defined as the visible, palpable living set of {{structures}} {{to be included in the}} human <b>biocomputer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Biocomputers use biologically derived {{materials}} to perform computational functions. A <b>biocomputer</b> {{consists of a}} pathway or series of metabolic pathways involving biological materials that are engineered to behave in a certain manner based upon the conditions (input) of the system. The resulting pathway of reactions that takes place constitutes an output, {{which is based on}} the engineering design of the <b>biocomputer</b> and can be interpreted as a form of computational analysis. Three distinguishable types of biocomputers include biochemical computers, biomechanical computers, and bioelectronic computers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Biocomputers</b> {{can also}} be {{designed}} with cells as their basic components. Chemically induced dimerization systems {{can be used to}} make logic gates from individual cells. These logic gates are activated by chemical agents that induce interactions between previously non-interacting proteins and trigger some observable change in the cell.|$|R
50|$|<b>Biocomputers</b> {{can also}} be {{constructed}} to perform electronic computing. Again, like both biomechanical and biochemical computers, computations are performed by interpreting a specific output that is based upon an initial set of conditions that serve as input. In bioelectronic computers, the measured output {{is the nature of}} the electrical conductivity that is observed in the bioelectronic computer. This output comprises specifically designed biomolecules that conduct electricity in highly specific manners based upon the initial conditions that serve as the input of the bioelectronic system.|$|R
50|$|Haploys S.A.S was a {{start-up}} company created in August 2005, in the Biopôle Clermont-Limagne, close to Clermont-Ferrand, France, by private entrepreneurs and public grants. Its {{aim was to}} provide reusable DNA “sample chips“ for cost effective SNP genotyping and gene expression profiling of large sets of samples. The company also filed a patent for ICLEDA, coining Isothermal Constrained Loop Extension DNA Amplification, with an aim to develop <b>Biocomputers.</b> In the incapacity of raising funds for its projects during the 2008 financial crisis, the company closed operations by mid-2009.|$|R

50|$|The {{scientist}} and philosopher John C. Lilly discussed his experiments with psychedelics and altered {{states of consciousness}} in The Center of the Cyclone: An Autobiography of Inner Space and Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human <b>Biocomputer.</b> Other psychologists who studied and wrote on psychedelic use include Walter Pahnke, Ralph Metzner and Claudio Naranjo.|$|E
50|$|The {{levels of}} the human <b>biocomputer</b> are {{explained}} thus:Levels from one to two are the boundaries between external reality and the body. Certain energies and materials (heat, light, sound, food, and secretions) pass through this boundary in special places. Levels two to three are the boundaries of body and brain, in which special structures such as blood vessels, nerve fibers, and cerebrospinal fluid pass. Levels four through eleven are in the brain circuitry, and is the software inside the <b>biocomputer.</b> Levels after ten are termed unknown. This is to allow an openeness for future scientific research, and discoveries. This is also to illustrate the unwillingness to subscribe to any dogmatic belief, to encourage creative, courageous and imaginative investigation, to emphasize the necessity for unknown factors on all levels, and {{to point out the}} heuristic nature of this schema.|$|E
50|$|Recently, CID {{has also}} been {{used to create a}} basic {{component}} of <b>biocomputers,</b> logic gates, from genetically manipulated cells. In this application, two independent CID systems, one based on plant proteins and one based on bacterial proteins are expressed in the same cell. Each set of proteins can be induced to dimerize by the addition of a separate chemical. By creating fusion proteins with the dimerizing proteins, membrane bound proteins and proteins that activate cell ruffling an AND gate and OR gate can be created that take chemical dimerizing agents as inputs and returns a ruffled or unruffled state as output.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of <b>biocomputers</b> {{has been made}} possible by the expanding new science of nanobiotechnology. The term nanobiotechnology can be defined in multiple ways; in a more general sense, nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that uses both nano-scale materials (i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 nanometers) and biologically based materials. A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer biomolecular systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a computer.|$|R
50|$|Cooke's {{games were}} often innovative. For example, Tau Ceti (released 1985) {{featured}} {{a form of}} solid 3D graphics but was also set on a planet with day and night cycles with dynamically drawn shadows. Micronaut One (released 1987) was set inside futuristic <b>biocomputers</b> with the player controlling a microscopic craft attempting to clear the tunnels of an insect-like life form called Scrim. This game also used fast-moving 3D graphics as well as featuring an enemy that went through a realistic (if speeded-up) life-cycle, beginning each level as eggs and progressing to larvae and eventually adult Scrim which would then lay more eggs. Even Cooke's more straightforward games, like the 1988 shoot 'em up Earthlight, featured their own complexities and technical gimmicks.|$|R

50|$|Xevious {{tells the}} story of the fight between {{humankind}} and the <b>biocomputer</b> GAMP, which controls the alien forces of planet Xevious. It turns out that the Xevious inhabitants are originally from Earth, and GAMP (General Artificial Matrix Producer) is the product of an ancient civilization that prospered on earth a hundred thousand years ago. During this golden age, the Gamps were human clones used in heavy labor, until they rebelled against their own creators. In order to survive the upcoming Ice Age, they planned to leave earth and migrate in search of a new homeland. They finally selected seven planets that were likely suitable to human life.|$|E
40|$|We present {{concepts}} for self-assembly of diffractive optics {{with potential}} uses in biosensors and <b>biocomputers.</b> The simplest such optics, diffraction gratings, can potentially {{be made from}} chemically-stabilized microtubules migrating on nanopatterned tracks of the motor protein kinesin. We discuss the fabrication challenges involved in patterning sub-micron-scale structures with proteins that must be maintained in aqueous buffers to preserve their activity. A novel strategy is presented that employs dry contact printing onto glass-supported amino-silane monolayers of heterobifunctional crosslinkers, followed by solid-state reactions of these cross-linkers, to graft patterns of reactive groups onto the surface. Successive solution-phase addition of cysteine-mutant proteins and amine-reactive polyethylene glycol allows assembly of features onto the printed patterns. We present data from initial experiments showing successful micro- and nanopatterning of lines of single-cysteine mutants of kinesin interleaved with lines of polyethylene, indicating that this strategy can be employed to arrays of features with resolutions suitable for gratings...|$|R
40|$|Two new {{molecular}} algorithms {{are presented}} {{that are designed}} {{for the improvement of}} efficiency and reliability of DNA computing. The first algorithm introduces an evolutionary cycle to guide chemical reactions of DNA molecules. The second molecular algorithm extends the first one by adding another evolutionary loop for optimizing encodings of the problem instance. Just as genetic programming is a method for programming conventional computers by means of natural evolution, our approach, which might be called molecular programming, provides a method for programming <b>biocomputers</b> by means of artificial evolution. Simulations have been performed with the Hamiltonian path problem to verify the positive effect of the presented molecular algorithms on the reliability and efficiency of DNA computing. 1 Introduction Due to advances in molecular biology it is nowadays possible to create a soup of roughly 10 18 DNA strands that fits in a test tube.

40|$|Synthetic biology {{has shown}} that the {{metabolic}} behavior of mammalian cells can be altered by genetic devices such as epigenetic and hysteretic switches, timers and oscillators, <b>biocomputers,</b> hormone systems and heterologous metabolic shunts. To explore the potential of such devices for therapeutic strategies, we designed a synthetic mammalian circuit to maintain uric acid homeostasis in the bloodstream, disturbance of which is associated with tumor lysis syndrome and gout. This synthetic device consists of a modified Deinococcus radiodurans-derived protein that senses uric acids levels and triggers dose-dependent derepression of a secretion-engineered Aspergillus flavus urate oxidase that eliminates uric acid. In urate oxidase-deficient mice, which develop acute hyperuricemia, the synthetic circuit decreased blood urate concentration to stable sub-pathologic levels in a dose-dependent manner and reduced uric acid crystal deposits in the kidney. Synthetic gene-network devices providing self-sufficient control of pathologic metabolites represent molecular prostheses, which may foster advances in future gene- and cell-based therapies...|$|R

50|$|All {{biological}} organisms {{have the}} ability to self-replicate and self-assemble into functional components. The economical benefit of biocomputers lies in this potential of all biologically derived systems to self-replicate and self-assemble given appropriate conditions. For instance, all of the necessary proteins for a certain biochemical pathway, which could be modified to serve as a <b>biocomputer,</b> could be synthesized many times over inside a biological cell from a single DNA molecule. This DNA molecule could then be replicated many times over. This characteristic of biological molecules could make their production highly efficient and relatively inexpensive. Whereas electronic computers require manual production, biocomputers could be produced in large quantities from cultures without any additional machinery needed to assemble them.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, biocomputers exist {{with various}} {{functional}} capabilities that include operations of [...] "binary [...] " [...] logic and mathematical calculations. [...] Tom Knight of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory first suggested a biochemical computing scheme in which protein concentrations {{are used as}} binary signals that ultimately serve to perform logical operations. At or above a certain concentration of a particular biochemical product in a <b>biocomputer</b> chemical pathway indicates a signal that is either a 1 or a 0. A concentration below this level indicates the other, remaining signal. Using this method as computational analysis, biochemical computers can perform logical operations in which the appropriate binary output will occur only under specific logical constraints on the initial conditions. In other words, the appropriate binary output serves as a logically derived conclusion from a set of initial conditions that serve as premises from which the logical conclusion can be made. In addition to these types of logical operations, biocomputers have {{also been shown to}} demonstrate other functional capabilities, such as mathematical computations. One such example was provided by W.L. Ditto, who in 1999 created a <b>biocomputer</b> composed of leech neurons at Georgia Tech which was capable of performing simple addition. These {{are just a few of}} the notable uses that biocomputers have already been engineered to perform, and the capabilities of biocomputers are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Because of the availability and potential economic efficiency associated with producing biomolecules and biocomputers—as noted above—the advancement of the technology of biocomputers is a popular, rapidly growing subject of research that is likely to see much progress in the future.|$|E
40|$|All human beings, {{all persons}} who reach {{adulthood}} {{in the world}} today are programmed <b>biocomputers.</b> None of us can escape our own nature as programmable entities. Literally, each of us may be our programs, nothing more, nothing less. Despite the great varieties of programs available, most of us have a limited set of programs. Some of these are built in. In the simpler forms of life the programs were mostly built in from genetic codes to fully formed adultly reproducing organisms. The patterns of function, of actionreaction were determined by necessities of survival, of adaptation to slow environmental changes and of passing on the code to descendants. Eventually the cerebral cortex appeared as an expanding new highlevel computer controlling the structurally lower levels of the nervous system, the lower builtin programs. For the first time learning and its faster adaptation to a rapidly changing environment began to appear. Further, as this new cortex expanded over several millions of years, a critical size cortex was reached. At this level of structure, a new capability emerged: learning to learn. ...|$|R
5000|$|Computing by transcriptor {{is still}} very slow; it can take a few hours between {{receiving}} an input signal and generating an output. Endy doubted that <b>biocomputers</b> would ever be as fast as traditional computers, but added {{that is not the}} goal of his research. [...] "We're building computers that will operate in a place where your cellphone isn't going to work", he said. [...] Medical devices with built-in biological computers could monitor, or even alter, cell behavior from inside a patient's body. [...] ExtremeTech writes: Moving forward, though, the potential for real biological computers is immense. We are essentially talking about functional computers that can sense their surroundings, and then manipulate their host cells into doing just about anything. Biological computers might be used as an early-warning system for disease, or simply as a diagnostic tool ... Biological computers could tell their host cells to stop producing insulin, to pump out more adrenaline, to reproduce some healthy cells to combat disease, or to stop reproducing if cancer is detected. Biological computers will probably obviate the use of many pharmaceutical drugs.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{computer}} on the designer are profound, and affect design methodology and habitation. The computer-aided designer experiences within the electronic environment a freedom from certain important constraints of real-world modelling of physical reality. Electronic configurations are not bound by the constructional, material, or structural constraints operating in the physical world. This freedom is liberating, in that the imagination is given a powerful tool with which to develop external representations of ideal environments. But {{there is also the}} potential of destructive tendencies. Is the increasing sophistication of external tools of the imagination {{at the expense of the}} ability of the individual to master the internal imagination - are we externalizing at the price of inner vision? There is also the possibility of greater alienation from the physical world. We loose the tactile sensitivity, and the spatial and structural intuition with which we draw and make physical models. These are essential parts of the design of the physical environment. We are left on the horns of a dilemma. The rapid response and exciting images of the computergenerated video environment suggest we are entering an era when architecture itself becomes electronic. The physical built-form recedes in importance, and may even become redundant. But we must also ask: Are we entering a post-computer age? Will we realize the potential profundity of our innate human <b>biocomputers</b> - to the point where we renounce the hard technology of the material for the soft technology of consciousness...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Lilly was {{introduced}} to psychedelic drugs such as LSD and (later) ketamine and {{began a series of}} experiments in which he ingested a psychedelic drug either in an isolation tank or in the company of dolphins.

Following advice from Ram Dass, Lilly studied Patanjali's system of yoga (finding I. K. Taimni's Science of Yoga, a modernized interpretation of the Sanskrit text, most suited to his goals). He also paid special attention to Self-enquiry meditation advocated by Ramana Maharshi, and was reformulating the principles of this exercise with reference to his human <b>biocomputer</b> paradigm (described in Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer: Theory and Experiments and The Center of the Cyclone).|$|E
50|$|The {{behavior}} of biologically derived computational {{systems such as}} these relies on the particular molecules {{that make up the}} system, which are primarily proteins but may also include DNA molecules. Nanobiotechnology provides the means to synthesize the multiple chemical components necessary to create such a system. The chemical nature of a protein is dictated by its sequence of amino acids—the chemical building blocks of proteins. This sequence is in turn dictated by a specific sequence of DNA nucleotides—the building blocks of DNA molecules. Proteins are manufactured in biological systems through the translation of nucleotide sequences by biological molecules called ribosomes, which assemble individual amino acids into polypeptides that form functional proteins based on the nucleotide sequence that the ribosome interprets. What this ultimately means is that one can engineer the chemical components necessary to create a biological system capable of performing computations by engineering DNA nucleotide sequences to encode for the necessary protein components. Also. the synthetically designed DNA molecules themselves may function in a particular <b>biocomputer</b> system. Thus, implementing nanobiotechnology to design and produce synthetically designed proteins—as well as the design and synthesis of artificial DNA molecules—can allow the construction of functional biocomputers (e.g. Computational Genes).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} <b>BioComputer</b> Music, {{an experimental}} one-piano duet between pianist and plasmodial slime mould Physarum polycephalum. This piece harnesses a system {{we have been}} developing, which we call <b>BioComputer.</b> <b>BioComputer</b> consists of an analogue cir-cuit that encompasses components grown from the biological computing substrate Physarum polycephalum. Our system listens to the pianist and uses the memristive characteristics of Physarum polycephalum to pro-duce a list of notes to generate a musical response with, which it plays through electromagnets placed on the strings of the piano. Such electro-magnets set the strings into vibration, producing a distinctive timbre. Physarum polycephalum is an amorphous unicellular organism that has been discovered to exhibit memristive qualities.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{and discusses}} the benefits, threats, and vulnerabilities {{related to the}} digital revolution. It aims to motivate research and its funding regarding digital threats and vulnerabilities related, in particular, to anticipating unintended, undesirable rebound effects, tipping points, critically fast evolutionary change rates, trade-offs, etc. A brief analysis {{of the history of}} the mind and technology reveals slow technological development over tens of thousands of years (including the invention of a place-value digital number system). Then, a small series of groundbreaking ideas (e. g., binary logic, Shannon’s symbolic analysis of relay and switching circuits, architectures of computing) enabled the industry-driven invention of programmable computing machines. Ultimately, the mastery of electron and semiconductor physics allowed for economical and seemingly unlimited storage capacity that made digital tools available to all domains of society. Based on the historical analysis, a coupled human-environment systems perspective (that includes a hierarchy assumption ranging from the human cell to the human species) enables the identification of several potential challenges to society and science. First, digital nano-engineering promotes genetic modifications (i. e., directed evolution), and synthetic biology enables a new level of the appropriation of nature. The understanding of cell-based <b>biocomputers</b> may call for new forms of logic. These and other challenges require thorough sustainability research in order to anticipate major changes on all levels of human systems. Second, the human individual is exposed to new forms of vulnerability. In particular, the potential epigenetic effects resulting from the excessive use of digital information of historically unknown speed, density, and contents and the loss of (the Western common-law right to) privacy resulting from big data (whose ownership is often unknown) should become subjects of research. Third, digital technologies are responsible for rapid changes in all social and economic structures. The paper suggests that thorough, discipline-based interdisciplinary research is needed in order to develop basic knowledge for creating and managing resilient relationships between human systems and their digital environments...|$|R
