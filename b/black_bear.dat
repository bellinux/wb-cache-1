5|$|The American <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus americanus), {{among the}} largest animals along the Appalachian Trail, rarely confronts people. The <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> is the largest {{omnivore}} that may be encountered on the trail, and it inhabits all regions of the Appalachians. Bear sightings on the trail are uncommon, except in certain sections, especially Shenandoah National Park and portions of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts sections, where bear populations have increased steadily since 1980; confrontations are rarer still.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{follows the}} {{adventure}} of four bears, Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a <b>black</b> <b>bear),</b> Toklo (a brown bear) and Ujurak (a brown bear).|$|E
25|$|Although mostly herbivorous, the jaw {{structure}} of Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> {{is not as}} specialised for plant eating as that of pandas: Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> have much narrower zygomatic arches, and the weight ratio of the two pterygoid muscles is also much smaller in Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears.</b> The lateral slips of the temporal muscles are thicker and stronger in <b>black</b> <b>bears.</b>|$|R
5000|$|December 5: The <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> {{had their}} six-game unbeaten streak snapped when {{they lost to}} Vermont 4-3 in overtime. The <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> have scored power play goals in their last five games as Jennie Gallo is the <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> leader with five power play tallies.|$|R
50|$|In the 2011-12 Maine <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> women's {{ice hockey}} season they {{will attempt to}} win their first NCAA Women's Frozen Four title. Head coach Maria Lewis returns for her second season. Lewis led the <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> to the Hockey East Tournament in the {{previous}} season and helped the <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> double their win total from the previous season. The <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> return 14 letterwinners for the season (nine forwards, three defenders, two goaltenders). Dawn Sullivan {{will serve as the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> captain. In the past season, she registered eight goals and nine assists for 17 points.|$|R

5|$|An avid hunter, Booth {{posted a}} YouTube video in May 2012 of him baiting and killing an American <b>black</b> <b>bear.</b> Though the {{practice}} is legal in Alberta, it is banned in 18 American states, as well as British Columbia, the Vancouver Canucks' province. Booth's actions were widely criticized among the public causing him to remove the video within days.|$|E
25|$|Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> are diurnal, {{though they}} become nocturnal near human habitations. They may live in family groups {{consisting}} of two adults and two successive litters of young. They will walk in a procession of largest to smallest. They are good climbers of rocks and trees, and will climb to feed, rest, sun, elude enemies and hibernate. Some older bears may become too heavy to climb. Half of their life is spent in trees and {{they are one of}} the largest arboreal mammals. In the Ussuri territory, <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> can spend up to 15% of their time in trees. Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> break branches and twigs to place under themselves when feeding on trees, thus causing many trees in their home ranges to have nest-like structures on their tops. Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> will rest for short periods in nests on trees standing fifteen feet or higher. Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> do not hibernate over most of their range. They may hibernate in their colder, northern ranges, though some bears will simply move to lower elevations. Nearly all pregnant sows hibernate. <b>Black</b> <b>bears</b> prepare their dens for hibernation in mid-October, and will sleep from November until March. Their dens can either be dug out hollow trees (sixty feet above ground), caves or holes in the ground, hollow logs, or steep, mountainous and sunny slopes. They may also den in abandoned brown <b>bear</b> dens. Asiatic <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> tend to den at lower elevations and on less steep slopes than brown <b>bears.</b> Female <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> emerge from dens later than do males, and female <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> with cubs emerge later than barren females. Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> tend to be less mobile than brown bears. With sufficient food, Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> can remain in an area of roughly 1–2sqkm, and sometimes even as little as 0.5–1sqkm.|$|R
25|$|On average, adult Asian <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> are {{slightly}} smaller than American <b>black</b> <b>bears,</b> though large males can exceed {{the size of}} several other bear species.|$|R
50|$|The 2014-15 Maine <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> men's {{ice hockey}} team {{represented}} the University of Maine during the 2014-15 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The team was coached by Red Gendron, in his 2nd {{season with the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Bears.</b> The <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> played their home games at Alfond Arena on campus in Orono, Maine, competing in Hockey East.|$|R
5|$|In {{contemporary}} Argentina, where {{consumption of}} steak is very high, steak {{is a significant}} part of the national cuisine and the barbecue asado has the status of a national dish. In Austria, the national dish is Wiener Schnitzel, which is a type of steak made from veal. Advice on butchery and recipes for American <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> steak and chops is provided by US governments.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} plants are found {{throughout}} {{the middle and upper}} basin, including California poppy, white alder, Oregon ash, oak, poison oak, bigleaf maple, Indian rhubarb, buttonbush, willow, whiteleaf manzanita, and historically, sugar pine, before heavy logging in the late 19th century. Squirrels, raccoon, jackrabbits, bats, skunks, beavers, mule deer, coyote, bobcat and <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> are among the mammal species found in the middle and upper watershed.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park also {{provides}} habitats for eastern woodland mammals. <b>Black</b> <b>bear</b> and white-tailed deer inhabit the woods, as do Virginia opossum, raccoon, American mink, muskrat, North American river otter, fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
25|$|The Vietnamese Government issued Decision 276/QD, 276/1989, {{which prohibits}} the hunting and {{exporting}} of <b>black</b> <b>bears.</b> The Red Book of Vietnam lists Vietnamese <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> as endangered.|$|R
50|$|Article 2 {{calls for}} the {{protection}} of <b>black</b> <b>bears.</b> This Article makes it unlawful in North Carolina to buy, sell or enclose <b>black</b> <b>bears.</b> Zoos and wildlife reserves that are operated by governmental agencies, as well as educational institutions in which <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> are kept or exhibited for training or research in the natural sciences, are exempt from this statute.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Black</b> <b>bears</b> {{were once}} not {{considered}} true or [...] "deep" [...] hibernators, {{but because of}} discoveries about the metabolic changes that allow <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> to remain dormant for months without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating, most biologists have redefined mammalian hibernation as [...] "specialized, seasonal reduction in metabolism concurrent with scarce food and cold weather". <b>Black</b> <b>bears</b> are now considered highly efficient hibernators. The physiology of American <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> in the wild {{is closely related to}} that of bears in captivity. Understanding the physiology of bears in the wild is vital to the bear's success in captivity.|$|R
5|$|The Himalayan Zoological Park {{exhibits}} the fauna of the Himalayas {{in their}} natural habitats. The zoo features the Himalayan <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> red pandas, the barking deer, the snow leopard, the leopard cat, Tibetan wolf, masked palm civet and the spotted deer, amongst the others. Jawaharlal Nehru Botanical Gardens, near Rumtek, houses many species of orchid {{and as many as}} fifty different species of tree, including many oaks.|$|E
5|$|The adult bobcat has few predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The local fauna of the Three Sisters {{includes}} fish such as brook and rainbow trout, birds such as {{blue and}} ruffed grouse, and larger species like the Columbian black-tailed deer, mule deer, Roosevelt elk, and American <b>black</b> <b>bear.</b> In addition to predator bobcats, cougars, and coyotes, raccoons, martens, weasels, and American minks live throughout the Three Sisters area.|$|E
25|$|In the remoter {{areas of}} Japan, <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> can be serious crop predators: <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> feed on {{cultivated}} bamboo shoots in spring, on plums, watermelons and corn in the summer, and on persimmons, {{sweet potatoes and}} rice in the autumn. Japanese <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> are estimated to damage 3,000 bee hives annually. When feeding on large crops such as watermelons or pumpkins, <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> will ignore the flesh, and eat the seeds, thus adversely affecting future harvests. <b>Black</b> <b>bears</b> can girdle and kill trees by stripping their bark for the sap. This can cause serious economic problems in Asia's valuable timber forests. In the late 1970s, 400-1,200 hectares of land had been affected by bears bark stripping Japanese conifers. There is evidence that 70-year-old conifers (commanding the highest market values) {{may also have been}} bark stripped.|$|R

50|$|In the 2005-06 Maine <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> women's {{ice hockey}} season, the <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> had 17 wins, 9 losses and 6 ties. The team's Hockey East record was 9 wins, 8 losses, and 4 ties.|$|R
5|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} {{growing in the}} {{riparian}} zones along the Rogue River include willows, red alder, white alder, black cottonwood, and Oregon ash. A few of the common animal and bird species seen along the river are American <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> North American river otter, black-tailed deer, bald eagle, osprey, great blue heron, water ouzel, and Canada goose.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the lower 48 states. There are almost 60 species of mammals in the park, including the gray wolf, coyote, the threatened Canadian lynx, and grizzly bears. Other large mammals include the bison (often referred to as buffalo), <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> elk, moose, mule deer, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and cougar.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, bears {{have come}} under {{pressure}} through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable; even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the American <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> {{are at risk of}} extirpation in certain areas. In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.|$|E
50|$|In the 2007-08 Maine <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> women's {{ice hockey}} season, the <b>Black</b> <b>Bears</b> had 4 wins, 27 losses and 3 ties. The team’s Hockey East record was 3 wins, 15 losses, and 3 ties.|$|R
2500|$|Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh {{conducted}} an on field survey of bears in Bangladesh from 2008–2010 that included Asian <b>black</b> <b>Bears.</b> The survey {{was done in}} 87 different places mostly in north-central, north eastern and south eastern area of Bangladesh that had historical presence of bears.

50|$|Grizzly bears, {{featured}} on the state flag, were once common in the Transverse Ranges, but were driven to extinction in California in the late 19th century, {{with one of the}} last animals in the San Gabriels being shot in 1894 by Walter L. Richardson. <b>Black</b> <b>bears</b> did not naturally exist in the San Gabriel Mountains, but in 1933 eleven <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> from Yosemite Valley that had shown problematic behavior were moved to Southern California and released near Crystal Lake. All <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> in the San Gabriels are believed to be descended from this group. <b>Black</b> <b>bears</b> are relatively shy and are almost never known to harm humans.|$|R
5|$|Species {{lists for}} the park include about 50 mammals, 86 birds, 11 {{reptiles}} and amphibians, 8 bats, more than 200 arthropods, 8 snails and slugs, 75 butterflies, more than 55 moths, and 8 aquatic macroinvertebrates. Of these species, 160 are found inside the cave. Outside the cave, the black-tailed deer, Steller's jay, the common raven, and Townsend's chipmunk are among animals often seen in the park. Less commonly sighted are the <b>black</b> <b>bear,</b> cougar, northern flying squirrel, and Pacific giant salamander. Springs and other wet places support flatworms, frogs, and snails.|$|E
5|$|The cartoon {{character}} Yogi Bear {{has appeared in}} numerous comic books, animated television shows and films. The Care Bears began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film. Around the world, many children—and some adults—have teddy bears, stuffed toys {{in the form of}} bears, named after the American statesman Theodore Roosevelt when in 1902 he had refused to shoot an American <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> tied to a tree.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} over the span of six books, which are: The Quest Begins, Great Bear Lake, Smoke Mountain, The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky, and Spirits in the Stars.
