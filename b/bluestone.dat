5|$|Monds Roller Mills {{building}} is a four-level, three-story, <b>bluestone</b> building with an iron gabled roof built c1846 by John Kinder Archer. The mill, and its associated storage and transportation needs, was the main employer in Carrick for many years. It was the last mill in Tasmania to be powered by water.|$|E
5|$|Other {{buildings}} of note in Caversham include the suburb's churches. The Presbyterian church {{is located on}} Thorn Street, roughly halfway between the South Road retail area and Forbury Corner. It was built in 1883 following {{the destruction of the}} previous building by fire. The current building, built in Port Chalmers <b>bluestone</b> with Oamaru stone facings, was designed by T. B. Cameron.|$|E
50|$|The {{main source}} of the <b>bluestones</b> is now {{identified}} with the dolerite outcrops around Carn Goedog although work led by Olwen Williams-Thorpe of the Open University has shown that other <b>bluestones</b> came from outcrops up to 10 km away. Dolerite is composed of an intrusive volcanic rock of plagioclase feldspar that is harder than granite.|$|R
5000|$|Bringing Back the <b>Bluestones</b> is a stage play by Derek Webb about a {{pressure}} group from Pembrokeshire campaigning {{to have the}} Stonehenge <b>bluestones</b> returned to Wales. It followed the fortunes of Roy Brown as he sets up the group, Carreg Las (Welsh for [...] "Blue Stone"), and campaigns {{for the return of}} the stones to the Preseli Hills.|$|R

5|$|Lathrop stands five stories {{tall with}} an {{additional}} basement level. The dormitory, Elizabethan in style, is a brick building with elements of brownstone trim. The roof is a Vermont slate and from it rise five chimneys, each built with two wythes of brick and capped with <b>bluestone.</b> There are also multiple cupolas that are framed with wood, include painted louvered slats, and have topped with a coat of terne. The building also has parapets, unlike neighboring Strong.|$|E
5|$|The Bank of New Zealand Building, 205 Princes St (cnr. Princes and High Sts) (Category I). Designed in Venetian Renaissance styling, the 1882 BNZ {{building}} stands {{just two}} doors along from the National Bank building. The William Armson-designed building is notable for the richly carved exterior work by Louis Godfrey and moulded ceilings in its interior. The façade combines Doric, Ionic and Corinthian styles, and makes {{good use of}} Port Chalmers <b>bluestone</b> and Oamaru stone, a compact, cream-coloured limestone.|$|E

50|$|In April 2005 an {{excavation}} at {{the site}} clarified {{the extent of the}} enclosure but did not retrieve any cultural material. The same year, the then Archdruid of the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards, Dr Robyn Lewis, wrote to the Daily Telegraph proposing that the <b>Bluestones</b> be returned from Stonehenge to the Preseli Hills. This was also the subject of a stage play called Bringing Back the <b>Bluestones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carn Menyn is {{believed}} {{by some to}} have been the main source for the <b>bluestones</b> used at Stonehenge. Sir Andrew Ramsey first suggested it as a contender in the mid-nineteenth century. In the early 1920s HH Thomas showed through petrographic analysis that many of the <b>bluestones</b> had come from the Preseli Hills, and in 2005 work led by Timothy Darvill and Geoff Wainwright supported the idea that Carn Menyn was the primary quarry. This is disputed by others, and Williams-Thorpe and others from the Open University have suggested that the Stonehenge <b>bluestones</b> came from at least twenty different places, with Carn Goedog about one mile to the west as the most likely source for the spotted dolerites.|$|R
5|$|The Pond Eddy Bridge is a petit {{truss bridge}} {{spanning}} the Delaware River between the hamlet of Pond Eddy in Lumberland, New York and the settlement informally called Pond Eddy in Shohola Township, Pennsylvania. It is accessible from NY 97 in Lumberland on the New York side and two dead-end local roads, Flagstone Road (State Route 1011) and Rosa Road on the Pennsylvania side. The bridge {{was built in}} 1903 by the Oswego Bridge Company to replace an old suspension bridge that had washed away in a flood earlier in the year. It connected the <b>bluestone</b> quarries in Pennsylvania to New York.|$|E
5|$|The German graves {{were grouped}} {{according}} to military unit. Every grave in each grouping receiving a similar headstone, {{but not necessarily}} {{the same as that}} in other groupings. There were a number of organizations in Germany that were particularly opposed to mass-produced identical headstones and by consequence the cemetery contains a number of differently styled headstones. The German headstones were carved from locally quarried stone, principally <b>bluestone</b> and Belgian Petit Granit. German officers were offered larger headstones to illustrate their higher military rank. The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were paid and provided by the city or town where the regiment was based.|$|E
5|$|When Adelaide {{was first}} planned and mapped out by Col. William Light, Mount Osmond {{received}} the three allotments 1070, 1277 and 1278. While much of Adelaide was relatively quickly bought (but not necessarily settled) Mount Osmond {{did not enjoy}} any early buyers. The first reported activity in the area was after the mining rush of Glen Osmond due to the Wheal Watkins and Wheal Gawler mines. Lot 1277 yielded a mine in Slaughterhouse Gully but it was worked only briefly. Subsequent finds of <b>bluestone</b> proved fruitful and the mineral was extracted until 1900, when mining ended and {{the last of the}} mines were either filled in or cordoned off.|$|E

50|$|This phase saw further {{rearrangement}} of the <b>bluestones.</b> They {{were arranged}} in a circle between the two rings of sarsens and in an oval at {{the centre of the}} inner ring. Some archaeologists argue that some of these <b>bluestones</b> were from a second group brought from Wales. All the stones formed well-spaced uprights without any of the linking lintels inferred in Stonehenge 3 III. The Altar Stone may have been moved within the oval at this time and re-erected vertically. Although this would seem the most impressive phase of work, Stonehenge 3 IV was rather shabbily built compared to its immediate predecessors, as the newly re-installed <b>bluestones</b> were not well-founded and began to fall over. However, only minor changes were made after this phase.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Bluestonehenge" [...] {{is derived}} from the {{discovery}} of small stone chips in some of the stone settings. These <b>bluestones</b> are also found in Stonehenge and consist {{of a wide range of}} rock types originally from Pembrokeshire West Wales, some 150 mi away. Archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson suspects that any <b>bluestones</b> in the circle may have been removed around 2500 BC and incorporated into Stonehenge, which underwent major rebuilding work at about that time.|$|R
5|$|SR 253 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 11 (Main Street) south of downtown Harrisonburg and {{southwest of the}} campus of James Madison University. The highway heads southeast as a four-lane undivided highway that intersects <b>Bluestone</b> Drive, which heads north to the campus and Bridgeforth Stadium and Zane Showker Field, just before meeting I-81 at a diamond interchange. SR 253's next intersection is with Forest Hill Road, {{which leads to the}} James Madison University Convocation Center, the Edith J. Carrier Arboretum, {{and the rest of the}} portion of James Madison University east of I-81. The highway gains a center turn lane at Devon Lane and passes several university athletic fields at Neff Avenue. SR 253's center turn lane ends and the road expands to a four-lane divided highway at the boundary between the independent city of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County. The highway intersects SR 280 (Stone Spring Road) next to Rockingham Memorial Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Roller Mills {{building}} {{is not in}} Princes Street itself, but rather lies {{at the foot of}} Manor Place, close to its intersection with Princes Street. It stands {{at the edge of a}} small area of parkland called the Market Reserve, at the opposite edge of which is the city's main bus depot. This area was swampland when the first European settlers arrived in Dunedin, but was reclaimed and did host a regular market for a few years from the 1870s. The market was not well-supported, however, and eventually folded. The bus depot is located on the site of the city's 1902 Tram workshops. The Market Reserve also contains a children's playground and, at the edge closes to the Crown Roller Mills Building, a small monument dedicated to Otago workers who have lost their lives while at work. This simple <b>bluestone</b> memorial was erected in 2003 by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions on a site donated by the Dunedin City Council.|$|E

50|$|It sits {{on top of}} the Preseli {{ridge and}} overlooks the rocky outcrop of Carn Menyn, a site that has been {{suggested}} as a source for some of the <b>bluestones</b> used at Stonehenge. A 2011 study of a particular group of the Stonehenge <b>bluestones</b> made of a Rhyolite material identified a geological match with an outcrop at Rhosyfelin, 3 km north of Bedd Arthur. On the other hand, a 2015 archaeological studies at Rhosyfelin failed to identify any signs of quarrying, which appears to promote the possibility of the stones as glacial erratics carried east on an ice-flow, rather than a neolithic cultural link between the two places.|$|R
