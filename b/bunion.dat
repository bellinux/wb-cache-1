5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his <b>bunion,</b> and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E

25|$|Gel toe spacers {{of various}} {{shapes and sizes}} are {{inserted}} between toes; these serve to adjust toe spacing and alignment so as to alleviate pain at the <b>bunion</b> joint between the big toe and first toe.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause is}} unclear. One {{proposed}} {{idea is that}} <b>bunions</b> are primarily due to the long-term wearing of particularly tight-fitting shoes with pointed toes. Others believe the problem stems from genetic factors, exacerbated by shoe use. <b>Bunions</b> occur when long-term pressure {{is applied to the}} side of the big toe forcing it inwards, towards - and sometimes under or over - the other toes (angulation). As pressure is applied, the tissues surrounding the joint may become swollen and painful. In a survey of people from cultures which do not wear shoes, no cases of <b>bunions</b> were found, lending credence to the first hypothesis.|$|R

In March that year, she had a <b>bunion</b> removed which doctors believed was the root cause of her other injuries at that time. She did not run competitively for almost 10 months, but made herself available for inclusion in the 2009 British team for the World Championships in Athletics. She announced that the New York City Half Marathon would be a testing ground for her fitness before the competition.|$|E
500|$|The British liner RMS Lusitania briefly {{held the}} record for largest {{passenger}} ship upon its completion in 1906. [...] McCay displayed a fondness for it, and featured it in the episode for September 28, 1907, of his comic strip Dream of the Rarebit Fiend, {{and again in the}} episode for November 10, 1908, of A Pilgrim's Progress by Mister <b>Bunion,</b> where <b>Bunion</b> declares it [...] "the monster boat that has smashed the record".|$|E
500|$|While still {{turning out}} {{illustrations}} and editorial cartoons daily, McCay began three more continuing strips in 1905. [...] In January, he began The Story of Hungry Henrietta, {{in which the}} child protagonist visibly ages week by week, and eats compulsively {{in lieu of the}} love she craves from her parents. [...] A Pilgrim's Progress by Mister <b>Bunion</b> was another [...] "Silas" [...] strip for the Evening Telegram, which ran from June 1905 until December 1910. [...] Mr. <b>Bunion</b> spent each strip unsuccessfully scheming to rid himself of his suitcase, labeled [...] "Dull Care".|$|E

500|$|Leslie {{indicates}} {{she had a}} dream involving American actress Gina Gershon. For her mural, Donna {{proposes a}} recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper with Indiana natives {{in place of the}} apostles. Actor Greg Kinnear was chosen to replace Jesus, with the Apostles replaced by John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, David Letterman and a NASCAR race car, among others. Jerry presents for his mural a work of pointillism, a style of painting in which small distinct dots of color create the impression of a wider image. When proposing her somber mural, Leslie claims tragedy often succeeds in awards, and specifically cites the Academy Awards which honor the film industry. As an example, Leslie uses The English Patient, the 1996 Best Picture winner during the 69th Academy Awards. Upon first receiving his painting, Tom says, [...] "It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles", a reference to the multi-colored candies. Leslie, upon the idea of putting the best parts of each design into a new mural, says it is like having Michelangelo, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis do one painting. When Mark tries to get out of helping with the mural, he uses the excuse, [...] "I was gonna go to Arby's and watch Frontline", a reference to a fast food restaurant chain and a Public Broadcasting Service public affairs program. Ron names his <b>bunion</b> Paul, after the mythological lumberjack Paul Bunyan.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bunions</b> are {{prominent}} and often inflamed metatarsal heads and overlying bursae, {{usually associated with}} hallux valgus, causing pain and problems with walking and wearing normal shoes. Hallux valgus (where the great toe moves towards the second toe) is found in at least 2 % of children aged 9 to 10 years and almost half of adults, with greater prevalence in women.

2500|$|The ridges {{surrounding}} Greenbrier {{are among}} the highest in the Appalachian range. To the east is the Guyot massif, which rises to over 6,000 feet (1,829 m) for long stretches. To the west is the LeConte massif, which culminates in a 6,593-foot (2,009 m) summit. The ridge immediately to the south connecting the two massifs, known as [...] "the Sawteeth," [...] consists of a series of jagged, steep cliffs, the most well-known of which spans the northern face of Charlies <b>Bunion.</b> Greenbrier Pinnacle, a [...] ridge descending from the western flank of Old Black westward to the Middle Fork valley, nearly closes off Greenbrier Cove entirely. [...] Over a dozen streams flow north from the crest of the Pinnacle, each of them cutting narrow hollows with traces of fertile bottomland.|$|E

[...] "And introduce me to Miss <b>Bunion.</b> I'm told she's very clever too. She's rum to look at, certainly, but that don't matter. Dammy, I consider myself a literary man, and I wish to know all the clever fellows."
