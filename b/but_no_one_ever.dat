25|$|Geronimo {{was raised}} with the {{traditional}} religious views of the Bedonkohe. When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. In a way we believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E

I hung out {{with a lot of}} rock stars <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> did that to the same extent. There was just an ease to the whole thing. They really were the kindest, most fun band I ever worked with." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1970 New Jersey Senator Harrison A. Williams [...] "reminded {{his colleagues}} of James Madison's strong {{objection}} when the post {{was created in}} 1793", and [...] "noted the modern fulfillment of another of Madison's warnings, that there would inevitably be discrimination in the appointment of such a chaplain against the (then) smaller denominations such as Catholics and Jews." [...] Williams pointed out [...] "that although Catholics have for some time comprised the largest religious affiliation in both the Senate and {{the population as a}} whole, there has been only one Catholic Senate Chaplain since 1793, and not a single rabbi." [...] He noted [...] "Only eight denominations have been represented in the office." [...] In light of this Williams put forward Senate Resolution 90 which [...] "resulted in the Senate's decision to appoint a new chaplain annually, rather than let the incumbent serve for life." [...] The appointment would also [...] "rotate among the nation's three major religious groups." [...] When asked by reporters about the question of Constitutionality raised by his citing Madison he replied [...] "If this were tested, I would say that it could go either way. It could be declared unconstitutional. Any taxpayer could question this, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> has." [...] He held that in places where people were isolated by acts of government, such as people in the armed services, hospitals or prisons that chaplains serving them would be Constitutional, [...] "But, I don't know anybody less isolated than members of Congress." [...] In following eras the courts would rule on the constitutionality of the chaplaincy.|$|E

60|$|The parents always {{hoped they}} were not dead, and that the rat-catcher, who {{certainly}} must {{have come out of}} the mountain, would have taken them with him to his country.

60|$|At last, {{however, the}} cloth was removed, walnuts, apples, pears, and {{biscuits}} {{were placed on}} the table, a glass of wine poured out for each lady, and the quartette, with the cat and dog, drew near the sunny window, where there was a little warmth.

2500|$|At times, Girard {{acknowledges}} his indebtedness to such precursors, including Tocqueville.

60|$|Her {{tone was}} a little indifferent, {{considering}} {{that it was her}} fiancé who was missing. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>ever</b> looked for much display of feeling from Helen Thurwell, not even the man who called himself her lover. Indeed, her unresponsiveness to his advances--a sort of delicate composure which he was powerless in any way to break through--had been her strongest attraction to Sir Geoffrey Kynaston, who was quite unused to anything of the sort.|$|E

60|$|Feinheimer liked Jimmy's appearance.

50|$|Two inquests were held, and {{the details}} were {{considered}} to be so scandalous that women and children were banned from the room while Florence Bravo testified.
