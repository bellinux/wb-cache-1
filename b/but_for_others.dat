5|$|During {{these early}} {{performances}} Verdi made substantial {{changes to the}} score. For some of these he altered his manuscript, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>others</b> musicologists have {{had to rely on}} the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted {{to keep up with the}} changes, issuing new edition after new edition, but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options. In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.|$|E
5|$|In late 1863, while Quantrill's Raiders {{spent the}} winter in Texas, {{animosity}} developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter's arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri {{as the leader of}} a group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state, killing and robbing dozens of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers throughout central Missouri. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate sympathizers in Missouri saw his actions as justified, possibly owing to their mistreatment by Union forces. In September 1864 he led a raid on Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, they were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In {{what became known as the}} Centralia Massacre--possibly the war's deadliest and most brutal guerrilla action--his men killed 24 Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day that killed more than 100 Union militiamen. A month later Anderson himself was killed in battle. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson: some see him as a sadistic, psychopathic killer, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>others</b> his actions cannot be separated from the general lawlessness of the time.|$|E

25|$|Collecting is {{for some}} people a {{childhood}} hobby, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>others</b> a lifelong pursuit or one that begins in adulthood. Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when they get older.

The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.|$|E
25|$|The term heterophobia is {{confusing}} {{for some people}} for several reasons. On the one hand, some {{look at it as}} just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>others</b> still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.|$|E

2500|$|Hegel, in the Lectures on the History of Philosophy, says {{of another}} Demetrius, Demetrius Phalereus that [...] "Demetrius Phalereus {{and others were}} thus soon after [...] honoured and worshipped in Athens as God." [...] What the exact source was for Hegel's claim is unclear. [...] Diogenes Laërtius in his short {{biography}} of Demetrius Phalereus does not mention this. Apparently Hegel's error comes from a misreading of Plutarch's [...] which is about Demetrius Poliorcetes and not Demetrius of Phalereus. Plutarch describes in the work how Demetrius Poliorcetes conquered Demetrius Phalereus at Athens. [...] Then, in chapter 12 of the work, Plutarch describes how Demetrius Poliorcetes was given honors due to the god Dionysus.

2500|$|To some African Americans, jazz has {{highlighted}} {{their contribution}} to American society and helped bring attention to black history and culture, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>others,</b> the music and term [...] "jazz" [...] are reminders of [...] "an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic visions". Amiri Baraka argues {{that there is a}} distinct [...] "white jazz" [...] music genre expressive of whiteness. White jazz musicians appeared in the early 1920s in the Midwestern United States, as well as other areas. Bix Beiderbecke {{was one of the most}} prominent white jazz musicians. An influential style referred to as the Chicago School (or Chicago Style) was developed by white musicians including Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland. Frank Teschemacher, Dave Tough, and Eddie Condon. Others from Chicago such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa became leading members of big-band swing during the 1930s. [...] Some jazz bands were notable for their inclusion of both black and white musicians, and this refusal by some influential jazz musicians and promoters to countenance segregation contributed towards changing attitudes in the United States.|$|E
