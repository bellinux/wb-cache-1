5000|$|In {{the spring}} {{after a year}} long harvest, merchants and trade {{organizations}} will taste barrel samples of wine that are often only 6-8 months old. In the case of Bordeaux, where the final wine is often a blend of several grape varieties, the winemaker will try to craft an approximate blend to sample. The composition of the final wine may differ from the sample depending on how each <b>barrel</b> <b>matures</b> during the aging process. Based on the initial sample, the wines will be giving a preliminary [...] "score" [...] or wine rating based on the expected quality of the wine once it is bottled, released and has had time to mature.|$|R
50|$|Vinsanto, the {{hallmark}} dessert wine {{of the island}} of Santorini, is made of the choicest Assyrtiko grapes, vinified {{after a few days}} of sundrying. It is then <b>barreled</b> to <b>mature</b> for several years, as its capacity for aging is measured in decades.|$|R
50|$|Noah's Mill is a bourbon {{produced}} in Bardstown, Kentucky by Kentucky Bourbon Distillers (KBD). The bourbon was originally aged in charred oak <b>barrels</b> until <b>mature</b> at 15 years old, however the current bottles contain no age statement. It is bottled by hand at 57.15% ABV (114.3 proof).|$|R
50|$|LBV is {{intended}} to provide some {{of the experience of}} drinking a vintage port but without the need for lengthy bottle ageing. To a limited extent it succeeds, as the extra years of oxidative ageing in <b>barrel</b> does <b>mature</b> the wine more quickly. Unfiltered LBV can age as long as Vintage Ports and are very difficult to identify as LBVs when inserted into blind tastings of Vintage Ports.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{process in}} the making of red wine is malo-lactic conversion. This is a {{bacterial}} process which converts [...] "crisp, green apple" [...] malic acid to [...] "soft, creamy" [...] lactic acid softening the taste of the wine. Red wine is sometimes transferred to oak <b>barrels</b> to <b>mature</b> for a period of weeks or months; this practice imparts oak aromas and some tannin to the wine. The wine must be settled or clarified and adjustments made prior to bottling.|$|R
25|$|After distillation, the unaged brandy {{is placed}} into oak <b>barrels</b> to <b>mature.</b> Usually, brandies {{with a natural}} golden or brown colour are aged in oak casks (single-barrel aging). Some brandies, {{particularly}} those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of aging, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel aging.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "fishhook" [...] spines and {{the armored}} web of spines {{enclosing}} the cactus body are {{a defense against}} herbivory. Rarely a <b>mature</b> <b>barrel</b> cactus is found hollowed out by javelina but overall prickly pear experience much higher levels of damage from more species. Barrel cactus spines pose an extreme hazard for handling, penetrating boots and gloves. The roots are quite long but very shallow.|$|R
50|$|Glenmorangie uses {{a number}} of {{different}} cask types, with all products being matured in white oak casks which are manufactured from trees growing in Glenmorangie's own forest in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri, United States. These new casks are left to air for two years before being leased to distillers Jack Daniel's and Heaven Hill for them to mature bourbon in for four years. Glenmorangie then uses the <b>barrels</b> to <b>mature</b> their spirit. The Original range will mature entirely in ex-bourbon casks, while the Extra Matured range of bottlings are transferred into casks that were previously used to mature other products such as wine, port or sherry in a process called finishing. These form part of the regular range of products Glenmorangie produces. Glenmorangie also obtains small batches of other casks for finishing and release limited edition bottlings from these. Following acquisition by LVMH, Glenmorangie produced a rare limited edition aged in casks previously used to mature Château Margaux; these bottlings are now (2011) extremely hard to find and are priced accordingly.|$|R
40|$|Whereas it {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the adult cortex is capable of a remarkable degree of functional plasticity, demonstrations of accompanying structural changes have been limited. We examined the basal dendritic field morphology of dye-filled neurons in layers III and IV of the <b>mature</b> <b>barrel</b> cortex after vibrissal-deafferentation in adult rats. Eight weeks later, the tendency for these neurons to orient their dendritic arbors {{toward the center of}} their home barrel was found to be disrupted by the resultant reduced activity of thalamocortical innervation. Measures of spine density and total dendritic length were normal, indicating that the loss of dendritic bias was accompanied by growth of dendrites directed away from the barrel center. This finding suggests that in the mature cortex, the apparently static structural attributes of the normal adult cortex depend on maintenance of patterns of afferent activity; with the corollary that changes in these patterns can induce structural plasticity...|$|R
40|$|During two {{successive}} summer hands-on whisky making {{classes at}} the Bruichladdich Distillery on Islay in Scotland, two types of samples were taken and analyzed using GC/MS. Samples were taken periodically during the two stages of distillation, and of whisky that had matured for different periods of time in different character casks. HYSYS ® engineering software was adapted to the batch distillation processes using the samples for parameterization and validation. The pot stills were modeled as having equivalent trays and internal reflux from condensation of the less volatile components on the copper walls of the stills. The maturation samples {{are being used to}} elucidate the physical and chemical interaction between the toasted, charred, and previous used <b>barrels</b> and the <b>maturing</b> whisky. The effect of transforming the boiling phenomena in the wash still (1 st stage) from nucleate to film boiling to break the head was utilized. Phase separation was observed upon distillate condensation resulting in the transformation of the distillate in the spirits still (2 nd stage) from the first cut (foreshots) to the second cut (spirits cut i. e. product...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe study {{tested the}} effect of red wine on endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) {{expression}} and eNOS activity in human endothelial cells. BackgroundEndothelial-type nitric oxide (NO) synthase exerts vasoprotective effects. Moderate alcohol consumption {{has been associated with}} a reduction of cardiovascular disease, and red wine seems to offer more benefits than any other type of drink. However, the molecular basis of this protective effect is unclear. MethodsHuman endothelial cells were treated with red wine, and eNOS messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was measured by RNase protection assay, eNOS protein expression by Western blotting, and eNOS activity by RFL- 6 reporter cell assay. The eNOS promoter activity was analyzed in transfected endothelial cells; binding activities of relevant transcription factors were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. ResultsIncubation of endothelial cells with red wines from France upregulated eNOS mRNA and protein expression. In contrast, red wines from Germany showed little or no effect on eNOS expression. No significant difference in eNOS mRNA expression could be detected between “en barrique” (<b>matured</b> in oak <b>barrels)</b> and “non-barrique” (<b>matured</b> in steel tanks) –produced French red wines. Endothelial cells treated with French red wines produced up to three times more bioactive NO than did control cells. French red wines increased the activity of the eNOS promoter, with the essential trans-stimulated sequence being located in the proximal 326 bp of the promoter sequence. The eNOS mRNA stability was also increased by red wine. ConclusionsThe increase in eNOS expression and activity brought about by red wines from France (and probably other locations) may contribute to the beneficial effects of this beverage on the cardiovascular system...|$|R
