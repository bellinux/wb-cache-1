5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this <b>biologic</b> process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E
5|$|The {{primary use}} of dental {{implants}} {{is to support}} dental prosthetics. Modern dental implants make use of osseointegration, the <b>biologic</b> process where bone fuses tightly {{to the surface of}} specific materials such as titanium and some ceramics. The integration of implant and bone can support physical loads for decades without failure.|$|E

5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer <b>biologic</b> width).|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the use of <b>biologics</b> in Taiwan, including the access to new <b>biologics,</b> the impact of this access on the growth of health-care expenditure, and the utilization patterns. MethodsWe first conducted a market-level analysis to investigate the availability of global <b>biologics</b> in Taiwan as well as the growth and concentration of aggregate spending on <b>biologics.</b> We then conducted a patient-level analysis to investigate the costs and utilization patterns for selected new <b>biologics.</b> ResultsWe found that the concentration index is such that the 20 leading <b>biologics</b> in Taiwan account for more than 90 % of the total spending on <b>biologics.</b> In our patient-level study on four <b>biologics,</b> the annual cost of treatment per patient ranged from NT$ 100, 000 to NT$ 400, 000. The prevalence rate of the user was between 6. 5 and 37. 2 per 100, 000 of population. The treatment costs were inversely related to the prevalence rate of users. We also found that physicians in larger and public hospitals were more likely to prescribe new <b>biologics</b> to their patients compared with their counterparts practicing in smaller and private hospitals. In addition, we found that physicians were more likely to prescribe <b>biologics</b> to patients with more severe diseases and higher comorbidities. ConclusionsWe conclude that public spending on <b>biologics</b> in Taiwan is highly targeted toward about 20 products with higher annual expenditures and growth rates and that the utilization of these <b>biologics</b> is targeted at a small number of patients. In addition, the access to these costly <b>biologics</b> is not uniform among patients in a country with universal coverage for prescription drugs...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, an {{increasing}} number of disease therapies based on recombinant DNA technology have been developed and commercialized. These treatments, commonly known as <b>biologics,</b> can be very effective. They can also be extraordinarily expensive. In an effort to ensure the availability and affordability of <b>biologics,</b> Congress enacted the <b>Biologics</b> Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) in 2010. The BPCIA was designed to facilitate the approval of generic versions of <b>biologics,</b> striking a balance between facilitating the approval of generic <b>biologics</b> with a new regulatory pathway and protecting innovation of new <b>biologics</b> by offering a period of regulatory exclusivity much as the Hatch-Waxman Act (HWA) had done for small-molecule drugs. This Article takes the position that because of differences between the composition and features of small molecule drugs and <b>biologics,</b> as well as between the abbreviated-approval pathways instituted by the BPCIA and the HWA, pioneer and generic manufacturers seeking to market <b>biologics</b> will face distinct regulatory and patent litigation considerations compared with small-molecule drugs. First, it considers the important technical differences between small-molecule drugs and <b>biologics</b> and how these differences are likely to be reflected in different regulatory approaches under the HWA and BPCIA abbreviated-approval pathways. Second, the Article considers the particular role that production methods play in determining the characteristics of <b>biologics.</b> The complexity of these production methods can make it difficult to adjudge the presence of therapeutic equivalence between pioneer and generic <b>biologics</b> because it is difficult to ensure that production methods used by different manufacturers are identical. Method patents will also be litigated in distinct ways under the HWA and the BPCIA. Third, the Article argues that, as currently structured, the BPCIA is not likely to result in the dramatic reductions in healthcare costs that some of its proponents expect. This will be because of both difficulties in guaranteeing equivalence between pioneer and generic <b>biologics</b> and the strong protection offered to pioneer <b>biologics</b> manufacturers by process patents. The best way to ensure that the introduction of generic <b>biologics</b> can help meet the price reduction goals of the BPCIA is to work toward improvements in technical and regulatory procedures for determining equivalence between pioneer and generic <b>biologics...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they have to support. As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both <b>biologic</b> (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E

40|$|<b>Biologics</b> (biomolecule drugs) play a {{key role}} in modem medicine, yet assuring their quality and safety remains a major {{challenge}} for the biopharmaceutical industry. Developing a platform for rapid and reliable assessment of <b>biologics</b> activity is critical for quality control of <b>biologics</b> manufacturing and safety assurance. Herein we introduce a generally applicable platform for this purpose, using molecular charge modulation and electrokinetic concentration based receptor binding assays. This technology is homogeneous (immobilization-free) and overcomes many practical challenges of current immobilization-based binding assays. We developed various formats of assays for extracting the dissociation constants and dissociation rates of <b>biologics</b> toward their target receptors, which are directly related to the in vivo efficacy and duration of efficacy of <b>biologics.</b> We showcased the technology for rapid determination of <b>biologics</b> degradation, which is meaningful for assuring <b>biologics</b> safety. This work provides reliable <b>biologics</b> analysis comparable to state-of-the-art technologies with significantly less time (< 1 h), reduced sample use, and simpler experimental setup, which holds promises as a platform for assuring the quality and safety of <b>biologics</b> at the point-of-care. by Wei Ouyang.

40|$|While {{much has}} been written about the distinctions between <b>biologics</b> and small {{molecules}} in terms of their scientific, manufacturing and regulatory experiences, relatively little has been published comparing their clinical and commercial experiences. Employing a data base encompassing all 96 <b>biologics</b> and 212 small molecules newly launched in the U. S. between 1998 Q 1 and 2008 Q 4, we compare their downstream clinical and commercial characteristics. Substantial heterogeneity occurs across therapeutic classes. <b>Biologics</b> are more concentrated than small molecules in their therapeutic class composition, but have obtained FDA indication approvals in 13 of 15 classes. While average delays between FDA approval and first observed sales revenues are similar, <b>biologics</b> are twice as likely as small molecules to be Orphan Drugs, are slightly more likely to be designated FDA priority rather than standard review status, and gain slightly more supplemental indication approvals. Although 9. 4 % of new small molecules permanently exited the market for a variety of reasons, 7. 3 % of new <b>biologics</b> exited, but 26 % of <b>biologics</b> had black box warnings compared to 20 % of small molecules. Both <b>biologics</b> and small molecules take 21 - 22 quarters from launch to reach $ 100 million in real revenues. Small molecules have an initially more rapid uptake, but thereafter <b>biologics</b> mean revenues tend to be slightly greater than for small molecules. While launch prices for <b>biologics</b> are commonly perceived as being greater than for small molecules, price growth per standard unit is generally greater for small molecules than <b>biologics,</b> with rates of price growth increasing for small molecules in the first five years since launch, and decreasing thereafter. We conclude that the market dynamics of <b>biologics</b> differ substantially from those of small molecules, although therapeutic class composition plays a major role. ...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: Biological {{medicinal}} products (<b>biologics)</b> {{are subject to}} specific pharmacovigilance requirements to ensure that <b>biologics</b> are identifiable by brand name and batch number in adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports. Since Member States collect ADR data {{at the national level}} before the data is aggregated at the European Union (EU) level, it is important that an unambiguous understanding of which {{medicinal products}} belong to the biological product category exists. This study aimed to identify the level of consistency between Member States regarding the classification of <b>biologics</b> by national authorities responsible for ADR reporting. Methods: A sample list of recombinant <b>biologics</b> from the European Medicines Agency database of European Public Assessment Reports was created to analyze five Member States (Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK) according to which products were classified as <b>biologics</b> by each Member State. We calculated the Fleiss kappa value to analyze interrater reliability. Results: A considerable divergence was identified regarding the classification of the 146 recombinant <b>biologics</b> from the sample list: one Member State classified 100 % of the recombinant <b>biologics</b> from the sample list as <b>biologics,</b> whereas the classification rates in the remaining four Member States ranged between 70 and 88 % for products available on the national market. The interrater reliability for 87 products available on the market in all five Member States was considered poor. Conclusion: Discrepancies exist between Member States in the classification of biologics; less divergence exists for common well-known <b>biologics.</b> These findings highlight the need to think about the best approaches to translate EU legislation into national practices.
