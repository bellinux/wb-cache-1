25|$|The {{implementation}} of the Dulles–Jackson–Correa Report recommendations {{began in the late}} 1950s after President Truman forced DCI Hillenkoetter to resign due to the latter's failure to foresee the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950. On October 7, 1950, President Truman appointed Lt. General Walter Bedell Smith ("Beetle Smith") as the new DCI who in turn hired William Harding Jackson as his Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI). Using recommendations from the Dulles Report, DCI Smith quickly reorganized the CIA's Office of Reports and Estimates (ORE) into three units. The first unit was to focus on national intelligence and became known as the Office of National Estimates. The second unit, the Office of Current Intelligence, had a current intelligence role, and produced the daily bulletin for the President. The Last unit, the Office of Research and Reports, was to conduct a <b>basic</b> <b>intelligence</b> function and focus on intelligence analysis that was more strategic in nature and beyond the scope of any of the established intelligence agencies. The reorganization greatly reduced confusion that had previously occurred regarding the analytic mission of the CIA.|$|E

40|$|The Culture Fair Test (CFT) is a {{psychometric test}} of fluid {{intelligence}} consisting of four subtests; Series, Classification, Matrices, and Topographies. The four subtests are only moderately intercorrelated, doubting {{the notion that}} they assess the same construct (i. e., fluid intelligence). As an explanation of these low correlations, we investigated the position effect. This effect is assumed to reflect implicit learning during testing. By applying fixed-links modeling to analyze the CFT data of 206 participants, we identified position effects as latent variables in the subtests; Classification, Matrices, and Topographies. These position effects were disentangled from a second set of latent variables representing fluid intelligence inherent in the four subtests. After this separation of position effect and <b>basic</b> fluid <b>intelligence,</b> the latent variables representing <b>basic</b> fluid <b>intelligence</b> in the subtests Series, Matrices, and Topographies could be combined to one common latent variable which was highly correlated with fluid intelligence derived from the subtest Classification (r=. 72). Correlations between the three latent variables representing the position effects in the Classification, Matrices, and Topographies subtests ranged from r=. 38 to r=. 59. The results indicate that all four CFT subtests measure the same construct (i. e., fluid intelligence) but that the position effect confounds the factorial structur...|$|R
