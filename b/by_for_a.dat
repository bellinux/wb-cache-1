5|$|Construction on the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin {{had been}} {{completed}} three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped <b>by</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua, since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell {{on the shoulders of}} the incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary. Margaret feared for the family's safety, as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state's Ordinance of Secession. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, and she saw throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons.|$|E

500|$|On November 18, 1994, Zosky's Blue Jays career {{came to an}} {{end when}} he was traded to the Florida Marlins <b>by</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> player to be named later, who ended up being minor league pitcher Scott Pace. That was the first trade ever made by new Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash, who {{replaced}} Pat Gillick following the 1994 season. Zosky made the Marlins Opening Day roster for the 1995 season and on April 29, he played in his first Major League game since October 4, 1992. Facing Trevor Wilson of the San Francisco Giants, Zosky singled in his first big league at-bat in over two seasons. He played the whole game, going 1-for-3 at the plate. Appearing in only six games at the Major League level in 1995 (with the single in his first at-bat his only big league hit), Zosky spent most of the year with the Triple-A International League's Charlotte Knights, to whom he was optioned after the Marlins cut their roster from 28 to 25 players on May 15. With Charlotte, he hit [...]247 with three home runs and 42 RBI in 92 games, walking only seven times in 312 at-bats. On October 16, he was granted free agency.|$|E
500|$|The Dollars trilogy was not {{released}} in the United States until 1967, when A Fistful of Dollars opened in January, followed <b>by</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> Few Dollars More in May, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly on December 29, 1967. All the films were commercially successful, particularly The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which eventually earned $8million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star. All three films received bad reviews, and {{marked the beginning of}} a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect. Judith Crist described A Fistful of Dollars as [...] "cheapjack," [...] while Newsweek considered For a Few Dollars More as [...] "excruciatingly dopey." [...] Renata Adler of The New York Times said The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was [...] "...the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre." [...] Time magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially on the part of Eastwood, though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised Eastwood's coolness in playing the tall, lone stranger. Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Released in Italy in 1964 {{and then}} in the United States in 1967, it {{initiated}} the popularity of the Spaghetti Western genre. It was followed <b>by</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, also starring Eastwood. Collectively, the films are known as the [...] "Dollars Trilogy", or [...] "The Man With No Name Trilogy". All three films were later released in sequence in the United States in 1967, catapulting Eastwood into stardom. The film has been identified as an unofficial remake of the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo (1961), which resulted in a successful lawsuit by Toho, the producers of Yojimbo. In the United States, the United Artists publicity campaign referred to Eastwood's character in all three films as the [...] "Man with No Name".|$|E

[...] His fellow Care Bears come <b>by</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> look; one of them, Funshine, loves telling jokes and making the other Care Bears laugh. [...] After they reluctantly agree to try the carousel, it goes out of control and sends them into the sky before crashing down. [...] Grumpy feels even worse after Funshine tries to cheer him up with a joke on height restrictions, which the other Bears find funny. [...] Grumpy is not amused and even {{goes so far as to}} tell Funshine that if he doesn't understand that cheering up isn't making fun of, then maybe Funshine doesn't belong in Care-A-Lot. [...] As a result, the Bears take Grumpy to help him and Funshine make up. [...] Reading from a note, Tenderheart Bear realizes that Funshine has felt sorry for Grumpy and has gone in search of a place where his talents can be better appreciated. [...] The other Bears are worried about his fate; as they cannot hold their Fair without him, they decide to look for him regardless and bring him back to Care-a-lot. [...] Five of them Tenderheart, Grumpy, Wish, Cheer and Share volunteer, while Laugh-a-Lot, Love-a-Lot, Friend, Good Luck, Bedtime, and Champ stay home to get ready for the fair.|$|E
