5|$|According to Tischendorf, Codex Sinaiticus {{was one of}} {{the fifty}} copies of the Bible {{commissioned}} from Eusebius by Roman Emperor Constantine after his conversion to Christianity (De vita Constantini, IV, 37). This hypothesis was supported by Pierre Batiffol, Gregory and Skeat <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already in production when Constantine placed his order, but had to be suspended in order to accommodate different page dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{threatens the}} island's very existence, it is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> around eight acres in 1639 before being reduced to 5.70 acres by 1818. By 1987, the total area {{has fallen to}} 2.87 acres and it was {{projected}} that it could lose another 12 inches each year until it disappears into the sea around 2026.|$|E
5|$|He had a paternalistic {{attitude}} towards his subjects and <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{his duty to}} treat the Chinese and foreign ethnic groups as equals under one ruler. Taizong's views grew into state policy as his government recruited Turkic and other non-Han Chinese soldiers into the Tang military. Turkic soldiers were later promoted to higher ranks as commanders and generals. The surname of Li, belonging to the royal family of Li Shimin, was awarded to Han and non-Han officers for their service.|$|E
50|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1981 {{showed that a}} substantial majority of U.S. adults and adolescents <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> socially unacceptable to discuss menstruation, especially in mixed company.

5|$|Kazuo Inamori, {{founder of}} Kyocera and KDDI, {{took over as}} CEO of JAL. Transport {{minister}} Seiji Maehara personally visited Kyocera headquarters in late 2009 in order to persuade Inamori to accept the position; task force leader Shinjiro Takagi <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to appoint a proven entrepreneur CEO in order to fix the various problems at JAL. Japan Air Commuter president Masaru Onishi was promoted to president of JAL.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Navy {{would need}} a {{significant}} manpower expansion of 2,800 sailors to crew all of the proposed battleships. The Commission <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unlikely that sufficient Dutch citizens would volunteer, and {{that as a result}} Indonesian sailors should be recruited and trained for service in the NEI. Strong segregation between white and Indonesian sailors was to be maintained to the maximum extent practical for unit efficiency.|$|E
5|$|A {{century later}} he was already a legendary figure; William of Tyre <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Peter who had planted {{the idea for the}} crusade in Urban's mind (which was taken as fact by historians until the 19th century). It is {{commonly}} believed that Peter's followers consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but indeed there were many knights among the peasants, including Walter Sans Avoir, who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.|$|E

5|$|Although the Boleyn {{family still}} held {{important}} {{positions on the}} Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the Duke of Suffolk. Even her own uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, had come to resent her attitude to her power. The Boleyns preferred France over the Emperor as a potential ally, but the King's favour had swung towards the latter (partly because of Cromwell), damaging the family's influence. Also opposed to Anne were supporters of reconciliation with Princess Mary (among them the former supporters of Catherine), who had reached maturity. A second annulment was now a real possibility, although it is commonly <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Cromwell's anti-Boleyn influence that led opponents {{to look for a}} way of having her executed.|$|E
5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz {{was the reason for}} her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had always <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the way they did.|$|E
5|$|Friendly {{generally}} {{approved of}} the first version but <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to include information on same-sex sexual practices. When those practices were explained to him, however, he changed his mind. While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, who {{was known for his}} cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E

Hill has also criticised the Academy's circumcision information brochure for parents, arguing that the brochure is inadequate to persuade parents to avoid circumcision.|$|R
50|$|Sunnis {{interpret}} ismah to {{mean that}} prophets are immune from telling lies (intentionally or unintentionally), of being Kafir (infidel) before or after their assignment, and of being unable to commit other sins intentionally. In other aspects, opinions diverge. Most Sunnis <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible for the prophets to unintentionally commit sin, while the minority <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|R
5|$|HP <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{no longer}} {{cost-effective}} for individual enterprise systems {{companies such as}} itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would {{be used by the}} majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. HP and Intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In {{cultures}} {{that did not}} recognize a smallpox deity, there was often nonetheless a belief in smallpox demons, who were accordingly blamed for the disease. Such beliefs were prominent in Japan, Europe, Africa, {{and other parts of}} the world. Nearly all cultures who believed in the demon also <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> afraid of the color red. This led to the invention of so-called red treatment, where victims and their rooms would be decorated in red. The practice spread to Europe in the 12th century and was practiced by (among others) Charles V of France and Elizabeth I of England. Afforded scientific credibility through the studies by Finsen showing that red light reduced scarring, this belief persisted even until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major supply base for {{supporting}} the Spanish uprising against Napoleon. The French invasion of Spain in 1808 prompted Gibraltar's British garrison {{to cross the border}} and destroy the ring of Spanish fortresses around the bay, as well as the old Spanish fortified lines on the isthmus, to deny the French the ability to besiege Gibraltar or control the bay from shore batteries. French forces reached as far as San Roque, just north of Gibraltar, but did not attempt to target Gibraltar itself as they <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impregnable. The French besieged Tarifa, further down the coast, in 1811–12 but gave up after a month. Gibraltar faced no further military threat for a century.|$|E

5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of {{this idea}} point out that moralists during Bosch's era <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> woman'sultimately Eve'stemptation that drew men into a life of lechery and sin. This would explain why {{the women in the}} center panel are very much among the active {{participants}} in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power of femininity was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by a circle of males. A late 15th-century engraving by Israhel van Meckenem shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the Pool of Youth similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.|$|E
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Why does it strike us as {{absurd to}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> raining and <b>that</b> one doesn’t <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> raining? Some argue <b>that</b> <b>it</b> strikes us as absurd because belief is normative. The beliefs <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> raining and <b>that</b> one doesn’t <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>are,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> suggested, self-falsifying. But, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> argued, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{essential}} to belief that beliefs ought not, among other things, be self-falsifying. That {{is why the}} beliefs strike us as absurd. I argue that while the absurdity may consist in and be explained by self-falsification, we have no reasons to accept the further claim that self-falsifying beliefs are absurd because violating norms...|$|R

5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 {{added to a}} litany of complaints about the state's first constitution. Some <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In {{the aftermath of the}} disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe {{was also}} {{known to the}} Greeks and Romans, who <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an unnatural hybrid of a camel and a leopard and called it camelopardalis. The giraffe was among the many animals {{collected}} and displayed by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by Julius Caesar in 46 BC and exhibited to the public. With {{the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined. During the Middle Ages, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance.|$|E
5|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Lithuania, Gens {{headed the}} Jewish {{hospital}} in Vilnius before {{the formation of}} the ghetto in September 1941. He was appointed chief of the ghetto police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head of the ghetto Jewish government. He attempted to secure better conditions in the ghetto and <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to save some Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in Ponary in October–December 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt to save some Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, continue to be a subject of debate and controversy.|$|E
