40|$|To combat {{adhesion}} loss, sand {{is fired}} into the wheel–rail contact via a hose using compressed air typically from a storage hopper mounted to the under {{frame of the}} train. Many passenger trains in the UK are fitted with stepped braking controllers which range from 1 to 3 with a fourth step being ‘emergency braking’. 1 Sand is fired automatically if wheel slip is detected from <b>brake</b> <b>step</b> level 2 upwards. 2 Sand is automatically fired when the emergency brakes are applied irrespective of whether low adhesion/wheel slip has been detected. 2 For adhesion loss in traction, sand can be applied at the driver’s discretion. Current railway standards 2 govern the maximum permissible sand flow rate to protect against wheel/rail isolation of track circuits, but do not address the hose position. This results {{in a range of}} hose set-ups across different train types, some of which may not be effective at delivering sand. The work here was carried out using a full-scale laboratory rail–wheel test machine to find the position for the hose and sand flow rates that give optimum sand entrainment to the contact. It was found that ideally the hose should be aimed at the rail or nip and be as close to that contact as safely possible. The use of a 20 [*]mm bore nozzle {{on the end of a}} 25 [*]mm bore hose increased sand passing through the contact by up to 70 % relative to widely used 25 [*]mm bore hoses without a nozzle. Reduction in sand flow rate below the 2 [*]kg/min threshold significantly reduced the amount of sand entering the contact. It was also shown that relatively small movements in the hose/nozzle from its ideal position and cross winds significantly reduced sand entrainment...|$|E

50|$|The oldest trams (1001-1005) {{controlled}} the motor current directly, through a slipring contact with five serial, four parallel and five <b>braking</b> <b>steps.</b> These {{controlled the}} power output directly, with a mechanism that breaking {{the power to}} the motors occurred in a contactor. The other trams had control current controllers, which was a 100 V power which controlled a contactor which again controlled the motors. Originally, the power was fed directly from the pantograph to the motors, via a resistance. From 1931, the trams were rebuilt with battery which fed the motors. Trams built from 1920 could be run in pairs with multiple-unit train control, via a cable with the control current. From 1943, plugs to connect the cables were not installed when trams were renovated. The maximum speed of the trams were 40 km/h when running at 600 V and 60 km/h when running at 1,200 V.|$|R

40|$|Plantar loading may {{influence}} comfort, performance and injury risk in soccer boots. This {{study investigated the}} effect of cleat configuration and insole cushioning levels on perception of comfort and in-shoe plantar pressures at the heel and fifth metatarsal head region. Nine soccer academy players (age 15. 7  ±  1. 6  years; height 1. 80  ±  0. 40  m; body mass 71. 9  ±  6. 1  kg) {{took part in the}} study. Two boot models (8 and 6 cleats) and two insoles (Poron and Poron/gel) provided four footwear combinations assessed using pressure insoles during running and 180 ° turning. Mechanical and comfort perception tests differentiated boot and insole conditions. During biomechanical testing, the Poron insole generally provided lower peak pressures than the Poron/gel insole, particularly during the <b>braking</b> <b>step</b> of the turn. The boot model did not independently influence peak pressures at the fifth metatarsal, and had minimal influence on heel loads. Specific boot-insole combinations performed differently (P <  0. 05). The 8 -cleat boot and the Poron insole performed best biomechanically and perceptually, but the combined condition did not. Inclusion of kinematic data and improved control of the turning technique are recommended to strengthen future research. The mechanical, perception and biomechanical results highlight the need for a multi-faceted approach in the assessment of footwear...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{autonomous}} braking {{system based on}} deep reinforcement learning. The proposed autonomous braking system automatically decides whether {{to apply the brake}} at each time step when confronting the risk of collision using the information on the obstacle obtained by the sensors. The problem of designing brake control is formulated as searching for the optimal policy in Markov decision process (MDP) model where the state is given by the relative position of the obstacle and the vehicle's speed, and the action space is defined as whether <b>brake</b> is <b>stepped</b> or not. The policy used for brake control is learned through computer simulations using the deep reinforcement learning method called deep Q-network (DQN). In order to derive desirable braking policy, we propose the reward function which balances the damage imposed to the obstacle in case of accident and the reward achieved when the vehicle runs out of risk as soon as possible. DQN is trained for the scenario where a vehicle is encountered with a pedestrian crossing the urban road. Experiments show that the control agent exhibits desirable control behavior and avoids collision without any mistake in various uncertain environments...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, at the Delft University of Technology and TNO Automotive and in {{conjuction}} with {{an industrial}} consortium, a pragmatic tyre model has been developed going by the name SWIFT, which is geared {{to the analysis of}} tyre oscillations and its effects on vehicle behaviour. The SWIFt tyre model has been designed to cover in-plane, out-of-plane and combined higher order dynamic tyre performance. It can be regarded {{as an extension of the}} Magic Formula pragmatic tyre model, up to a range of at least 50 HZ. This paper describes the application of the SWIFT tyre model to full vehicle ABS braking. First, the model is used to derive the single tyre response to road undulations and <b>brake</b> torque <b>step</b> input, both being very much of relevance to ABS braking. This includes a survey of the sensitivity of the dynamic tyre parameters regarding the first, rigid belt, eigenfrequencies and the relative damping. Next, the response of a quater vehicle to similar input is discussed with specific emphasis on the added value of the dynamic characteristics of the SWIFt model in comparision to steady state and transient tyre models. Finally, full vehicle ABS controlled braking on an even road is considered for various road friction values and vehicle spee...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Building {{models are}} an {{important}} part of contemporary 3 D GIS. Airborne laser scanning provides good opportunities for automation of their acquisition. In that the main task is the reconstruction of the roof geometry, as the complete model could then be obtained by projecting its outlines to the surface of a digital terrain model. A strategy for roof reconstruction from airborne laser scanning (LIDAR) data is described in this paper. At first planes within a building region are detected through the Hough trans-form. Separate segments are then extracted, based on the adjacency relations of a 2. 5 D Delaunay triangulation. The combined outline of all planar seg-ments constitutes the gutter. A scheme for the reconstruction of <b>brake</b> lines and <b>step</b> edges within the roof structure is presented. Finally, the possibili-ties of dynamically choosing among different processing options through the implementation of machine learning algorithms are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the severity of}} rear-end and other collisions, Pre-Crash Systems (PCS) are being developed. These active safety systems utilize radar and/or video cameras to determine when a frontal crash, such as a front-to-back rear-end collisions, is imminent and can brake autonomously, even with no driver input. Of these PCS features, the effects of autonomous pre-crash braking are estimated. To estimate the maximum potential for injury reduction due to autonomous pre-crash braking in the striking vehicle of rear-end crashes, a methodology is presented for determining 1) the reduction in vehicle crash change in velocity (ΔV) due to PCS braking and 2) the number of injuries that could be prevented due to the reduction in collision severity. Injury reduction was only performed for belted drivers, as unbelted drivers have an unknown risk of being thrown out of position. The study was based on 1, 406 rear-end striking vehicles from NASS / CDS years 1993 to 2008. PCS parameters were selected from realistic values and varied to examine the effect on system performance. PCS braking authority was varied from 0. 5 G’s to 0. 8 G’s while time to collision (TTC) was held at 0. 45 seconds. TTC was then varied from 0. 3 second to 0. 6 seconds while braking authority was held constant at 0. 6 G’s. A constant <b>braking</b> pulse (<b>step</b> function) and ramp-up braking pulse were used. The study found that automated PCS braking could reduce the crash ΔV in rear-end striking vehicles {{by an average of}} 12 % – 50 % and avoid 0 % – 14 % of collisions, depending on PCS parameters. Autonomous PCS braking could potentially reduce the number of injured drivers who are belted by 19 % to 57 %...|$|R
40|$|Starting in 2011, Germany {{will have}} a new fiscal rule to limit {{indebtedness}} - the debt brake. To encourage the functioning of this regulation on federal and Länder level, an advice board (Stabilitätsrat) was founded in April 2010. In a first step he selected four key numbers and defined thresholds. This article focuses on the chosen indicators and thresholds on Länder level by evaluating the effectiveness of both, the key figures themselves and their thresholds. We are analyzing time series from 1995 to 2009. The findings show that in general, the chosen figures are able to indicate a possible debt risk. However, the threshold values of the advice board endanger the effectiveness of the debt brake. This danger is especially caused by the mode of calculation: The thresholds are based on an average of German Länder. For this reason, only extremely negative household developments are pointed out. Furthermore, the new German debt brake is fundamentally based on the structural budget balance. Nevertheless, this key figure has not directly been chosen by the board. The approach of the board {{can be explained by the}} fact that there is - so far - no agreement between the federal level and the Länder how to calculate the structural balance on the Länder level. This circumstance is precarious, because the debt <b>brake</b> cannot <b>step</b> really into force without the calculation of the structural budget balance for the Länder. For this reason, we try to close this vacancy by proposing a possible calculating mode for the structural part of the budget. The results of this calculation are indicating that on average the fiscal policy of the Länder was not sustainable. Key numbers as defined by the board indicated this only for a few of the Länder. From our point of view policy urgently has to act – otherwise the debt brake might not be successful. ...|$|R
50|$|The train {{consisted}} of engine and tender, five carriages, two post office vans, and two brake vans. It left Darlington at 8.25 pm, and after about 4 mi, and moving at 40 mph towards Dalton Road bridge, the driver {{felt a sudden}} shock {{at the back of}} the engine. On looking around, he saw fire flying from the tender, and shut off the steam. The fireman couldn’t apply the tender <b>brake</b> since the <b>step</b> to the <b>brake</b> had broken in the incident. The driver whistled for the guard's brakes, but did not reverse the engine for fear of damage to the carriages behind. The engine came to a dead stop in 220 yards from the point of alarm, and both guards and firemen went to the nearest stations to alert any oncoming trains of the blockage to the line. The engine was fine, but the tender had lost both leading wheels, axle and axle-boxes, although was upright with the other four wheels intact, but off the rails. Most of the following vehicles were more or less damaged and off the track, damage being mainly confined to the wheel assemblies, but injuries were minimal, with only one passenger complaining. Six post-office clerks were “considerably shaken”.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring walking, {{the body}} {{center of mass}} oscillates along the {{vertical}} plane. Its displacement is highest at mid-swing and lowest at terminal swing during the transition to double support. Its vertical velocity (CoMv) has been observed to increase {{as the center of}} mass falls between mid- and late swing but is reduced just before double support. This suggests that braking of the center of mass is achieved with active neural control. We tested whether this active control deteriorates with aging (Experiment 1) and during a concurrent cognitive task (Experiment 2). At short steps of 0. 4 m but older subjects did so to a lesser extent. During the cognitive task, young subjects increased CoMv control (i. e. increase in CoMv <b>braking)</b> while maintaining <b>step</b> length and walking speed. Older subjects on the other hand, did not increase CoMv control but rather maintain it by reducing both step length and walking speed. These results suggest that active braking of the CoM during the transition to double support predominates in steps > 0. 4 m. It could be a manifestation of the balance control system, since the braking occurs at late stance where body weight is being shifted to the contralateral side. The active braking mechanism also appears to require some attentional resource. In aging, reducing step length and speed are strategic to maintaining effective center of mass control during the transition to double support. However, the lesser degree of control in older adults indicates a true age-related deficit...|$|R
