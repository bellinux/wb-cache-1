On {{the morning of}} 6 July, Pump A's pressure safety valve (PSV #504) was removed for routine maintenance. The pump's two-yearly overhaul was planned but had not started. The open condensate pipe was temporarily sealed with a disk cover (flat metal disc also called a blind flange or <b>blank</b> <b>flange).</b> Because the work could not be completed by 6:00p.m., the disc cover remained in place. It was hand-tightened only. The on-duty engineer filled in a permit which stated that Pump A was not ready and must not be switched on under any circumstances.|$|E

Others refused to help, believing that the Jewish inmates were simply being rightfully punished for some crime they must have committed. Forced to work, many POWs deliberately sabotaged the pipes they were working on by placing stones or <b>blank</b> <b>flanges</b> into the pipes. Suspicious, on one occasion a German engineer ordered a pressure test on the pipes. Horrified, the POWs knew that not one single pipe would pass such a test and realised that they would be shot in no less than 20 minutes. As the test was being prepared the air raid siren went off, and they were ordered into the shelters. Dodd later said: ...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} mode {{frequency of the}} prototype storage ring cavity has been measured with various port terminations and cavity temperatures. Since the highest tuned frequency of the prototype cavity with a tuner under the high RF power test condition is measured to be lower than the system specified frequency, a slight dimensional change in the cavity design is required for manufacturing future cavities. In addition to this, an extra dimensional correction is required to compensate the volume changes due to the tuner position and increased port sizes. In the following, the measured frequencies and the estimated frequency shift due to the volume changes are discussed. The correction to the internal dimension of the new cavity design based on the estimated frequency shift is also discussed. I. Frequency Measurement Data Measured frequencies of the prototype single cell cavity with various port terminations are as follows: (a) All four big ports are plugged. The plugs are flush to the cavity inner surface. Frequency is 352. 60 MHz. (b) Four ports are terminated with a loop coupler, one tuner and two plates. The loop coupler is adjusted for matched input and then terminated with a matched load. The tuner is adjusted for the frequency of 351. 93 MHz. (c) Frequency is measured under the high power test condition with vacuum (� 1 x 10 – 8 torr), higher cavity temperature (� 100 °F), and other accessories such as a tuner, two turbo pumps, and an E – probe damper, which {{is close to the}} actual operating condition. With maximum insertion of the tuning plunger, the resonant frequency is measured as ƒm = 351. 60 MHz. In this measurement the small ports in the cavity covers are covered with <b>blank</b> <b>flanges.</b> The measurement in case (c) is considered to be the most practical and useful in determining the right cavity dimensions for the right frequency. This information is used in estimation of the resonant frequency changes and the corresponding dimensional correction of the cavity. II...|$|R

Revise the Bases on page 178 to reflect {{a reduction in the}} number of installed drywell-to-torus vacuum breakers from ten to eight. Reason for Changes Monticello currently has ten 18 -inch Atwood & Morrill vacuum breakers mounted on the end of the vent lines in the pressure suppression chanber (torus). Six of the vent lines have one vacuum breaker and two of the vent lines have two vacuum breakers installed. Vacuum breaker sizing requirements have been reevaluated as part of the Mark I Containment Long Term Program. As noted in Exhibit C, six vacuum breakers are adequate to preserve containment integrity under the worst postulated condition (both drywell sprays initiated simultaneously in a steam filled drywell). This reassessment confirmed our long held belief that extremely conservative criteria were used in the original vacuum breaker sizing. Also as part of the Mark I Containment Long Term Program, the existing vacuum breaker locations will be strengthened to withstand post-accident impact loads...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Bearing is {{the core}} {{components}} of wind power equipment. According to the special requirement of high reliability, long life of wind power bearing, the current manufacturing defects {{of it has been}} analyzed, such as flange, pits, fish-tail, folding, and comparing with its current manufacturing method, which is called ring rolling, therefore, a new method called rolling and bulging-matching techniques is proposed, as wind power bearing ring should be released stress after rolling, then sized through bulging and once again to stress. Ring bulging is still a blank space in China; this project plans to research bulging process kinematics and dynamics analysis first. This paper gives a brief introduction of bulging processing and focus on the analysis of wind power bearing ring bulging forming. Preface At present, the main forming method of large different section ring parts is ring rolling. Ring rolling is a new special forming process to produce seamless ring, it is widely used in the production of ring parts or <b>blanks</b> like <b>flange</b> ring, bearing ring, gear ring, and train wheels [6]. Metal fibers of rolled rings distribute along the ring circumference direction continuously and compatible with the force and wear during its working. Its inner texture is compact and grain is fine, and its mechanica...|$|R
40|$|Deep drawing {{operations}} are crucial for metal forming operations. Obtaining a defect free final product with the desired mechanical properties {{is very important}} for fulfilling the customer expectations and market competitions. Flange wrinkling is one of the fatal and most frequent defects that must be prevented. This study focuses on understanding the phenomenon of flange wrinkling and prevention method that can be applied to avoid the flange wrinkling defect. MINITAB software was used to analyze parameters in order to understand level of flange wrinkling and effect in experiments against of sheet metal. Model of a cup are used to investigate with different thickness but the blank holder force depend on spring. This process also depends on calculation, and the material that we use is mild steel. Flange wrinkling instability is illustrated in energy diagrams of the process. Effect of anisotropy on flange wrinkling is also discussed by comparing with using different thickness. Besides experimental which is conducted as conventional deep drawing operation by a hydraulic press, numerical analysis verification is also performed and this yields will show the ability to understand the effect of <b>blank</b> thickness on <b>flange</b> wrinkling formation through experimental and numerical analysis. The wave formations different sized of blanks with same metals are illustrated...|$|R
