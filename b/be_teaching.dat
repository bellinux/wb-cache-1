5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{interpretation}} of the Upanishad is a qualified monism. Ramanuja interprets the Upanishadic literature to <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> a body-soul theory, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, where the Brahman is the dweller in all things, yet also distinct and beyond all things, as the soul, the inner controller, the immortal. The Upanishads, according to the Vishishtadvaita school, teach individual souls {{to be of the}} same quality as the Brahman, but quantitatively they are distinct.|$|E

25|$|If FID forces {{take part}} in combat, one of their first {{activities}} tends to <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> HN personnel how to call for close air support and artillery fires. The actual fire may come from HN or FID resources, or a combination. One {{of the reasons that}} fire direction is a priority is that experienced FID personnel will avoid firing at unknown targets, or firing at insurgents using civilian shields. Free-fire zones, such as used in Vietnam, can produce new insurgents faster than killing old ones.|$|E
25|$|During {{certain parts}} of the Amidah said on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, Ashkenazi Jews {{traditionally}} go down to the floor upon their knees and make their upper body bowed over like an arch, similar to Muslims, though not exactly in the same manner. There are some variations in Ashkenazi customs as to how long one remains in this position. Some Jews among the Dor Daim and Talmidhe haRambam understand both the Mishneh Torah and the Talmudic source texts concerning bowing in the Shemoneh Esreh to <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> that one must always prostrate, lying flat on the ground, not only during the High Holy Days, but throughout the year during the four bows of the Amidah. It is hard to know the percentage of those who hold by the latter view, the likelihood being that most who accept such a view usually only do so in private or when praying among like-minded people.|$|E
25|$|Hawley began {{teaching}} at the University of Arizona in 1929. By 1933, the University of Arizona was faced with financial difficulties due to the Great Depression, and they asked most of the young faculty to take a year’s leave of absence, which included Hawley. In the fall of 1934, she took a job {{teaching at the}} University of New Mexico in the Department of Anthropology where she made less than the male professors. As a professor Hawley was not considered easy; she expected her students to learn and to think on their own. She taught over 20 courses, several of which were usually taught by men. She was found at one point to <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> more courses {{than anyone else in}} the anthropology department. Hawley always brought new theoretical approaches as well as her own ideas into focus while teaching. Her students knew they were expected to organize and comprehend data, in addition to become familiar with the bibliographical material. She continued to work and to teach students in the field after her retirement.|$|E

25|$|After {{a lengthy}} quest {{involving}} library research, rigged gambling, theft, drinking contests, necromancy, monkeys and spitting, Guybrush {{is able to}} recover all four fragments of the map. He gives the map to Wally the cartographer {{so that it can}} be deciphered, but both Wally and the map are captured by LeChuck. Guybrush stows away in a crate of voodoo supplies which is delivered to LeChuck's fortress, and through yet more spitting to escape from the torture chamber, and an accident involving a match and a large quantity of explosives, he and Wally are able to escape, although without recovering the map. Literally landing on Dinky Island, Guybrush encounters Herman Toothrot, who claims to <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> zen philosophy on the beach. Herman is typically unhelpful, but his parrot remembers the conversation between the sailors who originally discovered Big Whoop and guides Guybrush to the treasure's burial site in exchange for crackers. Guybrush excavates the site and lowers himself into the hole on a rope. Elaine Marley, in her home on Booty Island, hears the explosion and correctly deduces that someone is attempting to dig up Big Whoop.|$|E
500|$|In the Vishishtadvaita school, the Upanishads are {{interpreted}} to <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> a Ishwar (Vishnu), {{which is the}} seat of all auspicious qualities, {{with all of the}} empirically perceived world as the body of God who dwells in everything. The school recommends a devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god. This ultimately leads one to the oneness with abstract Brahman. The Brahman in the Upanishads is a living reality, states Fowler, and [...] "the Atman of all things and all beings" [...] in Ramanuja's interpretation.|$|E

After a class contest, The Half-Blood Prince's tips help Harry win a bottle of Felix Felicis, more commonly known as [...] "Liquid Luck."

500|$|Even {{with this}} busy agenda, Paoli's {{financial}} situation remained strained. After living in New York City for {{almost the entire}} year of 1927, Paoli decided {{to come back to}} Puerto Rico to live and work with his sister Amalia, giving voice lessons at the Academia Paoli. Paoli also helped produce Othello at the Municipal Theater in San Juan. For the next two decades Paoli's main concern would <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> at the Paoli Academy with Amalia. In 1928, the tenor performed Verdi's Otello entirely for the last time in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This was his last performance on stage. It took place at the San Juan Municipal Theater, known today as the Tapia Theater. In 1935, the government of Puerto Rico named the San Juan Municipal Theater in his honor, changing its name to Teatro Paoli. In 1929, his wife Josephine died and a year later he married Adelaida Bonini, from Rimini, Italy, and whom he affectionately called [...] "Adina". He gave his last singing performance in 1942, while commemorating the one-year anniversary of the death of his sister, Amalia Paoli. The service was conducted at the Chapel of the University of the Sacred Heart (Santurce).|$|E

[...] It also claims that Jennifer Hudin, the {{director}} of the John Searle Center for Social Ontology, where the complainant had been employed as an assistant to Searle, has stated that Searle [...] "has had sexual relationships with his students and others in the past in exchange for academic, monetary or other benefits". It was reported that [...] "n early March, Searle’s students learned he would no longer <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> his undergraduate 'Philosophy of Mind' course.

2500|$|On 14 February 2016 the {{education}} minister, Simon Birmingham, described the lessons {{prepared by the}} coalition as having [...] "reasonable objectives". Birmingham stated that controversy over the program was [...] "very unhelpful because the debate {{that seems to be}} occurring in the public space is one of whether or not we should <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> inclusiveness and tolerance in our schools". Some of the negative commentary surrounding the program has been attributed to the belief that young people who are exposed to LGBTIQ issues might then change their sexuality. There is no evidence that sex education can make a student turn gay. The current federal governments policy is to not fund the program beyond 2017. Resources will still be available for schools to use beyond that date. Labor's policy is to expand the Safe Schools Coalition.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Santorum called {{intelligent}} design [...] "a legitimate scientific theory {{that should be}} taught in science classes", but by 2005 he had adopted the Teach the Controversy approach. He told National Public Radio, [...] "I'm not comfortable with {{intelligent design}} being taught in the science classroom. What we should <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> are the problems and holes ... {{in the theory of}} evolution." [...] Later that year, Santorum resigned from the advisory board of the Christian-rights Thomas More Law Center after the Center's lawyers lost a case representing a school board that had required the teaching of intelligent design. Santorum, who had previously supported the school board's policy, indicated he had not realized that certain members of the board had been motivated by religious beliefs. Santorum critics said he was backtracking from his earlier position because he was facing a tough reelection fight for 2006. When asked in November 2011 about his views on evolution, Santorum stated that he believes that evolution occurred on a tiny, micro level.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{government}} announced a reduction of reliance of racial quotas in 2002, instead leaning more towards meritocracy. Before 2004, all lecturers in public tertiary institutions were required to have some post-graduate award as a qualification. In October 2004, this requirement was removed and the Higher Education Ministry announced that industry professionals who added value to a course could apply for lecturing positions directly to universities {{even if they did}} not have postgraduate qualifications. To head off possible allegations that the universities faced a shortage of lecturers, Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Fu Ah Kiow said [...] "This is not because we are facing a shortage of lecturers, but because this move will add value to our courses and enhance the name of our universities... Let's say Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg, both [...] well known and outstanding in their fields, want to <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> professors. Of course, we would {{be more than happy to}} take them in."

2500|$|The prelude {{section of}} the Panchatantra {{identifies}} an octogenarian Brahmin named Vishnu Sharma (IAST: Viṣṇuśarman) as its author. He is stated to <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> the principles of good government to three princes of Amarasakti. It is unclear, states Patrick Olivelle – a professor of Sanskrit and Indian religions, if Vishnu Sharma was a real person or itself a literary invention. Some South Indian recensions of the text, as well as Southeast Asian versions of Panchatantra attribute the text to Vasubhaga, states Olivelle. Based on the content and mention {{of the same name}} in other texts dated to ancient and medieval era centuries, most scholars agree that Vishnu Sharma is a fictitious name. Olivelle and other scholars state that regardless of who the author was, it is likely [...] "the author was a Hindu, and not a Buddhist, nor Jain", but {{it is unlikely that the}} author was a devotee of Hindu god Vishnu because the text neither expresses any sentiments against other Hindu deities such as Shiva, Indra and others, nor does it avoid invoking them with reverence.|$|E
2500|$|After {{an initial}} [...] of {{submitted}} applications, short-listed candidates at Oxford and Cambridge {{are invited to}} a series of tests and interviews with the academics who may eventually <b>be</b> <b>teaching</b> them. Oxbridge interviews have acquired something of a mythical status in the British media, becoming a source of various humorous anecdotes and urban legends due to the perception that the interviews themselves are bizarre, intimidating and/or frequently involve unusual questions and requests. Interview prompts reportedly used in the past include [...] "Do you think you're clever?" [...] (from a Law interview at Cambridge) and [...] "Talk about a light bulb" [...] (from an Engineering interview at Oxford). Admissions staff have said that there are no correct answers to such questions, but that applicants are assessed on their ability to approach unfamiliar, open-ended problems and discuss them articulately, incorporating new ideas and evidence as the discussion progresses. Candidates are also expected to show a willingness to challenge their own preconceptions about the topics under discussion, as well as the preconceptions adopted by their interviewers. This is essentially a test of whether the student would do well under the tutorial/supervision system at Oxford and Cambridge, and a poor performance at interview may negate an otherwise strong application.|$|E
