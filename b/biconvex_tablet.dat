40|$|This thesis work {{is focused}} on the {{modeling}} of inter- and intra-tablet coating variability of pan coated tablets. Tablets are coated {{for a number of reasons}} such as controlling the bioavailability and release profile of the drug (functional coatings), ensuring product identification and aesthetics, masking odor and taste and protecting the tablet core. Due to the critical nature of functional film coating, significant variations in coating between tablet-to-tablet (inter-tablet coating variation) and between different regions of a tablet, such as the cap and the band of a <b>biconvex</b> <b>tablet</b> (intra-tablet coating variation) will adversely affect product efficacy. Therefore, modeling the process is an important tool towards predicting and controlling variability and can help eliminate some of the problems caused by poor coating uniformity. ^ The thesis work uses first principles analysis, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, and experiments to determine the variables that control coating uniformity. The parameters that can potentially affect inter-tablet coating variability and studied in this work are the pan speed, the tablet load, coefficient of friction, and spray zone size and location. The parameters that can potentially affect intra-tablet coating variability and studied in this work are the pan speed, the tablet load, tablet aspect ratio (and sphericity), and the effect of baffles. DEM models used to study intra-tablet coating variability are restricted to simple glued sphere particles instead of modeling true geometric primitives such as cylinders as this requires the implementation of prohibitively difficult contact detection algorithms and development of new force models. ^ The combination of DEM simulations, experiments and analysis provides a comprehensive framework for the understanding of the processes that control coating variability and serves as a platform from which more complex models of coating processes can be developed and implemented. ^ The thesis work investigates inter-tablet coating variability, specifically, tablet residence times within the spray zone. DEM computer simulations, experiments, and analytical investigations are performed to measure the residence time per pass, the circulation time, and appearance frequency of spherical shaped tablets for a range of pan speeds and tablet loads. In addition, the fractional residence time, defined as the ratio of time spent by a tablet in the spray zone to the total coating time, is measured. The average fractional residence time (averaged over all the tablets in the bed) is found to be equal to the ratio of the time-averaged number of tablets exposed to the spray to the total number of tablets in the pan, a result that is consistent with analyses. The average fractional residence time is observed to be independent of pan speed and total coating time. Furthermore, the fractional residence time is shown to be related to the residence time per pass and circulation time per pass. Circulation time per pass for a tablet is defined as the average time between successive appearances in the spray zone and residence time per pass is defined as the average time spent in the spray zone per pass. Appearance frequency is defined as the number of appearances a tablet makes in the spray zone per pan rotation. Simulations and analyses show that appearance frequency decreases with increasing pan speed. These various measures of residence time are all related, but from the standpoint of developing an analytical model for coating variability, fractional residence time is a more useful and intuitive parameter as it determines the fraction of total run time that a tablet spends in the spray. ^ To study the coefficient of variation of the coating mass distribution, the variation in tablet residence times is studied, as both quantities are directly related. The DEM simulations indicate that the coefficient of variation of tablet residence times, and subsequently, of coating mass, decreases with time following a power law relation. The theoretical model demonstrates that the coefficient of variation of residence time for a randomly mixed tablet bed is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of coating “trials. ” DEM simulations show that during each pan revolution, tablets in the spray zone remain in a quasi-segregated state from tablets located outside the spray zone for some time period termed Δ tseg. Increasing the pan’s Froude number (to ensure the tablet bed operates in the well-mixed rolling regime), the spanwise-to-streamwise spray zone aspect ratio, and the tablet-tablet and tablet-pan friction coefficient all act to decrease Δtseg, leading to more uniform residence times and less inter-tablet coating variability for a given operating time.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} that enables in-line analysis of film coating thickness on tablets during a pan coating operation. Real-time measurements were made using a diffusereflectance near-infrared (NIR) probe positioned inside the pan during the coating operation. Real-time spectra of replicate batches {{were used for}} modeling film growth. Univariate analysis provided a simple method for in-line monitoring of the coating process using NIR data. An empirical geometric 2 -vector volumetric growth model was developed, which accounts for differential growth on the face and band regions of <b>biconvex</b> <b>tablets.</b> The thickness of the film coat was determined by monitoring the decrease of absorption bands characteristic of {{a component of the}} tablet core and monitoring the increase of bands characteristic of a component in the coating material. There was good correlation between values estimated from the NIR data and the measured tablet volumetric growth. In-line measurements allow the coating process to be stopped when a predetermined tablet coating thickness is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Chemico-structures {{of shells}} {{representing}} all families presently {{assigned to the}} Linguloidea have undergone significant transformations since the Early Cambrian. Superficial hemispherical to hemi-ellipsoidal pits on the larval and/or mature shells are interpreted as casts of deformable, membrane-bound vesicles of mucus or rigid vesicles of glycoproteins or GAGs with thickened coats. Flat-bottomed, sub-circular imprints characterize acrotheloids and many acrotretides, and could be impressions of <b>biconvex</b> <b>tablets</b> of apatite like those exocytosed within the primary layer of the obolid 'Lingulella'? antiquissima, whilst the rhomboidal imprints of the Paterula shell could have held tablets of proteinaceous silica like those of living discinid larvae. The ancestral fabric of the linguloid secondary layer was probably composed of rubbly and virgose sets, but trellised rods of apatite (baculation) are characteristic of most linguloids and also acrotheloids. This condition was suppressed in shells identified as 'Lingula' from at least the Early Carboniferous to the present day. In early Palaeozoic acrotretides and lingulellotretids, columnar and camerate fabrics evolved in place of baculation. Baculation in Discinisca tenuis and Glottidia pyramidata {{is associated with the}} amino acids glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, arginine and proline which may be components of an organic polymer axial to baculate accretion...|$|R
40|$|For the {{prediction}} {{of the air and}} product temperatures, the product moisture, and the air humidity during a coating process in a Bohle Lab-Coater, a model was developed. The purpose of this work was to determine the limit moisture, the critical moisture, and the constant for the exchange rate between both zones and to use these values for other sets of experiments to test the model. The adaptation of the 3 parameters (limit moisture, critical moisture, and exchange rate constant), was done by calculation of the product temperature in both zones for several sets of parameters in order to minimize the sum of square deviation between the calculated and the measured product temperatures. This set of parameters was used to test the validity of the model. By applying the model, the product temperature could be predicted based on the product, process, and equipment-related parameters. Hence, the model can be used to theoretically investigate the influence of different process paramaters. The mean difference between the predicted, and measured product temperatures in the steady state is ≈ 2 up to 3 K using the determined parameter set for the limit moisture, the critical moisture, and the exchange rate constant. The model is useful for {{the prediction}} of the air and product temperatures, the product moisture, and air humidity during a coating process in the Bohle Lab-Coater using round, <b>biconvex</b> <b>tablets...</b>|$|R
40|$|Using Eudragit (R) E PO (EudrE) as a {{polymethacrylate}} carrier, {{the aim of}} {{the study}} was to develop a pH-independent dosage form containing ibuprofen (IBP) as an active compound via chemical modification of the polymer (i. e. quaternization of amine function) or via the addition of dicarboxylic acids (succinic, glutaric and adipic acid) to create a pH micro-environment during dissolution. <b>Biconvex</b> <b>tablets</b> (diameter: 10 mm; height: 5 mm) were produced via hot melt extrusion and injection molding. In vitro dissolution experiments revealed that a minimum of 25 % of quaternization was sufficient to partially (up to pH 5) eliminate the pH-dependent effect of the EudrE/IBP formulation. The addition of dicarboxylic acids did not alter IBP release in a pH 1 and 3 medium as the dimethyl amino groups of EudrE are already fully protonated, while in a pH 5 solvent IBP release was significantly improved (cf. from 0 % to 92 % release after 1 h dissolution experiments upon the addition of 20 wt. % succinic acid). Hence, both approaches resulted in a pH-independent (up to pH 5) immediate release formulation. However, the presence of a positively charged polymer induced stability issues (recrystallization of API) and the formulations containing dicarboxylic acids were classified as mechanically unstable. Hence, further research is needed to obtain a pH-independent immediate release formulation while using EudrE as a polmethacrylate carrier...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{possibility}} to deliver the acid-sensitive enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP) from calf intestine (CIAP) to the intestinal system by oral administration was investigated. Tablets were prepared and in vitro evaluated. Final proof of concept studies were performed in rats. This acid labile enzyme is potentially useful {{in the treatment of}} sepsis, a serious condition during which endotoxins can migrate into the blood stream. The CIAP was freeze-dried with inulin and subsequently compacted into round <b>biconvex</b> <b>tablets</b> with a diameter of 4 mm and a weight of 25 - 30 mg per tablet. The tablets were coated with an enteric coating in order to ensure their survival in the stomach. In vitro evaluation of tablets containing alkaline phosphatase from bovine intestine (BIAP) was {{the first step in the}} development. It was found that tablets without enteric coating dissolved rapidly in 0. 10 M HCl with total loss of enzymatic activity of the alkaline phosphatase. Tablets that were coated were stable for at least 2 h in 0. 10 M HCl, but dissolved rapidly when the pH was increased to 6. 8. Furthermore, it was shown that the enzymatic activity of the released BIAP was fully preserved. The in vivo test clearly showed that the oral administration of enteric coated tablets resulted in the release of enzymatically active CIAP in the intestinal lumen of rats. The location of the enhanced enzymatic activity of AP in the intestines varied with the time that had passed between the administration of the tablets and the sacrificing of the rats. Also, the level of enzymatic activity increased with an increasing number of tablets that were administered. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the suitability of terahertz (THz) transmission measurements to accurately measure and predict the critical quality attributes of disintegration time and the amount of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dissolved after 15, 20 and 25 min for commercial tablets processed at production scale. Methods Samples of 18 batches of <b>biconvex</b> <b>tablets</b> from a production-scale design of experiments study into exploring the design space of a commercial tablet manufacturing process were used. The tablet production involved the process steps of high-shear wet granulation, fluid-bed drying and subsequent compaction. The 18 batches were produced using a 4 factor split plot design to study the effects of process changes on the disintegration time. Non-destructive and contactless terahertz transmission measurements of the whole tablets without prior sample preparation were performed to measure the effective refractive index and absorption coefficient of 6 tablets per batch. Results The disintegration time (R$^{ 2 }$ = 0. 86) and API dissolved after 15 min (R$^{ 2 }$ = 0. 96) linearly correlates with the effective refractive index, neff, measured at terahertz frequencies. In contrast, no such correlation could be established from conventional hardness measurements. The magnitude of neff represents the optical density of the sample and thus it reflects both changes in tablet porosity as well as granule density. For the absorption coefficient, αeff, we observed a better correlation with dissolution after 20 min (R$^{ 2 }$ = 0. 96) and a weaker correlation with disintegration (R$^{ 2 }$ = 0. 83) compared to neff. Conclusion The measurements of neff and αeff provide promising predictors for the disintegration and dissolution time of tablets. The high penetration power of terahertz radiation makes it possible to sample a significant volume proportion of a tablet without any prior sample preparation. Together with the short measurement time (seconds), the potential to measure content uniformity and the fact that the method requires no chemometric models this technology shows clear promise to be established as a process analyser to non-destructively predict critical quality attributes of tablets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to create a calibration model based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data obtained during a small-scale coating process to predict in-line the coating layer thickness of tablets coated in a side-vented drum coater. The developed setup for the small-scale coating process consisted of a rotating plate with 20 tablets molds that pass a spraying unit, a heating unit, and an in-line NIR spectroscopy probe during one rotation. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) was compressed to flat-faced tablets, and these were coated with a sustained release coating suspension containing Kollicoat IR and Kollicoat SR 30 D. The film thickness of these tablets was determined for each tablet individually with a digital micrometer. A calibration model of predicted film thickness versus real-film thickness using PLS regression was developed. This model was tested against in-line NIR data obtained from a coating drum process, in which <b>biconvex</b> HDPE <b>tablets</b> were film-coated with the same film-coating suspension. The model predicted a final coating thickness of 240 μm, while the measured average thickness (n = 100 tablets) was 210 μm. Taking into account the use of a different setup and differently shaped tablets, it was possible to predict the coating thickness with accuracy comparable to the one of the digital micrometer. Thus, the small-scale rotating plate system was found to be an efficient means of preparing calibration model for a tablet-coating drum process...|$|R
