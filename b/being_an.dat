40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between familial, educational, and psychosocial factors and bullying among 702 North American Indigenous adolescents aged 11 – 14 years. The study used multinomial logistic regression models to differentiate correlates of bully perpetration and victimization versus being neither and between <b>being</b> <b>a</b> perpetrator versus <b>being</b> <b>a</b> victim. Analyses reveal that <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bully victim had different correlates than <b>being</b> <b>a</b> perpetrator. Perceived discrimination was associated with increased odds of <b>being</b> either <b>a</b> victim or a perpetrator, relative to being neither. Several factors differentiated <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bully perpetrator from <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bully victim: adolescent age, parental warmth and support, depressive symptoms, anger, and school adjustment. These findings expand upon the limited understanding of the factors associated with bullying among North American Indigenous youth. Bullying intervention and prevention programs that target Indigenous adolescents should be culturally grounded and begin early within the family...|$|R
