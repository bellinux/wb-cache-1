The harbour was reached through the Fowey estuary, which the local town had protected in the previous century with two blockhouses positioned along the river's edge—the Fowey and Polruan blockhouses—and a <b>boom</b> <b>chain</b> strung between them. The new castle replaced these and was located high on the headland overlooking {{the entrance to the}} estuary itself, St Catherine's Point, from which it took its name.|$|E

The city was surrounded by sea and land; the fleet {{at the entrance of}} the Bosphorus stretched from shore to shore {{in the form of a}} crescent, to intercept or repel any assistance for Constantinople from the sea. In early April, the Siege of Constantinople began. At first, the city's walls held off the Turks, even though Mehmed's army used the new bombard designed by Orban, a giant cannon similar to the Dardanelles Gun. The harbor of the Golden Horn was blocked by a <b>boom</b> <b>chain</b> and defended by twenty-eight warships.|$|E

50|$|A boom or a chain (also boom defence, harbour chain, river chain, chain boom, <b>boom</b> <b>chain</b> or variants) is an {{obstacle}} strung across a navigable stretch {{of water to}} control or block navigation. Booms could be military in nature, {{with the goal of}} denying access to an enemy's ships; a modern example is the anti-submarine net. Booms could also be used, especially along rivers, to force passing vessels to pay a toll.|$|E

50|$|Two strong fortresses {{defended the}} {{entrance}} channel; {{on the north}} side of the channel stood the very strong Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro (known in English as Morro Castle) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. The south side was defended by the Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta. The channel could also be blocked by a <b>boom</b> <b>chain</b> extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall 5 km long. Havana was considered impregnable, and hadn't been taken since the French pirates in the 16th century.|$|E

50|$|Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, the {{companion}} and standard bearer of Muhammad, had {{died during the}} first Siege of Constantinople (674-78). As Mehmed II's army approached Constantinople, Mehmed's sheikh Akshamsaddin discovered the tomb of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. After the conquest, Mehmed built Eyüp Sultan Mosque at the site to {{emphasize the importance of}} the conquest to the Islamic world and highlight his role as ghazi. In 1453 Mehmed commenced the siege of Constantinople with an army between 80,000 and 200,000 troops, an artillery train of over seventy large field pieces, and a navy of 320 vessels, the bulk of them transports and storeships.

50|$|<b>Booms</b> or <b>chains</b> {{could be}} {{broken by a}} {{sufficiently}} large or heavy ship, and this occurred on many occasions, including the Siege of Damietta, the Raid on the Medway and the Battle of Vigo Bay. Frequently, however, attackers instead seized the defences and cut the <b>chain</b> or <b>boom</b> by more conventional methods. The boom at the siege of Londonderry, for example, was cut by sailors in a longboat.|$|R
60|$|Burgoyne's {{measures}} were prompt.

5000|$|Burton's {{description}} of the <b>chain</b> <b>boom</b> was:The <b>chain,</b> which consisted of seven twisted together, passed diagonally through a kind of brick tunnel. On this side the River Paraguay it was made fast to a windlass supported by a house about 100 yards from the bank. Nearer the battery stood a still larger capstan: the latter, however, wanted force to haul tight the chain. [...] This was so provided an enemy destroyed the chain's intermediate floating supports; for as explained by Thompson, the chains weresupported {{on a number of}} canoes, and on three pontoons. [...] The Brazilian ironclads fired for three months at these pontoons and canoes, sinking all of them, when, of course, the chain went to the bottom, as the river there is about 700 yards wide, and the chain could not be drawn tight without intermediate supports. The chain was thus buried some two feet under the mud of the river, offering no obstacle whatever to the navigation.|$|R
60|$|The {{important}} {{command of}} the Hudson being declined by Arnold was now given to Putnam, who repaired forthwith to Peekskill. He set about promptly to carry into effect the measures of security which Greene and Knox had recommended; especially the <b>boom</b> and <b>chain</b> at Fort Montgomery, about which General George Clinton had busied himself. A {{large part of the}} New York and New England troops were stationed at this post, not merely to guard the Hudson, but to render aid either to the Eastern or Middle States in case of exigency.|$|R
5000|$|There were alternative, if heroic, {{methods of}} {{severing}} a <b>chain</b> <b>boom.</b> Sending out a party under the defending guns {{to cut it}} with a cold chisel was one. [...] Seizing the chain house or blowing it up with gunpowder were others. Both methods were urged upon the Brazilians by General Mitre but were not attempted.|$|R
50|$|He {{became an}} ally of Gráinne Ní Mháille. Together they {{prevented}} unwanted intruders from entering the surrounding waters, or they used the natural harbour as a trap to attack and loot those ships with valuable cargo on board. They succeeded by stretching a <b>chain</b> <b>boom</b> across the harbour entrance from the castle at the harbour to Scealp na gCat at the opposite end.|$|R
500|$|When López I built Humaitá all {{warships}} {{were made}} of wood, and steamships were mostly paddle-driven. [...] Wooden paddle-steamers, if intending to proceed into Paraguay, {{would have had to}} steam, against the current, past the succession of batteries – where the range was [...] or less – and somehow cut through the <b>boom</b> of twisted <b>chains,</b> without being sunk: this appeared to be impossible.|$|R
50|$|Grain Tower, about {{a quarter}} of a mile {{off-shore}} and accessible at low tide, originated about the same time as the main fort. Later additions, consisting of concrete emplacements and shelters, were added during the World Wars, and the tower was used as a boom control point. The <b>boom</b> was a <b>chain</b> supporting a huge antisubmarine net across the two rivers, preventing entry by German U-boats.|$|R

Jourdan (1838-1900) of the engineering corps of the Brazilian army.|$|R
5000|$|The {{curve and}} narrowness {{of the river}} here made it a {{suitable}} place to construct forts for the defence of London against foreign invaders. The first permanent fort at Tilbury was a D-shaped blockhouse built in 1539 by Henry VIII and initially called the [...] "Thermitage Bulwark", because {{it was on the}} site of a hermitage dissolved in 1536. The Tilbury blockhouse was designed to cross-fire with a similar structure at New Tavern, Gravesend. During the Armada campaign (1588), the fort was reinforced with earthworks and a palisade, and a <b>boom</b> of <b>chains,</b> ships' masts and cables was stretched across the Thames to Gravesend, anchored by lighters. The fort was rebuilt under Charles I and is now owned by English Heritage.|$|R
50|$|From a naval {{perspective}} {{the heavy}} guns of the fortress might — in principle — be bypassed by the latest ironclads (armoured vessels), provided the <b>chain</b> <b>boom</b> could be cut. But those vessels {{could not have}} operated ahead of their forward bases for long, because {{they would need to}} be resupplied with fuel, ammunition and provisions. Furthermore, the Brazilian navy command claimed there was no room inside the ironclads for the conveyance of troops; the wooden transport vessels could not have accompanied them.|$|R

The most significant and successful was the Great Chain, constructed from West Point in 1778, and used through 1782 after the war's end. The huge links for the chains were forged at iron works in Orange County, New York.|$|R
