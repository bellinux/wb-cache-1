40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of some lactobacilli on body growth and on the metabolic-nutritional status in growing goat kids. Twenty growing Maltese goat kids (10 Control and 10 <b>Bios)</b> were studied. The animals of the <b>Bios</b> group received a concentrate including 1  g*kg- 1 of SEB Bovino® (spray-dried), Akron S. r. l., Italy, with non bacterial components: gum arabic, soybean meal, silicate alum of magnesium, and with bacterial components: 1011 cfu*kg- 1 each of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus reuteri. Monthly, bio-metric and weight evaluations were carried out on each animal and individual blood samples were taken. The <b>Bios</b> group showed the highest body weight (Control 19 vs. <b>Bios</b> 23 kg P < 0. 001), anamorphosis (Control 71 vs. <b>Bios</b> 78 P < 0. 05) and body proportion (Control 35 vs. <b>Bios</b> 41 P < 0. 001) indices; the lowest levels of Non Esterified Fatty Acids (Control 0. 778 vs. <b>Bios</b> 0. 403 mmol*L- 1 P < 0. 001), triglycerides (Control 0. 21 vs. <b>Bios</b> 0. 18 mmol*L- 1 P < 0. 05), urea (Control 8. 83 vs. <b>Bios</b> 7. 65  mmol*L- 1 P < 0. 05) and the highest levels of Alkaline Phosphatase (Control 270 vs. <b>Bios</b> 851  U*L- 1 P < 0. 01) and Creatine Kinase (Control 173 vs. <b>Bios</b> 285 U*L- 1 P < 0. 01). The results testify to the better metabolic activity of the <b>Bios</b> group which achieved, at the end of the trial (7  months old), about 99 % of the morphological development of the adult, therefore an adequate structure for mating and going into production within the first year of life...|$|R

40|$|The yeast growth {{stimulant}} produced during {{the growth of}} Aspergillus niger on sucrose media {{was found to be}} similar to that obtained from the extract of malt sprouts. <b>Bios</b> II prepared from the mold-produced stimulant by means of alcoholic barium hydroxide and <b>Bios</b> II from malt sprouts had similar effects upon the growth of yeast. The results obtained by Schopmeyer (1931), to the contrary, may be explained on the difference in the media and the yeast employed;The importance of magnesium sulfate in media used in <b>bios</b> studies was emphasized. The effect of the concentration of magnesium sulfate upon the growth of various strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of <b>Bios</b> II and inositol was determined. With all the strains studied, the addition of magnesium sulfate to Medium C increased the stimulative effect of <b>Bios</b> II and inositol;The effect of inositol upon the stimulation of yeast growth by <b>Bios</b> II was studied. The complementary effect of inositol is dependent upon the strain of yeast employed, and upon the concentration of magnesium sulfate. In the absence of inositol the higher concentrations of magnesium sulfate are toxic toward certain strains of yeast. In such cases the addition of inositol gave large increase in growth;Twenty strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied in regard to growth in the presence of inositol, <b>Bios</b> II, and magnesium sulfate. The strains were divided into four groups according to their reactions to various combinations of the three substances;Photomicrographs were made of four different strains to show the ability of inositol to reduce the clumping of cells;Comparison was made of the growth of various strains of yeast in the media of Clark, Williams, and Fulmer {{in order to determine the}} suitability of each for use in <b>bios</b> studies...|$|R
