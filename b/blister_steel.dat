25|$|Two {{decades before}} the Industrial Revolution an {{improvement}} {{was made in}} the production of steel, which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do, such as for cutting edge tools and for springs.

50|$|Huntsman experimented {{in steel}} manufacture, first at Doncaster. Then in 1740 {{he moved to}} Handsworth, near Sheffield. Eventually, after many experiments, Huntsman {{was able to make}} {{satisfactory}} cast steel, in clay pot crucibles, each holding about 34 pounds of <b>blistered</b> <b>steel.</b> A flux was added, and they were covered and heated by means of coke for about three hours. The molten steel was then poured into moulds and the crucibles reused. The local cutlery manufacturers refused to buy Huntsman's cast steel, as it was harder than the German steel they were accustomed to using. For a long time Huntsman exported his whole output to France.|$|R

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1800s, the Lackawanna Valley in Pennsylvania was rich in anthracite coal and iron deposits. Brothers George W. Scranton and Seldon T. Scranton moved to the valley in 1840 and settled in the five-house town of Slocum's Hollow (now Scranton) to establish an iron forge.

25|$|This is now done {{by forcing}} a jet of {{high-pressure}} oxygen into a special rotating container containing the pig iron. Some {{of the carbon}} is oxidised into carbon monoxide, CO, and carbon dioxide, CO2. This also oxidizes impurities in the pig iron. The container is rotated and the processed pig iron can {{be separated from the}} oxidised impurities. Before the mid 19th century, pig iron from the blast furnace was made into wrought iron, which is commercially pure iron. At that period, if steel was needed, particularly pure varieties of iron were heated with charcoal in a cementation furnace to produce <b>blister</b> <b>steel</b> (with about 1-2% carbon). This might be further purified using the crucible technique, but steel was too expensive to use on a large scale. However, with the introduction of the Bessemer process in the late 1850s and then other processes, the production of steel was dramatically increased. By the late 19th century most iron was being converted to steel before use.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, the English {{steelmakers}} produced <b>blister</b> and crucible <b>steel</b> which required specialized equipment like finery forges and puddling furnaces and cost over £50 per long ton.

The Mount Savage Iron Works in Maryland was {{the largest in the}} United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for the construction of railroads. In the 1850s, American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that air blown through the molten iron increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag. The Kelly-Bessemer process, because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.|$|R
40|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} that hydrogen produced by corrosion, radiolysis, and decomposition {{of the waste}} could cause embrittlement of the carbon steel waste tanks at Hanford. The concern centers on the supposition that the hydrogen evolved {{in many of the}} existing tanks might penetrate the steel wall of the tank and cause embrittlement that might lead to catastrophic failure. This document reviews literature on the effects of hydrogen on the carbon steel proposed for use in the Multi-Function Waste Tank Facility for the time periods before and during construction {{as well as for the}} operational life of the tanks. The document draws several conclusions about these effects. Molecular hydrogen is not a concern because it is not capable of entering the steel tank wall. Nascent hydrogen produced by corrosion reactions will not embrittle the steel because the mild steel used in tank construction is not hard enough to be susceptible to hydrogen stress cracking and the corrosion product hydrogen is not produced at a rate sufficient to cause either loss in tensile ductility or <b>blistering.</b> If the <b>steel</b> intended for use in the tanks is produced to current technology, fabricated in accordance with good construction practice, postweld heat treated, and operated within the operating limits defined, hydrogen will not adversely affect the carbon steel tanks during their 50 -year design life. 26 refs...|$|R

50|$|Depending on the {{thickness}} of the iron bars, the pots were then heated from below for a week or more. Bars were regularly examined and when the correct condition was reached the heat was withdrawn and the pots were left until cool—usually around fourteen days. The iron had gained a little over 1% in mass from the carbon in the charcoal, and had become heterogeneous bars of <b>blister</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before the Bessemer process, Western Europe and the United States {{relied on}} the {{puddling}} process to reduce the carbon content of white cast iron (refined pig iron), converting it to wrought iron. It was possible to make low-quality puddled steel, but the process was difficult to control and quality varied. High-quality steel {{was made by the}} reverse process of adding carbon to carbon-free wrought iron, usually imported from Sweden. The manufacturing process, called the cementation process, consisted of heating bars of wrought iron together with charcoal for periods of up to a week in a long stone box. This produced <b>blister</b> <b>steel.</b> The <b>blister</b> <b>steel</b> was put in a crucible with wrought iron and melted, producing crucible steel. Up to 3 tons of expensive coke was burnt for each ton of steel produced. Such steel when rolled into bars was sold at £50 to £60 (approximately £3,390 to £4,070 in 2008) a long ton. The most difficult and work-intensive part of the process, however, was the production of wrought iron done in finery forges in Sweden.|$|E

5000|$|Faggoting or faggoting and folding is a {{metalworking}} {{technique used}} in the smelting and forging of wrought iron, <b>blister</b> <b>steel,</b> and other steel. Faggoting is {{a process in which}} rods or bars of iron and/or steel are gathered (like a bundle of sticks or [...] "faggot") and forge welded together. The faggot would then be drawn out lengthwise. The bar might then be broken and the pieces made into a faggot again or folded over, and forge welded again.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blister</b> <b>steel</b> {{that has}} been faggoted was known as shear steel; if faggoted twice, as double shear steel, if faggoted three times It was known as triple shear steel.

50|$|While {{the use of}} iron {{started to}} become more {{widespread}} around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal was much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of <b>blister</b> <b>steel</b> during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal {{for long periods of}} time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting <b>blister</b> <b>steel</b> in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.|$|E

50|$|Dannemora is the {{location}} of an important iron ore mine, the Dannemora mine, which {{formed the basis of}} the iron industry in Uppland. It provided the raw material for about 20 finery forges that produced bar iron for export. In England, iron produced from Dannemora ore, was known as oregrounds iron, after the port town of Öregrund. Bar iron from these forges was considered the best raw material for producing <b>blister</b> <b>steel</b> by the cementation process, owing mainly to the extremely low levels of sulphur and phosphorus in the ores but also to the relatively high manganese content.|$|E

50|$|The Dannemora mine at Dannemora, Sweden {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} iron ore mines in Sweden. The mine was closed by its owners SSAB in 1992. It may have been open since the 13th century, but the first documentary reference was in 1481. The mine supplied all the ironworks making oregrounds iron by the Walloon process (using a blast furnace and finery forge), such as Österby and Leufsta (now Lövsta). Their products were particularly pure iron, due the manganese content of the iron ore. This made it the best material for conversion to <b>blister</b> <b>steel,</b> the main variety of steel made in Great Britain between the 1610s and the 1850s. The mine has a depth of 640 metres.|$|E
50|$|This {{process was}} refined in the 18th century with the {{introduction}} of Benjamin Huntsman's crucible steel-making techniques, which added an additional three hours firing time and required additional large quantities of coke. In making crucible steel, the <b>blister</b> <b>steel</b> bars were broken into pieces and melted in small crucibles, each containing 20 kg or so. This produced higher quality crucible steel but increased the cost. The Bessemer process reduced the time needed to make steel of this quality to about half an hour while requiring only the coke needed initially to melt the pig iron. The earliest Bessemer converters produced steel for £7 a long ton, although it initially sold for around £40 a ton.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} and hardness of iron increases with {{the concentration of}} phosphorus. 0.05% phosphorus in wrought iron makes it as hard as medium carbon steel. High phosphorus iron can also be hardened by cold hammering. The hardening effect is true for any concentration of phosphorus. The more phosphorus, the harder the iron becomes and the more it can be hardened by hammering. Modern steel makers can increase hardness {{by as much as}} 30%, without sacrificing shock resistance by maintaining phosphorus levels between 0.07 and 0.12%. It also increases the depth of hardening due to quenching, {{but at the same time}} also decreases the solubility of carbon in iron at high temperatures. This would decrease its usefulness in making <b>blister</b> <b>steel</b> (cementation), where the speed and amount of carbon absorption is the overriding consideration.|$|E
