50|$|SHORAN, which {{operates}} at 300 MHz, requires an airborne AN/APN-3 set and two AN/CPN-2 or 2A ground stations. The {{equipment on board}} the aircraft includes a transmitter, a receiver, an operator's console and a K-1A model <b>bombing</b> <b>computer.</b> The transmitter sends pulses {{to one of the}} ground stations and the system calculates the range in statute miles by clocking the elapsed time between transmitter pulse and the returned signal. The system was intended for use in navigation, but it became obvious that it would work well for blind targeting during bombing runs in poor visibility. The setup made up of the K-1A <b>bombing</b> <b>computer</b> combined with the navigation system was the first SHORAN. The SHORAN system is designed so that as the aircraft faces the target, the low-frequency station should be on the left, and the high-frequency station is on the right. This allows the computer to triangulate the two stations and the target.|$|E

Green Satin made highly accurate and completely automatic measurements of wind speed and direction, allowing the NBC to perform dead reckoning calculations with a very high degree of accuracy. This further automated the navigation process to the point where separate navigators and bomb aimers were no longer needed, and some aircraft were designed with a crew of only two.|$|E

The most important bombers used in World War I were the French Breguet 14, British de Havilland DH-4, German Albatros C.III and Russian Sikorsky Ilya Muromets. The Russian Sikorsky Ilya Muromets, was the first four-engine bomber to equip a dedicated strategic bombing unit during World War I. This heavy bomber was unrivaled in the early stages of the war, as the Central Powers had no comparable aircraft until much later.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the start}} of the Vietnam War, a new {{computerized}} bombing predictor, called the Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), began to be integrated into the systems of aircraft equipped to carry nuclear armaments. This new <b>bomb</b> <b>computer</b> was revolutionary in that the release command for the bomb was given by the computer, not the pilot; the pilot designated the target using the radar or other targeting system, then [...] "consented" [...] to release the weapon, and the computer then did so at a calculated [...] "release point" [...] some seconds later. This is very different from previous systems, which, though they had also become computerized, still calculated an [...] "impact point" [...] showing where the bomb would fall if the bomb were released at that moment. The key advantage is that the weapon can be released accurately even when the plane is maneuvering. Most bombsights until this time required that the plane maintain a constant attitude (usually level), though dive-bombing sights were also common.|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the intense}} pilot {{workload}} involved with flying and entering {{the window of}} opportunity, some aircraft are equipped with a “Toss Bomb Computer” (in US nuclear delivery, {{a part of the}} Low Altitude Bombing System) that enables the pilot to release the bomb at the correct angle. The Toss <b>Bomb</b> <b>Computer</b> takes airspeed inputs from the aircraft’s pitot system, altitude inputs from the static system, attitude inputs from the gyroscopic system and inputs from weapons selectors signifying the type of bomb to calculate the appropriate release point of the ordnance. Instead of triggering the release directly, the pilot instead [...] "consents" [...] to release the weapon, then begins a steady climb. The computer then calculates the desired ballistic path, and when that path will be produced by the current aircraft attitude and airspeed, the <b>computer</b> releases the <b>bomb.</b> During the Second World War the engineers Erik Wilkenson and Torsten Faxén at Saab developed the first bomb sight for toss bombing. It was a mechanical computer that did the necessary calculations. It was first used in the Saab 17 and was standard on all Saab fighters up to and including Saab 32 Lansen. It was also sold to France, Switzerland, Denmark and USA and was used in for instance the Boeing B-47 Stratojet.|$|R

40|$|The 1964 / 65 New York World 2 ̆ 7 s Fair was {{the site}} of the first major public {{presentation}} of Pop art. These appeared on the exterior of the New York State Pavilion designed by Philip Johnson, who commissioned ten works from contemporary artists, including four from Pop artists Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, and Robert Indiana. With the exception of the censorship of Warhol 2 ̆ 7 s Thirteen Most Wanted Men, little {{attention has been paid to}} Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s enterprise within the historical context of the Fair. This dissertation addresses the issue of context by examining how Fair officials, the art world, and fairgoers responded to Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s architecture and exhibition. Examining the world 2 ̆ 7 s fair as a venue for the exhibition of art for the mainstream public, this project pays careful attention to Fair President Robert Moses, whose free-market attitude enabled exhibitors to present a broad spectrum of art. This dissertation also examines Philip Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s role as architect of a highly popular building, as well as curator of an extramural exhibition of contemporary art that fairgoers largely overlooked. Moses and Johnson represent the split between elite and mainstream culture that had informed critical debates about art since the late nineteenth century. Moses advocated art for the masses, while Johnson proposed a heroic role for avant-garde art within the public sphere at a time when the art world 2 ̆ 7 s activities seemed increasingly irrelevant to the mainstream public. The Fair immersed Pop art in an environment focused on technology, entertainment, and consumption, rather than on art-world politics. At a time when many feared that automation, the <b>bomb,</b> <b>computers,</b> and other newly developed mechanical entities on display at the Fair challenged human intellectual and creative primacy, Pop failed to affirm human capabilities because it embraced mechanization [...] -particularly the use of commercial art techniques [...] -and established new relationships among the artist, the audience, and the art that owed more to the factory than the studio. Despite this inauspicious introduction, mainstream culture rapidly assimilated Pop, making it the defining art movement of the 1960 s. ...|$|R

25|$|The Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), or toss bombing, tactic {{was first}} made public {{in front of}} a crowd of 3,000 {{including}} 11 state governors on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B–47 Stratojet entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a half loop, releasing its <b>bomb</b> under <b>computer</b> control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target. The development of this system at Eglin dated to at least mid-1955 under Project Back Breaker. The unintended consequence of this tactic would be a series of crashes by B-47s in early 1958 caused by stress-induced cracks which caused the bombers to shed their wings. A fleet-wide inspection and repair program known as Milk Bottle was begun in May 1958 which led to no fewer than nine Technical Orders, with most aircraft cycled through the program by October 1958.|$|R

With this purpose in mind a system called IDENTIFIED is being developed {{to assist with the}} task of software forensics which is the use of software code authorship analysis for legal or official purposes. IDENTIFIED uses combinations of wildcards and special characters to define count-based metrics, allows for hierarchical metametric definitions, automates much of the file handling task, extracts metric values from source code, and assists with the analysis and modelling processes.

40|$|In modern {{computer}} video games, {{the quality}} of artificial characters plays {{a prominent role in}} the success of the game in the market. The aim of intelligent techniques, termed game AI, used in these games is to provide an interesting and challenging game play to a game player. Being highly sophisticated, these games present game developers with similar kind of requirements and challenges as faced by academic AI community. The game companies claim to use sophisticated game AI to model artificial characters such as computer game bots, intelligent realistic AI agents. However, these bots work via simple routines pre-programmed to suit the game map, game rules, game type, and other parameters unique to each game. Mostly, illusive intelligent behaviors are programmed using simple conditional statements and are hard-coded in the bots 2 ̆ 7 logic. Moreover, a game programmer has to spend considerable time configuring crisp inputs for these conditional statements. Therefore, we realize a need for machine learning techniques to dynamically improve bots 2 ̆ 7 behavior and save precious computer programmers 2 ̆ 7 man-hours. So, we selected Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to evolve dynamic intelligent bots, as it is a simple, efficient, and online learning algorithm. Machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning are know to be intractable if they use a detailed model of the world, and also requires tuning of various parameters to give satisfactory performance. Therefore, for this research we opt to examine Q-learning for evolving a few basic behaviors viz. learning to fight, and planting the <b>bomb</b> for <b>computer</b> game bots. Furthermore, we experimented on how bots would use knowledge learned from abstract models to evolve its behavior in more detailed model of the world. Bots evolved using these techniques would become more pragmatic, believable and capable of showing human-like behavior. This will provide more realistic feel to the game and provide game programmers with an efficient learning technique for programming these bots...|$|R

[...] The primary modification for the AN/MSQ-77 was the control equipment for aircraft guidance (ballistic computer, guidance/release circuitry, and UHF command equipment). The central also had an added beacon tracking capability used when the aircraft had a receiver/transmitter (e.g., Motorola SST-181 X Band Beacon Transponder)http://www.1stcombatevaluationgroup.com/1CEVG_skyspot_history.PDF to increase the range so the radar site could be located farther from the hostile region of bombing targets. Beacon track upgrades included radar circuitry to switch the heterodyne receiver to demodulate the transponder frequency, compensation for the transponder delay, and modification of the central's plotting board circuitry to allow display for increased ranges. The plots were of tracks calculated by the computer's Aircraft Coordinates and Plotting Group which converted radar spherical data to plotting board cartesian coordinates (non-inertial east, north, up coordinate system) using sine/cosine voltages and radar-estimated range respectively from the Antenna Group (azimuth/elevation resolvers) and from the Track Range Computer.
