Axillary vein approach seems to be a favourable technique not only for the prevention of acute complications but also to reduce lead failure including <b>lead</b> <b>insulation</b> and <b>lead</b> fracture prevention with a consequently better long-term lead survival compared with the classical subclavian approach.

The specific polymers of interest were PIBS, 10 % 55 D polyurethane, 10 % 75 D polyurethane, 10 %PP, and a silicone control. Based on the bonding shear strength results of the initial screening, the best performing combinations were artificially aged to simulate their resistance to degradation in vivo. Each combination was subjected to both 3 % hydrogen peroxide and Phosphate Buffered Saline solutions for a period of 8 weeks to test for oxidative and hydrolytic stability. Bonding shear strengths for all sample groups were tested at each 2 -week period. The 10 % 55 D sample group had the highest mean bonding shear strength at. 5602 MPa, but to observe the aging stability of all sample groups, all combinations were used in Phase II. The phosphate buffered saline solution in Phase II caused no significant decrease in bonding shear strength for all sample groups. Alternatively, oxidation caused by the 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution did significantly affect the bonding shear strengths of all sample groups (minus the silicone control). Over the 8 -week period PIBS degraded 28 % and 10 % 55 D and 10 % 75 D decreased 40. 0 % and 30. 8 %, respectively. 10 %PP degraded 32. 0 % and the silicone control remained relatively unchanged...|$|R

40|$|Polymers used in implantable devices, {{although}} relatively unreactive, may degrade in vivo through unknown mechanisms. For example, polyetherurethane elastomers used as {{cardiac pacemaker}} <b>lead</b> <b>insulation</b> have developed surface defects after implantation. This phenomenon, termed "environmental stress cracking," requires intimate contact between polymer and host phagocytic cells, suggesting that phagocyte-generated oxidants might be involved. Indeed, brief exposure of polyetherurethane to activated human neutrophils, hypochlorous acid, or peroxynitrite produces modifications of the polymer {{similar to those}} found in vivo. Damage to the polymer appears to arise predominantly from oxidation of the urethane-aliphatic ester and aliphatic ether groups. There are substantial increases in the solid phase surface oxygen content of samples treated with hypochlorous acid, peroxynitrite or activated human neutrophils, resembling those observed in explanted polyetherurethane. Furthermore, both explanted and hypochlorous acid-treated polyetherurethane show marked reductions in polymer molecular weight. Interestingly, hypochlorous acid and peroxynitrite appear to attack polyetherurethane at different sites. Hypochlorous acid or activated neutrophils cause decreases in the urethane-aliphatic ester stretch peak relative to the aliphatic ether stretch peak (as determined by infrared spectroscopy) whereas peroxynitrite causes selective loss of the aliphatic ether. In vivo degradation may involve both hypohalous and nitric oxide-based oxidants because, after long-term implantation, both stretch peaks are diminished. These results suggest that in vivo destruction of implanted polyetherurethane involves attack by phagocyte-derived oxidants...|$|R

40|$|Achieving an {{in-depth}} {{understanding of the}} behaviour of low cemented formations such as running sands around a cylindrical borehole is of significant importance in identifying stability problems, designing adequate borehole supports and choosing an efficient drilling method. This paper presents numerical investigations on failure modes of unsupported vertical cylindrical boreholes drilled through weak formations, i. e. low cemented sands where the movement of individual grains is not restricted by sufficient cementation. Distinct element method (DEM) was used for this study. The method enables to simulate sand grains and control normal and shear bonding between them. To simulate actual condition surrounding a borehole {{at a depth of}} 80 m, a 2 m x 2 m x 2 m cube made up of spherical particles with diameters ranging from 5 mm to 70 mm was constructed and analysed in the DEM code, PFC 3 D. The results showed that stress concentration developed in the ground due to the presence of a <b>borehole</b> <b>leads</b> to the formation of a damage zone around that borehole. When there is not sufficient bonding between the sand grains, the interaction between them results in their movement towards the borehole and the eventual collapse of the borehole wall. The effect of fluid flow on stability of boreholes has been studied as well. The cementation between sand grains is mainly caused by the presence of clay particles in the formation. The bonding strength between sand grains is an intrinsic or micro property of the bonding material and is very difficult to measure in laboratory conditions. The results obtained from current research will help to evaluate the effect of particle bonding on the mechanical behaviour of low cemented formations and develop methods to assess borehole stability during and after drilling through such formations.

Despite the high prevalence of epicardial lead–based implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, their long-term performance is unknown, and appropriate follow-up has not been established. Methods. The study group comprised all patients in whom an epicardial lead system was implanted at the Mayo Clinic between October 31, 1984 and November 3, 1994. The number of lead fractures and leads with fluid within the insulation and the mode of presentation were determined retrospectively by review of patient visits, radiographs of lead systems and data derived from formal lead testing. Results. At 4 years, the survival rate free of lead malfunction, using formal lead testing, for 160 Medtronic epicardial patches (models 6897 and 6921) was 72 % compared with 92. 5 % for the 179 Cardiac Pacemaker, Inc. (CPI) patches (models 0040 and 0041) (p = 0. 01). In addition, five Medtronic patches in three patients had fluid within the <b>lead</b> <b>insulation</b> but no obvious fracture. No CPI patches had fluid identified within the leads. Of 330 Medtronic epicardial pace/sense leads (model 6917), the 4 -year survival rate free of lead malfunction as assessed by lead testing was 96 %. In all, 19 presentations of lead malfunction were found in 17 patients (2 patients had more than one lead fracture at different times). In 11 (58 %) of these presentations, the patients were asymptomatic despite the presence of obvious lead fracture. Conclusions. Epicardial lead malfunction is common on long-term follow-up, and some leads have a failure rate of 28 % at 4 years. Many patients with fractured leads remain asymptomatic, despite involvement of multiple leads in some cases. Therefore, consideration should be given to regular periodic lead testing in addition to routine X-ray examination, as asymptomatic lead malfunction can present with normal chest X-ray findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis was to, {{by the use of}} nanotechnology, improve {{material}} properties of the biomedical polymer Optim™, used as the <b>insulation</b> of pacemaker <b>leads.</b> Improved material properties are required to reduce the extent of fibrous encapsulation of the leads. Today, laser ablation is {{used to be able to}} remove the pacemaker lead because of the fibrous tissue, which can cause the lead to adhere to vascular structures. Consequently, the laser ablation results in risks of damaging cardiovascular structures. Moreover, improved material properties are needed to reduce the friction at the surface and enhance the wear resistance. Large wearing occurs between the lead and the titanium pacemaker shell as well as lead against lead and the wearing can result in a damaged insulation, which in turn might result in removal of the device. To achieve these improved material properties a hierarchically micro- and nanostructured and superhydrophobic surface was fabricated and to enhance the wear resistance, nanocomposites with 1 wt % and 5 wt % added hydroxyapatite nanoparticles were fabricated. The surface structures were fabricated via hot embossing and plasma treatment and were characterised with atomic force microscopy, environment scanning electron microscopy and with contact angle measurements. To evaluate the biological response to the surfaces, adsorption of radioisotope labelled human serum albumin proteins and adhesion of the human fibroblast cell line MRC- 5 were studied. The results show that a superhydrophobic surface, with contact angle as high as 170. 0 ± 0. 4 °, can be fabricated via hierarchically micro- and nanostructures on an Optim™ surface. The fabricated surface is more protein resistant and cell resistant compared to a smooth surface. The nanocomposites fabricated, especially the one with 5 wt % nanoparticles added, show an enhanced abrasive wear resistance compared to Optim™ without added nanoparticles. In conclusion, a hierarchically micro- and nanostructured superhydrophobic surface of the pacemaker lead seems promising for reducing the extent of fibrous encapsulation and by fabricating a nanocomposite, the abrasive wear damage of the <b>lead</b> <b>insulation</b> can be reduced...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the GTS-LCS project (Grimsel Test Site – Long-Term Cement Studies), an in-situ experiment lasting about 5 years was started in 2009 to study water-cement-rock interactions in fractured granite. A solid cement source (OPC) was installed in a borehole intersecting a water conducting fracture. Two other boreholes at about 0. 56 m (observation) and 1. 12 m (extraction) from the emplacement borehole were used to monitor the evolution of water composition in the fracture. Prior to the experiment, a tracer test was performed to characterize the initial flow and transport properties of the rock around the experimental boreholes. The flow and reactive transport calculations have been performed using the Retraso-CodeBright code. Solute transport is assumed to be controlled by diffusion in the cement and by advection-dispersion in the rock fracture. Initially, the flow model calculated from the results of the pre-emplacement tracer test, assuming a homogeneous fracture, was used to model reactive transport after emplacement of the cement. Since the small grid size from the flow model led to excessive computational times, the domain was divided into (a) a 1 D radial model for the emplacement borehole and a small volume of rock around it, and (b) a 2 D model {{for the rest of the}} domain. The results from (a) were used as input for (b). The model results show dissolution of portlandite and C-S-H in a thin (mm) external layer of the cement (emplacement borehole). In the rock fracture there is dissolution of the primary silicates (except phlogopite) and precipitation of C-S-H, C-A-S-H and calcite. Fracture porosity is reduced in a belt around the 3 boreholes, converging at the extraction borehole (due to the magnitude of the extraction flow rate). The decrease in porosity, due mainly to the precipitation of calcite, is stronger right next to the extraction borehole, due to the more favorable mixing conditions between Grimsel groundwater and cement porewater.

The name “polyurethane” describes a class of polymers that can be synthesized to possess a variety of properties, from hard to brittle to very elastic. The polyurethanes that have found use in biomedical applications have elastomeric properties accompanied by good toughness, tear resistance and abrasion resistance. They {{have been widely used}} in application such as the artificial heard and pacemaker <b>lead</b> <b>insulation,</b> among others. The role of polyurethane’s surface in the blood-material interaction will be described. Surface properties believed to affect biocompatibility include the interrelated properties of hydrophobicity, polarity and surface charge. The presence and mobility of microdomain surface morphologies may also affect protein adsorption and thrombus formation. In an attempt to use polyurethanes in more demanding applications, we have been modifying their structure to include functional groups, which have the potential to exhibit bioactivity. Polyurethanes containing sulfonate groups exhibit hydrogel and anticoagulant behavior compared to unmodified polyurethanes. The sulfonated polyurethanes affect the ability of fibrinogen to polymerize and they consume thrombin, an important enzyme in the coagulation pathway. Progress in understanding the interactions of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide sequence and integrins has stimulated a great deal of interest in the development of novel biomaterials, which may improve endothelial cell attachment and growth. Rather than immobilization of peptide to the polymer surface, an alternative approach was taken in that a polyurethane block polymer was modified so that it contained free carboxyl groups (PEU-COOH). Two cell adhesive peptides, GRGDSY (based on the fibronectin sequence, RGDS) and GRDVY (based on the vitronectin sequence RGDV), and an inactive peptide GRGESY were then grafted to the polyurethane backbone through the formation of amide linkages.

This paper reports an experimental program carried out to characterize the shear behavior of an interface between a shale rock and the steel parts of the drilling equipment (bottom hole assembly and casing). Direct shear tests were performed with an advanced shear box, on interfaces made up of shale specimens and steel plates both in natural and water re-saturated conditions. The shear tests were performed at different normal stress levels from 2 to 12  MPa and {{the results show that}} the shear stress increases when the normal stress is increased. While the cohesion strength between the steel plate and shale is almost zero in a dry condition, this parameter reaches about 1  MPa in the presence of water. The average friction coefficient is determined to be 0.45 in the dry condition and it decreases to 0.21 when water is present. These findings should allow engineers involved in drilling operations and casing installation to assess more accurately the forces required to pull tools out of the borehole when problems arise.

The possible cause of lead concentrations in the study may be attributed to the increased use of chemical fertilizers on farms that find their way into groundwater sources being a rural environment. It is recommended that there should be close monitoring of groundwater being exploited for rural water supply because if contaminated will be counter productive...|$|R
30|$|Underground {{structures}} are always under pressure because of vertical and tectonic stresses. When a borehole is drilled inside a structure, {{some parts of}} (rock) materials are missed. Borehole’s side walls are maintained only by fluid pressure. Since this fluid pressure is not consistent with in situ structure stresses, new stress redistribution occurs around <b>borehole</b> that may <b>lead</b> to rock fracture. Therefore, identification of stresses existent around a borehole is of great importance to examine borehole problems. There are two common types of borehole fracture: first one is drilling induced tension fracture (DITF) and the second one, with 90 ° of difference, is called breakout. In a substance with linear elastic behavior, centralization of bigger stress occurs on borehole wall, so borehole fracture is expected to start from this area.|$|R
40|$|Three-phase {{induction}} motors are {{accountable for}} 85 {{percent of the}} installed capacity of the industrial driving systems. Therefore, the protection of these motors is necessary for reliable operation of loads. This report tends to develop for protection of three phase induction motor from single phasing, over current, phase reversal, over voltage and under voltage. Due to this electrical fault the winding of motor get heated which <b>lead</b> to <b>insulation</b> failure and thus reduce the life time of motor. This fault is generated in induction motor due to variation in induction motor parameters. When three phase induction motor runs continuously, {{it is necessary to}} protect the motor from these anticipated faults. Three phase induction motor generally directly connected through the supply, if the supply voltage has sag and swell due to fault the performance of motor is affected and in some cases winding is burned out. When phase sequence (RYB) is reversed due to wrong connection then motor start rotating in another direction, if supply system has only one phase and other phase is disconnected then it is single phasing problem. If there is problem of under or over voltage then this can harm motor severely or even it can damage it permanentaly...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Drilling deep <b>boreholes</b> can <b>lead</b> to the rupture of {{the rock}} mass or to the {{reactivation}} of existing faults. The recording of the induced micro-seismicity allows one to locate the rupture or the damage zone for each seismic event. Using numerical modeling, it is then possible to back analyze the state of stress in order to predict {{the development of the}} rupture zones. This requires a good knowledge of the geomechanical model, that is to say, the "architecture " of the geological formations (nature of the layers, layout and extension of faults) to which the knowledge of the initial state of stresses and fluid pressures (in the pores or in the fractures {{of the rock}}) must be added. With these data and the mechanical properties of rocks, it is possible to simulate different scenarios using Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical numerical modeling. APPROACH: The proposed work consists in developing a coupled numerical constitutive model (THM) from an existing Finite Element platform. The model parameters will be calibrated based on well-documented case histories for which, the micro-seismic and the geomechanical model are known. In a second stage, the numerical model will be applied to different project configurations. Because of the uncertainties in the knowledge of natural environments, statistical analysis will be conducted to assess the influence of changes in input parameters on the risk of fracture and fault reactivation...|$|R
