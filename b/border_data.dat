50|$|Clippinger {{received}} a fellowship to the University of Pennsylvania, Annenberg School, {{where he studied}} cybernetics and information theory, completing his master’s thesis on a computer simulation and statistical analysis of adaptation strategies for “self-organizing symbolic system”. While in graduate school in Philadelphia, he worked with the Black Panther Breakfast program and Hispanic Young Lords and North Philadelphia gangs to mitigate youth violence. He entered the University of Pennsylvania doctoral program to study content analysis, computational linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. While in graduate school {{he worked as a}} Research Associate at the Brandeis University Florence Heller School, where he applied cybernetics, systems theory and simulation models to the design and delivery of integrated and accountable human services. From 1972- 1975, he undertook his thesis research at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab working with Terry Winograd, and with the support of Stephen Kosslyn, he published it as a book, Meaning and Discourse: A Computational Model of Psychoanalytic Cognition and Discourse, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979. It was the first computer model of distributed, multi-agent cognition and discourse composition derived from transcribed discourse. In 1976-1979, Clippinger became a Research Fellow at Harvard’s Information Resources Policy Program working with Professor Anthony Oettinger, where he conducted research on cross <b>border</b> <b>data</b> flow, telecommunications and development and information privacy. In 1978-80, he became an Expert Advisor for the formation of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and with Art Bushnell, helped formulate some of the United States first information policy.|$|E

Cross <b>border</b> <b>data</b> transfers from the EU became something of the past unless third countries (those countries outside the EU) could prove the existence of adequate data protection provisions.

40|$|Abstract. The Self-Organising Map is {{a popular}} {{unsupervised}} neural network model which has been used successfully in various contexts for clustering data. Even though labelled data is not required for the training process, in many applications class labelling of some sort is available. A visualisation uncovering the distribution and arrangement of the classes over the map can help the user {{to gain a better}} understanding and analysis of the mapping created by the SOM, e. g. through comparing the results of the manual labelling and automatic arrangement. In this paper, we present such a visualisation technique, which smoothly colours a SOM according to the distribution and location of the given class labels.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} publishing sensitive transaction data with privacy preservation. High dimensionality of transaction data poses unique challenges on data privacy and data utility. On one hand, re-identification attacks tend to use a subset of items that infrequently occur in transactions, called moles. On the other hand, data mining applications typically depend on subsets of items that frequently occur in transactions, called nuggets. Thus the problem is how to eliminate all moles while retaining nuggets as much as possible. A challenge is that moles and nuggets are multi-dimensional with exponential growth and are tangled together by shared items. We present a novel and scalable solution to this problem. The novelty lies in a compact <b>border</b> <b>data</b> structure that eliminates the need of generating all moles and nuggets. 1...|$|E

Comparing Korean and Turkish economies in particular demonstrate the importance of trade policy differentials. Both countries have followed restrictive trade policies during the 1950 s and started the planning development strategy during early 1960 s.

These study cases are mostly about the adjustment of the cadastre data with the data about state borderline from the official evidence, and about the procedures for preparing new documentation about the state border. In the framework of this thesis, we tried to define the reasons for such a discrepancy between the land cadastre data and data about state border, which lead us to the conclusion, that this was mainly the consequence of digitalisation of the state border documentation and of the cadastral maps.

30|$|Practical {{questions}} arise from census data and other surveys collected for purposes other than vulnerability and resilience mapping. These concern content and phenomenology, {{as well as}} spatial and temporal adequacy. Regarding general problems with census data, King (2001) extensively discusses the limitations of using socioeconomic indicators to predict a community’s vulnerability to natural hazards. Standardized sets of census data exclude many variables relevant to vulnerability and resilience. Therefore, some factors that influence vulnerability and resilience to a great extent, such as risk perception, social networks, preparedness measures, {{are more prone to}} cartographic silence than others. Studies show that people’s awareness and preparedness does not always coincide with defined vulnerability characteristics (for example, elderly people were highly aware and prepared, while young migrants were not). An important aspect is the incongruence of spatial and social entities, since the boundaries of communities in terms of social ties are often at odds with administrative <b>borders.</b> <b>Data</b> decay is another prominent problem: with the passage of time, census data ceases to be valid and up-to-date due to mobility, migration, and social change. Nonetheless, the knowledge of the changing patterns of vulnerable groups’ residences (single-parent families, elderly, and so on) is crucial to emergency planners (King 2001; Hufschmidt 2009; Fekete 2012).|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{recombinant}} tumour necrosis factor (TNF) on {{functional and}} structural vascular volumes in solid murine Meth A tumours were investigated by injection of Hoechst 33342 and staining for the vascular basement membrane component laminin, respectively. Systemic injection of 3 x 10 (4) U TNF caused an initial increase in functional volume in the tumour, but a strong decrease from 1 to 48 h after treatment. Early effects of intralesional treatment were more moderate.
