Emily resulted in one reported fatality and significant damage {{in the northern part of}} the country, including Carriacou which had <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> the worst effects of Ivan. 16houses were destroyed and well over 200 more were damaged, and two of the main hospitals were flooded. Damages in Grenada amounted to $110.4million.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa {{class has}} become {{culturally}} symbolic in the United States {{in many different}} ways, {{to the point where}} certain elements of the American public—such as the United States Naval Fire Support Association—are unwilling to part with the battleships despite their apparent obsolescence in the face of modern naval combat doctrine that places great emphasis on air supremacy and missile firepower. Although all have been officially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register they have <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> scrapping and were donated for use as museum ships.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, von Neumann {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E
5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E

Burton J. Hendrick had written the first installment, but it had been based largely on rumor. McClure asked her to complete the series because she was regarded as impartial. For the rest of the installments, she told Anderson, no expense had <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> in verifying Milmine's material. McClure had promoted her to managing editor {{on the basis of the}} work. She ended the letter by asking Anderson to keep the information confidential; she added that had not told the truth about it to anyone before this, but felt that someone ought to know.|$|E

5|$|The city of Nagasaki {{had been}} one of the largest {{seaports}} in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of , ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Hiroshima {{had reached a}} peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At {{the time of the}} attack, the population was approximately 340,000–350,000. Residents wondered why Hiroshima had <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> destruction by firebombing. Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters, others thought perhaps their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima. More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks, beginning in 1944. Firebreaks continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6, 1945.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} renewal {{of the civil war}} in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> the ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|Only 15 or 16 people {{survived the}} colony. Six {{returned}} to France, while nine others were {{captured by the}} Spanish, including the fourchildren who had <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> by the Karankawa. The children were initially brought to the viceroy of New Spain, the Conde de Galve, who treated them as servants. Two of the boys, Pierre and Jean-Baptiste, later returned to France. Of the remaining Spanish captives, three became Spanish citizens and settled in New Mexico. Although the French colony had been utterly destroyed, Spain feared that another French attempt was inevitable. For the first time, the Spanish crown authorized small outposts in eastern Texas and at Pensacola. In 1722, the Spanish built a fort, Presidio La Bahia, and Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga {{on the site of}} Fort Saint Louis.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{district}} council worked with King's College to establish plots {{of land for}} development around Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. A town planning competition was held, won by A & J Soutar, town planners from Wandsworth, who sought to create a symmetrical design spreading across Ruislip parish. Many {{of the woods and}} historic sites including Manor Farm were to be demolished and cleared as part of the plan, making way for a projected total of 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents. Only the church in Ruislip, St. Martin's, would have <b>been</b> <b>spared.</b> An outline map was made public on 30 November 1910 with few objections. A local board inquiry followed on 17 February 1911, which required negotiations with landowners to allow for a full planning scheme to be compiled. This was presented in February 1913 with an adaptation of the original Soutars plan and received approval from the Local Government Board in September 1914.|$|E

5|$|In 1711, Franciscan missionary Francisco Hidalgo, who {{had served}} in the earlier Texas missions, wanted to {{reestablish}} missions with the Caddos. The Spanish government was unwilling to provide the funding and troops for the project, so Hidalgo approached the French governor of Louisiana, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac for help. Cadillac was under orders to turn Louisiana into a profitable colony and believed that Spanish settlers closer to Louisiana could provide new trading opportunities. He sent Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, along with brothers Pierre and Robert Talon, who, as children, had <b>been</b> <b>spared</b> at the massacre of Fort Saint Louis, to find Hidalgo and offer assistance. In July 1714, the French delegation reached the Spanish frontier, at that time around the Rio Grande, where Hidalgo was located. Although St. Denis was arrested and questioned, he was ultimately released. The Spanish recognized that the French could become a threat to other Spanish areas, and ordered the reoccupation of Texas as a buffer between French settlements in Louisiana and New Spain.|$|E
