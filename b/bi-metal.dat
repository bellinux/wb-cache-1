50|$|Because Rokushō has a {{dramatically}} different effect on sterling silver {{than on the}} alloys typically fused to it in <b>bi-metals,</b> a common technique in art jewelry is to engrave through the alloy layer in a pattern to reveal the silver underneath prior to patination. This provides a rich contrast in color, highlighting the pattern.|$|R

It is shown that all systems or materials have one common factor: {{at least one}} elastic or thermoelastic continuous substructure, {{in the case of}} "shape memoryalloys" this substructure is on the atomic scale...|$|R
50|$|Rokushō (緑青) is a {{traditional}} Japanese compound for inducing patination in decorative non-ferrous metals, especially several alloys which are nearly unknown outside Japan. Shakudō, an alloy of copper and gold, becomes dark blue-violet; shibuichi, an alloy of fine silver and copper in a higher percentage than sterling, turns misty aquamarine; and kuromido dark coppery black. These alloys are becoming increasingly popular in high-end artistic jewelry, especially in <b>bi-metals</b> (a layer of the alloy fused to another metal such as sterling). Rokushō was generally used to patinate all types of mokume-gane as well. Although other patination agents {{can be used on}} these metals, some artisans prefer the rich colors achieved through traditional Rokushō.|$|R
2500|$|The {{density of}} mercury will change with {{increase}} or decrease in temperature, so a reading must be adjusted for {{the temperature of the}} instrument. For this purpose a mercury thermometer is usually mounted on the instrument. Temperature compensation of an aneroid barometer is accomplished by including a <b>bi-metal</b> element in the mechanical linkages. [...] Aneroid barometers sold for domestic use typically have no compensation under the assumption that they will be used within a controlled room temperature range.|$|E
2500|$|He did not {{recognise}} that {{an electric}} current was being generated when heat {{was applied to}} a <b>bi-metal</b> junction. He used the term [...] "thermomagnetic currents" [...] or [...] "thermomagnetism" [...] to express his discovery. Over the following two years, he reported on his continuing observations to the Prussian Academy of Sciences, where he described his observation as [...] "the magnetic polarization of metals and ores produced by a temperature difference." [...] This Seebeck effect became {{the basis of the}} thermocouple, which is still considered the most accurate measurement of temperature today. [...] The converse Peltier effect was seen over a decade later when a current was run through a circuit with two dissimilar metals, resulting in a temperature difference between the metals.|$|E
2500|$|The design {{itself was}} first tried out in 1994 when the Royal Mint {{produced}} a short run of demonstration {{pieces to the}} new <b>bi-metal</b> standard. These pieces were not for circulation and were simply intended to test the manufacturing process. The coin was technically similar to the version which eventually entered circulation with the Maklouf effigy of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse {{and the image of}} a sailing ship similar to that previously used on the reverse of the pre-decimal halfpenny piece. The inscription on the reverse read ROYAL MINT TRIAL 1994 with an edge inscription based on the one pound coin which read DECUS ET TUTAMEN ANNO REGNI XLVI, meaning [...] "An ornament and a safeguard – in the 46th year of her reign". The 1994 pieces were never legal tender but were eventually released for sale as part of a presentation set in 1998. At the same time in 1994 the Royal Mint produced a mono-metallic trial two-pound coin, with the same ship reverse and inscription, but otherwise similar to the earlier commemorative coins. These were never issued in presentation sets, and so are much scarcer than the bi-metallic version.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{determination}} of thermal stress in advanced CFRP foam-core sandwich structures. The sandwich was manufactured by open mould vacuum infusion process with polymethacrylimide-(PMI-) foam core and NCF carbon fibres. The thermal residual stress was determined by Timoshenkos theory {{based on the measured}} curvature of bisected sandwich specimen. The theory firstly was proved for applicability by means of numerical calculations, because it was original derived from <b>bi-metals.</b> The sandwich specimen were cut into two half specimens at room temperature. The separated halved specimens were heated up to 180 °C and cooled down to 30 °C for several times with defined temperature ramps and the curvature was imaged with contactless optical measuring system. Based on the measured curvature the residual stress was calculated and compared to theoretical results. It was found out that the specific relaxation behaviour of the foam has an important influence of the residual stress in the investigated sandwich. To verify these results separated foam specimens were heated and cooled with the same proceedings and the thermal expansion behaviour of the foam was measured...|$|R

5000|$|Johnson had an {{inquisitive}} {{mind and}} was {{particularly interested in}} electricity. In 1883, he developed a thermostat, which he deployed at the State Normal School. He called the instrument an [...] "electric tele-thermoscope" [...] in the patent application. It was a <b>bi-metal</b> coiled thermostat with a mercury switch, {{which could be used}} to ring a bell to alert the fireman to open or close the heating damper. While not the first <b>bi-metal</b> thermostat, Johnson received a patent for the device and interested William Plankinton, heir to the Plankinton Packing Company, to provide financial backing to manufacture the device.|$|E

50|$|In 1960, silver 1 dirham coins were introduced. These were {{followed}} by nickel 1 dirham and silver 5 dirham coins in 1965. In 1974, {{with the introduction of}} the santim, a new coinage was introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 santimat and 1 dirham. The 1 santim coins were aluminium, the 5 up to 20 santimat were minted in brass, with the highest two denominations in cupro-nickel. Cupro-nickel 5 dirham coins were added in 1980 and changed to a <b>bi-metal</b> coin in 1987. The <b>bi-metal</b> coins bear two year designations for the issue date—1987 in the Gregorian calendar and the 1407 in the Islamic calendar. The 1 santim was only minted until 1987 when new designs were introduced, with a ½ dirham replacing the 50 santimat without changing the size or composition. The new 5 dirham coin was bimetallic, as was the 10 dirham coin introduced in 1995. Cupro-nickel 2 dirham coins were introduced in 2002. In 2011, a new series of coins has been issued, with the 5 and 10 dirham coin utilizing a latent image as a security feature.|$|E

50|$|Introduced in November 1955 and {{launched}} {{at the same}} time as the 349 cc Velocette Viper, the single-cylinder Venom was developed from the Velocette MSS and needed to compete against a new range of British twin-cylinder motorcycles. Conceived by Velocette’s Eugene Goodman and designed by Charles Udall, the Venom's 499 cc engine had a <b>bi-metal</b> cylinder with a cast-iron liner, high compression piston and a light alloy cylinder head. The design of the engine's high cam with short push-rods was simpler to produce than an overhead camshaft engine.|$|E
5000|$|The Johnson Electric Service Company was {{established}} in 1885 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Johnson’s most notable contribution to temperature control was the automatic multi-zone temperature control system - a pneumatic system that used a <b>bi-metal</b> thermostat to control air flow through a nozzle and thereby operate a pilot regulator. The amplified air signal from the regulator was then used to control a steam or hot water valve on a heat exchanger, or to control a damper of a forced air system. He received a patent for the system in 1895.|$|E

Flashes, and other colour marks used on dress and elsewhere (such as backgrounds on signs about Warwick Camp) are red and blue, reflecting the colours of the Royal Artillery, but the stable belt (issued only to permanent staff, officers and senior ranks) worn is rifle green, with black edges, referring to the colours used by the BVRC.|$|E
5000|$|The {{research}} and development team at Prefco developed 'The McCabe Link'- a resettable <b>Bi-metal</b> fire link that is a heat releasing device for fire and smoke protection applications. The McCabe Link became recognized as a life saving invention by the UL and ASHRAE. [...] Prefco also manufactured fire and smoke dampers that allow ventilation systems to draw toxic smoke from a building that is on fire. Their products are sold throughout the United States, Canada, South America, Asia and the Middle East. Prefco helped standardize the smoke control industry worldwide, and was instrumental in changing laws on fire regulation and safety.|$|E
