It used the same first-person shooter game engine used in many of LucasArts's contemporary titles. The game was built from the same engine as LucasArts' , although the software had to be edited for various reasons, the main one being that while Jedi Knights had used an elastic form of physics, DroidWorks had to be true to the real world. While the Star Wars universe was known for its wars and violence, the design team made it a philosophy to use as little violence as possible; this led to create ways to prevent the player from accessing certain levels until a particular point. For instance rather than putting enemies in their way which could only be defeated once the player's droids had enough strength to defeat them, the landscape itself would be designed so only certain types of droids could traverse to the puzzle, which had the <b>bonus</b> <b>effect</b> of weeding out players who had not yet acquired the required parts to successfully complete the level.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of anaerobic treatment of methanol condensate from {{pulp and paper}} mill in UASB reactor was investigated and compared with the anaerobic treatment of methanol. The UASB reactor treating methanol condensate was operated for 480 days with minimum problems of overload. COD removal from methanol condensate and methanol under normal operating conditions ranged from 84 - 86 % to 86 - 98 %, respectively. Under optimal conditions (OLR= 5. 0 gCODL(- 1) day(- 1), COD(influent) = 11. 40 gL(- 1)) a methane yield of 0. 29 NL CH(4) per g COD(removed) (at standard temperature and pressure) was achieved during the treatment of methanol condensate. The recovery time of the microorganisms after several overloads was decreasing each time {{probably due to the}} adaptation to methanol condensate.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} interplay between the {{operational}} and financial facets of capacity investment. We consider the capacity choice problem of a firm with limited liquidity and whose access to external capital markets is hampered by moral hazard. The firm must therefore not only calibrate its capacity investment and the corresponding funding needs, but also optimize its sourcing of funds. Importantly, the set of available sources of funds is derived endogenously and includes standard financial claims (debt, equity, etc.). We find that when higher demand realizations are more indicative of high effort, debt financing is optimal for any given capacity level. In this case, the optimal capacity is never below the efficient capacity level but sometimes strictly above that level. Further, the optimal capacity level increases with the moral hazard problem's severity and decreases with the firm's internal funds. This runs counter to the newsvendor logic and to the common intuition that by raising the cost of external capital and hence the unit capacity cost, financial market frictions should lower the optimal capacity level. We trace the value of increasing capacity beyond the efficient level to a <b>bonus</b> <b>effect</b> and a demand elicitation effect. Both stem from the risk of unmet demand, which is characteristic of capacity decisions under uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{speaks to}} three separate but related issues on R&D collaboration. The first chapter details {{the various ways}} in which entities from {{the public and private}} research sectors transfer information. In Korea and Taiwan, information transfers are shown to {{have a positive impact on}} public-private R&D output in both countries, but government funding is a much stronger predictor of such transfers in Taiwan. The second chapter focuses on the research-based links between the government, universities, and firms, and tests the Triple Helix-based hypothesis that new capital arises from the interactions between the public and private research sectors. Focusing again on Korea and Taiwan, repartnering tendencies (as a proxy for new capital) are found to be strong predictors of R&D output, with virtually no differences between these two countries. In the third chapter, attention is drawn to R&D collaboration between countries, and it is shown that international R&D collaboration has a positive impact on the growth residual (TFP), and that it has a <b>bonus</b> <b>effect</b> to a country's patenting efforts. It is also shown that developing countries derive particular benefit from international R&D collaboration, but such benefits are largely dependent on the presence of strong political institutions and intellectual property rights. In terms of data and methods, Chapters 1 and 2 utilize a unique dataset (KORTAI R&D), which is specific to the Korean and Taiwanese cases, while the macro-level analysis of Chapter 3 uses data for a maximum of 150 countries drawn from the USPTO, WDI, Penn World Table, Barro-Lee education data, the Ginarte-Park IPR index, POLITY IV, and POLCON.

40|$|There is {{a robust}} {{evidence}} {{base for the}} negative health effects from smoking. Smoking is linked to severe morbidity and to mortality, and kills {{up to half of}} its regular users. Tobacco use and production also bring other negative consequences such as economic loss for countries, poverty for individuals, child labour, deforestation and other environmental problems in tobacco growing countries.  A combination of comprehensive interventions at different levels is needed to curb the tobacco epidemic. Tobacco control strategies at national levels in the western world often include components of information/education, taxation, legislative measures and influencing public opinion. Two approaches have dominated at the meso and micro levels: cessation support for tobacco users and prevention activities to support young people refraining from tobacco use. Smoking uptake is a complex process that includes factors at the societal level as well as social and individual characteristics.   At national level, taxation and legislation can contribute to a societal norm opposing tobacco and creating a context for primary prevention aimed at tobacco free youth.   There is no magic bullet in primary prevention.   At the meso and micro levels, a continued development of knowledge on the underlying mechanisms and primary prevention methods is essential to prevent young people from starting to use tobacco.  The overall aim of this thesis was to gain knowledge about factors that influence young people’s use of tobacco and of preventive mechanisms.   The specific aims included to study the relation between Tobacco Free Duo, an intervention program targeting youth in Västerbotten County, and tobacco use prevalence.   A specific interest was to explore the role adults can play in supporting young people to refrain from tobacco use.  The thesis is based on four studies with three separate sets of data, two were quantitative and one was qualitative. The studies were conducted among adolescents (aged 13 - 15 yr) in Västerbotten County and on national level in Sweden (aged 13, 15 and 17 yr).  Tobacco Free Duo is a school-based community intervention that started in 1993. An essential component of the intervention was to involve adults in supporting adolescents to stay tobacco free. Results showed decreased smoking in adolescents among both boys and girls in the intervention area during the study period of seven years.   There was no change in a national reference group during the same time period. A <b>bonus</b> <b>effect</b> was a decrease in adult tobacco use in the intervention area. One out of four adults who supported a young person taking part in the intervention stopped using tobacco. In a qualitative assessment of young smokers, starting to smoke was described as a means of gaining control of their feelings and their situation during early adolescence. They expected adults to intervene against their smoking and claimed that close relations with caring adults could be a reason for smoking less or trying to quit smoking.   In a quantitative study that used three decades of national data, over time adolescents became more positive toward parental action on children’s smoking. The adolescents strongly supported the idea of parental action, {{regardless of whether or not}} they themselves smoked. Adolescents preferred that actions from parents were dissuading their children from smoking, not smoking themselves, and not allowing their children to smoke at home.  These results suggest that the Tobacco Free Duo program contributed to a reduction in adolescent smoking among both boys and girls.   Using a multi-faceted intervention that includes an adolescent-adult partnership can decrease adolescent smoking uptake.   Engaging adults as partners in tobacco prevention interventions that target adolescents has an important tobacco reducing <b>bonus</b> <b>effect</b> in the adults. The intervention has proven sustainable within communities.   A growing majority of adolescents support parental interventions to help them refrain from tobacco.   The findings dismiss the notion that adolescents ignore or even disdain parental practices concerning tobacco. A common and consequent norm against tobacco from both schools and parents using a supportive attitude can prevent tobacco use in young people...|$|E
