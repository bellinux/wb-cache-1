5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution. The transition itself can only <b>be</b> <b>illustrated</b> and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Cohen {{approached}} May Cutler, {{founder of}} Tundra Books, {{to create an}} illustrated children's book of the story. It was published in 1984 as The Hockey Sweater, and by 2014 had sold over 300,000 copies. Following {{the success of the}} book, Cutler asked Carrier to write three more stories of his childhood to <b>be</b> <b>illustrated</b> by Cohen, each covering a different sport in a different season. They were published as The Boxing Champion (1991), The Longest Home Run (1994) and The Basketball Player (1996).|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can <b>be</b> <b>illustrated</b> with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas can}} <b>be</b> <b>illustrated</b> by drawing objects in pairs. It is {{difficult}} to depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a leftover object, so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, {{in the group of}} five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a leftover object, so 5 is odd. In the group of four objects, there is no leftover object, so 4 is even. In the group of just one object, there are no pairs, and there is a leftover object, so 1 is odd. In the group of zero objects, there is no leftover object, so 0 is even.|$|E

25|$|Hispanicization is {{the process}} by which a place or a person absorbs {{characteristics}} of Hispanic society and culture. Modern hispanization of a place, namely in the United States, might <b>be</b> <b>illustrated</b> by Spanish-language media and businesses. Hispanization of a person might <b>be</b> <b>illustrated</b> by speaking Spanish, making and eating Hispanic American food, listening to Spanish language music or participating in Hispanic festivals and holidays - Hispanization of those outside the Hispanic community as opposed to assimilation of Hispanics into theirs.|$|E
