Higher variability and range of TPM concentrations over the southern Baltic were observed during months of both low or below 0 °C temperature and strong turbulence. Elevated concentrations of Hg in aerosols were the result of emission from local sources (mainly fossil fuel burning in domestic furnaces and <b>boiler–rooms).</b> The autumn–winter season was the period of the highest Hg {{concentrations in}} fine and coarse aerosols...|$|R

She conducted trials on 20 May 1901 and reached a speed of [...] She served as a <b>boiler-room</b> training ship from then to September, and in 1902 became a station ship in Cattaro Bay. Sebenico was converted into a tender for the artillery school in 1903. For this role, she had her armament revised, to include one [...] gun, one [...] gun, one [...] gun, one [...] gun, eight 47mm guns, and two [...] guns. On 13 January 1904, she assisted the Norddeutscher Lloyd steamship [...] that had run aground off Medolino. Sebenico served with the artillery school until May 1915. During this period, after World War I broke out in July 1914, Sebenico was stationed as a guard ship in her namesake city. She was then assigned to the torpedo school in 1918, and served in that capacity {{to the end of}} the war. With Austria-Hungary's defeat, the Allies seized most of the Austro-Hungarian fleet as war prizes, and Sebenico was allocated to Italy in 1920, which scrapped her that year.|$|E
500|$|In 1904 Spiteful was {{instrumental}} in the Royal Navy's adoption of fuel oil as a source of power in place of coal. In July that year the journal Scientific American described her as [...] "the first warship to be so equipped." [...] Her boilers were modified to burn only fuel oil as part of ongoing experiments and, on [...] 1904, [...] "vitally important" [...] comparative trials were carried out near the Isle of Wight with Spitefuls sister ship Peterel burning coal, in which Spiteful performed best. Problems with the production of smoke were surmounted so that using oil produced no more smoke than coal, and {{it was found that the}} ship's crew could be reduced, since fewer were required in the boiler rooms. Whereas Peterel required six stokers during the trials, Spiteful required only three <b>boiler-room</b> crew; while Peterels crew had to dispose of 1.5tons (1.52tonnes) of ash and clinker, Spiteful produced no such waste. Further, while Peterel took 1.5hours to prepare for steaming, Spiteful took 10minutes. In June 1906 the same journal reported that Spiteful was being used by the Admiralty to train engine-room crews in the operation of oil-burning equipment.|$|E
500|$|Nevada was {{the first}} {{battleship}} in the US Navy to have triple gun turrets, a single funnel, and an oil-fired steam power plant. In particular, {{the use of the}} more-efficient oil gave the ship an advantage over earlier coal-fired plants. Nevada was also the first US battleship with geared turbines, which also helped increase fuel economy and thus range compared to earlier direct drive turbines. The ability to steam great distances without refueling was a major concern of the General Board at that time. In 1903, the Board felt all American battleships should have a minimum steaming radius of [...] so that the US could enforce the Monroe Doctrine. One of the main purposes of the Great White Fleet, which sailed around the world in 1907–1908, was to prove to Japan that the US Navy could [...] "carry any naval conflict into Japanese home waters". Possibly as a result of this, battleships after 1908 were mainly designed to [...] "steam 8,000miles at cruising speeds"; given the distance between San Pedro, where the fleet would be based, and Manila, where the Fleet was expected to have to fight under War Plan Orange, was , endurance was obviously a major concern for the U.S. Navy. Also, oil allowed for the <b>boiler-room</b> crew to be reduced— the engineer on [...] estimated that 100 firemen (stokers) and 112 coal passers could be adequately replaced by just 24 men, which would allow some crew's quarters to be eliminated; this would save weight and also reduce the amount of fresh water and provisions that the ship would have to carry.|$|E
500|$|On the 7thJune, 1917, while {{disguised}} as a British merchant vessel with a dummy gun mounted aft, H.M.S. [...] "Pargust" [...] was torpedoed at very close range. Her <b>boiler-room,</b> engine-room, and No. 5 hold were immediately flooded, and the starboard lifeboat was blown to pieces. The weather was misty at the time, fresh breeze and a choppy sea. The [...] "Panic Party", {{under the command of}} Lieutenant F. R. Hereford, D.S.C., R.N.R., abandoned ship, and as the last boat was shoving off, the periscope of the submarine was observed close before the port beam about 400 yards distant. The enemy then submerged, and periscope reappeared directly astern, passing to the starboard quarter, and then round to the port beam, when it turned again towards the ship, breaking surface about 50 yards away. The lifeboat, acting as a lure, commenced to pull round the stern; submarine followed closely and Lieutenant Hereford, with complete disregard of the danger incurred from the fire of either ship or submarine (who had trained a maxim on the lifeboat), continued to decoy her to within 50 yards of the ship. The [...] "Pargust" [...] then opened fire with all guns, and the submarine, with oil squirting from her side and the crew pouring out of the conning tower, steamed slowly across the bows with a heavy list. The enemy crew held up their hands in token of surrender, whereupon fire immediately ceased. The submarine then began to move away at a gradually increasing speed, apparently endeavouring to escape in the mist. Fire was reopened until she sank, one man clinging to the bow as she went down. The boats, after a severe pull to the windward, succeeded in saving one officer and one man. American Destroyers and a British sloop arrived shortly afterwards, and the [...] "Pargust" [...] was towed back to port. As on the previous occasions, officers and men displayed the utmost courage and confidence in their captain, and the action serves as an example of what perfect discipline, when coupled with such confidence, can achieve.|$|E

6000|$|Mark how {{virtue is}} rewarded! Another of our destroyers {{an hour or}} so {{previously}} had been knocked clean out of action, before she had done anything, by a big shell which gutted a <b>boiler-room</b> and started an oil fire.

She says: [...] "The fire having been dealt with it was found a mat kept the stokehold dry. My only trouble now being lack of speed, I looked round for useful employment, and saw a destroyer in great difficulties, so closed her." [...] That destroyer was our paralytic friend of the intermittent torpedo-tubes, and a grateful ship she was when her crippled sister (but still good for a few knots) offered her a tow, [...] "under very trying conditions with large enemy ships approaching." [...] So the two set off together, Cripple and Paralytic, with heavy shells falling round them, as sociable as a couple of lame hounds. Cripple worked up to 12 knots, and the weather grew vile, and the tow parted. Paralytic, by this time, had raised steam in a boiler or two, and made shift to get along slowly on her own, Cripple hirpling beside her, till Paralytic could not make any more headway in that rising sea, and Cripple had to tow her once more. Once more the tow parted. So they tied Paralytic up rudely and effectively with a cable round her after bollards and gun (presumably because of strained forward bulkheads) and hauled her stern-first, through heavy seas, at continually reduced speeds, doubtful of their position, unable to sound because of the seas, and much pestered by a wind which backed without warning, till, at last, they made land, and turned into the hospital appointed for brave wounded ships.

This decreased the ships silhouette and gave improved firing arcs for the anti-aircraft armament. This layout and hull design proved very effective and made for good-looking ships.
