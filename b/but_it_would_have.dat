5|$|The King's School, Canterbury claims Augustine as its founder, {{which would}} make it the world's oldest {{existing}} school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century. Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the East Anglian mission. Augustine received liturgical books from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a form of the Latin language liturgy in use at Rome.|$|E
5|$|The work {{eventually}} cost £211,000; {{it began}} in 1861, {{with the majority of}} the work being completed by 1870 and the additional iron shielding by 1874. In peacetime, the castle held around 131 officers and men <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> needed to be substantially reinforced during wartime if all the weapons were to be manned. Although the fort never received its full complement of guns, by 1881 it had ten 12.5 inch, 38 ton (317mm, 39,000kg) rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns, fifteen 10 inch, 18 ton (254mm, 18,000kg) RML guns, five 9 inch, 12 ton (228mm, 12,000kg) RML guns, and 3 64-pounders (29kg), together forming a powerful arsenal.|$|E

5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system was {{very similar to that}} in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> doubled the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used for weighing silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E
5|$|Jason Voorhees {{went from}} {{deceased}} child to full-grown man for Friday the 13th Part 2, and Warrington Gillette {{was hired to}} play the role. Gillette auditioned {{for the role of}} Paul; that role eventually went to John Furey. Under the belief that he had attended the Hollywood Stuntman's School, Gillette was offered the role of Jason Voorhees. Initially Gillette was unsure about the character, but the idea of starring in his first film grew on Gillette, and he also thought the role was amusing. It became apparent Gillette could not perform the necessary stunts, so the stunt coordinator Cliff Cudney brought in Steve Daskawisz. Daskawisz filmed all of the scenes except the opening sequence and the unmasking shot at the end; Gillette returned for the unmasking scenes. Gillette received credit for playing Jason, while Daskawisz was given credit as the stunt double. When Part 3 was released the following year, Daskawisz was credited as Jason for the reused footage from the climax of the film. Initially, Daskawisz was asked to return to the role for Part 3, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> required him to pay for his own transportation and housing during filming. Having secured a part on Guiding Light, Daskawisz declined.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Schmitt was a {{significant}} blow to the Austrian military organization. Called out of retirement for this specific task, {{he was the most}} experienced Habsburg general staff officer, second only to the Archduke Charles. From mid-1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, the Lower Rhine, the Rhine and the Army of Germany. Furthermore, he was a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. He had helped to design several of Charles' more important victories at Emmendingen, Schliengen, the sieges at Kehl and Hünigen, the battles at Ostrach and Stockach, and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at Winterthur and Zürich. An experienced officer and excellent tactician, he might well have made a more effective Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of Austerlitz than his eventual replacement, Franz von Weyrother. In Schmitt's absence, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at Hohenlinden in 1800, was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at Austerlitz. Schmitt, undoubtedly a far better tactician than Weyrother, and possessor of superior training and mapping skills, would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for Austerlitz. Schmitt's presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> mitigated the magnitude of the Coalition's losses; Austerlitz was considered one of Napoleon's finest triumphs.|$|E

25|$|After {{the initial}} crisis on Planet Earth where humans, {{animals and plants}} fought against each other, Roog intervened and punished them all.

25|$|The {{debt ceiling}} is a {{legislative}} mechanism {{to limit the}} amount of national debt that can be issued by the Treasury.

If this situation were to occur, it is unclear whether Treasury would be able to prioritize payments on debt to avoid a default on its debt obligations, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to default on some of its non-debt obligations.|$|E

25|$|However, the Second Revolution did not {{fare well}} for the Kuomintang. The leading Kuomintang {{military}} force of Jiangxi was defeated by Yuan's forces on August 1 and Nanchang was taken.

In October 1913 an intimidated parliament formally elected Yuan Shikai President of the Republic of China, and the major powers extended recognition to his government. Duan Qirui and other trusted Beiyang generals were given prominent positions in the cabinet. To achieve international recognition, Yuan Shikai had to agree to autonomy for Outer Mongolia and Tibet.

25|$|This stage {{began its}} {{evolution}} as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European {{that had lost}} its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels {{as well as one}} or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the word root, and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.|$|E

25|$|Neither {{the success}} at Uman nor what {{followed}} at Kiev {{would have happened}} had Rundstedt not backed his subordinates and resisted Hitler's interference {{in the conduct of}} the campaign. As during the French campaign, Hitler was panicked by his own success. By early July he was full of anxiety that the German armour was advancing too quickly, without infantry support, and that it was exposed to Soviet counter-attacks. On 10 July Brauchitsch arrived at Rundstedt's headquarters at Brody, with instructions from Hitler that Kleist was turn south towards Vinnitsa and link up with Schobert's army there, rather than continue south-east to Kirovograd. This would still have trapped many Soviet divisions, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> allowed the mass of Soviet forces at Uman and Kiev to escape. Rundstedt defended Kleist's ability to execute the larger encirclement, and persuaded Brauchitsch that he was right. Brauchitsch then contacted Halder, who succeeded in persuading Hitler to support Rundstedt. This was a sign that Rundstedt still had Hitler's respect, as were Hitler's two visits to Rundstedt's armies during this period.|$|E
