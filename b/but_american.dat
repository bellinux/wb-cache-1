5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, <b>but</b> <b>American</b> alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Chambly {{improved}} morale {{in the ranks}} of Montgomery's army, so much so that he went through with his plan to establish a battery north of Fort St. Jean, this time without opposition. While the Americans were constructing the batteries, the British heavily bombarded the American workers, but this resulted in few casualties. General Guy Carleton, commanding the British forces at Montreal, realized that the situation at Fort St. Jean was becoming desperate. He personally led a relief force at the end of October, <b>but</b> <b>American</b> forces successfully prevented it from crossing the Saint Lawrence River south of Montreal.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese forces {{lacked the}} ability to lay siege to the city, so the {{evacuation}} order caught Peng by surprise. On the morning of January 3, Peng ordered the PVA 13th Army to pursue the retreating UN forces by attacking towards Seoul. The US 24th, 25th Infantry Division and the British 29th Infantry Brigade soon bore {{the brunt of the}} Chinese attacks. In US IX Corps' sector, PVA 38th Corps immediately attacked the US 24th Infantry Division as the American were trying to withdraw. In the fierce fighting that followed, the US 19th Infantry Regiment on the division's left flank was involved in numerous hand-to-hand struggles with the Chinese around Uijeongbu. The Chinese overran the E and G company of US 19th Infantry Regiment during their attacks, <b>but</b> <b>American</b> artillery and air strikes soon inflicted 700 casualties in return. Faced with the heavy Chinese pressure, the 27th Commonwealth Brigade was again called in to cover the retreat of US IX Corps. After the US 24th Division evacuated Seoul on the night of January 3, the 27th Commonwealth Brigade started to cross the Han River on the morning of January 4, and by 07:40 the entire US IX Corps had left Seoul.|$|E

5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} Fiji, {{where it is}} found on the four largest islands (Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Kadavu) {{and also in the}} smaller western islands of the Mamanuca and the Yasawa groups. It is {{uncommon}} but widespread, found in both forested and open habitats, from sea level to at least 1,200m (3,900ft) on Viti Levu. It appears to be less common on Taveuni than the larger islands. It has adapted well to man-made habitats, and is seen in grasslands, pasture, rice paddies, parks and gardens. Many parrotfinch species are mainly forest birds, <b>but</b> <b>American</b> ornithologist Jared Diamond has suggested that in the central Pacific, where there are no seed-eating munias occupying the open habitats, species such as Vanuatu's blue-faced parrotfinch and its Fijian relative have expanded into grassy areas of their islands to exploit the supply of seeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, <b>but</b> <b>American</b> carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, <b>but</b> <b>American</b> Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E

5|$|Maria, {{like her}} mother, was likely a carrier of the {{hemophilia}} gene {{and might have}} passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of. One of Alexandra's brothers and two of her nephews, {{as well as one}} of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs, as was Maria's brother Alexei. Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother, Tsarina Alexandra. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers. Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia, <b>but</b> <b>American</b> scientists identified the young woman as Maria.|$|E
