Gaga in many ways {{is the epitome of}} what we are not. She is the butcher to our <b>butter</b> <b>knife.</b> The essential thrill is always to keep eluding what is expected of us and what we expect of ourselves." [...] The last of the remix to be released was The Weeknd's take on [...] "Marry the Night" [...] which featured Illangelo, thus earning him a co-producer credit on it.|$|E

Mark Deming of Allmusic calls it [...] "a scabrous masterpiece", while his colleague Andy Kellman states that [...] "each [...] is incisive enough to render a razor as effective as a <b>butter</b> <b>knife.</b> In sum: yowl, ching, thump-thump-screech. Ugly characters line up in the songs like early arrivals at a monster truck rally." [...] Critic Robert Christgau commented that [...] "Anybody who thinks rock and roll {{is alive and well in}} the infinite variety of its garage-boy permutations had better figure out how these Hitler Youth rejects could crush the competition and quit simultaneously. No matter what well-meaning rockers think of Steve Albini's supremacist lies, they lie themselves if they dismiss what he does with electric guitars—that Killdozer sound culminates if not finishes off whole generations of punk and metal." [...] Albini himself later considered the album's first side as Big Black's best output.|$|E

She might have lost her train, but he knew well enough she hadn't. 'Good-bye, dear Uncle Jolyon.' Why 'Good-bye' and not 'Good-night'? And that hand of hers {{lingering}} in the air. And her kiss. What did it mean? Vehement alarm and irritation took possession of him. He got {{up and began to}} pace the Turkey carpet, between window and wall. She was going to give him up! He felt it for certain--and he defenceless. An old man wanting to look on beauty! It was ridiculous! Age closed his mouth, paralysed his power to fight. He had no right to what was warm and living, no right to anything but memories and sorrow. He could not plead with her; even an old man has his dignity. Defenceless! For an hour, lost to bodily fatigue, he paced up and down, past the bowl of carnations he had plucked, which mocked him with its scent. Of all things hard to bear, the prostration of will-power is hardest, for one who has always had his way. Nature had got him in its net, and like an unhappy fish he turned and swam at the meshes, here and there, found no hole, no breaking point. They brought him tea at five o'clock, and a letter. For a moment hope beat up in him. He cut the envelope with the <b>butter</b> <b>knife,</b> and read: ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Butter</b> <b>knives</b> have a {{dull cutting}} edge and are {{generally}} used for spreading.

50|$|The {{edge of a}} knife {{gradually}} {{loses its}} sharpness, which can be restored by sharpening. For many types of <b>knives</b> (e.g., <b>butter</b> <b>knives)</b> this is not relevant.

50|$|In common usage, a <b>butter</b> <b>knife</b> may {{refer to}} any non-serrated table knife {{designed}} {{with a dull}} edge and rounded point; formal cutlery patterns {{make a distinction between}} such a place knife (or table knife) and a <b>butter</b> <b>knife.</b> In this usage, a <b>butter</b> <b>knife</b> (or master <b>butter</b> <b>knife)</b> is a sharp-pointed, dull-edged knife, often with a sabre shape, used only to serve out pats of butter from a central butter dish to individual diners' plates. Master butter knives are not used to spread the butter onto bread: this would contaminate the butter remaining in the butter dish when the next pat of butter was served. Rather, diners at the breakfast, the luncheon, and the informal dinner table use an individual <b>butter</b> <b>knife</b> to apply butter to their bread. Individual butter knives have a round point, so as not to tear the bread, and are sometimes termed butter spreaders. If no butter spreaders are provided, a dinner knife may be used as an alternative.|$|E

2500|$|A knife (plural knives) {{is a tool}} with {{a cutting}} edge or blade, {{hand-held}} or otherwise, with most having a handle. [...] Some types of knives are used as utensils, including knives used at the dining table (e.g., <b>butter</b> <b>knives</b> and steak knives) and knives used in the kitchen (e.g., paring knife, bread knife, cleaver). Many types of knives are used as tools, such as the combat knife carried by soldiers, the pocket knife carried by hikers and the hunting knife used by hunters. Knives are also used as a traditional or religious implement, such as the kirpan. Some types of knives are used as weapons, such as daggers or switchblades. Some types of knives are used as sports equipment (e.g., throwing knives). Knives are also used in agriculture, food harvesting etc.; the sickle, the scythe and even the combine harvester are knives.|$|R

50|$|Teams {{first made}} their way to the Tolosa Airport, where they would take a small charter plane over the city to reach the old hangars of Aeroclub La Plata. There, one team member would be {{attached}} to a crane and held upside-down like a pendulum. Their partner would have to swing their partner around while also stacking a series of boxes directly beneath them, trying not to have their partner knock them over. Each of the boxes was decorated with the flag of a country that had been visited on the race, and they would have to be stacked in the correct chronological order from bottom to top. Once the boxes were all stacked, teams would get their next clue. They would then make their way to Plaza San Martín and receive a 50 kg block of chocolate. They had to use only forks, spoons and <b>butter</b> <b>knives</b> to hack away at the block, looking for a tiny race flag somewhere inside.|$|R
50|$|On Friday, 20 April, the Kaz II was towed {{into the}} Townsville port for {{forensic}} examination. On 21 April, Police Sergeant Bardell and Sergeant Molloy searched the ship {{for signs of}} foul play or third-party involvement; no evidence for this was found. They found the cabin to be neat and tidy apart from some magazines, a piece of newspaper, and a wine cask which were lying on the floor. It was later determined that these items {{ended up on the}} floor while the ship was being towed to shore. In the sink were a few <b>butter</b> <b>knives</b> and, on a bench in the galley, a plastic sheath of fishing knives was found. They did not appear to have been used recently. Under Batten's bed, in a sealed container, the investigators found a firearm and some ammunition, none of which was apparently missing. In a drawer they found an additional single bullet of the same calibre.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Two example {{applications}} of the approximated generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD) computed by our novel, adaptive algorithm. Previous GVD methods require a gridded space of 224 (gears dataset) and 236 (knives dataset) voxels to resolve the closely spaced objects. (a) Two gears with regions of very tight spacing. (b) The GVD of the gears model. The surface is colored red in areas of very close tolerance. (c) Three <b>butter</b> <b>knives</b> in a wood block. To animate removal of the knives without intersecting the block requires extreme care because of close mesh spacing. (d) Intersection-free motion is guaranteed by computing motion vectors based on the GVD and allowing motion only within a Voronoi cell. We present an algorithm to compute an approximation of the generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD) on arbitrary collections of 2 D or 3 D geometric objects. In particular, we focus on datasets with closely spaced objects; GVD approximation is expensive and sometimes intractable on these datasets using previous algorithms. With our approach, the GVD can be computed using commodity hardware even on datasets with many, extremely tightly packed objects. Our approach is to subdivide the space with an octree that is represented with an adjacency structure. We then use a novel adaptive distance transform to compute the distance function on octree vertices. The computed distance field is sampled more densely in areas of close object spacing, enabling robust and parallelizable GVD surface generation. We demonstrate our method {{on a variety of}} data and show exampl...|$|R

50|$|As {{with many}} old Anglo-Saxon charms, it is presumed that {{physical}} gestures {{were intended to}} accompany the recitation of the text.

Despite the popular use of the aforementioned herbs in forms of remedial healing, {{it is important to note}} that the usage of these plants may have been more symbolic than practical. Many old Anglo-Saxon charms draw upon the symbolism of both pagan traditions as well as ancient Christian traditions, and the usage of plants in the texts were likely related to these religious references.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the Neolithic {{settlements}} in the protected marsh area were discovered by Jakob Messikommer between 1856 and 1858.

Additional individual finds included longbows, hatchets made of stone and stag horn, and ceramics. Messikommer identified, among the organic finds, however 58 different animal species. In another of his excavations Messikommer revealed the remains of woven fabrics, braids and seeds and evidence of the production of <b>butter.</b> Carved wooden <b>knife,</b> a trowel and scoops, a yoke of hazel, flail, remains of a garment and one from raffia braided mat were other single finds.
