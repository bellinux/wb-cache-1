40|$|In {{contrast}} to corporate defaults, regulators typically take {{a number of}} statutory actions to avoid the large fiscal costs associated with <b>bank</b> defaults. The distance-to-default, a widely used market-based measure of corporate default risk, ignores such regulatory actions.

We show that both risk measures can be analyzed using the same theoretical framework but differ depending on the level of capital adequacy thresholds and asset volatility.

Other data also indicate that <b>bank</b> competition within the CEMAC as a region is limited, complementing the findings on integration.
