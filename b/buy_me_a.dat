Interpreter at the State section, he was often off to work or studying in the Khaldounia, aiming to prepare {{the first half of}} the French baccalaureate. This left Habib with Dhaouia, M'hamed's servant who made Habib her domestic She made him do household chores or buy groceries and took him with her whenever she went visiting families in order to select a suitable wife for M'hamed. At the start of the 1907 school year, his brother enrolled him in the Sadiki elementary school. The superintendent described him as turbulent but studious. The young Habib had to perfect Quran learnings, that being the main lessons taught. That made him spend weekends studying and learning Quran with his brother Mahmoud, shouting and screaming being Mahmoud's teaching method. [...] "To go to school", he recalled, [...] "I had to go by foot. Leaving the house where I lived and which belonged to the grandfather of Tahar Lakhdar, I crossed the souks and climbed the hill of Sidi Ben Arous. I was poorly dressed. My shoes had holes which filled with water. By pride, I refused to ask my older brother to <b>buy</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> new pair. That was my life throughout my primary education". The Husainid family members being the only ones allowed to take lunch inside the school, Bourguiba had to go home and eat Dhaouia's ratatouilles that did not put an end to his hunger. It was only during the 1911 epidemic of Cholera which killed M'hamed's wife, that he was able to eat his fill, thanks to the Couscous destined for guests, narrowly avoiding starvation.|$|E
