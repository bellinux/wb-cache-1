40|$|Longitudinal {{barriers}} {{are commonly used}} to shield hazards, including stiff bridge rail ends and slopes. In some locations, a secondary roadway intersects the primary roadway within the guardrail’s length-of-need (LON). Some intersections have as little as 15 ft (4. 6 m) between the intersection and beginning of the <b>bridge</b> <b>railing,</b> which require short-radius guardrail systems. No short-radius systems have been tested and approved to current impact safety standards for shielding hazards with these conditions. Site conditions provided by the Nebraska Department of Roads {{were used to determine}} the constraints for a new safety treatment for intersecting roadways and include intersection radii, <b>bridge</b> <b>railing</b> offset distances, and clear zone distances. An examination of the site conditions determined that the <b>bridge</b> <b>railing</b> end should be treated as a hazard, as defined in the Roadside Design Guide. The hazard would begin at the <b>bridge</b> <b>railing</b> end with a width extending to the clear zone. Several design concepts were developed to treat these situations with a preference on using existing technologies that could be adapted for this hazard scenario. Fifteen concepts were brainstormed with three considered for further analysis and evaluation. These concepts included net attenuation/end terminal, inertial barrel array/end terminal, and a bullnose with a secondary energy absorber inside of it. All three systems were capable of stopping a vehicle in the space available, but only the net attenuation/end terminal concept was considered likely to accommodate the site conditions using a moderate slope behind the system. Four dynamic bogie tests and two static tests were performed on potential net attenuators to evaluate their use as energy absorbers in the preferred design concept. Recommendations for further development of the net attenuation system were provided. Advisor: John D. Rei...|$|R

The length of the structure is due to the wide right-of-way beneath, which was used as a railroad switchyard known as the [...] "Hump."

This late 1880s bridge existed until the current bridge replaced it in 1941. This earlier bridge was known to locals as the [...] "Black Bridge" [...] due to wet tar falling from wagons carrying felled timber. The ends of the timber were washed with tar, and on the journey across the bridge the tar would drip onto the road and subsequently be splashed onto the <b>bridge</b> <b>railings.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bridge No. L6007 is a {{single-span}} stone {{arch bridge}} on Skyline Parkway where it crosses Stewart Creek at the Smithville {{neighborhood in the}} southwestern {{part of the city}} of Duluth, Minnesota. The bridge is historically significant because of its picturesque design and setting within a city park. It is built of locally quarried dark green gabbro, which is abundant in the Duluth area. The single arch over a deep ravine is built on rubble abutments, springing about 7 ft above grade and rising 10 ft over a span of 30 ft. The rubble spandrel walls continue back in straight lines to form the retaining walls for the approaches. The <b>bridge</b> <b>railings</b> are topped with double sawtooth-shaped rows of gabbro.

50|$|Passengers {{traveled}} in multi-unit three-car elevated electric trains from 1st, 4th and 7th Street elevated stations and other stations en route between Louisville and New Albany. This rapid transit service was wildly popular, with its 15-minute service and convenient schedules from 6am to midnight, ridership soared exponentially from day one. By 1906 a ridership survey found 3,425 commuter passengers crossing daily and 1,250,000 passengers per year,crossing the K&I Bridge on these rapid electric trains. Even by modern standards {{this would be}} considered a heavily used line.Expenditures made for replacing wooden <b>bridge</b> <b>railings</b> and retrofitting west Louisville wooden el segments with steel, resulted in receivership for the Kentucky and Indiana Bridge Company.

40|$|Bridges {{that are}} {{designated}} historic present a special challenge to bridge engineers whenever rehabilitation work or improvements {{are made to}} the bridges. Federal and state laws protect historically significant bridges, and railings on these bridges can be subject to protection because of the role they play in aesthetics. Unfortunately, original railings on historic bridges do not typically meet current crash-test requirements and typically do not meet current standards for railing height and size of permitted openings. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop strategies that can be used to address existing railings on historic bridges and to develop solutions that meet current design requirements. To achieve this objective, three phases of research were conducted. First, an overview of current practice for addressing historic <b>bridge</b> <b>railings</b> was performed. Second, an investigation was conducted to document historic <b>bridge</b> <b>railings</b> in Indiana. Finally, rehabilitation solutions were developed to address the specific <b>bridge</b> <b>railings</b> found in Indiana.
