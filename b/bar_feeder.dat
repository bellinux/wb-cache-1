40|$|The {{operation}} of active distribution grids with high penetration of Distributed Energy Resources, connected to Medium Voltage <b>bars</b> and <b>feeders,</b> requires {{the implementation of}} new Medium Voltage regulation functions. Assuming that this control function is best positioned in the primary substations of the control hierarchy, the paper presents the architectural changes occurring at both the centre and the substation control levels. Possible cyber risk scenarios and mitigation countermeasures of the new SCADA architecture are discussed, {{in compliance with the}} IEC communication standards and the IEC/NIST cyber security technical recommendations related to the smart grid sector...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{information}} {{representation in the}} manufacturing business has always focused on products with information relating to their design, geometry and required processes. However there is no standardized information model available to represent the manufacturing equipment used to produce such products. This equipment contributes as a significant investment in setting up a CNC manufacturing facility and is considered as a major asset of the business. Thus the authors see a need for an effective model to represent such equipment particularly the most expensive assets namely CNC machining systems. Such a model could represent the machine resource and also its additional auxiliary devices such as workpiece and cutting tool changing mechanisms, <b>bar</b> <b>feeders,</b> pallet/gantry systems and robotic arms. These devices can function with a CNC only when the controller's resource data model can represent their functionality. Currently every machine tool and auxiliary device manufacturer promotes their own resource data models; resulting in a plethora of representation methods which are bespoke and incomplete in terms of representing the entire system's resources. This paper proposes a Unified Manufacturing Resource Model termed UMRM. UMRM {{not only has the}} novel capability to provide the information to define the various elements of the CNC machining system, but also has the added capability to provide support for automation of process planning decision making.

50|$|The {{frame of}} the machine {{consists}} of several rolling bars onto which layers of the quilt sandwich are placed. On {{one side of the}} machine, two rollers, known as the <b>feeder</b> <b>bars,</b> are present with a muslin leader onto which the backing and the quilt top can be attached. Material is attached by sewing pins, a snap system, or sewing zippers to the muslin leaders and then the material is stretched tight over the belly bar, which ensures that the layered material is smooth and taut according to the sewers’ desires.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bar</b> <b>feeder</b> feeds {{a single}} piece of bar stock into the cutting machine. As each part is machined, the cutting tool creates a final cut to {{separate}} the part from the bar stock, and the feeder continues to feed the bar for the next part, allowing for continual operation of the machine. There are two types of bar feeds used in lathe machining: Hydrodynamic bar feeds, which rest the bar stock in a series of channels whilst clamping down on {{the top and bottom of}} the bar, and hydrostatic bar feeds, which hold the bar stock in a feed tube using pressurized oil.|$|E
5000|$|CNC lathes {{and screw}} {{machines}} have accessories called [...] "bar feeders", which hold, guide, {{and feed the}} bar as commanded by the CNC control. More advanced machines may have a [...] "bar loader" [...] which holds multiple bars and feeds them {{one at a time}} into the <b>bar</b> <b>feeder.</b> Bar loaders are like magazines for part blanks (or pallets for milling work) in that they allow lights-out machining. The bar loader is filled with bars (or the magazine or pallet with part blanks) during working hours, and then it runs during the night unattended. Given that there is no human around to detect if something went wrong and the machine should stop, there are various kinds of sensors that are used to detect this, such as load meters, infrared beams, and, in recent years, webcams, which are placed inside the machine tool's enclosure and allow remote viewing of the cutting action.|$|E

40|$|Learning {{is known}} to be {{accompanied}} by induction of c-Fos expression in cortical neurons. However, not all neurons are involved in this process. What the c-Fos expression pattern depends on is still unknown. In the present work we studied whether and to what degree previous animal experience about Task 1 influenced neuronal c-Fos expression in the retrosplenial cortex during acquisition of Task 2. Animals were progressively shaped across days to bar-press for food at {{the left side of the}} experimental chamber (Task 1). This appetitive bar-pressing behavior was shaped by nine stages (" 9 stages" group), five stages (" 5 stages" group) or one intermediate stage (" 1 stage" group). After all animals acquired the first skill and practiced it for five days, the <b>bar</b> and <b>feeder</b> on the left, familiar side of the chamber were inactivated, and the animals were allowed to learn a similar instrumental task at the opposite side of the chamber using another pair of a <b>bar</b> and a <b>feeder</b> (Task 2). The highest number of c-Fos positive neurons was found in the retrosplenial cortex of " 1 stage" animals as compared to the other groups. The number of c-Fos positive neurons in " 5 stages" group animals was significantly lower than in " 1 stage" animals and significantly higher than in " 9 stages" animals. The number of c-Fos positive neurons in the cortex of " 9 stages" animals was significantly higher than in home caged control animals. At the same time, there were no significant differences between groups in such behavioral variables as the number of entrees into the <b>feeder</b> or <b>bar</b> zones during Task 2 learning. Our results suggest that c-Fos expression in the retrosplenial cortex during Task 2 acquisition was influenced by the previous learning history...|$|R
40|$|In the {{activity}} of some factories that use synchronous motors it’s nec-essary to chose and maintain the most rational value of the reactive power provided by the synchronous motors. In {{the context of the}} reduction of the energy consumption and knowing that the power of the synchronous motors is relatively great in the air compressor stations, the approach of the optimal regime of functioning of the synchronous motors, concerning the energy consumption, is necessary. Considering the synchronous motors together with the other consumers fed from the same <b>bars</b> and the <b>feeder</b> cable a functional utility, in the paper as optimising is presented the working regime that assures, on the defined above assembly, the minimal losses of energy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractField {{measurements}} and numerical modelling {{have been used}} to investigate the water-level control of rip current dynamics on a macro-tidal beach. Field data collected over 32 complete tidal cycles, spanning a range of wave and tide conditions, demonstrate that rip current strength and behaviour is modulated at the semi-diurnal frequency by tide-induced changes in the water-level over bar/rip morphology. Peak flow speeds in the rip neck 〈uv〉 correspond to the time of maximum wave breaking 1. 5 h before and after low water. Alongshore-directed water surface gradients ∂η/∂y were measured along the feeder channel and around the ends of the inter-tidal bar, with head differences O(0. 1 m). The numerical model reproduced ∂η/∂y with a good level of skill and showed that ∂η/∂y and 〈uv〉 increase with the proportion of breaking waves Qb over the inter-tidal bar; but 〈uv〉 was maximised during peak Qb, maximum ∂η/∂y occurred when wave breaking moved offshore to the sub-tidal bar and Qb was reduced. Around low water, the forcing of the rip current by the alongshore pressure-driven feeder current was reduced by the decrease in Qb over the <b>bar</b> and <b>feeder</b> regions, but an offshore flow through the rip channel was maintained by a localised intensification of ∂η/∂y around the ends of the inter-tidal bar...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With ever {{increased}} demand for reduced sizes and increased complexity and accuracy, traditional machine tools have become ineffective for machining miniature components. Typical examples include dental implants, the parts used in mechanical watch movement, and the parts used in medical endoscope. With complex geometry and tight tolerance, few machine tools are capable of making them. This paper introduces our PC-based CNC Turn-Mill Machining Center. It has 5 axes, an automatic <b>bar</b> <b>feeder,</b> an automatic part collection tray, and a tool changer. In particularly, it has a special synchronization control algorithm that gives not only higher accuracy but also ease of use. In addition, to improve the accuracy, the software based volumetric error compensation system is implemented. Based on the experiment testing, the machining error is ± 3 µm in turning, ± 7 µm in milling and the maximum profile error is less than ± 7. 5 µm in gear hobbing. ...|$|E
