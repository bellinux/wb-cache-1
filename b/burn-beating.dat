50|$|During the 19th century <b>burn-beating</b> {{was still}} {{essential}} in agriculture but in decline. In {{the end of}} 18th century tar production had arrived to the area as a new and steadily growing source of income. In the year 1900 tar production in Kuhmo was highest in Finland, at 1.6 million litres. Tar was shipped from Kuhmo to Oulu by rowboats. Largest boats could carry 25 - 27 barrels, 125 litres each. Remainings of tar pits, where tar was distilled from pine, can be found everywhere at Kuhmo area.|$|E
50|$|Attention {{is paid to}} the {{national}} landscape and geology in a zone which covers the highest tops of Koli. The cultural zone is located quite near a village. In the culture zone, the multiformity of the traditional landscapes is maintained by <b>burn-beating,</b> by grazing, and by managing open fields by among other methods, mowing. The yard circles with their old buildings on the open field and on the pasturage graze the pearls of the burn-beaten area culture {{in the middle of}} the open man-made landscape lined by the koivikko, the kyytt√∂ and sheep. The multiform flora of open fields, in particular, need annual maintenance mowing in order to be preserved. To the nature zone the forest nature of dangers is protected. The nature of Koli's terrain is well-varied, and thanks to it, there are a large number of different biotopes even in a small area, and thus a great variety of multiform species. The rocky terrain is fairly rugged, but with dense growths of old spruces and birches on valley slopes.|$|E
40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{quantitative}} and qualitative development of homicide in eastern Finland {{in the second half}} of the eighteenth century and the early years of the nineteenth. The area studied comprised northern Savo and northern Karelia in eastern Finland. At that time, these were completely agricultural regions on the periphery of the kingdom of Sweden. Indeed the majority of the population still got their living from <b>burn-beating</b> agriculture. The analysis of homicide there reveals characteristics that were exceptional by Western European standards: the large proportion of premeditated homicides (murders) and those within the family is more reminiscent of modern cities in the West than of a pre-modern rural society. However, there also existed some archaic forms of Western crime there. Most of the homicides within the family were killings of brothers or brothers-in law, connected with the family structure (the extended family) that prevailed in the region. This study uses case analysis to explore the causes for the increase in both familial homicide and murder in the area. One of the explanatory factors that is dealt with is the interaction between the faltering penal practice that then existed and the increase in certain types of homicide. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} on {{the origin}} and evolutionary trends in the Mediterranean weedy vegetation is presented, {{with reference to the}} phytosociological units to which they are ascribed: Stellarietea mediae, Papaveretea rhoeadis, Oryzetea sativae. It is postulated that the &ldquo;Neolithic revolution&rdquo; was more likely a &ldquo;Neolithic evolution&rdquo;, i. e. the result of a process of selection and demographic growth that lasted for at least 10000 yrs, before leading to the domestication of plants and animals. During this very long time, wild crop relatives were simply growing together with the wild weed relatives, in their original milieu. At the beginning of agriculture, fields were obtained to the detriment of oak-woods and maquis-vegetation; the deforestation had probably a patchy pattern, resulting from the <b>burn-beating</b> practice, and the annual plants from the vegetation around the fields were probably quite abundant also within the fields, at least those having the most prolific seed set, the most durable seeds and the most effective dispersal strategies, together with a diachronic, life-long, flowering and seed-dispersal. These features, apparently in contrast with the achievement of a within-population- organizational hierarchy, are in reality an extreme expression of the attitude of weedy plant species in &ldquo;amplifying adaptation&rdquo;, or, in other words, of its &ldquo;adaptation to adapt&rdquo;, which is the cornerstone of the opportunistic life strategy. The Mediterranean weedy vegetation is therefore a flexible system, able to cope with changes and disturbances: species frequency and composition may undergo great variations, but the functional role of any weedy community keeps...|$|E
