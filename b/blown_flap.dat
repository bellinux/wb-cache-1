50|$|A type of Boundary Layer Control System, blown flaps pass engine-generated air or exhaust {{over the}} flaps to {{increase}} lift beyond that attainable with mechanical flaps. Types include the original (internally <b>blown</b> <b>flap)</b> which blows compressed {{air from the}} engine {{over the top of}} the flap, the externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> which blows engine exhaust over the upper and lower surfaces of the flap, and upper surface blowing which blows engine exhaust {{over the top of the}} wing and flap. While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown flaps wasn't until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar. Upper Surface Blowing was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} foils, {{both natural and}} man-made, seen both in air and water, have {{features}} that delay or control the onset of lift-induced drag, flow separation, and stall (see Bird flight, Fin, Airfoil, Placoid scale, Tubercle, Vortex generator, Canard (close-coupled), <b>Blown</b> <b>flap,</b> Leading edge slot, Leading edge slats), as well as Wingtip vortices (see Winglet).|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{production}} aircraft with <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> was the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter which entered service in January 1958. After prolonged development problems, the BLCS proved to be enormously useful in compensating for the Starfighter's tiny wing surface. The Lockheed T2V SeaStar, with <b>blown</b> <b>flaps,</b> had entered service in May 1957 but was to have persistent maintenance problems with the BLCS which led to its early retirement. In June 1958 the Supermarine Scimitar with <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> entered service. Blown flaps were used on the North American Aviation A-5 Vigilante, the Vought F-8 Crusader variants E(FN) and J, the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the Blackburn Buccaneer. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 had <b>blown</b> <b>flaps.</b> Petrov states long-term operation of these aircraft showed high reliability of the BLC systems. The TSR-2, which was cancelled before it entered service, had full-span <b>blown</b> <b>flaps.</b>|$|R
40|$|Basic {{principles}} {{relating to}} the accomplishment of V/STOL flight are reviewed as they pertain to current prototype developments. Particular consideration {{is given to the}} jet flap, flow augmentation and circulation control separately and in combination. Configurations as the augmentor wing, upper-surface <b>blown</b> <b>flaps,</b> externally <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> and the circulation-controlled rotor are also examined...|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} of the jet flap, a type of internally <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> was proposed and patented in 1952 by the British National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) and thereafter investigated by the NGTE and the Royal Aircraft Establishment.The concept was first tested at full-scale on the experimental Hunting H.126. It reduced the stall speed to only 32 mi/h km/h, a number most light aircraft cannot match. The jet flap used {{a large percentage of}} the engine exhaust, rather than compressor bleed air, for blowing.|$|E
50|$|The lift of a wing can {{be greatly}} {{increased}} with blowing flow control. With mechanical slots the natural boundary layer limits the boundary layer control {{pressure to the}} freestream total head. Blowing with {{a small proportion of}} engine airflow (internal <b>blown</b> <b>flap)</b> increases the lift. Using much higher quantities of gas from the engine exhaust, which increases the effective chord of the flap (the jet flap), produces supercirculation, or forced circulation up to the theoretical potential flow maximum. Surpassing this limit requires the addition of direct thrust.|$|E
5000|$|Powered {{high-lift}} systems generally use airflow {{from the}} engine to shape the flow of air over the wing, replacing or modifying {{the action of the}} flaps. Blown flaps take [...] "bleed air" [...] from the jet engine's compressor or engine exhaust and blow it over the rear upper surface of the wing and flap, re-energising the boundary layer and allowing the airflow to remain attached at higher angles of attack. A more advanced version of the <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> is the circulation control wing, a mechanism that ejects air backwards over a specially designed airfoil to create lift through the Coandă effect.|$|E

40|$|As {{aircraft}} grow {{in size to}} {{meet the}} ever-increasing demand from the international traveling public, the limits imposed by current airport facilities become apparent. Continual growth of environmental awareness within the community and noise reduction requirements, combined {{with the issue of}} long takeoff and landing runs required by the large jet transport aircraft, create problems for engineers. The implementation of externally <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> would allow for steeper approach paths pertaining to a reduction in noise pollution and reduce the takeoff and landing distance required. The reduction in the distance required for aircraft operations will allow for an increase in the size of aircraft or operations from fields that were previously unavailable. The introduction of externally <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> has occurred on a production aircraft, the C- 17 Globemaster III, in use with the United States Air Force. The advantages provided by the system are obvious, improving the aircraft’s takeoff and landing performance dramatically. This study focuses on a computational fluid dynamics analysis of the three-dimensional flow characteristics of the externally <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> configuration for transport aircraft and future unmanned aerial vehicles operating in remote areas. The study compares two- and three-dimensional analysis with and without externally <b>blown</b> <b>flaps,</b> increasing understanding of the vital elements of the system so as to allow the possibility of further implementation of externally <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> in improving the airline industry in regard to airway congestion...|$|R

5000|$|Development of {{the general}} concept {{continued}} at NASA in the 1950s and 60s, leading to simplified systems with similar performance. The externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> arranges the engine to blow across the flaps {{at the rear of}} the wing. Some of the jet exhaust is deflected downward directly by the flap, while additional air travels through the slots in the flap and follows the outer edge due to the Coandă effect. The similar upper-surface blowing system arranges the engines over the wing and relies completely on the Coandă effect to redirect the airflow. Although not as effective as direct blowing, these [...] "powered lift" [...] systems are nevertheless quite powerful and much simpler to build and maintain.|$|E
50|$|In mid-1970, the USAF began a paper study, the Tactical Aircraft Investigation (TAI), with Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, {{and other}} {{companies}} to look at possible tactical transport aircraft designs. This study was a precursor to what became the Advanced Medium STOL Transport program. As {{a part of this}} program, Boeing began to look at various high-lift aircraft configurations. Boeing had earlier proposed an underwing externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> solution for their competitor for the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, and had put this to good use when they modified their losing entry into the Boeing 747. They had also done studies with the original Boeing 707 prototype, the Boeing 367-80, adding extensive leading and trailing edge devices using blown flaps. For the TAI studies, Boeing again looked at those mechanisms, as well as new mechanisms like boundary layer control. However, none of these studied designs were particularly appealing to Boeing.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{conventional}} <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> {{a small amount}} of the compressed air produced by the jet engine is [...] "bled" [...] off at the compressor stage and piped to channels running along the rear of the wing. There, it is forced through slots in the wing flaps of the aircraft when the flaps reach certain angles. Injecting high energy air into the boundary layer produces an increase in the stalling angle of attack and maximum lift coefficient by delaying boundary layer separation from the airfoil. Boundary layer control by mass injecting (blowing) prevents boundary layer separation by supplying additional energy to the particles of fluid which are being retarded in the boundary layer. Therefore, injecting a high velocity air mass into the air stream essentially tangent to the wall surface of the airfoil reverses the boundary layer friction deceleration thus the boundary layer separation is delayed.|$|E
50|$|In general, <b>blown</b> <b>flaps</b> {{can improve}} the lift of a wing by two to three times. Whereas a complex triple-slotted flap system on a Boeing 747 {{produces}} a coefficient of lift of about 2.45, external blowing (upper surface blowing on a YC-14) improves this to about 7, and internal <b>blowing</b> (jet <b>flap</b> on Hunting H.126) to 9.|$|R
50|$|The Lim-5M was {{regarded}} {{only as an}} interim variant, and work on a more advanced plane continued, testing many different ideas. In 1961, 40 Lim-6 attack aircraft were built. They introduced new <b>blown</b> <b>flaps,</b> but tests showed problems with the modified Lis-6 jet engine and the aircraft were not given to the Air Force. As a result, {{it was decided to}} redesign the thick wing sections with fuel tanks, <b>blown</b> <b>flaps,</b> double wheels and RATO and return to only slightly modified Lim-5 construction, with increased weapon-carrying capability instead.|$|R

40|$|Noise {{measurements}} were obtained on models of jet-augmented lift systems which {{are currently being}} considered for use on proposed short takeoff and landing vehicles. These configurations included a conventional internally <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> an augmenter wing, an externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> and modifications of these basic concepts. The tests were conducted in the Langley anechoic noise facility at zero forward speed with cold air jets. The conventional internally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> exhibited lower noise levels than the augmenter wing and the externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> {{at the same pressure}} ratios, being of the order of 8 dB or more at the lowest pressure ratio and of the order of 20 dB at the highest pressure ratio of the tests. The data also indicated that for the conventional internally <b>blown</b> <b>flap,</b> there may be an optimum gap size (other than zero) between the turning lip and the flap leading edge from the standpoint of minimum noise generation or admittance. Increasing the trailing-edge thickness of the plain internally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> produced no appreciable change in the overall sound pressure level or frequency spectral content in the range of the tests. The data indicated that at a position on the ground directly under the jet exit, the externally <b>blown</b> <b>flap</b> and the augmeter-wing overall noise levels are comparable to each other throughout the pressure range of the tests.
