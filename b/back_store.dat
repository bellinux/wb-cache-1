50|$|A cache {{is made up}} of a pool of entries. Each entry has {{associated}} data, {{which is}} a copy of the same data in some <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> Each entry also has a tag, which specifies the identity of the data in the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> of which the entry is a copy.|$|R
50|$|The dirty bit {{allows for}} a {{performance}} optimization. A page on disk that is paged in to physical memory, then read from, and subsequently paged out again {{does not need to}} be written back to disk, since the page has not changed. However, if the page was written to after it is paged in, its dirty bit will be set, indicating that the page must be written back to the <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> This strategy requires that the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> retain a copy of the page after it is paged in to memory. When a dirty bit is not used, the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> need only be as large as the instantaneous total size of all paged-out pages at any moment. When a dirty bit is used, at all times some pages will exist in both physical memory and the <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b>|$|R

50|$|Healthy Back, {{also known}} as The Healthy <b>Back</b> <b>Store,</b> is chain of stores {{centered}} in Maryland and Virginia that sells products aimed at helping people with back pain or other physical conditions.

50|$|The bitmap {{output from}} Quartz 2D, OpenGL, Core Image, QuickTime, or other process is written to a {{specific}} memory location, or <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> The Compositor then reads {{the data from the}} <b>backing</b> <b>stores</b> and assembles each into one image for the display, writing that image to the frame buffer memory of the graphics card. Quartz Compositor only accepts raster data, and is the only process that can directly access the graphics frame buffer.|$|R
5000|$|A write-through cache uses no-write allocate. Here, {{subsequent}} writes have no advantage, {{since they}} {{still need to be}} written directly to the <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{write-back}} cache is {{more complex}} to implement, since it needs to track which of its locations have been written over, and mark them as dirty for later writing to the <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> The data in these locations are written back to the <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> only when they are evicted from the cache, an effect {{referred to as a}} lazy write. For this reason, a read miss in a write-back cache (which requires a block to be replaced by another) will often require two memory accesses to service: one to write the replaced data from the cache <b>back</b> to the <b>store,</b> and then one to retrieve the needed data.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Healthy <b>Back</b> <b>Store</b> {{acquired}} three Natural Back Stores in California, bringing the chain to 8 locations. Healthy Back bought out the Maryland-based Joanne's Bed and Back chain of stores for $600,000 in 2008 following the latter's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier that year. At {{the time of}} the merger, Healthy Back's sales were $40 million per year, and Joanne's $10 million. Joanne's had played a role in Mazlish's entry into the back business, when he purchased a back cushion from the chain's Tyson's Corner location upon first moving to the District in 1993.|$|E
5000|$|The first Relax The <b>Back</b> <b>store</b> {{opened in}} Austin, Texas in 1984.

[...] In 1996, having grown the chain to 59 stores, Rogers sold the company to a franchisee, Dairl Johnson, for $6 million. Johnson continued to develop the company's independent franchising model. Relax The Back corporate offices are currently located in La Palma, California.|$|E
5000|$|The first VTL {{solution}} was an IBM Virtual Tape Server (VTS) introduced in 1997. It was targeted for a mainframe market, where many legacy applications {{tend to use}} a lot of very short tape volumes. It used ESCON interface, and acted as a disk cache for 3494 tape library. A competitive offering from StorageTek (acquired in 2005 by SUN Microsystems, then subsequently by Oracle Corporation) was known as Virtual Storage Manager (VSM) which leveraged the market dominant STK Powderhorn library as a <b>back</b> <b>store.</b> Each product line has been enhanced to support larger disk buffer capacities, FICON, and more recently (c. 2010) [...] "tapeless" [...] disk-only environments.|$|E

40|$|The largest cost in {{servicing}} {{virtual memory}} page faults {{is the time}} needed to swap pages to and from <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> With the increase in portable machines connected to a network across slow wireless links, this cost could become unacceptable. One solution is to use a compression cache, keeping some virtual memory pages in compressed form rather than sending them to the <b>backing</b> <b>store.</b> We have implemented a compression cache similar to previous work with some additional optimizations designed to manage the compressed pages more effectively. We measured page fault and compression counts using a variety of test programs, and applied architecture-specific numbers to determine the effectiveness of a compression cache under many different situations. We also determine the effectiveness of our optimizations. Also measured is the usefulness of virtual memory compression when there is no access to a <b>backing</b> <b>store</b> at all. Results show that a compression cache is useful under a wide variety of po [...] ...|$|R

His earliest experience in broadcasting was on the intercom system of Calvin Coolidge High School in Washington, D.C. in the 1950s. His upbeat, entertaining patter that was to become his trademark made his sports report a welcome treat for the kids. During this period he worked part-time at Baker's Shoe Store downtown, as a salesman. Many customers must have been puzzled at the ball park hawker's refrain of, [...] "Get your hot dogs, get your hot doggies here" [...] coming from the <b>back</b> <b>store</b> room. He was simply entertaining the staff and the customers, something he was to continue throughout his long career.|$|E

(Right) Screenshot from a pose close to the left images with overlaid building outline. This paper presents a model-based hybrid tracking system for outdoor augmented reality in urban environments enabling accurate, realtime overlays for a handheld device. The system combines several well-known approaches to provide a robust experience that surpasses each of the individual components alone: an edge-based tracker for accurate localisation, gyroscope measurements to deal with fast motions, measurements of gravity and magnetic field to avoid drift, and a <b>back</b> <b>store</b> of reference frames with online frame selection to re-initialise automatically after dynamic occlusions or failures. A novel edge-based tracker dispenses with the conventional edge model, and uses instead a coarse, but textured, 3 D model. This yields several advantages: scale-based detail culling is automatic, appearance-based edge signatures {{can be used to}} improve matching and the models needed are more commonly available. The accuracy and robustness of the resulting system is demonstrated with comparisons to map-based ground truth data...|$|E
