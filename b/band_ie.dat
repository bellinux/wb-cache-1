Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice.|$|E

50|$|Itoiz was {{the name}} of a Basque music band from the coastal towns of Mutriku and Ondarroa, started off in 1978 and disbanded in 1988.

50|$|The 15 meter band is {{considered}} a DX <b>band</b> (<b>i.e.,</b> used for long-distance communications). Since signals on 15 meters propagate primarily via reflection off of the F-2 layer of the ionosphere, the band is most useful for intercontinental communication during daylight hours, especially in years close to the solar maximum. However, the band also sees long-distance openings during solar minima, and into evening hours, and does not require high-power station equipment to make contacts even at these times.|$|E

This spin orbit coupling removes the spins degeneracy in both the conduction and valence <b>band</b> <b>i.e.</b> introduces a strong energy splitting between spin up and down states. In the case of MoS2, the spin splitting in conduction band is in the meV range, {{it is expected to}} be more pronounced in other material like WS2. The spin orbit splitting in the valence band is several hundred meV.|$|E

Such decision would help standarize CBTC systems across the market (a growing demand from most operators) and ensure availability for those critical systems.|$|R

50|$|The album has {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with most of}} the criticism to do with the album's departure from Steps' previous work and how it could alienate the group's fan base. Despite it not being particularly groundbreaking, the album has been highly praised for being technically proficient. The decision to include mostly covers has been questioned, and some of the individual song choices (which are depressing in nature) have baffled some critics, who criticised the new sound as neither reminiscent of Steps nor Christmas.

In {{order to}} directly quantify {{the rate of}} change of the subband temporal envelopes and possible cross-frequency interactions, modulation frequency bins are further grouped into four bands empirically designed to coincide with the range of the first four conventional frequency <b>bands</b> (<b>i.e.,</b> delta-beta). This choice was driven by the fact that, by definition of the Hilbert transform, the envelope signal can only contain frequencies (i.e., modulation frequencies) up to the maximum frequency of its originating signal (i.e., following the so-called Bedrosian’s theorem [46, 47]). As such, gamma-level modulation frequencies would only be present in the gamma frequency band. Hence, to reduce data dimensionality, the so-called gamma modulation band is not considered here.|$|R
