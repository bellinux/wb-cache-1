5|$|Thanks to {{a charge}} by Conrad, the crusaders managed to {{fight their way}} through and chase the {{defenders}} <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Barada river and into Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Domitian quickly {{launched}} a counteroffensive, personally travelling {{to the region}} accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect Cornelius Fuscus. Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the border in mid-85, prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph.|$|E
5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction {{of the muscle}} cell.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Pettifer, still strangely moved, and {{now more}} moved than before, cut the captain off as he <b>backed</b> <b>across</b> the room, and bespake him thus:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Wal. A {{very pretty}} quarrel! matter enough To spoil a waggon-load of ash-staves on, And break a dozen fools' <b>backs</b> <b>across</b> their cantlets. What's Lewis doing? ...|$|R
60|$|Eddie <b>backed</b> <b>across</b> {{the office}} to a table where stood a small lamp. Keeping an eye through the door on his {{prisoner}} he lighted the lamp and carried it into the back room, setting it upon a commode which stood in one corner.|$|R
5|$|On 27 November {{the brigade}} secured a {{bridgehead}} over the river. To help defend the crossing, the 3rd and 11th Squadrons dug {{in on the}} northern bank. The next day, at 14:45, the squadrons were attacked and by 17:45, first the horse holders and the regiment's mounts were sent <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the river. The squadrons were forced to retire to {{the lines of the}} supporting infantry. By 20:00 the entire British position was under threat and had to withdraw <b>back</b> <b>across</b> to the south of the river. The regiment's casualties were one dead, one missing and nineteen wounded, including Whitehorn. Command of the regiment temporarily passed to Major Duncan Munro.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{interest}} in the Caucasus soon waned after Peter's death in 1725 as its leaders pulled their forces <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Terek River. and the gained territories in the North and South Caucasus were ceded back to Iran (now led by Nader Shah) per the treaties of Resht and Ganja of 1732 and 1735, respeticely.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} five North Korean T-34 tanks crossed {{the river and}} moved toward Hamch'ang. Artillery fire from A Battery of the 90th Field Artillery Battalion knocked out four of the tanks immediately. The fifth moved <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the river, where an air strike later {{destroyed}} it.|$|E

60|$|The car <b>backed</b> <b>across</b> the {{rattling}} gravel, and the girl's figure {{faded into}} the gloom; then John turned the wheel and they shot forward down the drive. The lights of the other car vanished, there was a splash as they swung into the wet road, and Foster pulled the rug around him when he had struck a match and noted the time.|$|R
50|$|A senton {{is similar}} to a normal splash. Instead of {{impacting}} stomach first, the wrestler lands <b>back</b> first <b>across</b> the opponent.|$|R
5|$|With the {{infantry}} heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked {{its way across}} the Nebel. After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, Prince Maximilian of Hanover, were pressed by the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Nebel in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks. However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band was going <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Mississippi and would fight no more. No {{one in the}} American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|As the Dorniers passed Sheerness, the {{anti-aircraft}} defences opened fire {{to protect the}} naval yard at Chatham, Kent. Along the south bank of the Thames Estuary 15 gun positions fired six 4.5in of 3.7in heavy shells. The German bombers opened up a little, to spread out. The cloud over the target ruined the German bomb run, and some bombers began the return trip with their loads still on board. While crossing the coast over Deal, Kent, three attacked the Royal Marines barracks there. They continued <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Channel, having made no contact with enemy fighters.|$|E

5|$|By nightfall on 18 August, the North Korean 4th Division {{had been}} annihilated; {{huge numbers of}} deserters had {{weakened}} its numbers during the fight, but by that time, Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the U.S. forces. Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Naktong, pursued by American planes and artillery fire. The next day, the remains of 4th Division had withdrawn across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left {{a large number of}} artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans later pressed into service.|$|E
5|$|Centre then {{defeated}} Kentucky 55–0. McMillin {{had three}} touchdowns. In {{the middle of}} the second quarter, up 70, McMillin skirted left end and cut <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the field for a 49-yard touchdown. Herb Covington next had a 39-yard touchdown. In the fourth, a 30-yard pass to Roberts was followed shortly by a 35-yard pass to Hennie Lemon for the touchdown. Bobby Lavin starred for the Wildcats.|$|E
5|$|Colonel William E. Peters {{was able}} to get his 21st Virginia Cavalry Regiment ready for the {{oncoming}} Union cavalry, but was driven <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the river. Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland had him arrested. However, the arrest was revoked a short time later, and Peters led the rear guard when they left the burning town. He performed relatively well at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they slowed the Federal advance {{on the south side of}} the river.|$|E
60|$|Alice Deringham {{held her}} breath as, while a third beat of hoofs grew louder behind, Alton {{gathered}} up the bridle and drove his heels home. The horse, frightened by the clamour, reared almost upright and then <b>backed</b> <b>across</b> the trail, while the girl wondered with a tense anxiety whether the man would look up. Then {{for just a second}} he turned his head, and saw her standing on the verandah with a blaze in her cheeks and a dimness in her eyes.|$|R

5|$|Notable German burials include Musketier Oskar Niemeyer {{from the}} 84th Infantry Regiment {{was the first}} {{recipient}} of the Iron Cross during the war. Having come to a crossing of the Mons–Condé canal with a closed swing bridge he swam across the canal, returned across the canal with a requisitioned small boat, paddled <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the canal with a team and then opened the bridge allowing the Germans troops to cross in greater numbers. He was killed shortly after opening the bridge.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April {{the second}} raid across the Jordan began, their {{objective}} to capture Es Salt. This time {{a much larger}} force was involved under command of the Desert Mounted Corps. The regiment and brigade {{were part of the}} force assigned to attack Shunet Nimrin. Once again they advanced through Turkish artillery fire, and confronted by Turkish strong points in the foothills, were unable to make any progress. That night they moved <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Jordan, having suffered three dead and eleven wounded.|$|E
50|$|In 1796 {{a purpose}} built sailing boat called The Packet began a regular service between Portsmouth and Ryde and by 1811 two daily return trips were {{made between the}} Bugle Inn in Ryde and the Quebec Tavern in Portsmouth. At this time, on arrival at Ryde, the boats, known as Ryde Wherries, had to anchor a {{considerable}} distance away from the shore and passengers were transported by horse, cart or on men's <b>backs</b> <b>across</b> the wide and shallow sands to the town. This problem was resolved in 1814 when Ryde Pier was completed.|$|R
60|$|After {{setting up}} the broken door as best they could, the men left the {{apartment}} {{and when they were}} again alone Metak turned toward the girl. As he approached her, his face distorted by a hideous leer, his features worked rapidly in spasmodic twitches. The girl, who was standing at the entrance of the alcove, shrank back, her horror reflected in her face. Step by step she <b>backed</b> <b>across</b> the room, while the crouching maniac crept stealthily after her with claw-like fingers poised in anticipation of the moment they should leap forth and seize her.|$|R

5|$|The 22nd also participated, {{in a minor}} capacity, in the Battle of Chancellorsville. On April 27, Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin's division, {{including}} the 22nd, was ordered to secure the fords along the Rapidan River. It was a long, rapid, forced march for the division. The Confederate army launched a daring and successful flank attack against the Army of the Potomac at Chancellorsville on May 2, 1863, during which the 22nd saw little action. The Union army, badly defeated, retreated <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the Rappahannock and the 22nd returned to Camp Gove on May 8.|$|E
5|$|The Danish cavalry, {{under the}} Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt (not to be {{confused}} with the Duke of Württemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened on}} 17December 2015, with a bridge walk, in which Sheet Harbour {{residents}} {{walked across the}} old bridge to commemorate its closure, then walked <b>back</b> <b>across</b> the new bridge signifying its opening. That same day, the new bridge was opened for pedestrians, and open to traffic the following day. The new bridge has a projected lifespan of at least 75years, until 2090. It also has a sidewalk, which connects to Sheet Harbour's current sidewalk system. Officials hope this will encourage active transportation.|$|E
