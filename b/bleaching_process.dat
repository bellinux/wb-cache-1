Crude laccase enzyme was used for pretreatment of <b>bleaching</b> <b>processes</b> on unbleached kraft pulp Acacia mangium. Optimisation of biobleaching was conducted by Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Three significant factors which were pH, temperature and reaction time were studied to evaluate the decrease of Kappa Number.

There were no significant effects to pulp viscosity, fiber length, and brightness on the biobleaching pretreatment. The reduction of AOX about 30 % was demonstrated by using crude laccase biobleaching pretreatment.

50|$|Having {{acquired}} his bleachfield, Charles {{turned his}} mind and energy to developing ways to shorten the time required in bleaching.

50|$|Chemical pulps, such {{as those}} from the kraft process or sulfite pulping, contain much less lignin than {{mechanical}} pulps, (<5% compared to approximately 40%).

Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) was initially used to bleach chemical pulps, but was largely replaced in the 1930s by chlorine.

40|$|Chlorine {{bleaching}} effluents are {{problematic for}} anaerobic wastewater treatment {{due to their}} high methanogenic toxicity and low biodegradability. Presently, alternative <b>bleaching</b> <b>processes</b> are being introduced, such as elemental chlorine-free (ECF) and total chlorine-free (TCF) bleaching. The methanogenic toxicity and anaerobic biodegradability of ECF and TCF bleaching effluents from oxygen-delignified eucalyptus Kraft pulp were {{compared with those of}} different chlorine bleaching sequences. The effluents from chlorine and ECF bleaching sequences had similar methanogenic toxicities, with 50 % inhibiting concentrations (50 % IC) of 0. 65 - 1. 48 g-COD/litre. Only the TCF bleaching effluent was distinctly less toxic, with a 50 % IC of 2. 3 g-COD/litre. The fact that the ECF bleaching effluent was not less toxic than that of chlorine bleaching, as well as the residual toxicity of TCF, indicate that other substances aside from organohalogens contribute to the high methanogenic toxicity in bleaching effluents. Literature data is presented suggesting that wood resin compounds released by alkaline extraction stages might be important inhibitory substances in all <b>bleaching</b> <b>processes.</b> Oxygen-delignified! <b>bleaching</b> effluents of eucalyptus were found to be highly biodegradable. When tested at subtoxic concentrations, the chlorine and TCF bleaching effluent COD were anaerobically degraded by 67 and 75 %, respectively: In both cases, methane production accounted for most of the COD removed.
