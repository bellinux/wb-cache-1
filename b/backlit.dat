5|$|Reception of the Game Gear was mixed, with {{praise for}} its full-color <b>backlit</b> screen and {{processing}} power for its time, criticisms over its large size and short battery life, and questions over {{the quality of}} its game library.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{resolution}} Voyager 2 images {{revealed a}} pronounced clumpiness in the arcs, with a typical separation between visible clumps of 0.1° to 0.2°, which corresponds to 100–200km along the ring. Because the clumps were not resolved, they {{may or may}} not include larger bodies, but are certainly associated with concentrations of microscopic dust as evidenced by their enhanced brightness when <b>backlit</b> by the Sun.|$|E
5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days before or after inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is <b>backlit</b> by the Sun. The planet is bright enough {{to be seen in}} a clear midday sky and is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still <b>backlit,</b> are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is <b>backlit</b> by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and <b>backlit</b> them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren <b>backlit</b> Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E
25|$|Low power consumption. Depending {{on the set}} display {{brightness}} and content being displayed, the older CCFT <b>backlit</b> models typically use {{less than half of}} the power a CRT monitor of the same size viewing area would use, and the modern LED <b>backlit</b> models typically use 10–25% of the power a CRT monitor would use.|$|E
25|$|For {{animation}} in {{the stellar}} cartography set, the <b>backlit</b> starmaps were removed, and a bluescreen was rolled into place, {{replaced by a}} computer-animated star map composited in post-production. The star maps were created by Santa Barbara Studios.|$|E
25|$|Some {{models have}} a 2x <b>backlit</b> {{exposure}} switch and a 10 sec timer switch. When the timer is engaged, a flashing LED indicates the timer counter is counting down, {{for the last}} two sec, the flash interval shortened.|$|E
25|$|The Uruguayan Air Force updated its fleet {{with the}} {{incorporation}} of Litton LTN-211 and GPS omega navigation systems. Minor structure modifications were made in order to carry the Mk. 82 Snakeye bomb and 1000-litre drop tank. Other avionics incorporated were the WX-500 Stormscope by L3 Communications and LED Sandel SN3500 <b>backlit</b> display navigation.|$|E
25|$|An {{underground}} loop for the 510 Spadina streetcar {{was added}} in 1997 near {{the east end}} of the east–west platforms. The streetcar platform adds Postmodern finishes to the station's mix of styles. These range from the basic Modernist tiles of the Bloor–Danforth line platform, to the more intricate round tiles and <b>backlit</b> signage of the Yonge–University line platform.|$|E
25|$|The MacBook Air is {{designed}} for thinness, and is also lighter than most competing models. The computer features an anti-glare LED <b>backlit</b> display and a full-size keyboard, {{as well as a}} large trackpad that responds to multi-touch gestures such as pinching, swiping, and rotating. With the release of Snow Leopard, the Air's trackpad also supports handwriting recognition of Chinese characters.|$|E
25|$|Wall {{experimented with}} {{conceptual}} art while an undergraduate at UBC. He then made no art until 1977, when he produced his first <b>backlit</b> phototransparencies. Many {{of these are}} staged and refer {{to the history of}} art and philosophical problems of representation. Their compositions often allude to artists like Diego Velázquez, Hokusai, and Édouard Manet, or to writers such as Franz Kafka, Yukio Mishima, and Ralph Ellison.|$|E
25|$|Since LCD panels produce {{no light}} of their own, they require {{external}} light to produce a visible image. In a transmissive type of LCD, this light is provided {{at the back of}} the glass stack and is called the backlight. While passive-matrix displays are usually not <b>backlit</b> (e.g. calculators, wristwatches), active-matrix displays almost always are. Over the last years (1990 - 2017), the LCD backlight technologies have strongly been emerged by lighting companies such as Philips, Lumileds (a Philips subsidiary) and more.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{paper and}} e-paper are display devices that mimic the {{appearance}} of ordinary ink on paper. Unlike conventional <b>backlit</b> flat panel displays that emit light, electronic paper displays reflect light like paper. This may make them more comfortable to read, and provide a wider viewing angle than most light-emitting displays. The contrast ratio in electronic displays available as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly (2008) developed displays are slightly better. An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight without the image appearing to fade.|$|E
25|$|The Samsung SUR40 is a 40-inch (102cm) 16:9 LED <b>backlit</b> LCD display (1920×1080) with {{integrated}} PC and PixelSense technology, which {{replaces the}} {{cameras in the}} previous product. PixelSense technology enables Samsung and Microsoft to reduce {{the thickness of the}} product from 22 in (56cm) to 4 in (10cm). The size reduction enables the product to be placed horizontally, and adds the capability to be mounted vertically while retaining the ability to recognize fingers, tags, blobs and utilize raw vision data. Samsung produces the hardware and Microsoft produces the software platform for the SUR40.|$|E
25|$|On 4 June 1990, Granada Television, in {{the run-up}} to the 1990 {{franchise}} round, relaunched its on-screen branding to a blue stripe descending from the top of the screen, containing the pointed 'G', against a plain white background accompanied by the same music as previously. Variations were seen from which the stripe formed from a falling feather or was <b>backlit.</b> On 11 May 1992, the stripe descended to reveal a rainbow of colours before becoming the usual blue and this ident stays on screen until 1 January 1995.|$|E
25|$|Other numeric-display {{technologies}} concurrently in use included <b>backlit</b> columnar transparencies ("thermometer displays"), light pipes, rear-projection and edge-lit lightguide displays (all using individual incandescent or neon {{light bulbs}} for illumination), Numitron incandescent filament readouts, Panaplex seven-segment displays, and vacuum fluorescent display tubes. Before Nixie tubes became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly {{by use of}} cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by wiring the outputs of stepping switches to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of stepping switch to drive Nixie tubes.|$|E
25|$|The Zen Touch has {{a smaller}} form factor and larger <b>backlit</b> blue display in a curved {{industrial}} design. In addition, the device uses a touch-sensitive vertical strip {{on the front}} of the unit for easier file navigation. These changes were enabled by the use of Hitachi's smaller 1.8-inch hard drives. The Touch is available in capacities of 20 and 40GB. Unlike the previous two generations, the Zen Touch does not have a removable battery, and plays audio for approximately 24 hours. Even though the battery is not removable, it can be replaced rather easily since the case is closed with screws only and the battery attaches with a connector.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Hayes {{worked on}} the {{building}} from 1956 to 1970 and {{was responsible for the}} creation of the iconic 'BBC Television Centre' lettering on the façade of Studio 1. The lettering was later used all over the building, even in tile work outside lift entrances. Demands from Broadcasting House meant that Hayes had less time than he had thought to design a decor for the façade, leading to him puncturing a scale foam model of the wall with drawing pins, and thus the birth of the iconic 'Atomic Dots': there are 26 across the façade of Studio 1, each one <b>backlit</b> and clearly visible at night.|$|E
25|$|The script {{called for}} an entirely new {{location}} on the Enterprise, stellar cartography. According to Zimmerman, the script characterized the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a circular set with three stories {{to give the impression}} the actors are inside a star map. Zimmerman's previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design, dominated by video screens. Before the rise of large-format inkjet printers and computer graphics software in the few years before the film was made, the <b>backlit</b> starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create. The set's size made it one of the largest sets ever constructed on a Paramount lot.|$|E
25|$|Incorporated {{into the}} lower levels of the project is a large {{underground}} shopping mall, fitted in the same black aluminum and travertine as the main lobbies above, which was the genesis of Toronto's PATH system. Also extending to this area was Mies' strict design sense; to maintain the clean-lined and ordered aesthetic of the environment, Mies stipulated, with the backing of Phyllis and Alan Lambert, that the store fronts must consist only of the glass panels and black aluminium that he specified. Even signage graphics were restricted to only white <b>backlit</b> letters within a black aluminium panel and only in the specific font that Mies had designed for the TD Centre. A 690-seat Famous Players movie theatre was included in this underground mall, but, though the space still exists, it was closed in 1978 due to redundancy after newer theatres opened throughout the city.|$|E
25|$|After 32 years, Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped 178 {{trees in}} Berower Park/Beyeler Foundation {{north-east}} of Basel between 13 November and 14 December 1998. To wrap the trees, the couple used 55,000 m2 of silver-grey shiny polyester fabric and 23km of rope. A pattern {{had to be}} made for each individual tree and so the natural shape of the branches pushed the fabric outwards, creating individual shapes in the sky. The trees varied in height from 2 to 25 meters and in width from 1 to nearly 15 meters. As with their other projects, this was financed by the sale of original works. On view for three weeks, Wrapped Trees was extremely dynamic: varying silhouettes of trees moved in the wind with the skeletal framework of branches made visible when the translucent material was <b>backlit</b> by the sun. All materials used in this project were recycled when it was taken down.|$|E
25|$|Following further campaigns by Greenpeace, in 2008, Apple {{became the}} first {{electronics}} manufacturer to fully eliminate all polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in its complete product line. In June 2007, Apple began replacing the cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) <b>backlit</b> LCD displays in its computers with mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays and arsenic-free glass, starting with the upgraded MacBook Pro. Apple offers comprehensive and transparent information about the CO2e, emissions, materials, and electrical usage concerning every product they currently produce or have sold in the past (and which they have enough data needed to produce the report), in their portfolio on their homepage. Allowing consumers to make informed purchasing decisions on the products they offer for sale. In June 2009, Apple's iPhone 3GS was free of PVC, arsenic, and BFRs. All Apple products now have mercury-free LED-backlit LCD displays, arsenic-free glass, and non-PVC cables. All Apple products have EPEAT Gold status and beat the latest Energy Star guidelines in each product's respective regulatory category.|$|E
500|$|The building's {{elevator}} {{was designed}} and added to the foyer after the building was occupied. [...] It is encased in a <b>backlit</b> glass brick shaft at one edge of the open-air lobby. Scalloped steel railings line the central staircase which is anchored by a glass brick column. Sandblasted designs are featured in glass plate windows above the entrance.|$|E
500|$|West debuted [...] "Power" [...] {{live at the}} 2010 BET Awards, {{where he}} {{performed}} the song atop a mountain-like prop, with a video compilation of footage shot {{on top of a}} mountain playing in the back. West performed the track on Saturday Night Live on October 2, where he also substituted a verse containing profane language, as well as a diss towards the show itself ("Fuck SNL and the whole cast"), with an entirely new version. For {{the first time in the}} show's history, the signature black instrument filled stage gave place to an all-white, <b>backlit</b> canvas.|$|E
500|$|September Morn depicts, from {{an oblique}} point of view, a naked blonde girl or young woman {{standing}} ankle-deep {{in the water}} near the shoreline of a tranquil lake surrounded by hills. The figure is <b>backlit</b> by the morning sun, but fully visible, if a little darker than her surroundings. Her arms are folded about her body, her right arm passing below her breasts as she grasps her left elbow, while her left arm conceals her pubic area. This pose has been variously interpreted as the subject protecting herself from the cold, covering her modesty, or sponge bathing, or as the artist's [...] "fetishisation of innocence".|$|E
500|$|The Game Gear is an 8-bit {{handheld}} {{game console}} released by Sega on October 6, 1990 in Japan, in [...] throughout North America and Europe, and during 1992 in Australia. The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, the Atari Lynx and NEC's TurboExpress. The handheld shares {{much of its}} hardware with the Master System {{and is able to}} play its own titles {{as well as those of}} the Master System, the latter being made possible by the use of an adapter. Containing a full-color <b>backlit</b> screen with a landscape format, Sega positioned the Game Gear as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy.|$|E
500|$|From {{her time}} at the {{military}} academy, Shanina became known for her ability to score doublets (two target hits made in quick succession). During one period she crawled through a muddy communications trench each day at dawn to a specially camouflaged pit which overlooked German-controlled territory. She wrote, [...] "the unconditional requirementto outwit the enemy and kill himbecame an irrevocable law of my hunt". Shanina successfully used counter-sniper tactics against a German cuckoo sniper hidden in a tree, by waiting until dusk when {{the space between the}} tree branches would be <b>backlit</b> by sunlight and the sniper's nest became visible. On one occasion, Shanina also made use of selective fire from a submachine gun.|$|E
500|$|Models of the {{starship}} USS Enterprise were {{destroyed in the}} previous film partly because visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston {{wanted to build a}} [...] "more state-of-the-art ship for the next film", but the filmmakers made the less costly decision to have the crew return to serve on the duplicate USS Enterprise A, and six weeks were spent repairing and repainting the old model. A travel pod from [...] was also reused for the ending, although the [...] interior set had to be rebuilt. Graphic designer Michael Okuda designed smooth controls with <b>backlit</b> displays for the Federation. Dubbed [...] "Okudagrams", the system was also used for displays on the Klingon ship, though the buttons were larger.|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Park Welcome Center in the Northwest Pavilion offers {{guides to}} the park and wheelchairs. It houses {{exhibitions}} on parks and energy, and has interactive displays on how the pavilions' solar panels function and on renewable energy. There are exhibits with interactive web-based touch screens that depict the city's use of solar energy, and a dynamic multi-screen video presentation on electricity generation and usage. The building's atrium includes a sculpture by Chicago-based artists Patrick McGee and Adelheid Mers with three <b>backlit</b> [...] two-way mirrors. The sculpture, titled Heliosphere, Biosphere, Technosphere, is [...] "designed to interpret the links between the Earth's atmosphere, the solar system and scientific applications". It is the only permanent work of art by Chicago artists within the park.|$|E
500|$|The PowerBook100 is a {{portable}} subnotebook personal computer that was [...] designed and manufactured by Sony for Apple Computer and introduced on October 21, 1991, at the COMDEX computer expo in Las Vegas, Nevada. Priced at US$2,300, the PowerBook100 was the low-end {{model of the}} first three simultaneously released PowerBooks. Its CPU and overall speed closely resembled those of its predecessor, the Macintosh Portable. It had a Motorola 68000 16-megahertz (MHz) processor, 2-8megabytes (MB) of memory, a [...] monochrome <b>backlit</b> liquid crystal display (LCD) with 640400pixel resolution, and the System 7.0.1 operating system. It did not have a built-in floppy disk drive and was noted for its unique compact design that placed a trackball pointing device in front of the keyboard for ease of use.|$|E
500|$|Matte {{paintings}} of the Austrian castle and German airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle was a small West German castle that was made to look larger. Rain was created by filming granulated Borax soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly double exposed into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The airport used was at San Francisco's Treasure Island, which already had appropriate art deco architecture. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating [...] "Berlin Flughafen". The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were <b>backlit</b> and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings {{were used for the}} sky and to give the appearance of fill light in the shadows and rim light on the edges of the buildings.|$|E
500|$|Director Winrich Kolbe {{had some}} {{ideas about how}} the {{engineering}} set, suggesting {{that it should be}} a dangerous place with the Voyager crew looking down on the engine core. Braga compared the idea to the Foucault pendulum in the rotunda at Griffith Observatory. James' designs were not as elaborate as Kolbe suggested, but together with visual effects supervisor Ronald B. Moore they worked out a means of enabling the director to film from above. They raised the set [...] over a blue screen to enable it to be <b>backlit</b> properly. Kolbe had a further impact on the design of the set; he suggested in a production meeting on February 25 that the change of lighting suggesting by James for the bridge should shift from the Starfleet colors to orange in order to maximise the alien effect. James produced a foamcore model of the Dauntless bridge, to both illustrate the final construction and to enable Kolbe to plan out his camera angles while it was still being built.|$|E
500|$|Due to a {{significant}} wealthy East Asian clientele of gamblers which the casino attracts, it is a restaurant with Chinese chefs serving authentic Chinese cuisine. The bright and luminous interior contains no direct lighting; rather, an overhead metal-cut white screen and large aquariums filled with goldfish are all <b>backlit</b> by LED bulbs. Halogen track lighting spotlights each table. The lighting system won a commendation from Architectural Lighting magazine in its 2009 AL Design Awards. The authors of Eating Las Vegas 2012 wrote: [...] "Combining classic Chinese peasant and street food with a super-cool design, the place looks like it's been draped in a gigantic white, transparent metal doily, and is meant to resemble either inverted Chinese lace cut into an arabesque pattern or the inside of an inverted bird's nest – all very symbolic and all very Chinese. The food is fabulous, especially the Imperial seafood-soup dumplings (which everyone comes for) and the Chef's Special beef pancake".|$|E
