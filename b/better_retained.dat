6000|$|Along with rote-{{teaching}}, {{is declining}} also the nearly-allied teaching by rules. The particulars first, {{and then the}} generalisation, is the new method--a method, as the Battersea School Reports remarks, which, though [...] "the reverse of the method usually followed, which consists in giving the pupil the rule first," [...] is yet proved by experience {{to be the right}} one. Rule-teaching is now condemned as imparting a merely empirical knowledge--as producing an appearance of understanding without the reality. To give the net product of inquiry, without the inquiry that leads to it, is found to be both enervating and inefficient. General truths to be of due and permanent use, must be earned. [...] "Easy come easy go," [...] is a saying as applicable to knowledge as to wealth. While rules, lying isolated in the mind--not joined to its other contents as out-growths from them--are continually forgotten; the principles which those rules express piecemeal, become, when once reached by the understanding, enduring possessions. While the rule-taught youth is at sea when beyond his rules, the youth instructed in principles solves a new case as readily as an old one. Between a mind of rules and a mind of principles, there exists a difference such as that between a confused heap of materials, and the same materials organised into a complete whole, with all its parts bound together. Of which types this last has not only the advantage that its constituent parts are <b>better</b> <b>retained,</b> but the much greater advantage that it forms an efficient agent for inquiry, for independent thought, for discovery--ends for which the first is useless. Nor let it be supposed that this is a simile only: it is the literal truth. The union of facts into generalisations is the organisation of knowledge, whether considered as an objective phenomenon or a subjective one; and the mental grasp may be measured by the extent to which this organisation is carried.|$|E

50|$|Evidence for {{state-dependent}} {{learning has}} been found in children with hyperactivity taking the drug methylphenidate, a drug often prescribed for treatment of ADHD symptoms, more commonly known as Ritalin or Concerta. Children with hyperactivity taking this drug during periods of learning <b>better</b> <b>retained</b> that information during subsequent periods of methylphenidate use, illustrating the effectiveness of methylphenidate in facilitating learning in children diagnosed with hyperactive disorders. However, this state-dependent learning effect of stimulant medication applies only to children diagnosed with hyperactivity. Children not diagnosed with hyperactivity show no change in retention rates due to use of stimulants such as methylphenidate or pemoline. These studies validate the prescription of stimulants for individuals with hyperactive disorders. The results show that the state of consciousness produced through use of these drugs improves cognitive focus in those with hyperactive disorders when taken consistently.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{retrieval}} effort hypothesis, [...] "difficult but successful retrievals {{are better}} for memory than easier successful retrievals". For example, Pyc and Rawson showed that repeated testing is more beneficial for learning if the intervals between repeated testing {{are long and}} each test is therefore more difficult than when the intervals are short and tests are easy. This finding {{is related to the}} theory that certain conditions that make learning more effortful through so-called desirable difficulties are beneficial. Another finding showed that weaker cues for recalling information will be more beneficial to future recollection compared to that of stronger cues. Although these strong cues were shown to be more advantageous for initial recall, these stronger cues reduced the likelihood of activating more elaborative information that could be beneficial for retention. On the hand, the weak cues better allowed the to-be-remembered information to be <b>better</b> <b>retained</b> over time, enhancing long-term memory of the information.|$|E

Log homes differ from some other construction materials listed above because solid wood has both moderate R-value (insulation) and also significant thermal mass.

30|$|Some {{improvement}} {{measures of the}} technology {{can be considered as}} follows. The first is reducing the drainage velocity to <b>better</b> <b>retain</b> the clay and silt, so the geotextiles can be used to retain the clay and silt and drain the water. The second is changing the technical process of filling reclamation with Yellow River sediment to reconstruct an improved soil profile. Firstly, Yellow River sediment is filled to the reclamation strip at the depth of about 1 Â m from the ground surface; then about 15 â 20 Â cm of stripped clay soil is backfilled; thirdly sediment is continuously filled at the designed elevation and then backfilled with surface soil in layers. The soil profile reconstructed in this method would <b>better</b> <b>retain</b> water than the traditional method that doesnât retain a clayey soil layer between the overlying soil layer and substratum sediment layer. The third is increasing the organic matter content in the overlying soil layer to increase the capacity to hold water. It is suggested that green manure plants can be grown and incorporated for the first 3 Â years and the wheat straw also added to the soil after harvest.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To study {{magnetic}} microspheres of mesalamine (5 -aminosalicylic acid) for colon drug delivery. Methods: Magnetic microspheres {{were prepared}} by solvent evaporation technique {{for use in}} the application of magnetic carrier technology. An attempt was made to target mesalamine (5 -aminosalicylic acid) to its site of action i. e. to colon. Eudragit S- 100, ethylcellulose and chitosan were used in three different drug: polymer ratios i. e. 1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 3. The microspheres were characterized in terms of particle size, percentage yield, drug content, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release pattern and ex vivo study. The microspheres were uniform in size and shape. The in vitro release profile was studied in pH 7. 4 phosphate buffer medium using USP dissolution apparatus. Results: Chitosan microspheres were found to be <b>better</b> <b>retained</b> in terms of percentage release of the drug. Thus chitosan microspheres could be <b>better</b> <b>retained</b> at their target site. Conclusion: Flow characteristics are also better in case of chitosan magnetic microspheres.

This study of secondary learners of English used a pre-post design to investigate the students' knowledge of 50 words they had studied using two notebook templates, one that focused largely on definitions and another that engaged learners in creating personal knowledge links. It was hypothesized that words entered in the notebook templates would be <b>better</b> <b>retained</b> than control words that did not undergo any treatment.

It also investigated whether vocabulary that the learners selected themselves for study would be <b>better</b> <b>retained</b> than words selected by the teacher. Contrary to expectation, results showed an advantage for teacher-selected items. A final question was qualitative in nature and looked into students' and a teacher's perceptions of the materials and the learning process. Results showed that over half of the students found the activities relatively easy to use. Most of the students found both templates to be useful. Although a little {{more than half of the}} students reported that they did not enjoy using the templates, the teacher was favorable.

To answer this question, we set up an experiment with 24 students. They took part in an eyetracking experiment in which they read a text that matched their prior knowledge or did not. Causal diagrams, which summarized the relations in the text by means of bullets and arrows, were added. Text and causal diagrams were presented simultaneously on a computer screen. The number of causal relations was also varied (many-few). Results showed that the text containing more causal relations was <b>better</b> <b>retained</b> by participants than the text containing fewer causal relations F(1, 20) = 39. 31, p<. 0001, irrespective of prior knowledge.

For the text containing many causal relations, no correlations could be found between overall scores and division of attention between textual information and diagrams.
