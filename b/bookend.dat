5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern <b>bookend</b> vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5|$|Walters Cultural Arts Center was {{designed}} to be a <b>bookend,</b> along with the Hillsboro Civic Center, to increased downtown development. The center is the city’s first dedicated arts facility. City officials hoped to create a magnet for artists and aficionados in the downtown area with the center and other developments that include a renovated Venetian Theatre. The goal was to have the center encourage art studios to open and for art related festivals to develop to attract people to downtown after most businesses closed. Traditionally, shops and businesses closed by 6:00p.m. as workers in the county seat left for the day. The center also is rented out to groups for private functions.|$|E

The success of the theatrical cuts brought about four-disc Extended Editions, with new editing, added special effects and music. The extended cuts of the films and the included special features were spread over two discs, and a limited collector's edition was also released. The Fellowship of the Ring {{was released on}} 12 November 2002, containing 30minutes more footage, an Alan Lee painting of the Fellowship entering Moria, and the Moria Gate {{on the back of}} the sleeve; an Argonath-styled <b>bookend</b> was included with the Collector's Edition.

25|$|An {{audiobook}} {{version was}} released by Margaritaville Records and Island Records in 1996, on the 25th anniversary of the book's original publication. It features the voice talents of Harry Dean Stanton as the narrator/an older Hunter S. Thompson, Jim Jarmusch as Raoul Duke, and Maury Chaykin as Dr. Gonzo, with Jimmy Buffett, Joan Cusack, Buck Henry and Harry Shearer in minor roles. Unlike most audiobooks, sound effects, period-appropriate music and album-like sound mixing are used extensively, {{to give it the}} surreal feeling characteristic of the book.

25|$|The Tokyo Conference on Afghanistan, held on 8 July 2012 was the civilian-diplomatic <b>bookend</b> to NATO’s 2012 May {{summit in}} Chicago, where the {{alliance}} confirmed plans to withdraw foreign combat troops {{by the end}} of 2014 and pledged about $4 billion a year to pay for ongoing training, equipment and financial support for Afghanistan’s security forces. In exchange for pledges from the Afghan government to combat corruption $16 billion {{over the next four years}} for civilian projects such as roads to schools or projects aimed to strengthen the rule of law were pledged by the some 70 nations attending the conference. The reconstruction and development aid was pledged for the timeframe through 2015, but under the condition that the Afghan government reduce corruption before receiving all of the money. In the so-called Tokyo Framework of Mutual Accountability foreign governments will assure Afghanistan a steady stream of financing in exchange for stronger anticorruption measures and the establishment of the rule of law. Up to 20 percent of the money would depend on the government meeting governance standards according to the Tokyo Framework of Mutual Accountability.|$|E

500|$|The series also {{attracted}} {{a high degree}} of critical praise, earning a People's Choice Award for [...] "Favorite New TV Dramatic Series" [...] in its first year. At the beginning of the second season, Carter handed over control of the series to Glen Morgan and James Wong, with whom he had previously worked on both Millennium first season and several seasons of The X-Files. Despite its promising start, however, ratings for Millennium after the pilot remained consistently low, and it was cancelled after three seasons. However, an episode of The X-Files seventh season, titled [...] "Millennium", was written to <b>bookend</b> the series; the episode was later included in home releases of the third season.|$|E
500|$|The {{traditional}} {{criteria that}} distinguish a derecho from a severe thunderstorm are sustained winds of [...] during the storm {{as opposed to}} gusts, high or rapidly increasing forward speed, and geographic extent (typically [...] in length.)

[...] Although these storms most commonly occur in North America, derechos occur elsewhere in the world. [...] Outside North America they may be called by different names. [...] For example, in Bangladesh and adjacent portions of India, a type of storm known as a [...] "Nor'wester" [...] may be a progressive derecho.|$|E

His original <b>bookend</b> scenes—in which Ricky and Jane are prosecuted for Lester's murder after being framed by Col.

500|$|The title shares {{its name}} with the Robert Frost poem Acquainted with the Night, which is quoted {{on the first}} page.

Two additional chapters, [...] "First Night" [...] and [...] "Night's Last Stand", <b>bookend</b> the twelve chapters as an introduction and conclusion. This hour-by-hour structure was used to move the narrative along logically while jumping between diverse topics. The topics range from such disparate subjects as culture, superstitions, natural history, physiology, and psychology so that reviewers variously called the book [...] "a compendium", [...] "a browser's book" [...] and full of [...] "encyclopedic mini-essays".
