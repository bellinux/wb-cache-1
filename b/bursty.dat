50|$|Drop-tail queues have a {{tendency}} to penalise <b>bursty</b> flows, and to cause global synchronisation between flows. By dropping packets probabilistically, AQM disciplines typically avoid both of these issues.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve a}} more {{efficient}} use of bandwidth for <b>bursty</b> traffic, ALOHAnet developed the random-access packet switching method {{that has come to}} be known as a pure ALOHA channel. This approach effectively dynamically allocates bandwidth immediately to a user who has data to send, using the acknowledgment/retransmission mechanism described earlier to deal with occasional access collisions. While the average channel loading must be kept below about 10% to maintain a low collision rate, this still results in better bandwidth efficiency than when fixed allocations are used in a <b>bursty</b> traffic context.|$|E
50|$|Burstiness {{varies from}} −1 to 1. B = 1 {{indicates}} a maximally <b>bursty</b> sequence, B = 0 indicates a Poisson distribution, and B = −1 indicates a periodic sequence.|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of {{computer}} networking, TCP pacing is the denomination {{of a set of}} techniques to make the pattern of packet transmission generated by the Transmission Control Protocol less <b>bursty.</b> It can be conducted by the network scheduler.|$|E
50|$|As can be {{seen this}} {{implementation}} is restricted in that the packets are only ever transmitted at a fixed rate. To underline this, Tanenbaum also states that “The leaky bucket algorithm enforces a rigid output pattern at the average rate, no matter how <b>bursty</b> the input traffic is”. However, this assertion is only strictly true {{as long as the}} queue does not become empty: if the average arrival rate is less than the rate of clock ticks, or if the input is sufficiently <b>bursty</b> that the losses bring the rate of the remainder below the clock tick rate (i.e. gaps in the input stream are long enough and the queue is small enough that it can become empty), there will be gaps in the output stream.|$|E
50|$|DCA and DFS {{eliminate}} the tedious manual frequency planning work. DCA also handles <b>bursty</b> cell traffic and utilizes the cellular radio resources more efficiently. DCA allows {{the number of}} channels in a cell to vary with the traffic load, hence increasing channel capacity with little costs.|$|E
50|$|However, the Poisson {{traffic model}} is memoryless, {{which means that}} is {{does not reflect the}} <b>bursty</b> nature of packet data, also known as the {{long-range}} dependency. For a more realistic model, a self-similar process such as the Pareto distribution {{can be used as a}} long-tail traffic model.|$|E
50|$|Burstiness is {{observable}} {{in natural}} phenomena, such as natural disasters, or other phenomena, such as network/data/email network traffic or vehicular traffic. Burstiness is, in part, due {{to changes in}} the probability distribution of inter-event times. Distributions of <b>bursty</b> processes or events are characterised by heavy, or fat, tails.|$|E
50|$|Edgar Nelson Gilbert (July 25, 1923 - June 15, 2013) was an American {{mathematician}} and coding theorist, {{a longtime}} researcher at Bell Laboratories whose accomplishments include the Gilbert-Varshamov bound in coding theory, the Gilbert-Elliott model of <b>bursty</b> errors in signal transmission, and the Erdős-Rényi model for random graphs.|$|E
50|$|Burstiness is a {{well-known}} phenomenon in many real-world networks, e.g. email or other human communication networks. Additional dimensions of communication provide a more faithful representation of reality and may highlight these patterns or diminish them. Therefore it is of critical importance that our methods for detecting <b>bursty</b> behavior in networks accommodate multidimensional networks.|$|E
50|$|His work {{on human}} {{dynamics}} {{resulted in the}} discovery of the fat tailed nature of the inter event times in human activity patterns, and proposed the Barabási model that showed that a queuing model was capable of explaining the <b>bursty</b> nature of human activity. This topic is covered by his book Bursts.|$|E
50|$|In packet based data {{communication}} services, the communication is <b>bursty</b> and the traffic load rapidly changing. For high system spectrum efficiency, DCA {{should be performed}} on a packet-by-packet basis. Examples of algorithms for packet-by-packet DCA are Dynamic Packet Assignment (DPA), Dynamic Single Frequency Networks (DSFN) and Packet and resource plan scheduling (PARPS).|$|E
5000|$|A random-access channel (RACH) It is {{a shared}} channel used by {{wireless}} terminals {{to access the}} mobile network (TDMA/FDMA, and CDMA based network) for call set-up and <b>bursty</b> data transmission. Whenever mobile wants to make an MO (Mobile Originating) call it schedules the RACH. RACH is transport-layer channel; the corresponding physical-layer channel is PRACH.|$|E
50|$|With many time-series if {{the series}} is {{averaged}} then the data begins to look smoother. However, with self-similar data, one is confronted with traces which are spiky and <b>bursty,</b> even at large scales. Such behaviour is caused by strong dependence in the data: large values tend to come in clusters, and clusters of clusters, etc. This can have far-reaching consequences for network performance.|$|E
5000|$|This causes {{problems}} when used on TCP/IP routers handling multiple TCP streams, especially when <b>bursty</b> traffic is present. While {{the network is}} stable, the queue is constantly full, {{and there are no}} problems except that the full queue results in high latency. However, the introduction of a sudden burst of traffic may cause large numbers of established, steady streams to lose packets simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|The {{time between}} two {{consecutive}} events, {{for an individual}} node or link, is called the inter-event time. The distribution of inter-event times {{of a growing number}} of important, real-world, time-varying networks have been found to be <b>bursty,</b> meaning inter-event times are very heterogeneous - they have a heavy-tailed distribution. This translates to a pattern of activation where activity comes in bursts separated by longer stretches of inactivity.|$|E
50|$|This {{problem has}} been the subject of much research. The {{consensus}} appears to be that the tail drop algorithm is the leading cause of the problem, and other queue size management algorithms such as Random Early Detection (RED) and Weighted RED will reduce the likelihood of global synchronization, as well as keeping queue sizes down in the face of heavy load and <b>bursty</b> traffic.|$|E
50|$|RED is {{more fair}} than tail drop, {{in the sense}} that it does not possess a bias against <b>bursty</b> traffic that uses only a small portion of the bandwidth. The more a host transmits, the more likely it is that its packets are dropped as the {{probability}} of a host's packet being dropped is proportional to the amount of data it has in a queue. Early detection helps avoid TCP global synchronization.|$|E
5000|$|Less {{stress on}} the power {{distribution}} network. Synchronous circuits tend to draw {{a large amount of}} current right at the clock edge and shortly thereafter. The number of nodes switching (and thence, amount of current drawn) drops off rapidly after the clock edge, reaching zero just before the next clock edge. In an asynchronous circuit, the switching times of the nodes are not correlated in this manner, so the current draw tends to be more uniform and less <b>bursty.</b>|$|E
50|$|The random-access {{channel for}} {{communication}} between users and the Menehune was {{designed specifically for}} the traffic characteristics of interactive computing. In a conventional communication system a user might be assigned {{a portion of the}} channel on either a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) or time-division multiple access (TDMA) basis. Since it was well known that in time-sharing systems 1970, computer and user data are <b>bursty,</b> such fixed assignments are generally wasteful of bandwidth because of the high peak-to-average data rates that characterize the traffic.|$|E
50|$|These {{networks}} were largely engineered {{for a specific}} application and are not suited to other applications. For example, the traditional telephone network is too noisy and inefficient for <b>bursty</b> data communication. On the other hand, data networks which store and forward messages using computers had limited connectivity, usually did not have sufficient bandwidth for digitised voice and video signals, and suffer from unacceptable delays for the real-time signals. Television networks using radio or cables were largely broadcast networks with minimum switching facilities.|$|E
50|$|Workload pattern {{complexities}} (for example, <b>bursty</b> arrival patterns) {{can significantly}} affect resource demands, throughput, and the latency encountered by user requests, {{in terms of}} higher average response times and higher response time variance. Without adaptive, optimal management and control of resources, SLAs based on response time are impossible. The capacity requirements on the site are increased while its ability to provide acceptable levels of performance and availability diminishes. Techniques to control and manage long-tail traffic {{are discussed in the}} following section.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bursty</b> {{nature of}} packet traffic means that more paging {{messages}} are expected per mobile, {{and so it}} is worth knowing the location of the mobile more accurately than it would be with traditional circuit-switched traffic. A change from routing area to routing area (called a [...] "Routing Area Update") is done in an almost identical way to a change from location area to location area. The main differences are that the [...] "Serving GPRS Support Node" [...] (SGSN) is the element involved.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{the inner}} code {{is not a}} block code but a soft-decision {{convolutional}} Viterbi-decoded code with a short constraint length.For the outer code, a longer hard-decision block code, frequently a Reed-Solomon code with eight-bit symbols, is used.The larger symbol size makes the outer code more robust to error bursts that can occur due to channel impairments, and also because erroneous output of the convolutional code itself is <b>bursty.</b> An interleaving layer is usually added between the two codes to spread error bursts across a wider range.|$|E
50|$|The PLT050/PLi050 {{were aimed}} {{primarily}} at the audio distribution market. POEM's key strengths were its low cost (the silicon was inherently simpler in design than HomePlug-style solutions, hence cheaper to produce) and {{its support for}} multiple qualities of service. Its ability to support loss-less uncompressed streaming audio with low jitter, without interruption {{in the presence of}} <b>bursty</b> data traffic, was a key attraction to hardware OEMs looking for solutions for the home theater market. This application was successfully showcased at CES 2008, receiving strong interest from major OEMs.|$|E
50|$|Other {{codes are}} more {{appropriate}} for different applications. Deep space communications are limited by the thermal noise of the receiver which {{is more of a}} continuous nature than a <b>bursty</b> nature. Likewise, narrowband modems are limited by the noise, present in the telephone network and also modeled better as a continuous disturbance. Cell phones are subject to rapid fading. The high frequencies used can cause rapid fading of the signal even if the receiver is moved a few inches. Again there are a class of channel codes that are designed to combat fading.|$|E
50|$|The {{token bucket}} {{can be used}} in either traffic shaping or traffic policing. In traffic policing, nonconforming packets may be {{discarded}} (dropped) or may be reduced in priority (for downstream traffic management functions to drop if there is congestion). In traffic shaping, packets are delayed until they conform. Traffic policing and traffic shaping are commonly used to protect the network against excess or excessively <b>bursty</b> traffic, see bandwidth management and congestion avoidance. Traffic shaping is commonly used in the network interfaces in hosts to prevent transmissions being discarded by traffic management functions in the network.|$|E
50|$|There is, however, {{another version}} of the leaky bucket algorithm, {{described}} on the relevant Wikipedia page as the leaky bucket algorithm as a queue. This is a special case of the leaky bucket as a meter, which can be described by the conforming packets passing through the bucket. The leaky bucket as a queue is therefore applicable only to traffic shaping, and does not, in general, allow the output packet stream to be <b>bursty,</b> i.e. it is jitter free. It is therefore {{significantly different from the}} token bucket algorithm.|$|E
50|$|ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness {{of all types}} of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI/) and, , is maintained by the ITU. Noise measurements using this weighting typically also use a quasi-peak detector law rather than slow averaging. This also helps to quantify the audibility of <b>bursty</b> noise, ticks and pops that might go undetected with a slow rms measurement.|$|E
50|$|In {{a network}} {{such as the}} internet, {{different}} application types require different levels of performance. For example, email is a genuinely store and forward kind of application, but videoconferencing isn't since it requires low latency. When packets are queued up {{on one end of}} a congested link, the node usually has some freedom in deciding the order in which it should send the queued packets. One example ordering is simply first-come, first-served, which works fine if the sizes of the queues are small, but can result in problems if there are latency sensitive packets being blocked by packets from <b>bursty,</b> higher bandwidth applications.|$|E
5000|$|If {{a speech}} signal {{is reduced to}} packets, and it is forced to share a link with <b>bursty</b> data traffic (traffic with some large data packets) then {{no matter how small}} the speech packets could be made, they would always {{encounter}} full-size data packets. Under normal queuing conditions the cells might experience maximum queuing delays. To avoid this issue, all ATM packets, or [...] "cells," [...] are the same small size. In addition, the fixed cell structure means that ATM can be readily switched by hardware without the inherent delays introduced by software switched and routed frames.|$|E
5000|$|What do {{the repressive}} and {{permissive}} states represent? An attractive {{idea is that}} the repressed state is a closed chromatin conformation whilst the permissive states are more open. Another hypothesis is that the fluctuations between states reflect reversible transitions in the binding and dissociation of pre-initiation complexes. Bursts may also result from <b>bursty</b> signalling, cell cycle effects or movement of chromatin to and from transcription factories. Bursting dynamics have been demonstrated to be influenced by cell size and the frequency of extracellular signalling. [...] Recent data suggest different degrees of supercoiling distinguish the permissive and inactive states.|$|E
