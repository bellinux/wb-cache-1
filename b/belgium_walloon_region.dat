Milk MIR spectral data related to milk recording data were available in the <b>Belgium</b> <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> via European project OptiMIR (INTERREG IVB North West Europe Program). In Wallonia, the Ardenne region is associated to a traditional product of the area, a appellation d'origine “Beurre d’Ardennes”. Therefore, discrimination studies were conducted to distinguish Ardennes region {{from the rest of}} Wallonia. A total of 542, 733 Walloon spectral records linked to their geographic origin were used (97, 369 of MIR spectra for Ardennes region and 450, 326 for the rest of Wallonia). The spectral data selected and pre-treated were adjusted for the effects of breeds, months, years and days in milk using ab appropriate mixed model. To test the MIR ability for milk authentication, chemometric tools, such as quadratic discriminant analysis were applied to the adjusted spectrafor three MIR spectral regions (e. g. 930 - 1600 cm- 1, 1710 - 1810 per cm and 2560 - 2990 per cm). Results of classification showed that 94 % of the records from the Ardernnes region were properly classified.

Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the potential of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) for certifying the geographic origin of milk. Because milk MIR spectral databases and extra phenotypes (breed, testday, livestock herd and origin appellation of traditional products) were available in the <b>Belgium</b> <b>Walloon</b> <b>Region</b> via European project OptiMIR (INTERREG IVB North West Europe Program), discrimination studies were conducted to distinguish Ardennes region (which is linked to PDO “Beurre d’Ardennes”) from the rest of Wallonia. A total of 542, 733 spectral records linked to their geographic origin coming from Wallonia milk recording were used (97, 369 of MIR spectra -Ardennes region and 450, 326 -rest of Wallonia). A mixed model (fixed: breed, year and month of record, random: herd x year) was applied to obtain predicted MIR spectral values for all testdays and prediction errors (residuals) representing the factors not present in the model. In order to test the MIR ability to milk authentication, chemometric tools, such as partial least squat regression and linear discriminant analysis were applied to residuals for three MIR spectral regions (e. g. 930 - 1600 cm- 1, 1710 - 1810 cm- 1 and 2560 - 2990 cm- 1). The classifications on not-corrected MIR spectral data were 95 % and the cross-validation were 95 % for Ardennes region. Results showed after correction of MIR spectra, the discriminant function constructed on the residuals spectra allowed a good discrimination.

40|$|Animal {{improvement}} is always directed towards a given selection objective. These objectives in dairy cattle have been changing {{in the last}} forty years passing from simple yield only potentially associated with type, towards more complex ones including also functional traits as fertility and longevity. Milk composition has been selected too in most countries, however focussing only on major components, fat and protein. During the last years interest in milk quality traits, especially nutritionally quality has been increasing. Implementing breeding for additional traits first requires that animals can be evaluated for them because data is available and they are heritable enough. The objective of our research was to develop the needed steps to implement animal breeding for improved nutritional quality. Until recently data for fatty acid (FA) composition could not be obtained easily. However calibration equations for mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry data generated in routine milk analysis done during milk recording were developed. They are used in routine in <b>Belgium</b> (<b>Walloon</b> <b>Region)</b> and Luxembourg and generate MIR data used to predict FA for up to 100. 000 cows for every test date, therefore up to a maximum of 1 million test-day records. Multivariate test-day models were developed that allow estimating genetic parameters and ultimately breeding values as soon as enough data is available. Daily heritabilities estimated ranged between 0. 1 and 0. 4 showing that sufficient genetic differences exist. Because of the lack of historical data correlated traits as milk yield, fat and protein content will be analyse together with FA. For the future research on correlations between FA and other economically important traits will be done. Results are needed to integrate FA in the selection objectives. Because of the relative lack of historical data there is a high interest to research using genomic information to provide combined breeding values...|$|E
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} pathogen of cloven-hoofed mammals {{and one of the}} biggest concerns for veterinary authorities. The control measures to be applied in case of an outbreak vary in function of the disease-free or disease-enzootic status. Vaccination depends on the prior identification of the involved viral serotype and subtype, it confers an immunity limited to 6 months and it requires between 4 to 7 days to trigger the immune response (i. e. immunity-gap). The use of anti-FMD drugs has been discussed as an alternative or supplementary method to be used in previously FMD-free countries/zones. Such an antiviral treatment could protect against the viral dissemination to fill the gap between vaccination and the rise of a protective immunity. Apart from broad spectrum antiviral agents, such as ribavirin, specific anti-FMDV molecules have been identified in vitro, but none of them has been used in clinical studies involving ruminants or pigs. Next to the anti-FMDV activity, the absence of toxicity and the withdrawal period influencing the food safety, the cost of the treatment would be another important parameter influencing the potential use of an antiviral agent in the control of a FMD outbreak. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the economic impact of using an antiviral in the control of a FMD epizootic in southern <b>Belgium</b> (<b>Walloon</b> <b>Region).</b> This work was based on the results of previous investigations concerning the epidemiological and economic data of a FMD outbreak in Southern Belgium. In the considered scenario, the epizootic was caused by the introduction of an infected cow (during the incubation time) in a beef cattle farm during winter. During the two weeks between the brood cow introduction and the official declaration of the outbreak, animal movements occurred between other beef cattle farms. The economic effects of the epidemic were evaluated taking into account the air-borne transmission of FMDV, the occurrence of animal movements (two scenarios were considered, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 17 movements), the presence of bovine and small ruminant farms, as well as pig farms in the protection and surveillance zones around the initial and secondary outbreaks. The wild fauna was not involved in the epidemic. In order to integrate in the above scenario the application of an antiviral agent in the control of the disease, it was assumed that the efficacy of the anti-FMDV drug was proven by reducing viral excretion in infected animals as well as by preventing the infection in animals at risk. Two hypothetical prices were used to introduce in the model the costs related to the administration of the antiviral drug (5 € and 10 € per dose). Furthermore, different strategies of control could be envisaged, such as the administration of the drug to both domestic ruminants and pigs, or depending on the epidemiological role of these species in the FMD transmission and their density in the territory, the administration of the drug to only one of them. Other scenarios could be characterized by the use of the antiviral in the control of the epizootic within the protection and surveillance zones or in only one of them. The costs associated with the use of antivirals in the different proposed scenarios are compared to the costs and socio-economic losses associated with the FMD outbreak and the implementation of control measures.

Likewise, genetic evaluation system for udder health (using somatic cell scores) has been routinely used since 2003, as well as for longevity since 2005, for female fertility since 2007, and for body condition score since 2010. Finally, calving ease has been evaluated by genetic evaluation system in routine since 2013.
