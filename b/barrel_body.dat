5000|$|Upgraded Mark II (Second Great War) - This barrel was {{developed}} to be deployed {{as quickly as possible}} to meet the challenge of the Confederate Mark 4. It consisted of a Custer <b>barrel</b> <b>body</b> with an upgraded turret. It carried a crew of 5; and mounted a 60 mm gun and at least 2 machine guns.|$|E
50|$|Zambiasaurus had a <b>barrel</b> shaped <b>body</b> {{that was}} {{strongly}} built but very slow. The body was help {{off the ground}} but it either had a sprawling stance or a more upright stance.|$|R
50|$|The Welgun had {{a folding}} stock. When this was folded to lie over the <b>barrel</b> and <b>body</b> of the gun, the overall {{length of the}} weapon was barely 10 inches, {{allowing}} easy carriage and concealment. The Welgun also had a wooden pistol grip, and vestigial wooden foregrip, which contributed to its accuracy and balance.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{explained}} in the book Mysteries of Toronto as follows: [...] "As a prank, they had fabricated a semblance of the creature using a barrel filled with empty bottles for buoyancy and fitting it with a dragon-like head, rope and anchor {{to keep it in}} one place, and twine attached to the rope that ran underwater to the shore of Cartwright Bay to permit them to bob its <b>barrel</b> <b>body</b> and head up and down". (As quoted by Joe Nickel, writing for the Skeptical Inquirer.)On May 16, 2004 two individuals from the Kingston area witnessed a large unexplained animal underneath the water while fishing for carp in Little Cataraqui Creek. This was later named Kingstie, for it was spotted in Kingston Creek, Ontario.|$|E
50|$|With {{the war in}} Europe {{demanding}} most of {{the available}} material for the British, Australia {{was not in a}} position to purchase weapons from the United Kingdom or the United States and so they had to develop their own submachine guns. The British Sten submachine gun was taken as the basis for the Austen. The <b>barrel,</b> <b>body</b> (receiver) and trigger mechanism of the Mark II Sten were copied, while the folding stock and bolt, with separate firing pin and telescopic cover over the return spring, were copied from the German MP40. The folding stock also included a screwdriver and a cleaning rod which both unscrewed from the tubes of the stock. The weapon also featured twin pistol style grips (also copied from the MP40); the latter containing a small spare parts container inside. The weapon had a selective-fire feature permitting the firer to fire single shots or fully automatic at 500 rounds per minute.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the turning-milling complex {{processing}} {{simulation platform}} is established {{based on the}} simulation and optimization platform of VERICUT NC machining, with WFL M 65 turning-milling complex machining center as the research object; taking <b>barrel</b> <b>body</b> parts as an example, the simulation machining and related process issues checking in machining process is made and the analysis and optimization of effect factors is made for processing efficiency. The application indicates that: the research results effectively realize the simulation of the turning-milling complex machining process and the correctness verification and process optimization of the NC machining program, improve the processing efficiency and the processing quality, well improve the application level of enterprise turning-milling complex machining center, promote {{the development of the}} turning-milling complex machining technology...|$|E
500|$|The Museum of Modern Art in New York City {{recognised}} the Bic Cristal's {{industrial design}} by introducing {{it into the}} museum's permanent collection. Its hexagonal shape resembles the typical wooden pencil and grants strength and three grip points giving high writing stability. The pen's transparent polystyrene barrel and polypropylene tube show the ink-level. A tiny hole in the <b>barrel's</b> <b>body</b> maintains the same air pressure {{inside and outside the}} pen. The thick ink flows down due to capillary action from the tube inside the barrel, to feed the ball bearing, which spins freely within a brass tip. In 1961 the stainless steel ball was replaced with much harder tungsten carbide. This ballpoint is first vitrified by heat, then ground down and milled to an accuracy of [...] between spinning plates coated with industrial diamond abrasives. Since 1991 the pen's streamlined polypropylene cap has had a small hole {{to reduce the risk of}} suffocation if the cap is inhaled. Polypropylene is used instead of polystyrene because it absorbs impact better, reducing the chance of the pen cracking or splitting if it is dropped onto the cap.|$|R
5000|$|Currently {{these are}} [...] {{inline-four}} engines {{based on the}} Mazda MZR engine developed in cooperation with Mazda. Changes includes a billet crankshaft, <b>barrel</b> throttle <b>bodies,</b> new cylinder head with larger valves, pistons, con rods and camshafts. A detuned [...] version, targeting club racers, is sold to the consumer market. This engine retains the standard crankshaft, and has a different cylinder head. Both engines are built by Cosworth in Torrance, California, {{under the guidance of}} newly appointed technical designer Wayne Merry (formerly of Cosworth in Worcester UK).|$|R
50|$|Telescoping {{caseless}} rounds {{must also}} {{deal with the}} issue of blocking the bore, as the bullet is surrounded by propellant. The booster charge is used to address this issue, providing an initial burst of pressure to force the bullet out of the cartridge body and into the <b>barrel</b> before the <b>body</b> combusts.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the behavioural effects induced by endothelin- 1 {{injected into the}} lateral-caudal periaqueductal gray matter of freely moving rats. Endothelin- 1 induced a dose-dependent longitudinal rolling of the <b>body</b> (<b>barrel</b> rolling) which was prevented by D,L- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate (2 -APV), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, but not by 6 -cyano- 7 -nitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (CNQX), a non-NMDA receptor antagonist. This effect, not reproducible with NMDA alone, indicates that the activation of the NMDA receptors in the periaqueductal gray area may be a necessary, but not sufficient, step for the triggering of endothelin- 1 -induced barrel-rolling behaviour...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had drawn}} a little gleaming revolver, and emptied barrel after <b>barrel</b> into Milverton's <b>body,</b> the muzzle within {{two feet of}} his shirt front. He shrank away and then fell forward upon the table, {{coughing}} furiously and clawing among the papers. Then he staggered to his feet, received another shot, and rolled upon the floor. [...] "You've done me," [...] he cried, and lay still. The woman looked at him intently, and ground her heel into his upturned face. She looked again, {{but there was no}} sound or movement. I heard a sharp rustle, the night air blew into the heated room, and the avenger was gone.|$|R
50|$|The five {{come to the}} {{dwelling}} of the tinsmith Ku-Klip {{where the}} Tin Woodman talks to himself - that is, {{to the head of}} the man (Nick Chopper) he once was. The Tin Woodman and the Tin Soldier also find a <b>barrel</b> of assorted <b>body</b> parts that once belonged to each of them, but some, like Captain Fy-ter's head, are conspicuously missing. Ku-Klip reveals that he used Fy-ter's head and many body parts from each of them (which never decayed) to create his assistant Chopfyt. Chopfyt complained about missing an arm until Ku-Klip made him a tin one, and he departed for the east.|$|R
50|$|The tanggu drum (tang, lit. hall; gu, lit. drum) {{is listed}} as a hide {{instrument}} in the traditional bayin classification of Chinese instruments. The common type is similar in shape to a <b>barrel.</b> Its wooden <b>body,</b> entirely painted red with decorative patterns, is covered with two drumheads of cowhide or pig skin. Four lateral iron rings around the shell allow the drum to be vertically suspended in a frame. It is struck {{with a pair of}} wooden beaters. Tone quality can be modified by moving the striking point closer to the centre of the surface, with varying dynamics. Usually the different tone are not easily identified.|$|R
5000|$|In areas {{subject to}} {{freezing}} temperatures, {{only a portion}} of the hydrant is above ground. The valve is located below the frost line and connected by a [...] to the above-ground portion. A valve rod extends from the valve up through a seal {{at the top of the}} hydrant, where it can be operated with the proper wrench. This design is known as a [...] "dry barrel" [...] hydrant, in that the <b>barrel,</b> or vertical <b>body</b> of the hydrant, is normally dry. A drain valve underground opens when the water valve is completely closed; this allows all water to drain from the hydrant body to prevent the hydrant from freezing.|$|R
50|$|The Sigma 50mm 1.4 EX DG HSM is {{constructed}} {{with a plastic}} body and a metal mount. This lens features a distance window with depth of field scale. A nine-blade, maximum aperture of 1.4 gives the lens {{the ability to create}} shallow depth-of-field effects. The optical construction of this lens contains eight lens elements, including one aspherical lens element. This lens uses a front extension focusing system, powered by a ring USM motor. Auto-focus speed of the lens is moderate; it is not as fast as most ring USM lenses. The front of the lens does not rotate, but does extend when focusing. The lens is designed so that the outer <b>body</b> <b>barrel</b> is longer than the inner lens barrel, when the inner lens barrel is at its longest extension. This results in the lens maintaining the same overall length no matter where the point of focus lies.|$|R
40|$|Throughout history women’s {{participation}} in the male-dominated sporting atmosphere has been fraught with tensions. Many {{researchers have sought to}} bring light to the experiences of sportswomen walking the fine line between acceptable gender representation and successful sport performances. Rodeo is one such male dominated sport in which one event of seven is allocated for women’s participation. Ladies barrel racing showcases a rider and her horse racing through a cover-leaf pattern attempting to attain the fastest time. This thesis examines how barrel racers make sense of their sporting experiences. Drawing on Foucault’s notions of power, discourse, and knowledge a discourse analysis was performed to showcase how barrel racers become subjects. The results showcase two separate, yet interconnected, themes. The first analyzes how the barrel racing subject interacts with discourses of gender. It was found that contextual discursive fragments were (re) produced by the barrel racers that defined a code of professionalism that serves to discipline a <b>barrel</b> racer’s <b>body</b> and dress in order to represent an authentic cowgirl image separating her from the deviant, non-authentic ‘others’: groupies and wannabe’s. Further, when examining the inter-species interaction in barrel racing {{it was found that the}} racer and horse co-exist between three intertwined subjectivities: the athlete, the team member, and the trainer. Overall, the importance of context is showcased in the results as the specific cultural discourses actively engage with dominant gender discourse to create a nuanced knowledge base through with the barrel racers make sense of their subjectivity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} evaluate, in a {{practical}} manner, the use of linear and angular measurements and different animal-performance indices in {{a study on the}} breed-specific conformation of Brazilian Sport Horses training for eventing. These data can form the basis for the development of future studies based on the parameters evaluated and the calculations made. Seventeen Brazilian Sport Horses training for eventing were selected. Morphometric evaluations were made of all animals using linear and angular measurements. The linear measurements were withers, croup, and <b>barrel</b> heights; <b>body,</b> croup, shoulder, neck, and head lengths; head, chest, and hip widths; distance from the elbow to the ground and from the sternum to the ground (empty substernal); and thorax, forearm, knee, fetlock, and fore cannon girths. The angular measurements were shoulder-ground, shoulder-humerus, humerus-radius, metacarpus-phalanx, coxae-ground, coxae-femur, femur-tibia, and tibia-metatarsus angles. Thirteen animal-performance indices were calculated to {{have a better understanding of}} the conformation of the animals and their proportions: the relationship between the withers and croup heights, chest index, dactyl-thoracic index, estimated weight, body index, thoracic index, conformation index, load index 1, load index 2, relative body index, compactness index 1, compactness index 2, and meloscopic index. Brazilian Sport Horses in eventing training were within the expected conformation for an athletic horse, but the animal-performance indices differed among them because they are heterogeneous horses resulting from crossing among various different breeds. The use of linear and angular measurements allows the correct characterization of racial forms of Brazilian Sport Horses undergoing training for eventing. Animal-performance indices can be useful in a study of a breed-specific conformation of athletic horses...|$|R
40|$|The {{basal body}} shares similar {{architecture}} with centrioles in animals and {{is involved in}} nucleating flagellar axonemal microtubules in flagellated eukaryotes. The early-branching Trypanosoma brucei possesses a motile flagellum nucleated from the basal body that consists of a mature basal body and an adjacent pro-basal body. Little {{is known about the}} basal body proteome and its roles in basal body biogenesis and flagellar axoneme assembly in T.  brucei. Here, we report the identification of 14 conserved centriole/basal body protein homologs and 25 trypanosome-specific basal body proteins. These proteins localize to distinct subdomains of the basal body, and several of them form a ring-like structure surrounding the basal <b>body</b> <b>barrel.</b> Functional characterization of representative basal body proteins revealed distinct roles in basal body duplication/separation and flagellar axoneme assembly. Overall, this work identified novel proteins required for basal body duplication and separation and uncovered new functions of conserved basal body proteins in basal body duplication and separation, highlighting an unusual mechanism of basal body biogenesis and inheritance in this early divergent eukaryote...|$|R

40|$|Fifty six {{neonatal}} Holstein calves (22 {{male and}} 34 female) were fed calf starters and post weaning diets containing 35 and 21. 90 % Popped (PW), steam flaked (SFW), dry-rolled (DRW) or ground (GW) to 12 weeks of age. Particle size distribution of processed wheat grains, skeletal growth measures, starter digestibility, starter intake, health status, and blood metabolites of neonatal calves were assessed in weeks 4, 8 and 12 to assess rumen development {{and find the}} optimum method of wheat processing for calves. The experiment started when calves were 3 ± 1 d old and studied for 90 days. Calves were weaned {{at the end of}} 9 th week and a post weaning specific starter diets were fed for one month. PW and SFW dramatically decreased fine particles in comparison to GW or DRW. PW had the most proportion of larger particles (93. 52 % > 3. 38 mm) where GW had the finest texture (70. 71 % < 2 mm). Health status parameters of calves did not affected by treatments, but respiratory index was affected by time. Skeletal growth measures including <b>body</b> length, <b>body</b> <b>barrel,</b> wither height and hip width did not affected by treatments, but these measures progressed by age. Calves received PW had the highest body weight and daily gain, but feed; gain ratio was not affected by treatments. These parameters were also affected by age. Although, calves received DRW had the lowest starter intake, but the highest digestibility coefficients for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, NDF and energy. This higher digestibility was attributed to lower starter intake resulted in probably higher rumen retention time and thus the most rumen degradation of nutrients. Calves received PW, had the highest serum glucose, BHBA and insulin concentrations which may indicate that PW could cause a better rumen development and performance in comparison with other types of processed wheat...|$|R
60|$|But {{apart from}} that matter of general experience, there are some cases which put that curious mixture in a very clear light. You are aware that the {{offspring}} of the Ass and the Horse, or rather of the he-Ass and the Mare, is {{what is called a}} Mule; and, on the other hand, the offspring of the Stallion and the she-Ass is what is called a 'Hinny'. I never saw one myself; but they have been very carefully studied. Now, the curious thing is this, that although you have the same elements in the experiment in each case, the offspring is entirely different in character, according as the male influence comes from the Ass or the Horse. Where the Ass is the male, {{as in the case of}} the Mule, you find that the head is like that of the Ass, that the ears are long, the tail is tufted at the end, the feet are small, and the voice is an unmistakable bray; these are all points of similarity to the Ass; but, on the other hand, the <b>barrel</b> of the <b>body</b> and the cut of the neck are much more like those of the Mare. Then, if you look at the Hinny,--the result of the union of the Stallion and the she-Ass, then you find it is the Horse that has the predominance; that the head is more like that of the Horse, the ears are shorter, the legs coarser, and the type is altogether altered; while the voice, instead of being a bray, is the ordinary neigh of the Horse. Here, you see, is a most curious thing: you take exactly the same elements, Ass and Horse, but you combine the sexes in a different manner, and the result is modified accordingly. You have in this case, however, a result which is not general and universal--there is usually an important preponderance, but not always on the same side.|$|R
