5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Steve Huey awarded the album 4 stars and stated [...] "Perhaps {{as a result}} of Blue Notes more prepared, {{professional}} approach to recording sessions, McLean sounds invigorated here, catapulting each melody forward before launching into a series of impassioned improvisations...

Savlov stated that the film was easier to follow than Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend, due to Wicked Citys more linear and rapid storyline, and the lack of flashbacks and cyberpunk jargon that Savlov disliked in the genre. Savlov also appreciated the clarified animation. Savlov commented, [...] "This may not be the second coming of Akira, <b>but</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> step in the right direction." ...|$|E

[...] Rolling Stones Ben Ratliff rated the album four stars out of five and said [...] "TNT meanders, <b>but</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> meandering expertly defined by the editing razor."

5000|$|Reviewing {{the album}} in Record, Samuel Graham {{expressed}} {{mixed feelings about}} Eliminators adherence to the familiar ZZ Top motifs. While he found it a relief that the band had not veered down a commercially-driven route, he remarked that the albums failure to stretch out from established stylistics made it over-familiar and lacking in variety compared to the bands last three albums. He praised the tracks [...] "Gimme All Your Lovin", [...] "Legs", [...] "Thug", and [...] "I Need You Tonight", but concluded [...] "weve heard most of this before. Eliminator, then, will probably satisfy ZZ Tops boogie chillin faithful. <b>But</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> lateral move {{at a time when}} Gibbons, Hill and Beard could be stepping forward." ...|$|E

[...] Plus, Francesco wrote that [...] "So Much for Love proves {{to be a strong}} album from start to finish. It likely wont find [...] way onto too many best-of lists come years end (primarily because the band still seems to fly comfortably under the radar), <b>but</b> <b>its</b> <b>a</b> strong and memorable entry into the bands growing catalogue." ...|$|E
