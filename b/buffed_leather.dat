50|$|<b>Buff</b> <b>leather</b> is a strong, soft {{preparation}} of bull's or elk's hide, which was worn under mail armor {{in the middle}} ages to deaden the effect of a blow. As armor fell into disuse, buff coats, which would turn a broadsword cut, and even a pistol ball, were often worn in lieu of complete steel, either with or without a cuirass and gorget of metal. Modern <b>buff</b> <b>leather,</b> of which soldiers' cross belts and other accoutrements are frequently made, is for the most part made of common buckskin.|$|R

60|$|The Earl stood {{talking with}} a tall brawny man, lean and strong, brown and weather-beaten, in a frayed suit of <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> stained {{to all sorts of}} colours, in which rust predominated, and a face all brown and red except for the grizzled eyebrows, hair, and stubbly beard.

50|$|The {{rank and}} file wore similar ones of black or grey goatskin, but the white tassels had red cords. The sporran had a white <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> strap and was {{somewhat}} smaller and squarer than the modern pattern. It was worn in the old fashion, well braced up, close to the jacket. These sporrans, unlike the present day ones, had a large roomy pouch, the opening being concealed by the flat top.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening when}} Hector {{returned}} to his room after he had finished his meal, he found Paolo waiting outside his door. His appearance had so changed {{that he would not}} have known him. His hair had been cut short in the front and left long behind, as was the custom of the day, hanging down on to his collar. He was neat and tidy. He wore a dark blue doublet reaching to the hips, with a <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> belt, in which was stuck a dagger. His leggings, fitting tightly down to the ankles, were of dark maroon cloth, and he wore short boots of tanned leather. A plain white collar, some four inches deep, was worn turned down over the neck of the doublet, and a yellow cloth cap, with a dark cock's feather, was stuck on one side of his head. In his hand he held a bundle containing a leather jerkin and breeches of the same material, and a pair of <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> riding boots that would reach to the knee.|$|R
5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|R
60|$|As {{the beggar}} {{had nothing to}} object, he now {{produced}} a small <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> bag tied up carefully with a shoe-string. When this was opened, there appeared a very comfortable treasure of silver coins of all sorts and sizes, and I even fancied that I saw gleaming among them the golden plumage of that rare bird in our currency the American eagle. In this precious heap was my bank-note deposited, the rate of exchange being considerably against me.|$|R
25|$|It {{was common}} for {{infantry}} soldiers {{to wear a}} cross belt consisting of two white <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> straps which made an X across their chests; one belt held a bayonet {{and the other a}} cartridge box. Officers wore one shoulder belt which often supported a sabre scabbard or pistol cartridge box, since they did not carry a musket. The belts had a plate at the center which identified a soldier's regiment. Soldiers were issued white pipe clay which was used to whiten the belts to maintain their appearance.|$|R
2500|$|Buff coats {{were made}} in {{sleeveless}} and sleeved variants and were garments typically crafted from cowhide or buffalo hide. The very finest buff coats were made of elk-hide. <b>Buff</b> <b>leather</b> was produced by a method of [...] "oil tanning"; following treatment with lime the hide was scraped to remove the outer layer which gave the finished product a matt surface. The hide then had cod oil worked into it in a process called [...] "kicking" [...] and was finally air-dried. The oiling and drying steps could be repeated. The finished leather attained its characteristic buff colour and was supple, durable and weather resistant.|$|R
5000|$|In {{regards to}} the {{carrying}} of ammunition, a <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> waist-belt with brass buckles was attached to a double frog holding brown leather, brass-tipped scabbards for sword and bayonet. The sword carried was brass-hilted and had a straight blade. A red-brown leather cartridge-box {{was attached to the}} waist-belt, but it eventually came to be suspended on the right hip from a <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> cross-belt. The standard French cartouchière of the mid-eighteenth century held thirty musket cartridges instead of nine, contrasting its predecessor, though it can be assumed that there were many different stylistic variations. The older variant was engraved with the King's arms or a white anchor and border. A small brass-mounted powder-horn was also carried. The cartridge case was used to carry ammunition and a model 1728 French infantry musket, or [...] "St. Etienne", although different types of flintlock muskets and fusils were carried at different points {{in the history of the}} units. Although the exact designs of the muskets used by a unit such as the Compagnies franches de la marine can no longer be found, it is accepted that they were all of the flintlock type. Given that the colonial regulars were the responsibility of the navy, they carried navy-model muskets made at Tulle. In the 1740s, the navy began to purchase muskets from St-Etienne that probably resembled the army's 1728 model. In 1752, the royal magazines at Montreal and Quebec contained a great variety of muskets and bayonets.|$|R
5000|$|The New Model Army's elite {{troops were}} its Regiments of Horse. They were armed and {{equipped}} {{in the style}} known {{at the time as}} harquebusiers, rather than as heavily armoured cuirassiers. They wore a back-and-front breastplate over a <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> coat, which itself gave some protection against sword cuts, and normally a [...] "lobster-tailed pot" [...] helmet with a movable three-barred visor, and a bridle gauntlet on the left hand. The sleeves of the buff coats were often decorated with strips of braid, which may have been arranged in a regimental pattern. Leather [...] "bucket-topped" [...] riding boots gave some protection to the legs.|$|R

As soon as the mules were unburdened, Gerald found an opportunity of speaking with him.|$|R

60|$|Officers of the {{different}} regiments were distinguished by the colour of their sashes, which was the only point of regimental uniformity. When on a campaign doublets were usually worn of thick buff leather; armour was still used, but was far less cumbrous than it had been, consisting {{for the most part}} solely of shoulder pieces and cuirass, with plates covering {{the upper part of the}} arm, thick <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> gauntlets being considered sufficient protection below the elbow. Four suits were ordered for Hector: one for court, another for general use when in Paris or other large towns, the third for travelling and when in attendance with the general, the fourth for actual service in the field.|$|R
50|$|The typical harquebusier {{would have}} worn an iron cuirass, with a breast and backplate, {{and an open}} faced helmet such as a lobster-tailed pot; the fashion {{conscious}} could replace the helmet with a broad-brimmed felt hat, often worn over a concealed iron skullcap or secrete. In England, in 1629, a harquebusier's armour cost one pound and six shillings, that of a cuirassier four pounds and ten shillings. A more wealthy harquebusier may have worn a buff coat (the finest quality buff coats were often more expensive than an iron cuirass) under his armour and a metal gauntlet to protect his bridle hand and forearm. Also worn were tall, cuff-topped riding boots; these reached the thigh and were often also of <b>buff</b> <b>leather.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} word [...] "buff" [...] to describe a colour was in the London Gazette of 1686, describing a uniform to be [...] "...a Red Coat with a Buff-colour'd lining". [...] It referred to the colour of undyed buffalo leather, such as soldiers wore as some protection: an eyewitness to the death in the Battle of Edgehill (1642) of Sir Edmund Verney noted [...] "he would neither put on arms armour or buff coat the day of the battle". Such <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> was suitable for buffing or serving as a [...] between polished objects.

50|$|Rulers {{have been}} shown in {{specifically}} military dress since ancient times; the difference is especially easy to see in Ancient Roman sculpture, where generals and increasingly often emperors are depicted with armour and the short military tunic. Medieval tomb effigies {{more often than not}} depict knights, nobles and kings in armour, whether or not they saw active service. In the Early Modern period, when senior commanders tended to wear their normal riding dress even on the battlefield, the distinction between a military portrait and a normal one is mostly conveyed by the background, or by a breastplate or the <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> jerkin worn underneath armour, but once even generals began to wear military uniform, in the mid-18th century, it becomes clear again, although initially officer's uniforms were close to smart civilian costume.|$|R

Then, stooping low, she moves forward, gathering the corn with both hands against her knees, and pushing her left gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side, holding the corn in an embrace {{like that of a}} lover. She brings the ends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it, beating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the breeze. A bit of her naked arm is visible between the <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> of the gauntlet and the sleeve of her gown; and as the day wears on its feminine smoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds.|$|R

50|$|There is an {{historical}} debate {{as to what}} the Butler's Ranger uniform actually looked like.Variation ATheir uniforms consisted of a green woolen coat faced white and a white woolen waistcoat. Their pant garment was gaitered trousers made from Russia sheeting, a hemp product. Their hats were round hats, useful in shielding their faces from the sun. When in garrison or on parade, they could bring up the leaves of that hat to form a cocked hat. Their belting was black.Variation BDark green coats faced with scarlet and lined with the same, a waistcoat of green cloth, and Buckskin Indian leggings reaching from the ankle to the waist...their caps were almost skull caps of black jacket leather or turned up felt with a black cockade on the left side. Their belts were of <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> and crossed at the breast where they were held in place by a brass plate marked in the same manner and with the same words as the cap plate.|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} {{difficult}} to find a more workmanlike little corps than the franc tireurs of Dijon as, with the band of the national guard at their head, playing the Marseillaise, they marched through the old city. Their uniform was a brownish gray Their blankets--rolled up tight and carried, like a scarf, over one shoulder and under the other arm--were brown, also. Their belts and gaiters were of <b>buff</b> <b>leather.</b> Their caps had flat peaks, to shade their eyes; but round the cap was rolled a flap lined with fur, which let down over the ears and back of the neck, tying under the chin. On the outer side of the fur was thin India-rubber, to throw the rain off down over the light waterproof cloaks; which each man carried in a small case, slung to his belt. The waterproof on the caps, when rolled up, did not show; the caps then looking like fur caps, with a peak.|$|R
6000|$|Otto, whose course {{hitherto}} {{had been}} undetermined, now immediately settled what to do. He straightway repaired to the ready-made emporium of Herr Moses, and bidding that gentleman furnish {{him with an}} archer's complete dress, Moses speedily selected a suit from his vast stock, which fitted the youth to a T, and we need not say was sold at an exceedingly moderate price. So attired (and bidding Herr Moses a cordial farewell), young Otto was a gorgeous, a noble, a soul-inspiring boy to gaze on. A coat and breeches of the most brilliant pea-green, ornamented with a profusion of brass buttons, and fitting him with exquisite tightness, showed off a figure unrivalled for slim symmetry. His feet were covered with peaked buskins of <b>buff</b> <b>leather,</b> and a belt round his slender waist, of the same material, held his knife, his tobacco-pipe and pouch, and his long shining dirk; which, though the adventurous youth had as yet only employed it to fashion wicket-bails, or to cut bread-and-cheese, he was now quite ready to use against the enemy. His personal attractions were enhanced by a neat white hat, flung carelessly and fearlessly {{on one side of}} his open smiling countenance; and his lovely hair, curling in ten thousand yellow ringlets, fell over his shoulder like golden epaulettes, and down his back as far as the waist-buttons of his coat. I warrant me, many a lovely Colnerinn looked after the handsome Childe with anxiety, and dreamed that night of Cupid under the guise of [...] "a bonny boy in green." ...|$|R
60|$|A loud crash here {{announced}} that the door was broken down, and the knight just descended the stair in time to prevent bloodshed betwixt his attendants and the intruders. They were three in number. Their chief was tall, bony, and athletic, his spare and muscular frame, {{as well as the}} hardness of his features, marked the course of his life to have been fatiguing and perilous. The effect of his appearance was aggravated by his dress, which consisted of a jack, or jacket, composed of thick <b>buff</b> <b>leather,</b> on which small plates of iron of a lozenge form were stitched, in such a manner as to overlap each other and form a coat of mail, which swayed with every motion of the wearer's body. This defensive armour covered a doublet of coarse gray cloth, and the Borderer had a few half-rusted plates of steel on his shoulders, a two-edged sword, with a dagger hanging beside it, in a buff belt; a helmet, with a few iron bars, to cover the face instead of a visor, and a lance of tremendous and uncommon length, completed his appointments. The looks of the man were as wild and rude as his attire; his keen black eyes never rested one moment fixed upon a single object, but constantly traversed all around, as if they ever sought some danger to oppose, some plunder to seize, or some insult to revenge. The latter seemed to be his present object, for, regardless of the dignified presence of Lord Lacy, he uttered the most incoherent threats against the owner of the house and his guests.|$|R
50|$|The Regiment was {{established}} by Colonel Jakob von Bulow by advertising in 1672, and immediately received {{the name of the}} Leib Regiment at its foundation. The uniform was a <b>buff</b> colored <b>leather</b> tunic with dark blue cuffs, collar and waistcoat. In 1805, tunic was changed to a white color. The coats and waistcoat were covered with a blue velvet trim, in which a white stripe (among the officers a golden dress). The men wore a bicorne hat, and during combat they had an iron skullcap underneath it. The regiment canton (recruiting district) was part of the Aschersleben, the third district of the Holzkreis, and the cities Kochstedt, Schönebeck, Frohsa, Saltz, Hamersleben, Mannsfeld and Gerbstädt, amounting to 4429 households comprised its recruiting district.|$|R

5000|$|By this time, in France at least, {{the general}} {{character}} of the clothes and accoutrements to be worn on various occasions was strictly regulated by orders. But uniformity of clothing {{was not to be}} expected so long as the [...] "enlistment" [...] system prevailed and soldiers were taken in and dismissed {{at the beginning and end}} of every campaign. The beginnings of uniform are therefore to be found in truly national armies, in the Indelta of Gustavus Adolphus, and the English armies of the English Civil War. In the earlier years of the latter, though the richer colonels uniformed their men (as, for instance, the Marquess of Newcastle's [...] "Whitecoats" [...] and King Charles's own red-coated Lifeguard of foot), the rustics and the citizens turned out for war in their ordinary rough clothes, donning armour and sword-belt. But in 1645 the Long Parliament raised an army [...] "all its own" [...] for permanent service, and the colonels became officials rather than proprietors. The New Model Army was clothed in the civilian costume of the date - ample coat, waistcoat, breeches, stockings and shoes (in the case of cavalry, boots) - but with the distinctive colour throughout the army of red and with regimental facings of various colours and breeches of grey. Soon afterwards the helmet disappeared, and its place was taken by a grey broad-brimmed hat. From the coat was eventually evolved the tunic of the mid-19th century, and the hat became the cocked hat of a later generation, which generally disappeared during the decade of 1800-1810 to reappear in the late 19th and early 20th century, by which time it had its original form of a [...] "slouch-hat." [...] For service in Ireland the New Model Army's red coat was exchanged for one of russet colour, just as scarlet gave way to khaki for Indian service in the 19th century. The cavalry (Iron Sides), however, wore <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> coats and armour long after the infantry had abandoned them.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{week from}} {{the day of the}} appeal of Sir Henry two troops, each of a hundred men strong, drew up in front of Furness Hall. To the eye of a soldier {{accustomed}} to the armies of the Continent, with their bands trained by long and constant warfare, the aspect of this troop might not have appeared formidable. Each man was dressed according to his fancy. Almost all wore jack-boots coming nigh to the hip, iron breast and back pieces, and steel caps. Sir Henry Furness and four gentlemen, his friends, who had seen service in the Low Countries, and had now gladly joined his band, took their places, Sir Henry himself {{at the head of the}} body, and two officers with each troop. They, too, were clad in high boots, with steel breast and back pieces, thick <b>buff</b> <b>leather</b> gloves, and the wide felt hats with feathers which were worn in peace time. During the war some of the Royalist officers wore iron caps as did their foes. But the majority, in a spirit of defiance and contempt of their enemies, wore the wide hat of the times, which, picturesque and graceful as it was, afforded but a poor defense for the head. Almost all wore their hair long and in ringlets, and across their shoulders were the white scarfs typical of their loyalty to the king. Harry bestrode a fine horse which his father had given him, and had received permission to ride for half the day's march by his side at the head of the troop. The trumpeter sounded the call, Sir Henry stood up in his stirrups, drew his sword and waved it over his head, and shouted [...] "For God and King." [...] Two hundred swords flashed in the air, and the answering shout came out deep and full. Then the swords were sheathed, the horses' heads turned, and with a jingle of sabers and accouterments the troop rode gayly out through the gates of the park.|$|R
