50|$|The {{redundant}} signal hypothesis, {{also known}} as <b>back-up</b> <b>signal,</b> states that each character can only best show partial representation of overall condition. If each ornament reflected the male's quality with a certain error, then mate choice based on a single trait would lead a female to select a male in poor condition rather than one in great condition. Thus, a female {{ought to look at}} multiple sexual traits of a male if she wants to get an overall view of the male's quality. The redundant signals hypothesis differs from the multiple messages hypothesis, as the latter predicts that different signals reflect the same aspect of mate quality, whereas the former predicts that different signals reflect different aspects. There has been some empirical support of this hypothesis. However, the majority of studies showed no correlation, suggesting the redundant signals are less common in indicating mate quality compare to other hypothesis like multiple messages hypothesis.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} the temporal characteristics of performing under pressure in a high-stakes real-world sport situation. Design: Behavior observation analyses were conducted of televised soccer games. Methods: Videos were obtained from all penalty shootouts ever held in three major international soccer tournaments (World Cup, European Championships, and UEFA Champions League). In these events, 296 players performed 366 penalty kicks. The time periods that were analyzed in relation to shot outcomes were: walking, ball placement, <b>back-up,</b> <b>signal</b> waiting, signal response, and run-up. Results: Several time intervals were linked to performance. For example, longer times {{to respond to the}} referee's ready signal were related to more goals and shorter times were related to more misses. A similar weak trend was found for ball placement. Time to wait for the referee signal went in the other direction, with shorter times giving more goals. Conclusions: Shorter self-imposed times were linked to worse performance than longer times. Plausible reasons for this result may be the extreme levels of pressure that are induced by major penalty shootouts, causing performers to attempt escaping the emotional distress by getting the situation "over with" as soon as possible. These results are consistent with a model of choking as a case of self-regulatory breakdown. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} sexual {{selection}} {{is likely to}} incorporate multiple sources of {{information that can be}} used to identify a suitable mate. Utilising multiple signals for sexual selection could be advantageous since together these might limit the chance of mating with a suboptimal partner (Møller & Pomiankowski, 1993) and thus avoid the cost of unhealthy progeny. However to date, research has focused primarily on unitary signals of attractiveness. Therefore, this thesis aimed to identify the function and relative importance of face and voice signals in human mate attractiveness, with particular reference to Candolin’s (2003) framework of signal integration. The findings suggested that female face and voice signals appear to be related and are likely to constitute <b>back-up</b> <b>signals.</b> Together, female faces and voices interact thus modulating the attractiveness of face-voice compound stimuli and provide a more accurate estimate of fertility. Male voices decreased female response latencies when presented congruently with male faces, which suggests that they are integrated. However, male face-voice integration did not enhance the detection or discrimination of attractive male faces. Rather, females’ readiness to rate male faces and voices was delayed when the stimuli were more attractive...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, new {{operation}} concepts should be introduced {{according to the}} characteristics of the DTO systems. New models and algorithms should be built to enhance the feasibility of DTO systems to huge passenger demand, the utilization of the regenerative energy, and the circulation of the EMUs (including the coupling and decoupling of the EMUs). In particular, the DTO systems also have a much higher standard for the automation of the terminals, where the layout of the terminals, the circulation of EMUs, the coupling and decoupling of EMUs, the maintenance schedules, etc., should be designed and scheduled in an intelligent way. The DTO systems could be operated with smaller headway when compared with traditional urban rail transit systems. However, the usability and reliability of signaling systems, especially the reliability of the onboard equipment, the operation and control mode in case of failure, and the design of <b>back-up</b> <b>signaling</b> systems are important topics for the operation of DTO systems. In addition, the operation control center does not only monitor and control the operation of trains, but also handles the emergency situations happened in the DTO systems. So it is important to employ new technologies and algorithms to enhance the automation level of the operation control center and to help dispatchers make decisions.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} utilize fully the data {{gathering}} {{capabilities of the}} DAMP ship, it was necessary that the data gathered be stored in a form which permitted easy retrieval at the data analysis facility. Therefore, all data obtained at the DAMP ship was stored only on certified and designated CEC digital recorders, Ampex recorders, a Sanborn recorder, an RCA video recorder and a Mincom recorder. Timing was provided by two Hermes Hycon Eastern timing generators, one primary and one <b>back-up.</b> Timing <b>signal</b> outputs were 24-bit pulse absence code, 17-bit pulse absence code, and 13-bit pulse width code. Both generators were synchronized with Bureau of Standards, WWV, time standard.|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of studies find females to base their mate choice on several cues. Why this occurs is debated and many different hypotheses have been proposed. Here I review the hypotheses and the evidence in favour of them. At the same time I provide a new categorisation based on the adaptiveness of the preferences and the information content of the cues. A few comparative and empirical studies suggest that most multiple cues are Fisherian attractiveness cues or uninformative cues that occur alongside a viability indicator and facilitate detection, improve signal reception, or are remnants from past selection pressures. However, much evidence exists for multiple cues providing additional information and serving as multiple messages that either indicate general mate quality or enable females that differ in mate preferences to choose the most suitable male. Less evidence exists for multiple cues serving as <b>back-up</b> <b>signals.</b> The importance of receiver psychology, multiple sensory environments and signal interaction {{in the evolution of}} multiple cues and preferences has received surprisingly little attention but may be of crucial importance. Similarly, sexual conflict has been proposed to result in maladaptive preferences for manipulative cues, and in neutral preferences for threshold cues, but no reliable evidence exists so far. An important factor in the evolution of multiple preferences is the cost of using additional cues. Most theoretical work assumes that the cost of choice increases with the number of cues used, which restricts the conditions under which preferences for multiple cues are expected to evolve. I suggest that in contrast to this expectation, the use of multiple cues can reduce mate choice costs by decreasing the number of mates inspected more closely or the time and energy spent inspecting a set of mates. This may be one explanation for why multiple cues are more common than usually expected. Finally I discuss the consequences that the use of multiple cues may have for the process of sexual selection, the maintenance of genetic variation, and speciation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{observation}} lounge {{at the end}} of the car had an oval-shaped appearance, with {{a rounded}} end in its ceiling lighting cove matching the rounded shape of the end of the car. The observation lounge included nine movable lounge chairs, as well as three sofas: two kidney-shaped ones (seating two and three people, respectively) that could also be moved, and a third large, curved, built-in sofa. The sofas and chairs were turned toward the windows while the train was in motion, but during tours they were turned inward. There was a table in front of the built-in sofa, and smoking stands throughout, like those in the other lounges. The windows in the observation lounge were large, and almost appeared to be pillarless, but small pillars were hidden behind drapes. The windows also had shades. The very end of the observation car contained a [...] "cockpit area" [...] with built-in end tables and built-in seats, and (hidden behind a door) a <b>back-up</b> and <b>signal</b> valve that could be used to control the train while it was being operated in reverse.|$|R

50|$|In 1955 the grille was {{redesigned}} with wider {{spaces between}} the blades and the parking lamps were repositioned beneath directly below the headlights. On {{the sides of the}} body the rub-rail moldings formed a right angle with the vertical trim on the rear doors or fenders. This accentuated the character line in the sheet metal. The Florentine curve rear window treatment was adopted for sedans. Three chrome moldings bordered the rear license plate on either side and deck lid decorations consisted of a V-shaped ornament and a Cadillac crest. The Coupe de Ville had a golden script nameplate at the upper body belt just forward of the rear window pillar. The Eldorado sport convertible featured extras such as wide chrome body belt moldings, a distinctive rear fender design, with twin round taillights halfway up the fenders and flatter pointed tailfins. Tubeless tires were a new standard Cadillac feature. Sales reached a record 118,190, accounting for nearly 84% of all Cadillacs sold. Standard equipment included <b>back-up</b> lights, turn <b>signals,</b> and automatic transmission.|$|R
