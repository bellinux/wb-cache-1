When the millimeter-wave radar detects {{a high risk}} of collision, the Pre-Crash Seatbelts improves initial restraint capabilities for passengers while the Pre-Crash <b>Brake</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>System</b> decelerates the vehicle to reduce the collision speed and contribute to less damage induced by collision.|$|E
500|$|In Vietnam, the Camry was {{introduced}} in 2006 and has been available only in sedan form with two different trims: Camry 2.4 G and 3.5 Q. The 2.4 G trim comes with the 2.4-litre engine rated [...] and a 5-speed automatic gear box while the 3.5 Q trim {{is equipped with a}} 3.5L 2GR-FE engine rated [...] (SAE net) and a 6-speed automatic transmission standard. The two trims come with many safety features including <b>brake</b> <b>assist</b> <b>system,</b> Electronic brake-force distribution (EBD), vehicle stability control (VSC) and front and side airbags. The Vietnamese Camry is produced at the Toyota production plant in Phúc Yên, Vĩnh Phú.|$|E
2500|$|When activated, some earlier ABS systems {{caused the}} brake pedal to pulse noticeably. As most drivers rarely {{or do not}} brake hard enough to cause brake lock-up, and drivers {{typically}} do not read the vehicle's owners manual, {{this may not be}} noticeable until an emergency. Some manufacturers have therefore implemented a <b>brake</b> <b>assist</b> <b>system</b> that determines that the driver is attempting a [...] "panic stop" [...] (by detecting that the brake pedal was depressed very fast, unlike a normal stop where the pedal pressure would usually be gradually increased, Some systems additionally monitor the rate at the accelerator was released) and the system automatically increases braking force where not enough pressure is applied. Hard or panic braking on bumpy surfaces, because of the bumps causing the speed of the wheel(s) to become erratic may also trigger the ABS, sometimes causing the system to enter its ice mode, where the system severely limits maximum available braking power. Nevertheless, ABS significantly improves safety and control for drivers in most on-road situations.|$|E
50|$|The 2WD models {{feature the}} new Electronic Braking Force Distribution (EBD) system that uses {{electronic}} control to optimally distribute braking {{force to the}} front and rear wheels according to changes in the payload (number of passengers) being carried. This system works in tandem with the <b>Braking</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>system</b> (a <b>brake</b> booster with a two-stage mechanical assist mechanism plus ABS) to achieve synergies between effective utilization of front and rear braking force (EBD) and reduced pedal pressure (<b>Braking</b> <b>Assist).</b> As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less pedal pressure in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload. The 4WD models also provide the nearly same high level of braking performance by adopting a load sensing valve (LSV) as a mechanical braking force distribution system in a set with the <b>Braking</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis exemplifies an {{engineering}} service that validates the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system on customized vehicles. This service is {{important as the}} European Commission mandates that all utility vehicles be equipped with ESC as of November 1, 2014. The specific vehicle is a production utility vehicle that has had its suspension customised with a self-leveling pneumatic suspension. The validation is performed {{in accordance with the}} international standard UN-ECE R 13 H. In its Annex 9, the standard's purpose is to substantiate the ESC's responsiveness and <b>brake</b> <b>assist</b> <b>systems</b> performances. This standard indirectly requires the use of a driving robot with both steering and pedal actuation. The work done in the thesis includes the mechanical modification to the driving robot to fit the utility vehicle, design, construction and testing of outriggers, vehicle testing and data analysis. The work went beyond the standard as we also measured the adhesion of all the test track surface using a Halliday RT 3 Curve.

50|$|The brakes {{continue}} {{to become more}} advanced with the new <b>Brake</b> <b>Assist</b> Plus <b>system</b> monitoring for an impending collision and increasing braking if needed, while the Distronic Plus radar guided cruise control can now bring the car to a complete stop. This system works in outdoor conditions; a test demonstration by Mercedes-Benz in a crash-test hall resulted in embarrassment for the company when a new S-Class crashed {{into the back of}} a stationary W220 S-Class. This incident was later attributed to the radar system malfunctioning inside the radar-reflective (i.e. radar-confusing) steel test building where the event was filmed.|$|R

When the millimeter-wave radar detects {{a high risk}} of collision, the Pre-Crash Seatbelts improves initial restraint capabilities for passengers while the Pre-Crash <b>Brake</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>System</b> decelerates the vehicle to reduce the collision speed and contribute to less damage induced by collision.The Radar Cruise Control system detects and monitors the preceding vehicle and the lane, maintaining a fixed distance according to the preceding vehicle's speed within a preset range of speed.|$|E
5000|$|Brake Assist detects {{circumstances}} in which emergency braking is required by measuring {{the speed with which}} the brake pedal is depressed. Some systems additionally take into account the rapidity of which the accelerator pedal is released, pre-tensioning the brakes when a [...] "panic release" [...] of the accelerator pedal is noted. When panic braking is detected, the <b>Brake</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>system</b> automatically develops maximum brake boost in order to mitigate a driver's tendency to brake without enough force. In doing so, Brake Assist has been shown to reduce stopping distance by a significant margin (up to 20% in some studies).|$|E
5000|$|K: {{launched}} in October 2001, {{exclusively for the}} Japanese market. It was designed to fit the Japanese kei car regulations by adopting specially developed rear fenders and narrowing the track width and tire dimensions and the width reduced to 1.47 m. The engine displacement remains unchanged at 598 cc, as specified in the standard. Safety features include ESP (Electronic Stability Program) and BAS (<b>Brake</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>System)</b> as standard. The Smart K also facilitates the starting procedure with the Hill Start Assist that makes a starts on slopes easier. The Smart K was discontinued in November 2004.|$|E
50|$|Following on {{from the}} Mercedes {{innovations}} ABS, ASR, ESP® and <b>Brake</b> <b>Assist,</b> this <b>system</b> is regarded as yet another important milestone to enhance driving safety. With Sensotronic Brake Control electric impulses are used to pass the driver’s braking commands onto a microcomputer which processes various sensor signals simultaneously and, depending on the particular driving situation, calculates the optimum brake pressure for each wheel. As a result, SBC offers even greater active safety than conventional brake systems when braking in a corner or on a slippery surface. A high-pressure reservoir and electronically controllable valves ensure that maximum brake pressure is available much sooner. Moreover, the system offers innovative additional functions to reduce the driver’s workload. These include Traffic Jam Assist, Soft-Stop.|$|R
50|$|However, {{active safety}} is {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} describe systems that use {{an understanding of the}} state of the vehicle to both avoid and minimise the effects of a crash. These include <b>braking</b> <b>systems,</b> like <b>brake</b> <b>assist,</b> traction control <b>systems</b> and electronic stability control systems, that interpret signals from various sensors to help the driver control the vehicle. Additionally, forward-looking, sensor-based systems such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems including adaptive cruise control and collision warning/avoidance/mitigation systems are also considered as active safety systems under this definition.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2008 The AuthorsThis paper {{estimates}} {{the potential benefits}} to Australia from the adoption of an Australian Design Rule on pedestrian protection. Previously we compared the sales-weighted performance of the Australian and European new car fleets in relevant pedestrian impact tests, based on test reports from EuroNCAP and ANCAP. The comparison showed that the pedestrian protection of the new car fleet in Australia is inferior {{to that of the}} new car fleet in Europe. EuroNCAP and ANCAP use very similar tests to those prescribed by the European Directive on pedestrian safety and a proposed Global Technical Regulation. In the present study, the benefits to Australia of an ADR on pedestrian protection were estimated, based on benefit calculations that were estimated for a second phase of European regulation due in 2011. Expected proportional reductions of fatal, serious and slight casualties were applied to Australian casualty data and the associated crash costs. By examining the current performance of the new car fleet, these benefits were disaggregated into benefits that have already accrued since overseas and international regulations were mooted, and that which is yet to be realised through compliance of the new car fleet with a future regulation. It is estimated that an Australian Design Rule conforming to the proposed Global Technical Regulation with the addition of <b>Brake</b> <b>Assist</b> would reduce fatalities in Australia by approximately 28, serious injuries by 947 and slight injuries by 1248 each year, with associated savings in crash costs of approximately $ 386 million per year. Despite recent improvements in the passive safety performance of the fleet, and the introduction of <b>Brake</b> <b>Assist</b> <b>Systems</b> in around 60 % of current new car sales, around half of these benefits are yet to be realised.

5000|$|... 2003 Honda's Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS, {{although}} originally introduced {{with the}} initials CMS) introduced {{in on the}} Inspire uses a radar-based system to monitor the situation ahead and provide automatic braking if the driver does not react to a warning in the instrument cluster and a tightening of the seat belts. The Honda system was the world's first production system to provide automatic braking. The 2003 Honda system also incorporated an [...] "E-Pretensioner", which worked {{in conjunction with the}} CMBS system with electric motors on the seat belts. When activated, the CMBS has three warning stages. The first warning stage includes audible and visual warnings to brake. If ignored, the second stage would include the E-Pretensioner's tugging on the shoulder portion of the seat belt two to three times as an additional tactile warning to the driver to take action. The third stage, in which the CMBS predicts that a collision is unavoidable, includes full seat belt slack takeup by the E-Pretensioner for more effective seat belt protection and automatic application of the brakes to lessen the severity of the predicted crash. The E-Pretensioner would also work to reduce seat belt slack whenever the brakes are applied and the <b>brake</b> <b>assist</b> <b>system</b> is activated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To deliver complex {{functionalities}} in a {{cost effective}} manner, embedded software should ideally be developed with standardized interoperable components. At the same time, {{most of these}} embedded systems must be demonstrably safe and reliable. This paper aims to extend SaveCCM, a modelling language for component-based embedded systems, with standard safety evaluation models. Based on this extension, failure and hazard probabilities can be estimated early in the development process {{and can be used}} to check if a system can fulfil its safety requirements. The procedure of the safety evaluation is demonstrated with the case study of a computer <b>assisted</b> <b>braking</b> <b>system.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{vehicles}} use {{a vacuum}} <b>assisted</b> <b>brake</b> <b>system</b> that greatly increases the force {{applied to the}} vehicle's brakes by its operator. This additional force is supplied by the manifold vacuum generated by air flow being obstructed by the throttle on a running engine. This force is greatly reduced when the engine is running at fully open throttle, as the difference between ambient air pressure and manifold (absolute) air pressure is reduced, and therefore available vacuum is diminished. However, brakes are rarely applied at full throttle; the driver takes the right foot off the gas pedal and moves it to the brake pedal - unless left-foot braking is used.|$|R
30|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, VO {{also plays a}} big role. It is applied in numerous driver assistance systems, such as vision-based <b>assisted</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems.</b> VO is considered a cost-effective solution compared with LIDAR systems (Fraundorfer and Scaramuzza 2012). In ground vehicle robotics, the effective use of visual sensors for navigation and obstacle detection is the main goal (Nistér et al. 2006). VO is employed {{in cases where the}} GPS signal is unavailable (in planetary environments), too heavy to carry (on a small air vehicle), or insufficiently accurate at a low cost (in agricultural applications) (Zhang et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2014 a). It is also used in agricultural field robots to estimate the robot’s position relative to the crops (Ericson and Astrand 2008; Jiang et al. 2014 a).|$|R
