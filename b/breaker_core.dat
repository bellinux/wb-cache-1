40|$|The {{presence}} of the chunky graphite is unwanted in the cast iron with the spheroidal graphite for this significantly lowers {{the properties of the}} ductile iron. This shape of the graphite is formed {{as the result of the}} slow cooling rate of the castings with large thermal point and also due to the {{presence of}} the elements which suppress the formation of the spheroidal graphite and support formation of the chunky graphite. The spheroidal graphite present in the ductile iron assures the excellent mechanical properties, while the chunky graphite significantly reduces those properties of the ductile iron. Therefore it is of importance to assume conditions under which prevented is the formation of the chunky graphite. The casts were carried out under the conditions of the regular operation of the foundry and tested were various types of modifiers and inoculators and also pre-inoculators containing the elements suppressing the formation of the chunky graphite (Al, Sb a Ba). Applied were also the chromium <b>breaker</b> <b>core</b> to suppress the formation chunky graphite which was present in the structure in the places after the feeders elimination. As whole, executed were eight casts with various types of the modifiers and inoculators...|$|E
