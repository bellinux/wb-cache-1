Marsh-Lockett says that part of Rosa's struggle is forging her own identity, and this decision to rebel against her dead father is a bold step, although she does return later to South Africa to become a committed activist and ultimately a political prisoner. <b>But,</b> <b>according</b> to Coetzee, what Rosa achieves is what her father never could: to have a life of her own while still remaining politically committed.|$|E
