50|$|Water resources, such as {{lakes and}} aquifers, are usually {{renewable}} resources which naturally recharge (the term fossil water is sometimes {{used to describe}} aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource, such as the Ogallala Aquifer, is mined or extracted {{at a rate that}} exceeds the recharge rate, that is, at a rate that exceeds the practical sustained yield. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. An aquifer which has been overexploited is said to <b>be</b> <b>overdrafted</b> or depleted. Forests enhance the recharge of aquifers in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion. Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as nitrates, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most {{commercial}} banks, Japan Post Bank {{is primarily}} a savings institution. Its only loan products <b>are</b> <b>overdraft</b> lines secured by time deposits and Japanese government bonds on deposit with the bank.|$|R
5000|$|International {{competition}} {{over water}} can arise when one country starts drawing more {{water from a}} shared water source. This is often the most efficient route to getting needed water, {{but in the long}} term can cause conflict if water <b>is</b> <b>overdrafted.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between linked accounts and an overdraft {{line of credit}} <b>is</b> that an <b>overdraft</b> line of credit is typically only usable for overdraft protection. Separate accounts that <b>are</b> linked for <b>overdraft</b> protection <b>are</b> independent accounts in their own right.|$|R
40|$|In the {{theoretical}} part, this bachelor's thesis {{focuses on the}} description of terminology {{in the field of}} banking, the classification of bank credit products, and on the description of the credit process. In the practical part, the thesis focuses on the analysis and comparison of the credit products of the current banking market in two types of short-term loans for entrepreneurs. These <b>are</b> <b>overdraft</b> loans and operating loans, that are mainly used by entrepreneurs in their business activities...|$|R
5000|$|The Ieropotamos (Γεροπόταμος or Ιερός Ποταμός) is a {{watercourse}} {{in southern}} Crete in Greece. This river {{was a source}} of water supply for the ancient Minoan settlement of Phaistos. [...] The Ieropotamos was heavily drawn upon by the Minoans because of the intensity of farming, even in the Bronze Age at Phaistos. Scientists have determined that the groundwater basin may have <b>been</b> <b>overdrafted</b> some time in the Bronze Age, being a contributing factor to the mysterious depopulation of Phaistos.|$|R
50|$|The EFT Act also prohibits a {{creditor}} or lender from {{requiring a}} consumer to repay a loan or other credit by electronic fund transfer, except when there <b>is</b> an <b>overdraft</b> on checking plans.|$|R
50|$|Other {{letters of}} credit {{reference}} might be written by banks, which would provide basic {{information about how}} long the applicant has held an account, what type of account it was, and whether there <b>were</b> any <b>overdrafts</b> or late payments noted.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overdrafting</b> <b>is</b> {{the process}} of extracting {{groundwater}} beyond the safe yield or equilibrium yield of the aquifer.|$|R
2500|$|According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), {{groundwater}} has {{a potential}} of 1,500 million m3/year, {{but less than}} a third of this value is actually being extracted. [...] Although coastal limestone aquifers contain only about 4 percent of the available groundwater reserves, human activities in the southeast of the country (from Santo Domingo to La Romana and Punta Cana) are heavily dependent on them – for example, some 30 percent of Santo Domingo’s water supply comes from underground sources. [...] As a result, coastal limestone aquifers <b>are</b> <b>overdrafted</b> and seawater intrusion already reaches inland 20 to 50km from the seashore. Many coastal aquifers are at risk of contamination from agrochemicals and poorly located solid waste disposal, contributing to water scarcity by making resources unavailable.|$|R
25|$|However, such {{intensive}} agriculture {{in such an}} arid area has had a significant negative impact of water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from {{above and below the}} surface is used for agriculture. One third of aquifers <b>are</b> <b>overdrafted,</b> especially in Caborca, Guaymas and the coast near Hermosillo. There have been water disputes in the state, notablely between officials from Hermosillo and the relatively water-rich Ciudad Obregón. The overpumping has drastically lowered water tables and has increased soil salinity in many areas. In some areas, the tables have dropped by as much as one or two meters per year, making fresh water increasing unavailable and forcing the abandonment of croplands. For this reason, {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century area under cultivation in Sonora dropped by more than 24%.|$|R
5000|$|At the AGM for {{the year}} ended 29th Mar 1969 Scribbans {{reported}} having sold their bakery business to J. S. Lyons and to be acquiring more shops. The wholesale {{part of the business}} was converting to [...] "Cash and Carry" [...] stores. These were losing money - this would have to <b>be</b> controlled. The <b>overdraft</b> <b>was</b> up to £60 million and this would have to be funded. Lyons also reported buying the bakery business at their AGM.|$|R
50|$|Stealth {{inflation}} {{is a type}} of charges or fees created by businesses to gain extra profit and revenue from its customers. The stealth part of the term is that business will often use miscellaneous fees to charge customers without the customers even knowing the fees existed as they were hidden in the fine print of a signed a contract. The inflation part of the term relates to the up charging of the service without actually providing anything additional. Since most companies charge a fee to accept payment, a portion gets built into profit and revenue. A big example of stealth inflation can <b>be</b> <b>overdraft</b> fees from banks surcharges from Telco providers, processing fees and installation fees. Another form of stealth {{inflation is}} devaluation of money by a government, sometimes in order to pay off debt with lower value currency. The unintended higher cost of imported goods and raw material is passed on to the consumer yet not part of traditional definition of inflation.|$|R
25|$|Reducing {{groundwater}} <b>overdrafting</b> <b>is</b> usually politically unpopular, and {{can have}} major economic impacts on farmers. Moreover, this strategy necessarily reduces crop output, something {{the world can}} ill-afford given the current population.|$|R
50|$|Another {{good example}} <b>is</b> the bank <b>overdraft</b> fee. As below {{you can see}} if a normal {{checking}} account costs $15.00 per month than the bank just made 10 times that in a single day.|$|R
5000|$|Bank <b>overdrafts</b> {{normally}} <b>are</b> {{considered as}} financing activities. Nevertheless, where bank borrowings which are repayable on a demand form {{an integral part}} of company's cash management, bank <b>overdrafts</b> <b>are</b> considered {{to be a part of}} cash and cash equivalents.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{arrangement}} {{which allows for}} the loan amount to be withdrawn, repaid, and redrawn again in any manner {{and any number of}} times, until the arrangement expires. Credit card loans and <b>overdrafts</b> <b>are</b> revolving loans, also called evergreen loan.|$|R
50|$|Overall, the Daylight <b>Overdraft</b> <b>is</b> {{a system}} that is useful for the banks; however, it comes with costs for the Federal Reserve as a lender. With proper {{regulations}} and policies, the Daylight Overdraft system will allow the banks to operate more efficiently.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate the benefits of bank loans to selected banks in terms of profitability for the client in the segment of ndividuals and legal entities. Diploma thesis in the literature review describes {{the essence of the}} banking system in the Czech Republic, the basic concepts associated with the lending activity of banks, types of loans, their classification and rating system for the client's creditworthiness. Marginally they are also described alternative forms of financing. Analytical part contains a selection of specific banking institutions - Česká spořitelna, a. s., Komerční banka, a. s. and Československá obchodní banka, a. s. It also examines the selected products offered to natural and legal persons in terms of profitability for the client and describes their characteristics. Readers also describes the concrete steps of the lending process. Based on the analysis of the product portfolio was selected banking entities in each product group evaluated {{with the assistance of the}} points system the best. The analysis shows that the most advantageous credit terms provided by Komerční banka. The only exceptions <b>are</b> <b>overdraft</b> loans to individuals, which provide favorable conditions other banks analyzed and credit cards for individual person, where the best offer Československá obchodní banka,a. s...|$|R
5000|$|Bank {{fees are}} {{assessed}} to customers for various services and as penalties. There <b>are</b> unauthorised <b>overdraft</b> fees, ATM usage fees, and fees for having an account balance under a required amount. Some banks charge {{a fee for}} using tellers {{in an effort to}} encourage customers to use automated services instead. [...] The fees have come in for criticism as excessive from consumer advocates. They have also targeted bank practices that maximize the assessment of fees and fees that can add up to many times the amount of small transactions.|$|R
50|$|Lanchester's {{contract}} with Daimler was terminated after the Wall Street Crash of 1929; the Lanchester Motor Company's <b>overdraft</b> <b>was</b> also withdrawn, forcing immediate liquidation of its assets. BSA group, {{the owners of}} Daimler since 1910, completed {{the purchase of the}} Lanchester company in January 1931 and moved production to Radford, Coventry.|$|R
50|$|As a {{very simple}} example of a VDM-SL model, {{consider}} a system for maintaining details of customer bank account. Customers are modelled by customer numbers (CustNum), accounts are modelled by account numbers (AccNum). The representations of customer numbers are held to be immaterial and so are modelled by a token type. Balances and <b>overdrafts</b> <b>are</b> modelled by numeric types.|$|R
50|$|Accounts exist with {{overdraft}} protection facilities which {{guarantee that}} the bank will not allow an informal overdraft and which may have lower charges for refusing transactions, protecting the customer from the interest and charges which would be incurred if an <b>overdraft</b> <b>was</b> granted. Accounts for those under eighteen years old will not normally permit an <b>overdraft</b> to <b>be</b> created.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, the {{daylight}} overdraft (also called intraday <b>overdraft)</b> <b>is</b> {{a system in}} which “allows qualifying banks to overdraw on their Federal Reserve accounts in order to make payments via Fedwire. Banks can acquire overdrafts throughout the day to make payments, but must ensure that their accounts are not in a negative position {{at the end of the}} day.” ...|$|R
5000|$|CHIPS {{provides}} real-time, {{immediate and}} final settlement of payment messages continuously {{throughout the day}} similar to Fedwire. During the business day, system participants can send their payments to CHIPS. Funds are released by available funds on hand (no <b>overdrafts</b> <b>are</b> permitted) or through offsetting. A “Balance Release Algorithm” continuously searches the queue of unreleased payments and uses this patented off-setting algorithm to match and release payments.|$|R
50|$|Since no {{daylight}} <b>overdraft</b> <b>is</b> offered, {{in order}} for banks {{to avoid having to}} maintain large balances in their settlement accounts, which accrue no interest, so that payments are processed as soon as possible, interest-free intraday liquidity may be obtained by the banks through repurchase agreements (repos). Intraday repos that are not reversed {{at the end of the}} business day are carried into overnight borrowing.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{daylight}} <b>overdraft</b> <b>is</b> making a $100 deposit at an automated teller machine (ATM) which allows for instant withdrawal of the first $100 deposited. This ATM transaction will post the next day; however {{if one were to}} transfer the funds from this account to another account using other means (such as Internet or telephone) the funds would be withdrawn that day and would post the account negative the next day.|$|R
50|$|On the {{financial}} side, a record £100,888 profit was announced, their first profitable season since 1975-76. The lottery brought in £142,324, {{the open market}} rents took in £51,462, whilst Vale's average home attendance was the second highest in the division. Total liabilities stood at £236,850 and the bank <b>overdraft</b> <b>was</b> £128,123. Two players departing {{at the end of}} the season were Les Lawrence (Aldershot) and Steve Waddington (Chesterfield), who had not established themselves in the first team.|$|R
5000|$|... • EFG loans {{may be used}} {{to refinance}} {{existing}} overdraft facilities afforded by the Bank. The Bank must however continue to provide an appropriate working capital facility (i.e. continue to make available an overdraft) should existing borrowing be refinanced and the customer still wishes an overdraft. The level of any continuing <b>overdraft</b> <b>is</b> to be determined by the Bank in that it does not necessarily require to equal the amount of the <b>overdraft</b> which <b>is</b> being refinanced by EFG.|$|R
25|$|The {{subsequent}} mortgagee takes {{subject to the}} overdraft only at that time, that is to say, not subject to future advances, and {{the reduction of the}} overdraft correspondingly improves his security. If the <b>overdraft</b> <b>is</b> paid off, then any subsequent indebtedness will be by way of future advances and the bank mortgage will be postponed entirely in relation to the subsequent mortgage, although the bank mortgage does not cease to be effective between the bank and its customer, the mortgagor.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{virtually}} all current accounts offer a pre-agreed overdraft facility {{the size of}} which is based upon affordability and credit history. This <b>overdraft</b> facility can <b>be</b> used at any time without consulting the bank and can be maintained indefinitely (subject to ad hoc reviews). Although an <b>overdraft</b> facility may <b>be</b> authorised, technically the money is repayable on demand by the bank. In reality this is a rare occurrence as the <b>overdrafts</b> <b>are</b> profitable for the bank and expensive for the customer.|$|R

5000|$|While {{the volume}} of {{groundwater}} in California is very large, aquifers can be over drafted when groundwater is removed more rapidly than it is replenished. In 1999, {{it was estimated that}} the average, annual <b>overdrafting</b> <b>was</b> around [...] across the state, with [...] in the Central Valley. Since then, overdrafting had significantly increased. Satellite measurements found that in just the combined Sacramento and San Joaquin River basins, including the Central Valley, overdrafting between 2011 and 2014 was [...] of water per year.|$|R
40|$|An <b>overdraft</b> <b>is</b> a lending instrument, usually {{offered by}} banks, {{that for a}} {{predetermined}} period allows the borrower to overdraw his account up to a predetermined limit. The timing and size of withdrawals is {{at the discretion of}} the borrower except, of course, when the credit limit is reached. Lending by Australian banks <b>is</b> predominantly by <b>overdrafts</b> and some attention has been focussed in the past on explaining the behaviour of overdraft advances. Individual demands for credit can therefore be characterised as censored (that is, subject to an upper limit). In practice there are only aggregate data for advances by overdrafts, which creeates difficulties for estimating the behavioural parameters for the demand for advances by overdraft. This paper develops a theory of aggregation of a group of individual demands that are each censored. A measure of credit rationing can also be derived from the approach. The approach is implemented using Australian data for three classes of business borrowers. The results support the view that the observed aggregate quantity of advances by <b>overdraft</b> <b>is</b> determined by both supply and demand factors. This finding is consistent with earlier work by researchers using Australian data. The significance of the present results lies in the attention paid to aggregation and the implications this has for the specification of the estimating equations. A second benefit of the approach is that it permits direct estimation of the distribution of rationed credit demands. The correctly aggregated equation specifies the observed stock of advances as a weighted average of constrained and unconstrained demands for credit, where the weights are interpreted as the probability that an individual borrower faces a binding credit limit. In that limited sense the probability measure, which varies over time, indicates the likelihood and distribution of credit rationing in the overdraft sector. These estimated probabilities are calculated for the three classes of business borrowers (agriculture, commerce and manufacturing) and are similar to the overdraft utilisation ratios in these sectors, which are independent measure of tightness in credit markets. ...|$|R
40|$|Models of {{shrouding}} {{predict that}} firms lack incentives {{to compete on}} add-on prices. Working with a large Turkish bank to test SMS direct marketing promotions to 108, 000 existing checking account holders, we find that messages promoting a large discount on the overdraft interest rate reduce overdraft usage. In contrast, messages that mention overdraft availability without mentioning price increase usage. Neither change persists long after messages stop, suggesting that induced <b>overdrafting</b> <b>is</b> not habit-forming. Our {{results are consistent with}} a model of limited memory and attention...|$|R
50|$|In 2010, TCF Bank <b>was</b> sued {{regarding}} <b>overdraft</b> fees. Some {{practices that}} came to light included processing higher amount transactions first in order to drain customer accounts faster, allowing TCF to then {{increase the number of}} total overdraft charges from each of the smaller amounts remaining, as well as charging overdraft fees on a daily basis rather than posing one flat fee. In 2011, TCF Bank changed its overdraft policy to include a daily $28 fee. After public backlash, the bank reversed its policy in 2012.|$|R
