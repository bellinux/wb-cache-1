25|$|De Palma has {{encouraged}} and fostered the filmmaking careers of directors such as Mark Romanek and Keith Gordon. During {{an interview with}} De Palma, Tarantino said that <b>Blow</b> <b>Out</b> {{is one of his}} all-time favorite films, and that after watching Scarface he knew how to make his own film. Terrence Malick credits seeing De Palma's early films on college campus tours as a validation of independent film, and subsequently switched his attention from philosophy to filmmaking. Other filmmakers influenced by De Palma include Quentin Tarantino, Ronny Yu, Don Mancini, Nacho Vigalondo, and Jack Thomas Smith.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Thomas Midgley, Jr. {{improved}} {{the process of}} synthesis and led the effort to use CFC as refrigerant to replace ammonia (NH3), chloromethane (CH3Cl), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), which are toxic but were in common use. In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low boiling point, low toxicity, and to be generally non-reactive. In a demonstration for the American Chemical Society, Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> a candle in 1930.|$|E

25|$|For many film-goers, De Palma's gangster films, {{most notably}} Scarface and Carlito's Way, pushed the {{envelope}} of on-screen violence and depravity, and yet greatly vary {{from one another}} in both style and content and also illustrate De Palma's evolution as a film-maker. In essence, the excesses of Scarface contrast with the more emotional tragedy of Carlito's Way. Both films feature Al Pacino {{in what has become}} a fruitful working relationship. In 1984, he directed the music video of Bruce Springsteen's song Dancing in the Dark. The 1980s were denoted by De Palma's other films Dressed To Kill, <b>Blow</b> <b>Out,</b> and Body Double.|$|E

PO McDermott bailed out of the aircraft between Grangemouth and Stirling. The aircraft dived in and buried itself eight feet into the ground. On recent inspection of the salvaged wreck of P6966, it was noticed that the defective tyre fitted was not of the correct size for a Whirlwind. Instead, it was the correct size for a Hurricane which 263 Squadron was also flying.|$|E

25|$|De Palma {{is known}} for quoting and {{referencing}} other directors' work throughout his career. Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup and Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation plots {{were used for the}} basis of <b>Blow</b> <b>Out.</b> The Untouchables finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin. The main plot from Rear Window was used for Body Double, while it also used elements of Vertigo. Vertigo was also the basis for Obsession. Dressed to Kill was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's Psycho, including such moments as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.|$|E
