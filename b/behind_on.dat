5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Autobots remains <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> Earth to investigate allegations that Skywatch head Spike Witwicky illegally executed Scrapper, discovering that his crimes go far deeper, {{and that he}} has been trading weapons technology with Swindle. Spike goes on the run, and Jazz, already compromised after killing a human in the heat of battle, dissolves the Autobots' alliance with Skywatch.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, {{and drug dealers}} and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> tax payments, and the city threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} weekend, Lewis Hamilton {{was leading the}} World Drivers' Championship on 252 points, 41 ahead of his Mercedes {{teammate}} Nico Rosberg. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari was 8 more points <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> 203, followed by Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas on 107 and 101 points respectively. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes was leading Ferrari by 153 points, with Williams an additional 112 points behind in third.|$|E

5|$|On February 8, 2008, Van der Sloot {{met with}} Aruban {{investigators}} in the Netherlands and denied {{that what he}} said on the tape was true, stating that he was {{under the influence of}} marijuana at the time. Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> the beach.|$|E
5|$|Ships {{were ordered}} to make for the open ocean. Chicago left her {{anchorage}} at 02:14, leaving a sailor <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> the mooring buoy in her haste to depart. Bombay, Whyalla, Canberra, and Perkins began their preparations to depart.|$|E
5|$|The USEE had a scare against Eighteen of Bolton in {{the three-day}} match {{starting}} on Thursday, 18 July. They won by just 21 runs having been slightly <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> first innings. Grace and Southerton bowled the Bolton team out {{but the difference}} was a second innings of 63 by Charlwood {{in a total of}} just 120. Grace scored 51 and 22 and took 20 wickets. The USEE won the final match of this tour, starting on Monday, 22 July, against Twenty-two of Birmingham by 5 wickets, having been 23 <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> first innings. The USEE had a strong Gloucestershire flavour in this match with all three Grace brothers, Midwinter, Gilbert and Cranston involved. Birmingham scored 128 and 119, Grace taking 21 wickets. USEE scored 105 and 144–5, Grace making 7 and 59. He needed the support of his brother E. M., who scored 52 not out, to secure the five wicket victory.|$|E

5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to charges that he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark were <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> {{the series}} from the start. After several late issues, the team announced a four-month hiatus between issues 21 and 22 to allow Lark {{to get ahead}} of schedule. They said they would not solicit any additional issues until the next story arc was completed, and the hiatus actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, left <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> {{the bullet}} {{as it passes}} through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E

5000|$|Gibson was {{recruited}} by Hawthorn with the 23rd {{pick of the}} 1993 AFL Draft, after earning 'Best On Ground' honours for the Northern Knights in their TAC Cup final win over the Western Jets. He kicked two goals and two <b>behinds</b> <b>on</b> his AFL debut, a win over the previous year's Grand Finalists Geelong at Kardinia Park.|$|R
5|$|Connecticut fumbled {{the ball}} for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was {{responsible}} for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from <b>behind.</b> <b>On</b> the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the highly}} {{productive}} lead-up, Davidson faltered {{in his first}} outing as Australia's Test spearhead. He conceded 1/115 in only 32 overs in the first innings as South Africa reached 9/470 in the First Test in Johannesburg. With Australia 102 <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> the first innings, Davidson's tour nearly ended. Unable {{to cope with the}} 10 pm curfew imposed by team manager Jack Norton, Davidson and roommate Les Favell absconded and went sightseeing. By the time they had returned, Norton had confiscated their keys and left them a note asking them to report. The pair then went to sleep at the home of some supporters who had hosted the team for dinner the previous day.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Levine {{was cast}} in the musical romance-drama film Begin Again. The film was {{directed}} by John Carney and had Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo play the lead roles. In it, he plays Dave Kohl, Knightley's songwriting partner and former boyfriend of five years, who leaves her <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> finding success in the music industry. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival to generally favorable reviews from critics.|$|E

5|$|In November 1955, {{while on}} the sick list for the 49ers due to a {{shoulder}} injury, Johnson carried two women to safety out of a blazing apartment building in Oakland, California. One of the women was his pregnant wife, Barbara Johnson. The couple divorced in 1959, and a bench warrant was issued for Johnson after he fell $2,360 <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> alimony payments, concurrent with his suspension from the Lions for missing the team plane. After retiring as a player, he worked for Columbia Gas and later for Warner Communications. He had aspirations of coaching football, but the opportunity never arose.|$|E
5|$|Link {{can travel}} from the Dark World to the Light World {{at almost any}} outside {{location}} by using the Magic Mirror, and can travel back to the Dark World again from the same location using a temporary portal left <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> the map {{at the point where}} he reappears in the Light World. Otherwise, Link must use hidden warp locations throughout the Light World to travel from the Light World to the Dark World. Travel between worlds allows for puzzles in A Link to the Past that exploit structural differences between the Light and Dark Worlds, as Link may travel to otherwise inaccessible areas in one world by warping from parallel but accessible locations in the other world.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E

5|$|The Martian is a 2015 {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Ridley Scott. The screenplay by Drew Goddard {{is based on}} Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name. Matt Damon stars as an astronaut who is mistakenly presumed dead and left <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> Mars. The film depicts his struggle to survive and others' efforts to rescue him. The film's ensemble cast also features Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, Donald Glover, Aksel Hennie, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.|$|E
5|$|The force out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} runner who {{is required to}} attempt to advance—either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory, or because the runner immediately <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The ground out is technically a special case of the force out.|$|E
5|$|The {{girls and}} the Rippers sneak into W, {{where they are}} ambushed. Kesslee, whose body had been reconstructed by the cybernetic surgeon Che'tsai (James Hong), reveals that Tank Girl has unknowingly been bugged. Deetee is killed. While the Rippers turn the tide of the battle, Jet Girl kills Sergeant Small (Don Harvey), who had earlier sexually harassed her. Kesslee reveals that Sam is in the pipe, her life {{endangered}} by rising water. Tank Girl uses her tank to kill Kesslee, then pulls Sam out of the pipe. The film ends with an animated sequence showing water starting to flow freely. Tank Girl drives down rapids, pulling Booga <b>behind</b> <b>on</b> water-skis, then takes them over a waterfall, shouting for joy.|$|E
