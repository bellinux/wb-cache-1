5|$|The SIRT {{discontinued}} passenger {{service on}} the North Shore <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> Arlington and the South Beach <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> Wentworth Avenue at midnight on March 31, 1953 because of city-operated bus competition; the South Beach Branch was abandoned shortly thereafter, while the North Shore Branch continued to carry freight. By 1955, the third rail on both of the lines were removed. On September 7, 1954, SIRT made an application to discontinue all passenger {{service on the}} Tottenville Branch on October 7, 1954. A large city subsidy allowed passenger service on the Tottenville <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> continue.|$|E
5|$|An Act was {{obtained}} on 27 July 1857 {{to extend the}} line to Minehead, with a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Cleeve; an additional £35,000 capital was authorised, but this work never started.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission {{proposed}} relocating Queens Chapel Road near Northwest <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> {{eliminate the}} highway's circuitous course and extend Ager Road {{to the new}} highway. MD 500 was relocated from Northwest <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> Hamilton Street as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway in 1949. The second carriageway of the new highway was added in 1951 and 1952. The portion of the state highway from the District of Columbia to Northwest Branch was expanded to a divided highway in 1951 and 1952; this work included rebuilding the highway's bridge across Northwest <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> carry the expanded highway. In addition, the remainder of MD 500 from Hamilton Street to US 1 was widened and resurfaced in 1951. The divided highway was extended northeast from Hamilton Street to MD 410 in 1973. MD 500 was reduced from six lanes to four lanes when the highway was re-striped in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The iliohypogastric (T12-L1) and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) {{emerge from}} the psoas major near the muscle's origin, from where they run {{laterally}} downward to pass anteriorly above the iliac crest between the transversus abdominis and abdominal internal oblique, and then run above the inguinal ligament. Both nerves give off muscular <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> both these muscles. Iliohypogastric supplies sensory <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> {{the skin of the}} lateral hip region, and its terminal branch finally pierces the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique above the inguinal ring <b>to</b> supply sensory <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> the skin there. Ilioinguinalis exits through the inguinal ring and supplies sensory <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> the skin above the pubic symphysis and the lateral portion of the scrotum.|$|R

No more than the {{unfinished}} Polar Line was built and there was never any railways built north of Narvik and the Ofoten Line. However, detailed plans were made for the line, including surveying geological conditions and choice of the route.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system for the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area. One of the key components of the system was a downtown subway tunnel on 3rd Avenue terminating at Union Station, where it would split into a south <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> serve Georgetown and Renton, and an east <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> serve Bellevue. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970. The failure of the Forward Thrust ballot measures {{led to the creation}} of Metro Transit in 1972, operating bus service across King County.|$|E

5|$|Nihonium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Seven different isotopes of nihonium have been reported with atomic masses 278, 282–286, and 290; they all decay through alpha decay to isotopes of roentgenium, although nihonium-284 may have an electron capture <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> copernicium-284.|$|E

Another tramway was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course, so that there would be a tramway link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837.|$|E

5|$|The Q11 {{begins at}} Queens Boulevard, and {{runs down the}} entire length of Woodhaven Boulevard and a short portion of Cross Bay Boulevard to Pitkin Avenue.

At 160th Avenue, the route splits into two branches; a western <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Old Howard Beach and an eastern <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Hamilton Beach (the two neighborhoods are {{separated}} by Hawtree Creek).
