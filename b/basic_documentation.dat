Most studies that compared offender and non-offender patients with schizophrenia have only focused on male patients. With this study, we compared demographic and disease-related characteristics between 35 female incarcerated forensic patients (fSZ) and 35 female inpatients with schizophrenia (SZ). <b>Basic</b> clinical <b>documentation</b> and <b>basic</b> forensic clinical <b>documentation</b> revealed significant clinical and demographic {{differences between the two}} groups. Compared to SZ, fSZ were more severely clinically impaired, showing higher rates of comorbid alcohol and substance disorder, more suicide attempts, had more previous hospitalizations, and were younger at disease onset. Regarding demographic variables, fSZ showed a higher rate of unemployment and homelessness and had to rely more often on housing and legal guardianships compared to SZ. These results suggest that female forensic patients with schizophrenia are more severely affected by clinical and non-clinical variables requiring an adapted intervention program. These results may also indicate two developmental trajectories for criminal and non-criminal schizophrenia in females...|$|R

They are gaining importance {{due to the fact}} that they largely depend on common risk factors, of which more than 70 % can be prevented. In 1996, an integrated health prevention program for chronic non-communicable disease based on the Aims of the World Health Organization “Health for all in the 21 st century” was designed in the Republic of Serbia. This program concerns the whole population and measures for its implementation. For its successful realization it is necessary to define standard procedures: uniform terminology, diagnostics, therapy and rehabilitation, its risk factors. The aim of this study was to establish data from <b>basic</b> medical <b>documentation</b> of the primary health care and propose a more efficient and effective evidence, as well as to establish a program for surveillance, prevention and control of mass non-communicable diseases within the existing medical documentation. The data were gathered from medical records of the general practice and occupational health services. A special questionnaire was designed to register data from medical records. Medical records of general practice and occupational health service in Kikinda have been analyzed. The existing medical documentation is insufficient regarding data necessary for evidence, surveillance and analysis of risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases. A follow-up model for surveillance and evidence of risk factors in <b>basic</b> medical <b>documentation,</b> which should be incorporated in routine statistical reports, would actively include medical professionals - doctors and medical staff in prevention and detection of risk factors...|$|R

In constructing the model, consistent treatment of expectations is emphasized. Following current theoretical literature, intertemporal optimization with rational expectations is taken as the starting point, and Euler equations are applied in the estimation of the key behavioural equations. Consistent treatment of technology {{on the supply side}} has been another important aim. We illustrate the properties of the model with some simulation experiments. A complete list of equations and an outline of the derivation of the key equations are presented. We also show how forward-looking equations have been transformed to facilitate simulation under alternative assumptions concerning the formation of expectations. macroeconomic models; Finland; econometric modelling; policy simulations; expectations; Euler equations...|$|E
