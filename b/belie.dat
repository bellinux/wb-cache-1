In {{the final of the}} Inter-Colonial Tournament of 1931–32, he took 3 for 74 and 7 for 73 to bowl Trinidad to victory over British Guiana.|$|E

25|$|Four conversations are {{described}} in the seventh and eighth cantos of the epic. These include the first conversation between Aṣṭāvakra and Janaka, followed by the three debates of Aṣṭāvakra – {{the first one to}} convince the gatekeeper to let him into the assembly; then his answers to the cryptic questions of Janaka; and finally the Śāstrārtha between Bandī and Aṣṭāvakra, in which the seemingly simple enumerations of the numbers one to thirteen <b>belie</b> enigmas and latent meanings which lie beneath. These conversations in the epic are the same as in the Mahābhārata, and the comparison between the poetry in the Saṃskṛta of Mahābhārata and the Hindi of Aṣṭāvakra is noteworthy.|$|E
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the monastic lands granted by Henry VIII {{were not on}} their own {{sufficient}} to ensure Trinity's eventual rise. In terms of architecture and royal association, {{it was not until}} the Mastership of Thomas Nevile (1593–1615) that Trinity assumed both its spaciousness and its courtly association with the governing class that distinguished it since the Civil War. In its infancy Trinity had owed a great deal to its neighbouring college of St John's: in the exaggerated words of Roger Ascham Trinity was little more than a colonia deducta. Its first four Masters were educated at St John's, and it took until around 1575 for the two colleges' application numbers to draw even, a position in which they have remained since the Civil War. In terms of wealth, Trinity's current fortunes <b>belie</b> prior fluctuations; Nevile's building campaign drove the college into debt from which it only surfaced in the 1640s, and the Mastership of Richard Bentley adversely affected applications and finances. Bentley himself was notorious for the construction of a hugely expensive staircase in the Master's Lodge, and for his repeated refusals to step down despite pleas from the Fellows.|$|E

For Elvenking, fantasy themes are used [...] "as a metaphor to cover deeper meanings."

500|$|This rule is {{not simply}} a method of {{breaking}} ties; it reflects an altogether proper reluctance by the judiciary to assume that Congress has chosen further to disadvantage a people whom our Nation long ago reduced to a state of dependency. The rule is particularly appropriate when the statute in question was passed primarily {{for the benefit of the}} Indians, as was the 1959 Division of Assets Act. [...] Absent “clear and plain” language to the contrary, it must be assumed that Congress did not intend to <b>belie</b> its “avowed solicitude” for the Indians with a “backhanded” abrogation or limitation of their rights.|$|E
500|$|The lens' {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} (MTF) metrics for its image resolution (sharpness) {{were described as}} [...] "surprisingly impressive...throughout the entire zoom range" [...] by Photozone.de. The sharpness, in terms of line widths per picture height (LW/PH), is most uniform at 8mm (especially near the f-number of 8 where it is even throughout the image) with strong numbers at the center, borders and corner. [...] Higher focal lengths were less impressive. Optical tests were consistent with lab results pointing to excellent sharpness. However, exposure testing seems to <b>belie</b> the stated f-number capabilities of the lens, since stopping down from widest aperture did not change results, according to Gietler.|$|E

Her breakthrough came playing a cynical outcast in Terry Zwigoff's black comedy Ghost World (2001), an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel of same name. Johansson auditioned for the film via a tape from New York, and Zwigoff believed her to be [...] "a unique, eccentric person, and right for that part". The film premiered at the 2001 Seattle International Film Festival; it was a box office failure, but has since developed a cult status. Credited with [...] "sensitivity and talent [...] <b>belie</b> her age" [...] by an Austin Chronicle critic, Johansson won a Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.|$|E
500|$|Within the guild, DKP may {{stand in}} for competence—high level items (Krista-Lee Malone {{mentions}} a specific item from World of Warcraft, the [...] "Cold Snap" [...] wand) are forms of cultural capital themselves. [...] Since the items are [...] "bound" [...] to the player who first receives them, {{the only way to}} wield a desired item is {{to be involved in the}} raid that defeated the boss which rewards it. [...] As such, a [...] "Cold Snap" [...] represents a signal to other players that the bearer has defeated a particular high-level monster and therefore mastered the skills needed to do so. [...] The points themselves represent a mélange of cultural and material capital. [...] The language of material capital is used: [...] "price", [...] "bid", and [...] "currency", but these terms <b>belie</b> a unit of account that [...] "crosses the line between material and symbolic".|$|E
500|$|Although Paine {{liked to}} say that he read very little, his {{writings}} <b>belie</b> this statement; The Age of Reason has intellectual roots in the traditions of David Hume, Spinoza, and Voltaire. Since Hume had already made many of the same [...] "moral attacks upon Christianity" [...] that Paine popularized in The Age of Reason, scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume's works on religion or had at least heard about them through the Joseph Johnson circle. Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume's description of religion as [...] "a positive source of harm to society" [...] that [...] "led men to be factious, ambitious and intolerant". More of an influence on Paine than Hume, however, was Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-politicus (1678). Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza's ideas through the works of other eighteenth-century deists, most notably Conyers Middleton. Paine would also more than likely have been familiar with Voltaire's mocking wit and the works of other deistic French philosophes.|$|E

2500|$|In {{its modern}} usage, hubris denotes overconfident pride {{combined}} with arrogance. Hubris is {{often associated with}} a lack of humility. Sometimes a person's hubris is also associated with ignorance. The accusation of hubris often implies that suffering or punishment will follow, similar to the occasional pairing of hubris and nemesis in Greek mythology. The proverb [...] "pride goeth (goes) before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall" [...] (from the biblical Book of Proverbs, 16:18) is thought to sum up the modern use of hubris. Hubris is also referred to as [...] "pride that blinds" [...] because it often causes a committer of hubris to act in foolish ways that <b>belie</b> common sense. In other words, the modern definition may be thought of as, [...] "that pride that goes just before the fall." ...|$|E
2500|$|The minimal {{expression}} of the splashed white pattern can include few or no white markings at all. [...] When only minimal markings are present, other qualities can <b>belie</b> splashed white. Stars and snips may lopsided, off-center, or otherwise strangely placed. Blazes are usually blocky or straight-edged, and bottom-heavy. Splashed white blazes may also be crooked or skewed to one side. Sabinos with a bold blaze almost invariably have white on the lip or chin, {{and this is not}} the case for the facial white of a minimally marked splash; the upper lip typically remains colored. Leg markings in a minimally marked splashed white range from hind coronets to high-whites on all four, or marked hindlegs and unmarked forelegs. While sabino leg markings are often tapering with distal patches, the leg markings on a splashed white usually have crisp borders.|$|E
