50|$|Sodium {{chloride}} <b>brine</b> <b>spray</b> {{is used on}} some {{fishing vessels}} to freeze fish. The brine temperature is generally -5 F. Air blast freezing temperatures are -31 F or lower. Given the higher temperature of brine, the system efficiency over air blast freezing can be higher. High-value fish usually are frozen at much lower temperatures, below the practical temperature limit for brine.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. Southern Africa {{faces an}} {{increasingly}} serious shortage of potable water {{and will continue}} to do so for the foreseeable future. Desalination is a process whereby dissolved solids are removed out of a contaminated water source to produce potable water. However, desalination carries an unavoidable energy cost per unit of potable water produced. Minimising this energy cost is an important goal towards making desalination a practical technology for widespread use. A desalination process is proposed by the author which is based on the injection of a <b>brine</b> <b>spray</b> into vacuum conditions. Although a complete desalination process is proposed, only the core components of the desalination process are investigated in the present study. The physical processes taking place in the core components are complex. Computational fluid dynamics is the numerical tool used to investigate the processes taking place in the core components. A commercial computational fluid dynamics code, augmented with user-programming, provides a simulation model for the core components. Due to the complexity of the investigated desalination process not all of its physical aspects are accounted for in the simulation. An analytical as opposed to experimental verification of the simulation is performed. The simulation model is used to perform a number of parametric tests. These tests are used to numerically investigate the effects of a number of process variables on the core components. The results of these parametric tests are presented and discusse...|$|E

50|$|Natamycin {{has been}} used for decades in the food {{industry}} as a hurdle to fungal outgrowth in dairy products and other foods. Potential advantages for the usage of natamycin might include the replacement of traditional chemical preservatives, a neutral flavor impact, and less dependence on pH for efficacy, as is common with chemical preservatives. It can be applied in a variety of ways: as an aqueous suspension (such as mixed into a <b>brine)</b> <b>sprayed</b> on the product or into which the product is dipped, or in powdered form (along with an anticaking agent such as cellulose) sprinkled on or mixed into the product. While not currently approved for use on meats in the United States, some countries allow natamycin to be applied to the surface of dry and fermented sausages to prevent mold growth on the casing. Also, natamycin is approved for various dairy applications in the United States. More specifically, natamycin is commonly used in products such as cream cheeses, cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, shredded cheeses, cheese slices, and packaged salad mixes. One of the reasons for food producers to use natamycin is to replace the artificial preservative sorbic acid.|$|R

50|$|Geotrichum candidum {{can be used}} commercially to {{inoculate}} wash-rinds and bloomy rind cheeses. Cultures {{can be added to}} milk, <b>brine</b> or <b>sprayed</b> onto cheese surface. The optimum pH range for growth on cheese ranges from 4.4 to 6.7. The fungus colonizes nearly the entire surface of the cheese during the early stages of ripening. It is found on soft cheeses like Camembert cheese and semi-hard cheese Saint-Nectaire and Reblochon. For the Camembert cheese the fungi grows {{on the outside of the}} cheese forming a rind. The fungus is responsible for the uniform, white, velvety coat on Saint-Marcellin cheese. Lipases and proteases from G. candidum release fatty acids and peptides that provide the cheese with distinctive flavors. Geotrichum candidum reduces the bitterness in Camembert cheese through the activity of the aminopeptidases that hydrolyze low molecular weight hydrophobic peptides. Aminopeptidases also contributes an aroma in traditional Norman Camembert. The fungus also neutralize the curd by catabolizing lactic acid produced by bacteria. Geotrichum candidum prepares the cheese for colonization of other acid sensitive bacteria such as Brevibacterium. The fungus inhibits growth of the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. Commercial strains of G. candidum are available for cheese ripening.|$|R
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of <b>brine,</b> which is <b>sprayed</b> on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|R
40|$|In a {{departure}} from past practice, snow plow operations are now executed in a two phase approach: a preparation phase where <b>brine</b> is <b>sprayed</b> on roads, and a snow removal phase. In order to augment existing snow removal operations by the first phase, investments in new facilities such as silos for brine storage, and equipment such as brine spreaders are required. To maximize {{the impact of these}} investments, decisions such as the optimal location of silos and the selection of appropriate equipment must be carefully considered. This thesis addresses the facility location problem only. ^ The benefit of investing in facilities and assigning them to locations in a network is assessed based on two premises: operations shall be expedited and brine shortage shall be avoided. Operations are expedited by providing more replenishment points for trucks so that the time for replenishment dwindles. The model is formulated as a deterministic facility location model. ^ The second premise takes into account that silos are cheaper than brine machines but that they are also less effective in averting brine shortage. Since they are cheaper, more replenishment points can be set up and solving the model only based on the first premise would always suggest to invest in silos. But when subsequently hitting snow storms require plenty of operations with only a few days in between, silos eventually deplete and brine shortage is imminent. The deterministic model is therefore extended to a scenario-based model incorporating variability due to weather. All possible facility combinations, so-called facility type mixes, undergo a stress test and it is assumed that when no brine shortage occurred during this stress test, the facility type mix is also appropriate for less intense weather scenarios which were not considered. ^ In this work, a new concept is assessed which comprises a brine machine on a boat. Such a boat helps to avert brine shortage and additionally provides a mobile replenishment point for trucks. ...|$|R
40|$|In arid {{regions of}} the United States potable water is a {{valuable}} resource and is sometimes produced using energy intensive processes by removing salts from brackish water. Task 4 provides a solar option for producing potable water from brackish water; in competing in Task 4, H 2 OGS has developed a simple, cost effective solar desalination process to provide these regions with necessary, potable water. H 2 OGSâ€™ design takes into account WERC requirements, including cost, energy usage, worker safety, and easily obtained materials. U. S. government regulatory requirements are also taken into account as the proposed location for this process is Alamogordo, New Mexico. H 2 OGSâ€™ design consists of a thin plate-type solar evaporator and also a thin plate-type condenser. Black-painted corrugated galvanized steel panels were used to construct the evaporator and condenser. The black-painted evaporator panels are protected from atmospheric convection by a six mil polyethylene film, commonly used for greenhouses. Radiant energy from the sun passes through the polyethylene film and is absorbed by the black-painted panel. <b>Brine</b> is <b>sprayed</b> onto {{the back side of}} the panel via a nozzle located at the top of the unit. As the brine runs down the evaporating face, it is evaporated. The warmed, evaporated brine gravity drains to an insulated holding tank from which it moves to the next evaporating stage to be further concentrated. The evaporated water is condensed on additional corrugated steel plates located opposite the evaporating face. Because this plate is shielded from direct sunlight, the evaporated water is condensed by convection to the atmosphere and drained into a holding trough at the bottom of the unit where it is pumped to a potable water storage tank. The brine effluent that remains after leaving the final still unit is transported to a solar pond where salts crystalize and are removed by manual raking from the evaporation basin. This basin is designed to be 3 â€™ deep by 45 â€™ wide by 180 â€™ long and will evaporate the remaining 20 % of the bring effluent and allow for crystallization and recovery of the salts.

After air drying, the salts are sold. The health and safety of all individuals involved in the H 2 OGS project is important during the construction and the life of the project. The individuals involved in construction will be trained on the proper safety precautions before construction begins. Warning labels concerning the temperature of the unit will be printed on the solar brine concentrator. Regular and preventative maintenance will be performed by a trained individual(s) to keep the unit running safely and efficiently. 	The public involvement plan is crucial to the success of the solar brine concentrator in Alamogordo, New Mexico; this technology would be competing with the cityâ€™s current technology. Meetings will be held to inform the community of the benefits and disadvantages of both technologies. These meetings will help educate the community and address any community concerns. A training session will be held concerning operation, maintenance, and safety precautions of the facility. 	The H 2 OGS full scale unit will produce 25 L/day/person (1 / 2 of the UN minimum per day) for a community of 500 people or 12, 500 L/day (3, 300 gpd, 1. 2 million gpy). The installed cost of the unit is $ 100, 000. With capital cost amortized over 10 years the yearly capital charge is $ 10, 000. With community volunteer labor the operating costs are $ 10, 000 /yr. With 15, 600 L/day of brine feed the produced salts will be 198 lb/day (66, 000 lb/yr). At a salt netback price of $ 0. 33 /lb, the benefits of salt sales are $ 21, 780 /yr. The salt sales will thus cover both capital charges and operating costs, assuming volunteer labor. This optimistic scenario will produce water at zero cost to the community. The current Alamogordo water cost for large volume users is $ 7. 91 /k gal 23. With operating labor included at $ 50, 000 /yr the cost of water will increase to $ 40. 01 /k gal. 	The following report provides a detailed proposal of the solar brine concentrator, including design concepts, experimental results, health safety and environmental concerns, and a public involvement plan. While the design is recommended for Alamogordo, NM, H 2 OGS has designed the unit to be implemented anywhere there is a real need for potable water near a usable brine source...|$|R
