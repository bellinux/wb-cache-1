5|$|The Horse Project has an {{official}} website, which encourages participation, and offers instructions for tethering. The project accepts donations and volunteer support. Participants considered selling kits for consumers interested in tethering horses. One Portland resident has reportedly installed more than 150 horses. Horses {{are the most}} frequent animal to <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> rings, but pigs, dolls, and other animals have also appeared throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's {{leadership}} in Lucca left it {{arguably the most}} thoroughly Protestant city in Italy. The Inquisition led many of these Protestants to flee, creating a significant population of Protestant refugees in Geneva. Several important leaders in the Reformation can also <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> Vermigli's work in Lucca, including Girolamo Zanchi and Bernardino Ochino.|$|E
5|$|Although Rome {{at first}} rejoiced at {{the demise of}} Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more {{extensive}} trials, as Tiberius persecuted all those who could in any way <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath. Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro. The political turmoil continued until the death of Tiberius in AD 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.|$|E

5|$|Applications {{for grants}} from the Nordic Game Program, which had funded Limbo initial development, {{increased}} 50% {{in the second half}} of 2010, believed to <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the game's success. Playdead was able to buy itself back from its investors in August 2011 from the revenue made from sales of Limbo. Playdead's follow-up title, Inside, first released in June 2016, is visually and thematically similar to Limbo, and includes some elements that were cut from Limbo development.|$|E
5|$|Black has {{the blood}} tested, and finds it {{free of any}} pathogen; meanwhile, the {{government}} center running the earlier briefing has vanished. Black realizes he was tricked into finding Zero for an ulterior motive, eventually learning that the organisation responsible is carrying out medical experiments on the homeless, and may <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the Millennium Group. Elsewhere a homeless man, acting similarly to Zero, attacks two policemen, and is killed in response. Black and fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigate, but are clearly not welcome. Black manages to obtain a blood sample from the dead man, and finds a stretcher tag which he believes {{is connected to the}} United States Department of Energy.|$|E
5|$|Flanders felt that, {{to quell}} inflation, wage {{increases}} should <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> productivity increases, {{rather than the}} cost of living. He recommended splitting gains in productivity three ways: to the worker for higher wages, to the company for higher profits and to the consumer for lower prices. He felt that with this approach everyone would benefit at the company level and in the national economy. Such an approach would require mutual respect and understanding between labor and management.|$|E

5|$|From 1944, the Allies became {{increasingly}} concerned with laying {{the framework of}} post-war Europe. These were formalized through numerous treaties and agreements from 1944. In July 1944, Camille Gutt attended the Bretton Woods Conference in the United States {{on behalf of the}} Belgian government, establishing the Bretton Woods System of currency controls. During the negotiations, Gutt served as an important intermediary between the delegates of the major Allied powers. Through the agreements, the Belgian Franc's exchange rate would <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the American Dollar after the war, while the conference also established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of which Gutt would serve as the first director.|$|E
5|$|In Charlottesville, Virginia, the Smoking Man is admonished by the Well-Manicured Man (John Neville) {{when the}} latter learns about Mulder's travels. Skinner and the agents are subpoenaed {{to appear before}} Senator Sorenson's panel over the missing pouch; when Skinner {{questions}} Scully about Mulder's whereabouts, she is not forthcoming. Meanwhile, as Mulder and Krycek hike through the forests of Krasnoyarsk, the former theorizes that the fragment may <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the Tunguska event, a mysterious cosmic impact {{that occurred in the}} area in 1908. The two men come across a slave labor camp, but are captured by the taskmasters and thrown into a gulag.|$|E
5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which would either be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women to bathe in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate {{the death of a}} federal construction worker and the destruction of various property that can only <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> an escaped elephant. Unfortunately, the only witnesses claim to have seen no animals which might have caused the turmoil. Soon, Mulder and Scully discover the local zoo whose claim to fame is that they've never had a successful animal birth.|$|E
5|$|Journalists {{noted that}} many of the user reviews for Portal 2 on Metacritic evoked {{negative}} opinion of the game, believed to <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the minimal impact on Portal 2s release time. These users cited complaints about the game being too short (with some saying it is only four hours long), the existence of paid downloadable content at launch for some versions, and supposed evidence that the game on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X were ports of the console version. Journalists have defended Valve in these claims, countering that the game's length depends on the amount of immersion the player puts into the game, that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for the co-op mode, and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port.|$|E
5|$|Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly megalithic, the {{earliest}} instances date {{to within a}} few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also {{date back to the}} fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from {{the earliest}}, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.|$|E

5|$|Netherlandish {{painting}} ends in {{the narrowest}} sense {{with the death of}} Gerard David in 1523. A number of mid- and late-16th-century artists maintained many of the conventions, and they are frequently but not always associated with the school. The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists. In the early 16th century, artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions. The painting of the early 16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century, with some painters, following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century, continuing to produce copies of previously painted works. Others came under the influence of Renaissance humanism, turning towards secular narrative cycles, as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes. A full break from the mid-15th-century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of Northern Mannerism around 1590. There was considerable overlap, and the early- to mid-16th-century innovations can <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the Mannerist style, including naturalistic secular portraiture, the depiction of ordinary (as opposed to courtly) life, and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views.|$|E

25|$|The Apprentice was so {{successful}} that, according to Trump, he earned $214 million from 14 seasons of the show, plus more from related product licensing as his name as a brand became more valuable. As {{the popularity of the}} series grew, {{more and more of the}} tasks began to <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> specific companies. For example, sales tasks would require a team to take over a brand-name storefront or restaurant and operate it; and marketing tasks would require teams to prepare a marketing material (e.g. a jingle or flyer) or campaign for an established company. In later series, the launches of specific products would <b>be</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> the airing of episodes of the series. Several companies have appeared multiple times on the show.|$|E

25|$|The Maravi people built bridges called Uraro due to {{changing}} river depth. These bridges were {{made out of}} bamboo.
