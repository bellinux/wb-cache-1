40|$|<b>Back</b> to <b>back</b> can {{be defined}} as a rule of {{construction}} by which in appropriate circumstances the wording of the reinsurance agreement is to be construed {{in the same way as}} the wording of the underlying policy. The discussion on whether or not two contracts are <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> is always interconnected with the contract wording. That way, the most suitable way to discuss the <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> principle is to discuss firstly the full reinsurance clause, incorporation, and then <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> principle conditions, scope, and limits. <b>Back</b> to <b>back</b> overlaps incorporation. If two contracts are rendered <b>back</b> to <b>back,</b> one contract incorporates terms of other one, and the incorporated terms in the reinsurance contract will hold the same meaning as in the underlying policy. Some clauses that can have their meaning altered by <b>back</b> to <b>back</b> presumption are follow the settlements, follow the fortunes, claims control and claims cooperation...|$|R
