5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia <b>boring</b> moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the rachis {{as they get}} older and <b>boring</b> into follicles and eating seeds. This tunneling itself damages the architecture of the spike and prevents seed development. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genus Cryptophasa, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa, Brachmia trinervis, Carposina hyperlopha and an unidentified weevil species.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{sequence}} where {{soccer is}} portrayed as the most <b>boring</b> sport imaginable was intended to show that soccer was more <b>boring</b> on television than live, but both Michels and Groening enjoy the game. The referee at the game is a caricature of the janitor at Film Roman, who supplied director Pete Michels with every piece of soccer information he needed to design the episode. Pelé also makes an appearance at the match, although he is voiced by Hank Azaria.|$|E

5|$|Construction on the Northgate {{extension}} {{was approved}} by voters in a 2008 ballot measure and began in 2012. Two tunnel <b>boring</b> machines used to build the light rail tunnels arrived at Roosevelt station in 2015, on their way between Northgate and the University District.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} pipes and wires around the station areas. In August 1997, work {{started at the}} depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline work. In October and November, the two tunnel <b>boring</b> machines (TBM), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started <b>boring</b> each barrel of the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{the eight}} <b>bore</b> wells in the region, 6 {{are in the}} coastal zone [...] According to a {{regional}} water officer, the <b>bore</b> wells El-gal, and Laanta Morohda are in Zeila district; and Karure and Kalowle are in Lughaya District. Two more <b>bore</b> wells are Husayn and Gerissa. Kalowle <b>bore</b> well provides water to pastoralists and Lughaya Town which is about 8 km from the <b>bore</b> well site. UNICEF has drilled a back up strategic <b>bore</b> well at the site in case the old <b>bore</b> well breaks down. Karure <b>bore</b> well {{does not have a}} back up yet. These <b>bore</b> wells are strategic {{in the sense that they}} are drilled in the driest areas of the coastal zone, where water sources are not obtainable. However, the <b>bore</b> wells have no back ups and if a <b>bore</b> well breaks down, the live of both livestock and the people are at great risk.|$|R

5|$|In January 2014, LaBeouf {{spoke about}} the {{plagiarism}} accusations with Bleeding Cool writer Rich Johnston, where he stated that he saw copyright laws as too restrictive and {{that it did not}} allow for ideas to flow freely. LaBeouf later tweeted a description of his next project, Daniel <b>Boring</b> (a reference to David <b>Boring,</b> another comic created by Clowes). The description of the project was also taken word-for-word from a description by Clowes of his comic. Clowes' attorney, Michael Kump, has since sent a cease-and-desist letter to LaBeouf's attorney, which LaBeouf posted on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{projects}} use tunnel <b>boring</b> machines, which {{increase the}} cost. They minimize disruption at street level and avoid already existing utilities. Examples of such projects include {{the extension of}} the IRT Flushing Line and the IND Second Avenue Line.|$|E

40|$|There exist {{a number}} of experiments/applications where the second {{dimension}} of the <b>bore</b> of Bitter magnets is not fully utilized. Using an analytical solution for elliptical <b>bore</b> coils, we show that reducing one of {{the dimensions of the}} <b>bore</b> can lead to considerable decrease in consumed power and/or coil material. The results of additional numerical computation show that a 20 % higher magnetic field can be achieved for an elliptical <b>bore</b> and racetrack <b>bore</b> coils with 1 : 10 ratio of the transverse dimensions of the <b>bore</b> than for a circular <b>bore</b> coil with the same larger transverse dimension of the <b>bore,</b> consumed power, and disk area.

60|$|There is no {{such thing}} on earth as an uninteresting subject; {{the only thing that can}} exist is an uninterested person. Nothing is more keenly {{required}} than a defence of <b>bores.</b> When Byron divided humanity into the <b>bores</b> and <b>bored,</b> he omitted to notice that the higher qualities exist entirely in the <b>bores,</b> the lower qualities in the <b>bored,</b> among whom he counted himself. The <b>bore,</b> by his starry enthusiasm, his solemn happiness, may, in some sense, have proved himself poetical. The <b>bored</b> has certainly proved himself prosaic.|$|R
5|$|Starting about 3million {{years ago}} and {{continuing}} {{at least through the}} late Pleistocene, extensional faulting of the Earth's crust led to eruption of small volcanoes in the <b>Boring</b> volcanic field. This field extended roughly from Portland and Tualatin on the west to Battle Ground, Washington, on the north to Sandy and <b>Boring</b> on the east. Two of these volcanoes, Mount Sylvania and Cook's Butte, are in the Tryon Creek watershed. The Mount Sylvania eruptions included ash plumes and lava flows that covered some of the Waverly Heights Formation and Columbia River basalts.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{approved}} in December 2007, but was temporarily cancelled a year later. Construction began in May 2010. The tunnel <b>boring</b> machine began work in November 2011 and completed the second tunnel in May 2013. The tunnel was opened to traffic on August 3, 2014.|$|E

5|$|A {{reviewer}} at RPGFan {{praised the}} game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood to be <b>boring.</b> As the science fiction elements were well received, later entries in the series gradually {{moved away from the}} dating theme and became more focused on science fiction. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was the 967th best selling video game of the year in Japan in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Aqua {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from game critics, citing <b>boring</b> plot lines and unenthusiastic voice acting combined with weak combat skills. However, her return in Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue has received positive response by critics. With fans, Aqua was well received, {{and is one}} of Kingdom Hearts most popular characters.|$|E
500|$|Being {{the onset}} of the flood tide, the <b>bore</b> is {{accompanied}} by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the <b>bore</b> has passed. The Severn <b>bore</b> is not a self-reinforcing solitary wave or soliton but rather a shock wave which is formed because the wave is travelling faster than the wave speed in water above the <b>bore</b> (see tidal <b>bore</b> for more details). The passing of the <b>bore</b> causes a churning of the water, and the myriads of tiny bubbles popping contributes much of the roaring sound made by the <b>bore.</b> The largest recorded <b>bore</b> was on 15 October 1966, when it reached a height of [...] at Stonebench.|$|R

40|$|A tidal <b>bore</b> is a {{positive}} surge taking place during the flood tide under macro-tidal conditions and the <b>bore</b> represents {{the leading edge of}} the tidal wave propagating upstream. The fundamentals of tidal <b>bores</b> remain unknown, although some physical experiments were performed during the last two decades. In this study, some physical modelling was performed to investigate the tidal <b>bore</b> propagation and turbulent mixing on fixed and movable gravel beds with both undular and breaking <b>bores.</b> Further observations of particle motion beneath the <b>bore</b> front were recorded. The results showed the significant impact of breaking <b>bore</b> propagation on the gravel bed motion, associated with upstream gravel bed load motion behind the <b>bore.</b> The gravel bed particles were destabilised by the roller toe passage and advected upstream with a convective velocity about 1 / 7 th of the <b>bore</b> celerity...|$|R
