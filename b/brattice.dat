50|$|A <b>brattice</b> is a {{partition}} used in mining. It {{is built}} between columns of a sub-surface mine to direct air for ventilation. Where the mine is sunk {{at the base}} of a single shaft, the shaft is divided into two parts by a wooden or metal <b>brattice.</b> Air is delivered down one side of the shaft and exhausted upwards through the other.|$|E

50|$|More {{victims were}} {{discovered}} in small groups along nearly 500 feet inward on the east gangway throughout Wednesday and early Thursday morning. At 9:00 a.m., a canvas <b>brattice</b> was fashioned on the east gangway to direct air to the west gangway. More victims were discovered there, notably seven men who sealed themselves into a chamber. None of them were wearing shirts. The men had attempted to seal their makeshift <b>brattice</b> with their clothing.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of mine and how the {{operation}} is run, <b>brattices</b> can be permanent (concrete or wood) or temporary (cloth). Temporary installations are also called curtains.|$|R
50|$|A bartizan, (an {{alteration}} of <b>bratticing),</b> also called a guerite or échauguette, or spelled bartisan, is an overhanging, wall-mounted turret projecting {{from the walls}} of late medieval and early-modern fortifications from the early 14th century up to the 18th century. Most frequently found at corners, they protected a warder and enabled him to see his surroundings. Bartizans generally are furnished with oillets or arrow slits. The turret was usually supported by stepped masonry corbels and could be round or square.|$|R
2500|$|A crowd {{consisting}} of miners' families and curious onlookers quickly {{gathered at the}} Cross Mountain Mine as miners and engineers immediately initiated a rescue operation. [...] A ventilation fan was brought from a nearby mine and used to expel the afterdamp and force air into the mine shafts. [...] A rescue crew from the Bureau of Mines which had been created the previous year arrived at around noon equipped with gas masks and oxygen tanks. [...] This team was the first mine rescue team to use caged canaries to detect dangerous changes in air quality. Water was piped into the mine from a nearby brook, allowing the Bureau crews to extinguish fires and erect <b>brattices.</b>|$|R

5000|$|By 3 a.m. Wednesday, {{workers were}} able {{move down the}} main gangway to the mule stable, several hundred feet inward. The first two victims were discovered, the stable boss and a young mule driver. Their [...] "bodies were bloated with blood oozing from their mouths". By 6:30 a.m., workers arrived at the east gangway, which was a {{crosscut}} off the main gangway. A makeshift <b>brattice</b> (barrier) of coal, rock, scrap wood, mud, and canvas was encountered less than 100 feet inward. The <b>brattice</b> was constructed by the desperate trapped miners attempting to stop the infiltration of blackdamp, {{in the hope of}} surviving on cleaner deep mine air until rescue. Rescuers pierced the <b>brattice,</b> and encountered [...] "a view which appalled the stoutest heart among them. Grouped together, in every possible position, laid the dead bodies of sixty-seven men and boys." [...] Many victims appeared merely to be asleep; fathers embraced their sons, men assumed the attitude of prayer, others leaned against gangway walls. Some men had struggled for a final breath; their faces were buried in the coal dust of the floor or wrapped with their shirts. Eyeballs were protruded, and blood had foamed from mouths and noses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brattice,</b> {{from the}} French bretèche, {{originally}} referred to {{part of a}} castle. This was a small wooden structure, sometimes temporary, that projected out beyond {{the main part of}} a castle wall, so as to give flanking fire along that wall whilst still offering some degree of protection. See hoarding.|$|E
50|$|The {{outline of}} the walls of Petra Castellana, the ancient city beneath the current one, is still visible, and in places they reach seven meters in height. The walls are thought to date from the 12th century, {{although}} a June 2016 archeological excavation sought to date them more precisely. Only one tower survives of the fourteen that originally reinforced these walls: the 14th-century pentagonal keep. This keep, which dominates the town center, is on private property but was declared a historic monument in 1921.Construction on the wall enclosing the lower town began in 1359, {{with the permission of}} the Count of Provence, Louis I of Naples. Traces of this wall are still visible in the square towers {{on the front of the}} houses on the square. Corbels, which could support defenses (<b>brattices</b> or simple parapets with battlements) are visible on their façades.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{explosion}} the station master, J B Griffen, sent the company's train to Balclutha to get Dr Smith. He {{arrived on the scene}} some 25 minutes later. While this was happening, men from the neighbouring mines gathered and organised a group of volunteers to either rescue the miners or recover their bodies. Fire damp initially prevented rescuers from entering the mine. Those first entering the mine were W Shore, R M Sewell, Mr Aitcheson, and some unnamed others. They found two falls in the mine, which had been caused by the explosion. Also the <b>brattices</b> which allowed air circulation had been destroyed and temporary canvas ones needed to be installed prior to further searching. Several of those installing the canvas ones were almost suffocated. The condition in the mine remained dangerous and those working in it had to do so in shifts because of the impact of after damp. All hope of finding the miners alive was abandoned at this point.|$|R
60|$|The most {{important}} part of Jack's duties consisted in going round the pit before the men went down in the morning, to see that there was no accumulation of gas in the night, and that the ventilation was going on properly. The deputy usually takes a helper with him, and Jack had chosen his friend Harry for the post--as in the event of finding gas, it has to be dispersed by beating it with an empty sack, so as to cause a disturbance of the air, or, if the accumulation be important, by putting up a temporary <b>bratticing,</b> or partition, formed of cotton cloth stretched on a framework, {{in such a way as}} to turn a strong current of air across the spot where the gas is accumulating, or from which it is issuing. The gas is visible to the eye as a sort of dull fog or smoke. If the accumulation is serious, the main body of miners are not allowed to descend into the mine until the viewer has, with assistance, succeeded in completely dispersing it.|$|R
50|$|Early collieries {{sometimes}} {{only had}} one pit which was divided by a <b>brattice.</b> A furnace was kept burning within the pit and the hot air rose up the {{one side of the}} <b>brattice</b> (the upcast side) drawing cold air down the other (the downcast side). One such pit was Hartley pit. In 1862 the beam of the pumping engine failed and brought down part of the lining resulting in the pit being blocked. All the men trapped underground died from carbon monoxide poisoning {{as a consequence of the}} lack of ventilation. As a result an Act of Parliament was passed later in the year requiring all collieries to have at least two shafts. Rather than bratticing one shaft, it was more convenient to use one shaft as the upcast pit and the other as the downcast pit. Underground however, brattices remained vitally important for directing the current of air throughout the whole of the colliery.|$|E
50|$|Before {{recovery}} {{could begin}} the shaft {{had to be}} timbered and the <b>brattice</b> completed. During rescue attempts safety concerns had been minimised, but now {{the welfare of the}} recovery workers took priority. By the Saturday the works were complete and the sinkers and shaftmen withdrawn. First down were Humble and Hall (a manager from a nearby collier) followed by Chapman and Brown then other men.|$|E
50|$|Wilkinson, John, 13 Oct 1846, aged 12, while {{standing}} {{waiting to be}} drawn up from the High Main Coal seam at Ludworth Pit on 13 October, John Wilkinson, aged 12, was accidentally knocked {{through a hole in}} the <b>brattice</b> by the onsetter, who was taking a tub out of the cage. The boy fell down the opposite section of the shaft, a distance of about 10 fathoms, and was killed.|$|E
60|$|I {{had some}} {{talk with a}} youngish man whose {{business}} it was to train avalanches to jump clear of his section of the track. Thor went to Jotunheim only once or twice, {{and he had his}} useful hammer Miolnr with him. This Thor lived in Jotunheim among the green-ice-crowned peaks of the Selkirks--where if you disturb the giants at certain seasons of the year, by making noises, they will sit upon you and all your fine emotions. So Thor watches them glaring under the May sun, or dull and doubly dangerous beneath the spring rains. He wards off their strokes with enormous <b>brattices</b> of wood, wing-walls of logs bolted together, and such other contraptions as experience teaches. He bears the giants no malice; they do their work, he his. What bothers him a little is that the wind of their blows sometimes rips pines out of the opposite hill-sides--explodes, as it were, a whole valley. He thinks, however, he can fix things so as to split large avalanches into little ones.|$|R
50|$|The New Hartley Pit Disaster {{occurred}} on 16 January 1862, {{it was during}} the change from the fore-shift to the back-shift when nearly all of the two shifts were still down the pit, that the beam of the pumping engine that kept the pit clear of water broke in two, and 20 tons of cast iron plunged down the shaft, stripping the <b>brattices</b> and rocks and blocking the one and only shaft. It took several days of heroic effort by rescue teams to reach the entombed men and boys - all to no avail as all were dead. All in all 204 men and boys perished in the disaster, either when the beam plummeted down the shaft or as a result of being entombed. A fitting Memorial to all of them is at St Alban's Church, Earsdon, where an obelisk lists the names and ages of all the casualties. Additionally the everlasting memorial is that Parliament quickly passed a law ensuring that all future pits opened had to have two shafts. There is a memorial garden in the village {{at the site of the}} disaster, which includes remnants of the shaft entrance.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of January 12, 1886, gas ignited at the Almy Number 4 mine {{claiming}} 11 men and 2 boys. The Deseret Evening News in Salt Lake City described the disaster:The night of January 12 about 25 minutes to 12, {{the people of the}} vicinity were startled by a loud report as of thunder, and for a few seconds the sky was illuminated for miles like a bright-yellow sunset. The noise and light, proceeding from the No. 4 mine, was caused by an explosion of gas, the force of which was so terrific as to blow all of the building's above-ground into kindling wood, sending great timbers and rocks three-quarters of a mile. Miners’ houses were' struck and pierced, but the people in them were not seriously injured. Two miners riding down the slope in a trip of empty cars had got down to the 3d level when the explosion broke the cars into fragments and shot them out as from a cannon. The two bodies were blown to pieces and were found a considerable distance from the portal. Eleven men and two boys were said to have been in the mine, and all were killed. (Rescue' crews forced their way into the mine and placed temporary <b>brattices</b> to permit recovery of the bodies. The last was brought, out January 15. The explosion was thought to have originated in the 13th level {{on the south side of}} the mine, when gas was ignited by a miner's open light. Although the mine had been troubled with gas the fireboss had reported it clear at 6 a. m. on the day of the explosion.|$|R
50|$|In medieval fortresses, a bretèche or <b>brattice</b> {{is a small}} balcony with machicolations, usually {{built over}} a gate and {{sometimes}} {{in the corners of}} the fortress' wall, with the purpose of enabling defenders to shoot or throw objects at the attackers huddled under the wall. Depending on whether they have a roof, bretèches are classified in two types: open and closed. The open ones were accessed from the battlement's wall walk, or from a crenel.|$|E
50|$|With {{a single}} shaft {{colliery}} this simple arrangement {{could not be}} followed, and so a timber <b>brattice</b> (B) was built {{from the top of}} the shaft to the bottom. Men and materials passed up and down on the downcast side, the pumps worked in the upcast. At Hartley a furnace was kept burning in the yard seam (E) with the rising hot gasses passing up the furnace drift (I) to join and draw foul air up the upcast side of the shaft.|$|E
50|$|Sparks {{from the}} wooden brake blocks of a haulage engine had {{set fire to}} nearby <b>brattice</b> sheets. The fire spread quickly, fanned by the strong {{ventilation}} and ignited timber supports, sending dense clouds of smoke and fumes into the mine workings. The death toll {{would have been much}} higher {{had it not been for}} the actions of the district fireman, Thomas Prosser. Prosser bravely ventured into the dense smoke and, by opening a set of air doors, diverted the noxious fumes out of the mine.|$|E
50|$|A hoard or {{hoarding}} (also {{known as}} a <b>brattice</b> or , from the French bretèche) was a temporary wooden shed-like construction that {{was placed on the}} exterior of the ramparts of a castle during a siege to allow the defenders to improve their field of fire along the length of a wall and, most particularly, directly downwards to the wall base. The latter function was capably taken up by the invention of machicolations, which were an improvement on hoardings, not least because masonry {{does not need to be}} fire-proofed. Machicolations are also permanent and siege-ready.|$|E
50|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred as}} the mine was transitioning from day shift to night shift. Most {{of the day}} shift workers had already exited the mine, {{while most of the}} night shift workers had just reached their work areas in the northwest section. The assistant to the mine boss, Tom Callaghan, was among a group of sixteen men who had worked together to erect a cloth <b>brattice</b> approximately 500 ft from the flame zone. Within a few minutes of the explosion, Callaghan had managed to telephone the mine house on the surface.|$|E
5000|$|A {{second reason}} {{to divide the}} shaft is for ventilation. One {{or more of the}} {{compartments}} discussed above may be used for air intake, while others may be used for exhaust. Where this is the case a steel wall called a <b>Brattice</b> is installed between the two compartments to separate the air flow. At many mines there are one or more complete additional separate [...] "Auxiliary" [...] shafts with separate head gear and cages. It is safer to have an alternate route to exit the mine as any problem in one shaft may affect all the compartments.|$|E
5000|$|The rescuers' {{progress}} was restricted due to roof falls and after-damp. Where {{it was possible}} to penetrate further into the mine bodies were found unburnt but damaged by the blast. Matthew Hague, a night deputy, told the inquest of finding 16 bodies between [...] and : [...] "They were not burnt or scorched in the least, but appeared as if asleep." [...] James Marsh, a miner from [...] "Worsbro'dale" [...] (Worsbrough), tried to push on past Hague, but had to turn back [...] "as the air was so bad" [...] During the day the rope and cage for the No. 1 shaft were repaired and <b>brattice</b> was sent down to repair the stoppings.|$|E
50|$|On 16 January 1862 {{the fore}} shift went on duty at 02:30. At 10:30 the same morning the back shift were taking {{over from the}} fore shift, so most men of both shifts were at the coal face. As the first eight men were ascending, the beam of the pumping engine snapped and fell down the shaft. Although much of the <b>brattice</b> was destroyed, the first part seems to have {{deflected}} the beam away from the cage. Other debris did fall on the cage snapping {{two of the four}} support chains. Four of the eight men fell, the others managed to cling on. The beam came to rest jammed in the shaft and other falling debris created a blockage 30 yd deep between the yard seam and the high main.|$|E
50|$|A <b>brattice</b> was {{constructed}} {{to divert the}} air passing from number 3 pit directly to the upcast, and by this means More's dook became passable by 22:00. Four survivors were found, all badly injured. One of them, a boy, died shortly afterwards. The remaining three {{were brought to the}} surface through number 2 pit and sent to Glasgow Infirmary, but all died within the month. Rescue parties explored number 3 pit as far as they could, but were limited by chokedamp and firedamp. Seventeen bodies were found and brought {{to the foot of the}} blocked number 3 shaft for later retrieval. The shaft was unstable, and if it closed up the rescuers would be deprived of air so they retreated until the shaft could be secured from above. All hope of finding more survivors was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|To restart some {{ventilation}} a cloth <b>brattice</b> was rigged {{from the}} surface down to the work area. On the Wednesday the furnace drift was reached but George Emerson, who attempted to enter it, was forced back by the gas. He did report seeing an axe, saw and sawn timber which indicated that the trapped miners had attempted to escape along that route. Later in the day William Adams of Cowpen and Robert Wilson of Backworth managed to enter the yard seam and found the men dead. Humble and Hall penetrated further and found the dead miners, but on their return to the bank were severely affected by the gas. The corn bins to feed the horses had been emptied to provide emergency food for the trapped miners, some miners were found with corn in their pockets. Although other men went down after Humble and Hall, no survivors were found and all returned seriously affected by the gas. All work ceased with the extinguishing of the last hope and the rescue moved into the recovery phase.|$|E
5000|$|An inquisition at Plymouth, in the County of Luzerne, the eighth, ninth, eleventh, and fourteenth days of September, in {{the year}} of our Lord, one {{thousand}} eight hundred and sixty-nine,...do say upon their oaths that...The cause of death of Palmer Steele miner and other people sustained was the exhaustion of atmospheric air and the presence of the abundance of carbonic acid gasses in the said Avondale mines, caused by the burning of the Head House and Breaker at said mine, on the sixth day of September 1869, destroying the air courses leading from the mine through the shaft. That the fire originated from the furnace in the mine, taking effect on the wood <b>brattice</b> to the up-cast air course leading {{from the bottom of the}} shaft to the Head House.The jury regards the present system of mining in a large number of cases now working by shaft as insecure and unsafe to the miner, and would strongly recommend, in all cases where practicable, two places for ingress and egress and a more practical means of ventilation, thereby rendering greater security to the life of the miner under any similar accident.|$|E
5000|$|... “Early on {{the morning}} of Tuesday week, some men {{belonging}} to Sheriff-hill Colliery, Northumberland, were waiting the arrival of the gin-horse to go down into the pit. Owing to the cleaning of the boiler, the regular engine rope was not in a working state at the moment; but about 20 fathoms of it, with the chain, were hanging into the shaft. One of the men, John Wilson, having, in the dark, gone incautiously too near the bridge, fell in. Repeated cries from within the shaft at last roused the attention of the other men, who, on repairing to the spot with a light, were told by him that he had fallen into the pit, and was then hanging by the rope.As soon as the alarm would allow them to take measures for his preservation, they proceeded to adjust the gin-rope — a work that occupied not less than 15 minutes, from their having to discharge it on one pulley and place it upon another. After fixing on a corf, one of them wished to descend in it to his assistance, but this Wilson forbade them to do so. The corf was now let down gently till it came under his feet he then freed himself from the engine rope, and being seated in the corf, was drawn slowly to bank, in a state of indescribable trepidation. He was, however, able, with the assistance of another man, to walk upwards of a mile to his own house, which on entering, he threw himself upon his knees, and poured out his fervent thanks to God for his deliverance. No sooner was this done than, overpowered by the dreadful conflict of his feelings, he fainted.Some time elapsed before he recovered tolerable composure, and even still when the subject is recurred to, his agitation is extreme. Being questioned minutely, he said he had gone to the brink of the shaft to ascertain whether his comrade was calling upon him from below, and being deceived by a glimmering of light through a crevice in the <b>brattice</b> partition, his feet slipped. He was conscious at the moment he dropt in, but has no recollection whatever of how or when he caught hold of the engine rope. The first thing he was sensible of was the rope sliding in his breast, and next its stripping his left hand, which he held mainly on, and also with the legs and feet. He had in his right hand a small stick, of which he kept firm possession all the time, and brought it up with him. There was a chasm of 450 feet perpendicular depth yawning beneath”.|$|E

Firedamp was ignited by an open acetylene cap lamp and the initial explosion started fires which spread rapidly.David Brown, the overman, descended the pit and proceeded with a fireman to explore the narrow workings where men were trapped. Though they encountered smoke for a time it was not sufficiently dense to prevent progress but as they passed the junction of another heading increasing smoke compelled their withdrawal. After waiting a few minutes Brown made another attempt, alone, to get inbye. He actually got in to No. 3 Dookhead, where he shouted but got no response. He saw no signs, of the inbye men nor of their lights, and {{he was forced to}} withdraw again. On his way outbye, he again met the fireman, who said he had been trying to improve the atmospheric conditions in the inbye section by a partial opening of some <b>brattice</b> screen doors, but this step was of no avail. The atmospheric conditions were getting worse all the time, to the spreading of the fires, the extent and seriousness of which even then were not generally realized. Brown, however, did realize the seriousness of the position in relation to the trapped men and immediately sent word explaining the position to the manager who was dealing with fires elsewhere, asking for all possible assistance and making it quite clear that there was no hope of undertaking further exploratory work without the use of rescue teams wearing self-contained breathing apparatus. He then set out to discover for himself where all the smoke was coming from.Although the National Fire Service was never intended for fire-fighting underground in mines, nevertheless, a team at once volunteered for this duty. Two members of the team donned their one-hour Proto-Breathing Apparatus. Underground, they met the overman, Brown, who pleaded {{for the use of the}} two sets of Proto-Apparatus, so that he and another trained member of the Burngrange Mines Rescue Team could make another attempt to get into the workings beyond No. 3 Dook. Using the one-hour apparatus borrowed from the N.F.S. Brown and his companion made an unsuccessful attempt to rescue the trapped men. At 11.15 pm under the captaincy of Brown a fresh team wearing goggles and using a life-line again attempted to reach the men but were forced to return as the temperature was very high and the smoke so dense that their lights could not be seen. There had been a fall of stone and sounds of strata movement were heard. A further attempt along another level led to the discovery of another fire and it became certain that there was no hope of saving the men until this was under control. The work of firefighting continued for four days and it was not until the night of 13th/14th January, that it was considered practicable to send a rescue team beyond the fire area. With one exception the bodies of all the 15 men who lost their lives by the effect of afterdamp and fumes were in No. 3 Dook."The Scotsman newspaper {{reported on}} 30 January 1948:"The Carnegie Hero Fund Trustees at Dunfermline yesterday awarded an honorary certificate and grants of £25 and £15 respectively to David Brown, mine oversman, 82 Parkhead Crescent, and James M'Arthur, shaleminer, 12 Kirkgate, both of West Calder, Midlothian, who on January 10, 1947, attempted to rescue a number of workmen who had been trapped following an explosion in a colliery at West Calder.

40|$|In {{underground}} mine, it is {{very important}} to maintain fresh and sufficient air in unventilated areas to maintain safe working environment for workers. To study the behaviour of air flow in underground mine, a T-shaped crosscut region of Bord and Pillar mining is considered for simulation in two different cases: without and with thin <b>brattice</b> positioning at crosscut region. <b>Brattice</b> is cost effective ventilation control device to deflect air into unventilated areas in underground mine. The ultimate objective is to find the best location and dimension of <b>brattice</b> across the crosscut region by which one can get maximum velocity at dead end. In this thesis, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and optimization algorithms are considered for maximizing the air flow at the dead end by placing a <b>brattice</b> at optimum location. Two different optimization algorithms: multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and non-linear programming of quadratic Lagrangian (NLPQL) optimization techniques were used in this study. ANSYS FLUENT software is used for CFD modeling at T-shaped crosscut region and computes the simulation result of air flow velocity at dead end. Optimization techniques are used for to optimize four input parameters; <b>brattice</b> position vertical and horizontal from the wall of crosscut region and width and length of <b>brattice.</b> The objectives for optimizations are to maximize the velocity at dead end and minimize the pressure drop in crosscut region.

40|$|Coal mine {{ventilation}} systems are often subject to high leakage rates. As a result, changes in airflow resistance will strongly affect the efficiency with which air is {{delivered to the}} working place. One major source of airflow resistance is the line <b>brattice</b> used to direct air from the last open crosscut to the working face. Because {{it is a great}} distance from the fan, the resistance of the line <b>brattice</b> can result in more overall leakage than an equivalent resistance closer to the fan. Substituting auxiliary fans for <b>brattice</b> eliminates this source of resistance, with improvements in system efficiency and cost. Also, in some mines, the leakage that leads to spontaneous combustion can be reduced. The benefits obtained by several different <b>brattice</b> and fan substitutions have been studied by Mine Ventilation Services, Inc., Lafayette, CA, under contract to the U. S. Bureau of Mines.

40|$|In recent years, Computational Fluid Dynamics, CFD, {{has been}} {{commonly}} utilized in the mining industry {{to model the}} fluid flow behavior in underground mine workings.
