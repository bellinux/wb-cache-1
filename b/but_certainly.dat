5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place {{during the early years of}} Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when a floor was inserted and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E

5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} {{some insight into}} his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> {{among the most important}} of these for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends the extent to which a particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{joined the}} King in the advance on London, playing {{a key role}} in the {{resulting}} Battle of Edgehill in October. Once again, Rupert was at his best with swift battlefield movements; the night before, he had undertaken a forced march and seized the summit of Edgehill, giving the Royalists a superior position. When he quarrelled with his fellow infantry commander, Lindsey, however, some of the weaknesses of Rupert's character began to display themselves. Rupert vigorously interjected—probably correctly, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> tactlessly—that Lindsey should deploy his men in the modern Swedish fashion that Rupert was used to in Europe, which would have maximised their available firepower. The result was an argument in front of the troops and Lindsey's resignation and replacement by Sir Jacob Astley. In the subsequent battle Rupert's men made a dramatic cavalry charge, but despite his best efforts a subsequent scattering and loss of discipline turned a potential victory into a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|In 1535, the abbey's {{income was}} only {{assessed}} at £155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances. It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, it was not to be and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E

25|$|In Scandinavia {{family names}} often, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> not always, {{originate}} from a patronymic. Later on, {{people from the}} Scandinavian middle classes, particularly artisans and town dwellers, adopted surnames {{in a similar fashion}} to that of the gentry. Family names joining two elements from nature such as the Swedish Bergman ("mountain man"), Holmberg ("island mountain"), Lindgren ("linden branch"), Sandström ("sand stream") and Åkerlund ("field grove") were quite frequent and remain common today.|$|E
25|$|Often, as men age {{and begin}} to lose their hair, the hair is either closely cropped, or the head is shaved {{completely}} free of hair. However, since the 1960s, natural hairstyles, such as the afro, braids, and dreadlocks, have been growing in popularity. Despite their association with radical political movements and their vast difference from mainstream Western hairstyles, the styles have attained considerable, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> limited, social acceptance.|$|E
25|$|When King James II of England was dethroned in the Glorious Revolution of 1688/9, he is {{supposed}} to have thrown the Great Seal of the Realm into the River Thames before his flight to France {{in order to ensure that}} the machinery of government would cease to function. It is unclear how much truth there is to this story, <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> the seal was recovered: James's successors, William III and Mary used the same Great Seal matrix, fairly crudely adapted – possibly quite deliberately, in order to demonstrate the continuity of government.|$|E

25|$|In 1666, {{a project}} for the main altar by Malta's {{greatest}} sculptor, Melchiorre Cafà, was approved and begun. Cafà intended a large sculpture group in bronze depicting the Baptism of Christ. Following Cafà's tragical death in 1667 in a foundry accident while working on this work in Rome, the plans were abandoned. Only in 1703, Giuseppe Mazzuoli, Cafà's only pupil, finished a marble group of the Baptism of Christ {{which might have been}} influenced by his master's undocumented designs <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> is strongly dependent on a small baptism group by Alessandro Algardi.|$|E
25|$|Margaret {{was married}} to Suffolk's son, John de la Pole. The wedding may have been held between 28 January and 7 February 1444, when she was perhaps a year old <b>but</b> <b>certainly</b> no more than three. However, there is more {{evidence}} to suggest {{they were married in}} January 1450, after Suffolk had been arrested and was looking to secure his son's future. Papal dispensation was granted on 18 August 1450, necessary because the spouses were too closely related, and this concurs with the later date of marriage.|$|E

Though he never applied himself to his studies at the Inner Temple, he well applied himself to spending money and living as a bon vivant which led to him quickly running out of funds.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} {{involved}} in ant keeping is capturing a fertilized queen ant. Ants engage in nuptial flights during spring and summer, and after these flights a fertilized queen ant will land and remove her wings before locating a spot to found her new colony. If a queen has already chewed her wings off, she is likely (<b>but</b> not <b>certainly)</b> fertilized. If a queen ant {{on the ground}} still has her wings, she is likely (<b>but</b> not <b>certainly)</b> unfertilized.|$|R
