Gould regained his international place and the captaincy on his return for the 1892 Home Nations Championship. The tournament was a failure for Wales; the team lost all three of their matches. There was little consistency for Gould at centre, with three different centre-pairings in each of the matches; Garrett against England, Conway Rees at home to Scotland and in the Irish encounter, Gould's younger brother Bert. The 1892 Championship was soured by the aftermath of the Wales–Scotland encounter, which was played in Swansea at St. Helen's. After Wales lost the game 7–2, members of the crowd, angered by Jack Hodgson's refereeing of the game, attacked him. The assailants <b>by-passed</b> the police and the referee had to be rescued by members of the Welsh team. In the struggle, Gould was struck on the chin, and it was reported that Hodgson only reached the Mackworth Hotel because Gould accompanied him on the coach.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringSunanda DissanayakeConstruction of <b>by-pass</b> lanes at rural intersections {{typically}} {{has been}} considered a low-cost safety improvement. Safety analysis utilizes two common approaches to evaluate treatment effectiveness: before-and-after study and cross-sectional study. This research performed paired sample t-test statistical analysis to estimate changes in total of crash frequency, crash rates, EPDO crash frequency, and EPDO crash rates at intersections, {{three to five years}} after adding a <b>by-pass</b> lane compared to identical time period before the <b>by-pass</b> lane was added. Crash data between 1990 and 2011 were obtained from Kansas Crash and Analysis Record System (KCARS) maintained by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT). In order to perform a cross-sectional study, intersections with <b>by-pass</b> lanes were compared to intersections with no countermeasures; crash data were obtained for more than 1, 100 intersections in the state of Kansas. According to before-and-after study, addition of <b>by-pass</b> lanes improves safety at unsignalized rural intersections; crashes and their severities are reduced after adding <b>by-pass</b> lanes. But, these reductions are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. However, when considering intersection related crashes, a statistically significant reduction in crash rates is happened after adding <b>by-pass</b> lanes at 3 -legged intersections. In cross-sectional study, crashes and their severities are lower at 3 -legged intersections with the <b>by-pass</b> lanes versus 3 -legged intersections without the <b>by-pass</b> lanes. However, these reductions are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. When considering 300 feet intersection crash box, statistically significant reductions are happened at 4 -legged intersection. In contrast, crashes and their severities increased at 4 -legged intersections with the <b>by-pass</b> lanes, but these changes are not statistically significant under 95 % confidence level. The Crash Modification Factors were calculated to evaluate safety effectiveness of adding <b>by-pass</b> lanes at unsignalized rural intersections. The calculated CMFs less than 1. 0, indicate a reduction in crashes after implementation of <b>by-pass</b> lanes. Finally, this study concluded that expected crashes at intersections with <b>by-pass</b> lanes are lower than intersections without <b>by-pass</b> lanes...|$|R
40|$|The maximum {{available}} {{free length}} in the straight {{sections of the}} BESSY II storage ring will be 5. 6 m. A <b>by-pass</b> option for BESSY II could be of interest if extra long insertion devices are to be installed. A simple approach of such an option is suggested here, which offers a 14. 5 m long straight section. Optical beam parameters and the required hardware modifications for aby-pass section are presented. The <b>by-pass</b> operation should be optional to the storage ring mode with a minimum impact on the regular storage ring operation. The suggested solution for the <b>by-pass</b> fits into the ring tunnel. All additional magnets are of the same type as presently planned or constructed for the storage ring. The beam optics are closely matched to the storage ring operation, i. e. the transversal emittance will not change. Solutions for a single <b>by-pass</b> and a double <b>by-pass</b> are discussed. The construction scheme of the <b>by-pass</b> is in both cases nearly identical. The single <b>by-pass</b> solution is based on different radio-frequencies (rf) for booster and storage ring and this mismatch {{requires a lot of}} effort for controlling rf and injection of the two machines. In case of the double <b>by-pass</b> solution both rings run at the same (the nominal) rf, which is celarly an advantage. However, the disadvantage of this solution is that there are twice as many cells of the storage ring involved in the <b>by-pass</b> operation. First, we present the construction scheme for a <b>by-pass</b> cell, then a single and double <b>by-pass</b> solution are discussed. (orig.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review our results with axillofemoral <b>by-passes</b> {{performed}} for aortoiliac occlusive disease. Fifty patients receiving 51 axillofemoral <b>by-passes</b> from January 1989 to December 1994 were retrospectively reviewed. The 30 -day post-operative mortality was 4 %. Seven patients (14 % presented graft-related local complications and all but one required reoperation. Five patients were lost to follow-up, the mean length of which was 36 months (16 - 74 months). Forty-nine per cent of the patients died during the follow-up period. At 36 months, the primary patency rate was 51 %, the secondary patency rate was 69 %, and limb valvage rate was 57 %. A statistical difference was seen in the secondary patency rate between axillobifemoral <b>by-pass</b> (87 %) and axillo-unifemoral <b>by-pass</b> (56 %) at 36 months (P < 0. 01), but no difference was seen in the limb salvage rate at 36 months between the two configurations of the <b>by-pass</b> (94 % vs 81 %) (P=NS).
