40|$|Background: Miscanthus is {{a leading}} second {{generation}} bio-energy crop, which is currently planted using rhizomes; however, increasingly the use of seed is being explored to improve efficiency of propagation. Miscanthus seed are small, germination is often poor and without sterilisation so germination detection must be sufficiently adaptable for example to {{the presence or absence}} of mould. Results: Machine learning using k-NN improved the scoring of different seed phenotypes encountered in scoring germination for Miscanthus. The k-NN-based algorithm was effective in scoring the germination of seed images when compared with human scores of the same images. The trueness of the k-NN result was 0. 69 to 0. 7, as measured using the area under a ROC curve. When the k-NN classifier was tested on an optimised image subset of seed an area under the ROC curve of 0. 89 was achieved. Conclusions: With non-ideal seed images that included mould and <b>broken</b> <b>seed</b> the k-NN classifier was less consistent with human assessments. The most accurate assessment of germination with which to train classifiers is difficult to determine but the k-NN classifier provided an impartial consistent measurement of this important trait. It was more reproducible than the existing human scoring methods and was demonstrated to give a high degree of trueness to the human score. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

Because not conflict with human and animal food resources, non-food vegetable oils are promising sources for developing bio-jet fuels. Extracting vegetable oil from oilseeds is the first critical step in the pathway of bio-jet fuel production. When sunflower seeds are de-hulled, there are always about 5 %– 15 % <b>broken</b> <b>seed</b> kernels (fine meat particles) left over as residual wastes with oil content up to 48 %. However, the oil extracted from these sunflower seed residues is non-edible due to its quality not meeting food standards. Genetically modified sunflower grown on margin lands has been identified one of sustainable biofuel sources since it doesn't compete to arable land uses. Sunflower oils extraction from non-food sunflower seeds, sunflower meats, and fine sunflower meats (seed de-hulling residue) was carried out using a cold press method in this study. Characterization of the sunflower oils produced was performed. The effect of cold press rotary frequency on oil recovery and quality was discussed.

Seeds of Cuscuta epithymum, which is a rare and often threatened species in dry heaths of north-western Europe, were water-impermeable (physically dormant) at maturity in late summer. An 8 -week period at 58 C, followed by incubation at 23, 15 / 6 or 30 / 208 C, resulted in 15 – 30 % germination. Thus, in nature, only part of the seed population exposed to low winter temperatures and a subsequent warm spring potentially becomes waterpermeable and can germinate in spring. When scarified seeds were cold-stratified at 58 C for 8 weeks and then incubated at 238 C, essentially all the viable seeds (c. 65 %) germinated. It is concluded that seeds have a combination of physical (PY) and physiological (PD) dormancy (the first to be reported in the Convolvulaceae), which is interpreted as a double safety mechanism preventing germination at unfavourable times or places. After PY and PD were <b>broken,</b> <b>seeds</b> did not require light or fluctuating temperatures for germination. Some loss of PD (afterripening) can occur before PY is broken.

40|$|One of {{the most}} tedious {{operations}} in processing bambara groundnut is the shelling operation. However, moisture content normally affects the handling and processing of agromaterials, such as nut shelling/cracking. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of moisture content on shelling efficiency of bambara groundnut using a centrifugal cracker. A 50 kg bag of bambara groundnut obtained from Damboa Local Government Area of Borno State, Nigeria, was divided into three groups. These groups were prepared for tests by soaking them in ordinary water at room temperature for different periods of 0, 60 and 90 min to obtain different levels of moisture content. Moisture content of each sample was determined by oven drying at 130 Ã‚Â°C for 6 h. The moisture content levels were found to be 5. 3, 9. 6, and 12. 2 % (d. b.) for samples A, B and C, respectively. The samples were subjected to impact energy through a centrifugal impaction device operating at an angular velocity of 1920 r. p. m., using three different types of impellers.

40|$|In {{the seed}} {{processing}} industry, rotary batch seed coaters {{are widely used}} for providing a protective coating layer to the seeds consisting of various ingredients including fertilisers and crop protection chemicals. Seed motion and mixing are important in ensuring uniform coating; hence {{the focus of this}} work is to address the mixing efficiency and coating uniformity of corn seeds in a rotary batch seed mixer. In the present study, the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to analyse the motion and coating uniformity of the seeds. A comprehensive study has been carried out addressing the influence of the shape of corn seeds for accurately simulating their flow in the mixer using two commonly used techniques: (i) manipulation of coefficient of rolling friction of spherical particles, and (ii) clumping multiple spheres. Both methods were successful in simulating the flow of seeds in the mixer, however the former method is found to be an empirical approach rather than predictive. A coating model is used for predicting the coating uniformity of corn seeds in the mixer. Effect of various process parameters on variation of coating mass among the seeds is investigated. For the seed mixer, the baffle clearance gap, baffle geometry and position of the atomiser disc were found to be the key influential process parameters affecting the coating uniformity of corn seeds. Other process parameters such as the base rotational speed, baffle angle, width and curvature had less effects on coating variability. A study has also been carried out on tailoring the existing methods of measuring the extent of breakage of particles for seeds. Four breakage criteria were proposed and assessed for consideration of mass of <b>broken</b> <b>seeds,</b> and the most suitable methods are suggested. The simulations developed here are generic and can be applied {{to a wide range of}} coating processes, such as particle and tablet coating. The proposed methodology for measuring the extent of breakage of corn seeds can also be used for other types of seeds...|$|R

Introduction: The cheapest and most satisfactory seed of grasses, clover, or alfalfa, is an absolutely pure clean and vital seed. This {{is the ideal}} condition, and the planter whose seed is lacking {{in any of these}} qualities will be the proportionate loser. The importance of seed tests are very apparent and cannot be profitably overlooked. This is especially true of grass seeds, for the reason that adulterants, weed seed, immature and spoiled seed, is much more difficult to recognize in grasses than in cereals. The seeds used in the following tests were secured from seed houses that are patronized by Kansas farmers and one object of the experiment was to get some idea of the seeds that are being planted in Kansas at the present time. The seeds were all, as nearly as was possible to secure them, fair samples of what was being sold to the farmers. The seeds were examined and tested with regard to purity, vitality, and possibility of cleaning. In the purity tests a sample of about three hundred seeds, was counted, the weed seed separated, counted, and the predominating seed recognized. The per cent of weed -seeds given is a per cent {{of the total number of}} seeds. The foreign matter includes weed <b>seeds,</b> <b>broken</b> <b>seeds,</b> stems, chaff, adulterants, etc., and the per cent is calculated from the weight of the sample. The apparatus for testing vitality was a plate partially filled with sand, over which was placed a cloth, on which one variety of seeds was placed, and another cloth on top of this, with another variety of seeds, etc. From six to seven of these layers could be placed on one plate, the cloth and sand being well dampened and a second plate inverted over them. No artificial heat was necessary, the temperature varying from 65 ° to 90 ° F. At the end of one week all seeds germinated were counted and the per cent given is of the total number of seeds placed in the germinator...|$|R

40|$|The {{invasion}} of natural environments by alien species {{is a significant}} threat to the ecological integrity of these systems. Senna obtusifolia is an aggressive invasive weed recently introduced to Australia that is having significant impacts on grassland ecosystems on the Cape York Peninsula. Currently the species is inadequately managed and so range expansion continues. The invasion potential of S. obtusifolia in Australia remains unknown, as does much about its behaviour and management in natural systems. This project undertakes extensive mapping and modelling of the current and future distributions and the invasion dynamics of S. obtusifolia in Australia to facilitate early detection of outbreak populations {{and the development of}} appropriate management strategies. The mapping and modelling of S. obtusifolia was conducted at three different scales: continental, landscape and local (population). To address these spatial scales, eco-climatic modelling, remote sensing analysis, field experimentation and creation of a model of seed fate was undertaken. Using the climatic preferences of S. obtusifolia displayed internationally, an eco-climatic model (using CLIMEX software) ascertained that S. obtusifolia has a very large invasive potential in Australia. The predicted geographic distribution comprised the entire eastern and northern Australian coastlines, with spread further inland being largely restricted by a lack of moisture. The regional distribution of S. obtusifolia was not successfully delineated using remote sensing technology. Despite possessing favourable traits for detection by remote sensors, poor data quality and inappropriate image scales prevented the weed from being distinguished from other vegetation by multi-spectral satellite imagery and aerial photography. However, the results indicated that refining the data and the techniques used, single S. obtusifolia populations may be detectable in the future. Investigation of the invasion dynamics of S. obtusifolia at the local scale involved multiple field surveys and manipulative experiments during 2002 - 2005. Field work indicated that little variation in population characteristics (e. g. stem density, soil seed reserve, seed production) existed within populations, but there was variability across populations and between years: the variation between years was very significant. The vegetation type adjacent to the weed population did not affect population attributes; however less competitive, more open and disturbed environments may better facilitate the invasion. The compartment model of seed fate reflecting S. obtusifolia population dynamics demonstrated that change in annual rainfall was unlikely to explain the variation evident between populations and years. Instead, the rate at which dormancy is <b>broken</b> in <b>seeds</b> and the intensity and regularity of fire provided a better explanation of the weed's population dynamics. Early detection of invaders and the prediction of likely sites of invasion provide the most effective means of preventing future invasions. How best to achieve these goals still remains largely unknown. The process undertaken in this study was a relatively quick and reliable method for assessing the seriousness of S. obtusifolia, predicting future outbreaks and for providing clues to long term management. The appropriate use of fire, maintaining high interspecific competition and shade, as well reducing the rate at which dormancy is <b>broken</b> in <b>seeds</b> are all possible methods of managing S. obtusifolia...|$|R
