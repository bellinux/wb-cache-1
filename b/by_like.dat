25|$|Cats were mummified as {{religious}} offerings in enormous quantities and {{were believed to}} represent the war goddess Bastet. This cult was primarily centered at Thebes and Beni Hasan beginning in the Ptolemaic Period. At Beni Hasan, {{there were so many}} cat mummies {{that at the end of}} the 19th century, a total of 19 tons of mummified Egyptian cats were shipped to England to be used as fertilizer. In addition, thousands of cat mummies have been found at the catacombs of Saqqara. Cats who were bred to become offerings of this type usually died due to strangulation or the breaking of their necks. During mummification, the cat bodies would be dried and filled with soil, sand or some other kind of packing material. They were either positioned with their limbs folded closely to their bodies or in a sitting, lifelike position. The wrapping was usually completed through intricate, geometric patterns. Early in the development of animal mummification, cat mummies were placed in little bronze or wooden sarcophagi. More expensive mummies were typically adorned with features drawn in black paint and colored glass, obsidian or rock crystal eyes. Kittens and fetuses were mummified and buried inside the stomach of a statue that represented their mother. As time went <b>by,</b> <b>like</b> all mummies designed for this purpose, the mummification became less precise. In fact, Sir T. C. S. Morrison-Scott, Director of the British Museum of Natural History, unwrapped a large number of cat mummies, but discovered many were simply stuffed with random body parts of cats and not mummified with detailed care.|$|E

Madonna was followed <b>by</b> <b>Like</b> a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986). From then on she released a series of commercially successful albums, including the Grammy Award winners Ray of Light (1998) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005).

500|$|Short films {{released}} by Wong Fu Productions have received, cumulatively, millions of views, {{and the group}} has several thousand fans. According to Wang, the group's website received 5,000 daily hits in 2009. He expected the audience size to grow [...] "as online video becomes {{part of everyday life}} for the up-and-coming generation of movie-watchers" [...] but believed that movie theaters will not become obsolete. University of Southern California digital media expert David Wertheimer also believed that [...] "Wong Fu's use of new media to tell their community stories and build a business is the wave of the future." [...] The group's success has allowed for growth in the popularity of Asian American comedians who promote themselves primarily through YouTube, such as Kevin Wu (KevJumba), Ryan Higa (Nigahiga), Christine Gambito (HappySlip), and David Choi. Although grateful for the group's success and popularity, Wang said, [...] "Some people who go to film school, they'll make something great but it's only seen <b>by</b> <b>like,</b> two hundred people [...] It's kind of not fair." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Davis' {{previous}} recordings, the cadenzas throughout Agharta {{were mostly}} played by Fortune and Cosey. Fortune alternated between soprano and alto saxophones and the flute, performing with a [...] "substance and structure" [...] Gilmore believed {{was very much}} indebted to John Coltrane during his A Love Supreme (1965) period. He performed his longest alto saxophone solo on [...] "Right Off", which opened the record's second disc in a [...] "propulsive" [...] segment Gilmore said [...] "flies <b>by</b> <b>like</b> a train ride in a dream, where scenes flash past the window in a fascinating and illusive dream". Cosey played a Guild S-100 electric guitar and heavily employed chromaticism, dissonance, and feedback in his improvisations on Agharta. He alternated between several effects pedals set up underneath his table of percussion instruments, including a fuzzbox for distorting guitar sounds and two different wah-wah pedals he used during solos or when playing more mellow tones. Cosey often arranged his guitar strings in different places on the fretboard and never played in standard tuning, using at least 36 different tuning systems, each of which altered the style and sound of his playing. According to Tzvi Gluckin from Premier Guitar, his experimental guitar playing was rooted in the blues and displayed a sense of phrasing that was aggressive and [...] "blistering" [...] yet [...] "somehow also restrained", particularly in his control of feedback.|$|E
500|$|... "Call the Shots" [...] is a dance-pop and pop rock track {{written in}} the key of D major and with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. Unlike previous singles released by the band, the song follows the verse–chorus form. The lyrics {{are concerned with the}} ending of a relationship, and opens with a repetitive melody followed by Coyle singing, [...] "Static tone on the phone, I'll be breaking again / Must be something better babe". As the chorus begins, the five members of the group trade lines and sing, [...] "Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me / It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time", with Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stating that [...] "only anterograde amnesia could wipe [...] from your brain". During the middle-eight, Roberts sings lyrics that were the inspiration for Girls Aloud's autobiography Dreams that Glitter – Our Story, released in 2008: [...] "I've seen life burn bright, seen it shimmer / Then fade like starlight to a glimmer, oh no / I've seen life flow <b>by</b> <b>like</b> a river / So full of twilight, dreams that glitter". Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy said that the instrumentation of [...] "Call the Shots" [...] was based on 1990s dance productions, and added that it incorporated [...] "oohs" [...] and [...] "ah ah ahs" [...] that [...] "reverberate around an infectious chorus," ...|$|E

2500|$|Many design {{elements}} of the ballpark's interior are inspired by the original Yankee Stadium. The roof of the new facility features {{a replica of the}} frieze that was a trademark of the previous ballpark. In the original Yankee Stadium, a copper frieze originally lined the roof of the upper deck stands, but it was torn down during the 1974–75 renovations and replicated atop the wall beyond the bleachers. The new stadium replicates the frieze in its original location along the upper deck stands. Made of steel coated with zinc for rust protection, {{it is part of the}} support system for the cantilevers holding up the top deck and the lighting on the roof. The wall beyond the bleacher seats is [...] "cut out" [...] to reveal the [...] subway trains as they pass <b>by,</b> <b>like</b> they were in the original facility. A manually operated auxiliary scoreboard is built into the left and right field fences, in the same locations it existed in the pre-renovation iteration of the original Yankee Stadium.|$|E
