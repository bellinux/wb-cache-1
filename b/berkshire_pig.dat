60|$|It {{appears at}} first sight {{probable}} that the increased size, the tendency to fatten, the early maturity and altered forms of our improved cattle, sheep, and pigs, have directly resulted from their abundant supply of food. This is the opinion of many competent judges, and probably is {{to a great extent}} true. But as far as form is concerned, we must not overlook the more potent influence of lessened use on the limbs and lungs. We see, moreover, as far as size is concerned, that selection is apparently a more powerful agent than a large supply of food, for we can thus only account for the existence, as remarked to me by Mr. Blyth, of the largest and smallest breeds of sheep in the same country, of Cochin-China fowls and Bantams, of small Tumbler and large Runt pigeons, all kept together and supplied with abundant nourishment. Nevertheless {{there can be little doubt}} that our domesticated animals have been modified, independently of the increased or lessened use of parts, by the conditions to which they have been subjected, without the aid of selection. For instance, Prof. Rutimeyer (23/37. 'Die Fauna der Pfahlbauten' 1861 s. 15.) shows that the bones of domesticated quadrupeds can be distinguished from those of wild animals by the state of their surface and general appearance. It is scarcely possible to read Nathusius's excellent 'Vorstudien' (23/38. 'Schweineschadel' 1864 s. 99.) and doubt that, with the highly improved races of the pig, abundant food has produced a conspicuous effect on the general form of the body, on the breadth of the head and face, and even on the teeth. Nathusius rests much on the case of a purely bred <b>Berkshire</b> <b>pig,</b> which when two months old became diseased in its digestive organs, and was preserved for observation until nineteen months old; at this age it had lost several characteristic features of the breed, and had acquired a long, narrow head, of large size relatively to its small body, and elongated legs. But in this case and in some others we ought not to assume that, because certain characters are lost, perhaps through reversion, under one course of treatment, therefore that they were at first directly produced by an opposite treatment.|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} in backfat of commodity pork {{has declined to}} the point some major packers are no longer measuring backfat depth. From our previous research with <b>Berkshire</b> <b>pigs,</b> {{a large amount of}} {{variation in}} backfat and loin eye area (LEA) still existed, especially between barrows and gilts. In our previous research, barrows average one inch backfat depth around 210 pounds whereas gilts did not achieve one inch until 260 pounds. This potentially may be a meat quality issue for gilts marketed less than 260 pounds. The objective of these trials was to replicate our previous study and to determine whether these differences persisted within a different set of <b>Berkshire</b> <b>pigs</b> under the same nutritional regimen. Understanding how feed programs and growth rates affect lean and fat deposition rates is a critical aspect to these niche programs in order to maintain consistency and quality of the Berkshire pork products marketed. Overall, barrows averaged an inch of backfat between 230 and 250 lb body weight whereas gilts average backfat was. 90 inches at 269 pounds market weight. Only a 30 % of the gilts within these two groups were over one inch backfat at market. These differences are crucial when selecting animals for market to achieve the highest desirability in meat quality within the Berkshire marketing system. These differences between barrows and gilts indicate it may be more critical that each are fed differently than in commodity pork production systems...|$|R

Traits analyzed in live animals were: body weight at 60 days of age (W 60), age at finish (AGF), daily weight gain from birth to finish (DG), back fat thickness at finish (BFTF), and loin eye area at finish (LEAF), and in carcasses were: carcass weight, loin eye area (LEA), and subcutaneous fat thickness (SCF) at some points, using the records of 4, 773 purebred Berkshire pigs. Variance components for the traits were estimated according to the animal model by the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) procedure using the VCE 6 program (Neumaier and Groeneveld, 1998). Correlated responses were also calculated. Genetic correlations of back fat thickness (BFT) in live animals with SCF in slaughtered animals were strong, whereas that of LEA between live and slaughtered animals was low. The expected gains by actual selection including W 60 and BFTF as selection criterion were superior to other selections.

40|$|Improvement in {{litter size}} has become of great {{interest}} in the pig industry because fecundity {{is directly related to}} sow reproductive life. Improved reproduction has thus been achieved by elucidating the molecular functions of genes associated with fecundity. In the present study, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) via transcriptomic analysis using RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) in <b>Berkshire</b> <b>pig</b> placentas from larger (LLG, mean litter size > 12) and smaller (SLG, mean litter size 1. 5 -fold change), of which 98 were upregulated, while 490 were downregulated in the LLG compared with the SLG. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment was also performed. We concluded that 129 of the 588 DEGs were closely related to litter size according to reproduction related genes selected based on previous reports, as 110 genes were downregulated and 19 upregulated in the LLG compared with the SLG. RT-qPCR utilizing specific primers targeting the early growth response 2 (EGR 2), pheromaxein c subunit (PHEROC) and endothelial lipase (LIPG) genes showed high accordance with RNA-Seq results. Furthermore, we investigated the upstream regulators of these three genes in the placenta. We found that WNT 9 B, a Wnt signaling pathway molecule, and IL- 6, known inducers of EGR 2 and LIPG, respectively, were significantly increased in LLG compared with SLG. We believe that the induction of IL- 6 and LIPG may {{play an important role in}} increasing nutrition supply through the placenta from the sow to the piglet during gestation.

40|$|The first {{objective}} of this computational study {{was to assess the}} strain magnitude and distribution within the three-dimensional (3 D) trabecular bone structure around an osseointegrated dental implant loaded axially. The second objective was to investigate the relative micromotions between the implant and the surrounding bone. The work hypothesis adopted was that these virtual measurements would be a useful indicator of bone adaptation (resorption, homeostasis, formation). In order to reach these objectives, a ?CT-based finite element model of an oral implant implanted into a <b>Berkshire</b> <b>pig</b> mandible was developed along with a robust software methodology. The finite element mesh of the 3 D trabecular bone architecture was generated from the segmentation of ?CT scans. The implant was meshed independently from its CAD file obtained from the manufacturer. The meshes of the implant and the bone sample were registered together in an integrated software environment. A series of non-linear contact finite element (FE) analyses considering an axial load applied {{to the top of the}} implant in combination with three sets of mechanical properties for the trabecular bone tissue was devised. Complex strain distribution patterns are reported and discussed. It was found that considering the Young’s modulus of the trabecular bone tissue to be 5, 10 and 15 GPa resulted in maximum peri-implant bone microstrains of about 3000, 2100 and 1400. These results indicate that, for the three sets of mechanical properties considered, the magnitude of maximum strain lies within an homeostatic range known to be sufficient to maintain/form bone. The corresponding micro-motions of the implant with respect to the bone microstructure were shown to be sufficiently low to prevent fibrous tissue formation and to favour long-term osseointegration...|$|E

The frequency of both PRLR 3 alleles A and a was 0. 50. The frequencies of the RBP 4 alleles B and b were 0. 42 and 0. 58, respectively. Neither locus was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No significant associations of the PRLR 3 alleles with birth or weaning weights and of the RBP 4 alleles with birth weight were observed. The proportions of the phenotype variances due to the genotypes of PRLR 3 in the feeder weights was 4. 0 % and those of RBP 4 in the weaning and feeder weights were 11. 9 and 3. 3 %, respectively (P < 0. 05). The dominance effect of PRLR 3 and RBP 4 on feeder weights was 2. 40 and － 1. 86 kg, respectively (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Analysis {{for back}} fat {{thickness}} (BFAT) and daily body weight gains from birth {{to the end of}} a performance test were conducted to find an optimal method for estimation of weaning age effects and to ascertain impacts of weaning age on the growth performance of purebred <b>Berkshire</b> <b>pigs</b> from a closed population in Korea. Individual body weights were measured at birth (B), at weaning (W: mean, 22. 9 d), at the beginning of the performance test (P: mean, 72. 7 d), and at the end of the performance test (T: mean, 152. 4 d). Further, the average daily gains in body weight (ADG) of 3, 713 pigs were analyzed for the following periods: B to W (DGBW), W to P (DGWP), P to T (DGPT), B to P (DGBP), B to T (DGBT), and W to T (DGWT). Weaning ages ranged from 17 to 34 d, and were treated as fixed (WF), random with (WC) and random without (WU) consideration of an empirical relationship between weaning ages in the models. WF and WC produced the lowest AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and least fractions of error variance components in multi-traits analysis, respectively. The fractions of variances due to diverse weaning age and the weaning age correlations among ADGs of different stages (when no overlapping allowed) by WC ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 35 and from − 0. 03 to 0. 44, respectively. The maximum weaning age effects and optimal {{back fat thickness}}es were attained at weaning ages of 27 to 32 d.

In addition, BFAT was reduced by 0. 106 mm per increased day in weaning age. In conclusion, WC produced reasonable weaning age correlations, and improved the fitness of the model. Weaning age was one of crucial factors (comparable with heritability) influencing growth performance in <b>Berkshire</b> <b>pigs.</b> Further, these studies suggest that increasing weaning age up to 32 d can be an effective management strategy to improve growth performance. However, additional investigations of the costs and losses related to extension of the suckling period and on the extended range of weaning age are necessary to determine the productivity and safety of this practice in a commercial herd and production system...|$|R

40|$|Niche {{marketing}} {{continues to}} grow in Iowa and the United States as the demand for high quality pork increases for both in home and out of home consumption. The majority of pigs in demand for these markets are Berkshires, with many raised in bedded hoop barns. Berkshires {{have been shown to}} have significant advantages in meat eating quality, with significantly poorer feed conversion and higher feed costs. However very little information exists as to how these pigs grow and the nutritional needs to optimize both growth and feed efficiency. Producers have little production data to evaluate and adjust feeding programs. These trials were initiated to help characterize these parameters and allow Berkshire producers a means to be more effective within their production and marketing system. This trial demonstrated that <b>Berkshire</b> <b>pigs</b> grow as fast but consume more feed than expected from traditional commodity genetic lines, resulting in a challenging feed conversion ratio. Barrows grow faster, consumed more feed than gilts, but gilts were more efficient converting feed to gain. Although seasonal feed intakes differ for both sexes, growth rates were similar within gilts and barrows. This information can perhaps be used in designing rations and feed budgeting systems that can lower the feed costs for production of Berkshire pork...|$|R
