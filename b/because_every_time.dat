5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear <b>because</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face.|$|E

Coyne died of leukemia in 1973. In November 2012 the musical What A Glorious Feeling depicted both the making of Singin' in the Rain and the love triangle between Donen, Kelly and Coyne.|$|E

In contrast to our previously cited treatment, here we impose the condition that the maturation velocity for any cell can become null. This consideration implies that the cell population never completely leaves its initial distribution, <b>because</b> at <b>every</b> <b>time</b> we can find some cells of initial cell population that are not divided. In this case, the generated semigroup is not compact. To surmount this difficulty, after studying the irreducibility of the generated semigroup, we calculate explicitly its essential type and we show the asymptotic convergence of the generated semigroup to a projection of rank 1...|$|R

[...] Also, they felt they were not properly servicing Angie's character, instead [...] "just sticking her in scenes just to be there," [...] resulting in the decision to ultimately not bring Angie back for the season as planned. In her place, the characters of Ana Jarvis and Rose Roberts are featured as confidante's for Carter, [...] "both people who are 100% in on Peggy's secret. Angie sort of figures it {{out at the end of}} the first season but Ana and Rose—there is no need to hide the truth from them. So it makes it a lot easier for her to confide in them." ...|$|E
60|$|This result admits of an {{experimental}} test {{by means of}} the photographic registration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun. The only reason why we must wait for a total eclipse is <b>because</b> at <b>every</b> other <b>time</b> the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by the light from the sun that the stars situated near the sun's disc are invisible. The predicted effect can be seen clearly from the accompanying diagram. If the sun (S) were not present, a star which is practically infinitely distant would be seen in the direction D[1], as observed front the earth. But {{as a consequence of the}} deflection of light from the star by the sun, the star will be seen in the direction D[2], i.e. at a somewhat greater distance from the centre of the sun than corresponds to its real position.|$|R
40|$|Using a {{numerical}} weather forecasting code {{to provide the}} dynamic largescale inlet boundary conditions for the computation of small-scale urban canopy flows requires a continuous specification of appropriate inlet turbulence. For such computations to be practical, a very efficient method of generating such turbulence is needed. Correlation functions of typical turbulent shear flows have forms not too dissimilar to decaying exponentials. A digital-filter-based generation of turbulent inflow conditions exploiting this fact {{is presented as a}} suitable technique for large eddy simulations computation of spatially developing flows. The artificially generated turbulent inflows satisfy the prescribed integral length scales and Reynoldsstress-tensor. The method is much more efficient than, for example, Klein’s (J Comp Phys 186 : 652 – 665, 2003) or Kempf et al. ’s (Flow Turbulence Combust 74 : 67 – 84, 2005) methods <b>because</b> at <b>every</b> <b>time</b> step only one set of two-dimensional (rather than three-dimensional) random data is filtered to generate a set of two-dimensional data with the appropriate spatial correlations. These data are correlated with the data from the previous time step by using an exponential function based on two weight factors. The method is validated by simulating plane channel flows with smooth walls and flows over arrays of staggered cubes (a generic urban-type flow). Mean velocities, the Reynolds-stress-tensor and spectra are all shown to be comparable with those obtained using classical inlet-outlet periodic boundary conditions. Confidence has been gained in using this method to couple weather scale flows and street scale computations...|$|R

When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, <b>because</b> <b>every</b> <b>time</b> I do, I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs.

2500|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells {{contain an}} enzyme with reverse transcription activity called telomerase.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScAsthma {{education}} aims {{to reduce}} exacerbations by helping the patient or the caregivers to recognize early warning signs and act accordingly. However, {{a number of}} studies have indicated that childhood asthma morbidity is still rising. The goal of this research study is to explore the caregivers’ experiences of implementing the asthma education guidelines. The question to be answered by this research is: “How do caregivers experience the implementation of the guidelines for preventing an asthma attack?” Caregivers attending the asthma clinic at Red Cross War Memorial Children Hospital, Rondebosch were the study population who participated in this qualitative study. Purposive sampling was applied for recruiting participants to the study. A semi-structured, open –ended interview schedule was used to collect data from individuals during semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The data was analysed according to the guidelines of Creswell (2009). The results showed that care-givers found the education programme useful. They also reported that the education programme were offered at their level and was easy to understand. Care-givers indicated that the programme should continue <b>because</b> they learnt <b>every</b> <b>time</b> they attended and found that the practical demonstrations were particularly useful...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{foraging}} and vigilance are mutually exclusive is crucial to understanding {{the management of the}} predation and starvation risk trade-off in animals. We tested whether wild-caught captive chaffinches that feed at a higher rate do so at the expense of their speed in responding to a model sparrowhawk flying nearby, and whether consistently good foragers will therefore tend to respond more slowly on average. First, we confirmed that the time taken to respond to the approaching predator depended on the rate of scanning: as head-up rate increased so chaffinches responded more quickly. However, against predictions, as peck rate increased so head-up rate increased and mean length of head-up and head-down periods decreased. Head-up rate was probably dependent on peck rate <b>because</b> almost <b>every</b> <b>time</b> a seed was found, a bird raised its head to handle it. Therefore chaffinches with higher peck rates responded more quickly. Individual chaffinches showed consistent durations of both their head-down and head-up periods and, therefore, individuals that were good foragers were also good detectors of predators. In relation to the broad range of species that have a similar foraging mode to chaffinches, our results have two major implications for predation/starvation risk trade-offs: (i) feeding rate can determine vigilance scanning patterns; and (ii) the best foragers can also be the best at detecting predators. We discuss how our results can be explained in mechanistic terms relating to fundamental differences in how the probabilities of detecting food rather than a predator are affected by time. In addition, our results offer a plausible explanation for the widely observed effect that vigilance continues to decline with group size even when there is no further benefit to reducing vigilance...|$|R
