5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E

They said the Vatican, in its stern reaction, [...] "seeks to stifle {{freedom of speech and}} public discussion in the Roman Catholic Church and create the appearance of a consensus where none exists." [...] The group issed a statement describing the current Church stance as not {{in the spirit of the}} Vatican II which said, [...] "Let there be unity in what is necessary, freedom in what is unsettled and charity in any case."

500|$|Vermont Representative Frederick G. Fleetwood {{addressed}} the committee. O'Reilly had indicated that coins were being requested for local celebrations, and Fleetwood {{stressed the importance}} in American history {{of the events that}} were being commemorated. Vestal and others supported a ban on the committee passing further commemorative coin bills, but wanted the Vermont bill to pass. [...] For one thing, as Massachusetts' Robert M. Leach noted, President Calvin Coolidge was a Vermonter by birth. The Treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin, but as Illinois' Morton D. Hull pointed out, the sellers preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus, over a medal that could not. Leach's attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical: [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been going too fast, and I believe at some time we ought to quit it, but I dislike quitting on these gentlemen representing the State of Vermont this morning." [...] Vestal issued a report the same day, stating that the committee was against more commemorative coin issues, but that the Bennington issue should pass because of the national importance of the events of 1777, and because the issue of 40,000 was relatively small.|$|E
500|$|On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a {{televised}} speech including what became his most quoted utterance. [...] "I don't believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia—not in 1,000 years," [...] he said. [...] "I repeat that I believe in {{blacks and whites}} working together. If one day it is white {{and the next day}} it is black, I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> failed {{and it will be a}} disaster for Rhodesia." [...] The first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that Smith was a crude racist who would never compromise with the black nationalists, even though the speech was one in which Smith had said that power-sharing with black Rhodesians was inevitable and that [...] "we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, not white as opposed to black and vice versa". The [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] comment was, according to Peter Godwin, an attempt to reassure the RF's right wing, which opposed any transition whatsoever, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn comments that regardless of whether the statement was [...] "taken out of context, or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted", this was one of his greatest blunders as Prime Minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors.|$|E

500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. Al Gore has argued [...] "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." [...] In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries – revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.|$|E
