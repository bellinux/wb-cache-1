2500|$|Sisi, who is {{reportedly}} facing a severe economic ordeal in Egypt, {{has decided to}} raise fuel prices by 78 percent as an introduction to cut the subsidies on basic food stuffs and energy, which eat up {{nearly a quarter of}} the state budget. The Egyptian government has always provided these subsidies as a crucial aid to millions of people who live in poverty, fearing people's anger in five years time. Egypt has spent $96 billion on energy subsidies in a decade which made petrol in Egypt among the world's cheapest. Cutting the energy subsidies will save 51 billion pounds. The government hopes the decision will <b>benefit</b> <b>services</b> such as health and education. Sisi also raised taxes on alcohol and cigarettes, applying a flat tax on local and imported cigarettes to between 25 and 40 cents per pack, as well as new property taxes, and plans to introduce a new scheme for value-added taxes. Chicken prices would reportedly rise by 25 percent days after the decision because of added transportation costs. Mini-bus and taxi fares were raised by about 13 percent. Slashing subsidies was recommended by international financial institutions, but no Egyptian leader had managed to broach the issue, fearing unrest in a country where nearly 50 percent of the population live in poverty and rely on government aid. President Sisi defended the decision to raise fuel prices, saying it was [...] "bitter medicine" [...] that should have been taken before and was [...] "50 years late" [...] but was not taken, as governments feared a backlash like the Bread Riots of 1977. Sisi, who had previously accepted only half of his own pay, called on Egyptians to make sacrifices, vowing to repair an economy growing at the slowest pace in two decades. Sisi warned Egyptians of more pain {{over the next two years}} from economic problems that he said had accumulated over the last four decades and needed to be fixed. Egypt also paid more than $6 billion it owed to foreign oil companies within two months. By March 2015 after 8 months of Sisi's rule, Egypt's external debt fell to $39.9billion, a drop of 13.5 percent.|$|E

5000|$|Pension funds appoint {{to their}} fund a service {{provider}} which {{needs to have}} an administrator licence in terms of section 13B of the Pension Funds Act. Service providers include large banks and institutions such as Old Mutual, Sanlam Employee Benefits, Standard Bank, ABSA and Nedgroup, Alexander Forbes {{as well as a}} few independent service providers such as FedGroup, Fairheads <b>Benefit</b> <b>Services</b> and Bophelo <b>Benefit</b> <b>Services.</b> Once the funds are in a beneficiary fund, the trustees of the beneficiary fund take over the fiduciary duty from the retirement fund trustees. They consult with the guardian who may need to draw up a budget. Taking into account the capital amount, the age of the child and the income requirements, an appropriate allocation of funds is made. Investment management varies among service providers but best practice is to outsource this to independent asset managers. Investments need to be in line with Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, which stipulates strict prudential guidelines.The members of a beneficiary fund are the minor beneficiaries to whom assets have been left. They have a right to benefit from these assets and in the event of any maladministration or complaints they and their guardians have recourse to the Pension Funds Adjudicator. [...] Communication generally takes place between the beneficiary fund and the minor’s guardian or caregiver.|$|E
