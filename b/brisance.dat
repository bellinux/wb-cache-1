25|$|In quarrying, high {{explosives}} {{are generally}} preferred for shattering rock. However, {{because of its}} low <b>brisance,</b> black powder causes fewer fractures and results in more usable stone compared to other explosives, making black powder useful for blasting monumental stone such as granite and marble. Black powder is well suited for blank rounds, signal flares, burst charges, and rescue-line launches. Black powder is also used in fireworks for lifting shells, in rockets as fuel, and in certain special effects.|$|E
25|$|Gunpowder is {{classified}} as a low explosive because of its relatively slow decomposition rate and consequently low <b>brisance.</b> Low explosives deflagrate (i.e., burn) at subsonic speeds, whereas high explosives detonate, producing a supersonic wave. Ignition of powder packed behind a bullet must generate enough pressure to force it from the muzzle at high speed, {{but not enough to}} rupture the gun barrel. Gunpowder thus makes a good propellant, but is less suitable for shattering rock or fortifications. Gunpowder was widely used to fill artillery shells and in mining and civil engineering to blast rock until {{the second half of the}} 19th century, when the first high explosives were put into use. Gunpowder is no longer used in modern weapons nor is it used for industrial purposes due to its relatively inefficient cost compared to newer alternatives such as dynamite and ammonium nitrate/fuel oil. Today gunpowder firearms are limited primarily to hunting, target shooting, and bulletless historical reenactments.|$|E
500|$|On April 17–18, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols {{removed the}} bomb {{supplies}} from their storage unit in Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived, and loaded {{them into a}} Ryder rental truck. They then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards onto {{the floor of the}} truck to hold the 13barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale. Each filled barrel weighed nearly [...] McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he could ignite (killing himself in the process) at close range with his Glock 21 pistol in case the primary fuses failed. During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier (the wife of Michael Fortier) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a shaped charge. This was achieved by [...] the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building. Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels {{in the shape of a}} backwards J; he later said that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed [...] load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention. All or most of the barrels of ANNM contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the <b>brisance</b> of the explosion.|$|E
2500|$|In a pinch the Winchester WLRM primer or primers {{with similar}} <b>brisance</b> may be substituted. The Federal 216 primer is not {{available}} for sale to the reloader at present but should the primer become available it may be substituted for the Federal 215 primer. This primer was developed for the [...]470 Nitro Express and is currently used by Federal to load the cartridge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brisance</b> by lead block {{compression}} (Hess crusher test) is 30.0 mm, versus 18.5 mm for NG and 16 mm for TNT. <b>Brisance</b> by sand test, {{determined in}} mixtures with 40% kieselguhr, gave for NGc mixtures slightly higher results then with those containing NG.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to strength, explosives display a second characteristic, which is their shattering effect or <b>brisance</b> (from the French meaning to [...] "break"), which is distinguished and separate from their total work capacity. This characteristic is of practical importance {{in determining the}} effectiveness of an explosion in fragmenting shells, bomb casings, grenades, and the like. The rapidity with which an explosive reaches its peak pressure (power) {{is a measure of}} its <b>brisance.</b> <b>Brisance</b> values are primarily employed in France and Russia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brisance</b> [...] is the {{shattering}} {{capability of}} a high explosive, determined mainly by its detonation pressure. The term can be traced from the French verb [...] "briser" [...] (to break or shatter) ultimately derived from the Celtic word [...] "brissim" [...] (to break). <b>Brisance</b> is of practical importance for determining the effectiveness of an explosion in fragmenting shells, bomb casings, grenades, structures, and the like. The sand crush test and Trauzl lead block test are commonly {{used to determine the}} relative <b>brisance</b> in comparison to TNT (which is considered a standard reference for many purposes).|$|E
50|$|The sand {{crush test}} is {{commonly}} employed {{to determine the}} relative <b>brisance</b> in comparison to TNT. No test is capable of directly comparing the explosive properties {{of two or more}} compounds; it is important to examine the data from several such tests (sand crush, trauzl, and so forth) in order to gauge relative <b>brisance.</b> True values for comparison require field experiments.|$|E
5000|$|Amatol {{exploits}} synergy between TNT and ammonium nitrate. TNT has higher explosive {{velocity and}} <b>brisance,</b> but is deficient in oxygen. Oxygen deficiency causes black smoke residue from a pure TNT explosion. The oxygen surplus of ammonium nitrate increases the energy release of TNT during detonation. Depending on {{the ratio of}} ingredients used, amatol leaves a residue of white or grey smoke after detonation. Amatol has a lower explosive velocity and correspondingly lower <b>brisance</b> than TNT but is cheaper because of the lower cost of ammonium nitrate.|$|E
50|$|The {{velocity}} of detonation is an important indicator for overall energy or power of detonation, and in particular for the <b>brisance</b> or shattering effect of an explosive.|$|E
50|$|Ammonal is an {{explosive}} {{made up of}} ammonium nitrate and aluminium powder, {{not to be confused}} with T-ammonal which contains trinitrotoluene as well to increase properties such as <b>brisance.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{ethylene}} glycol dinitrate is rapidly heated to 215 °C, it explodes; this is preceded by partial decomposition {{similar to that of}} nitroglycerin. EGDN has a slightly higher <b>brisance</b> than nitroglycerin.|$|E
50|$|Given that HMX has a {{much higher}} {{detonation}} velocity than TNT (over 2,000 metres per second faster) and forms {{the main part of}} this explosive blend, the <b>brisance</b> characteristics of Octol can be inferred.|$|E
50|$|In {{explosive}} materials, {{strength is}} the parameter determining {{the ability of}} the explosive to move the surrounding material. It is related to the total gas yield of the reaction, and the amount of heat produced. Cf. <b>brisance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Panclastites are {{shock-sensitive}} {{and difficult}} to handle, requiring their mixing immediately before use; also the dinitrogen tetroxide is highly corrosive and explodes in contact with some chemicals. Despite their <b>brisance</b> and detonation velocity being comparable with TNT, panclastites have virtually no use today.|$|E
50|$|Astrolite A, a {{secondary}} (and less common) type of Astrolite, is synthesized {{by the addition}} of finely powdered aluminium to the Astrolite G mixture. Though it has a lower detonation velocity (approximately 7,600 m/s) than Astrolite G, the addition of the aluminium increases both its density and <b>brisance,</b> moderately increasing its overall effectiveness.|$|E
5000|$|In a pinch the Winchester WLRM primer or primers {{with similar}} <b>brisance</b> may be substituted. The Federal 216 primer is not {{available}} for sale to the reloader at present but should the primer become available it may be substituted for the Federal 215 primer. This primer was developed for the [...]470 Nitro Express and is currently used by Federal to load the cartridge.|$|E
50|$|For pure {{explosive}} damage, high burn {{rates or}} detonation speeds (and accompanying <b>brisance)</b> are generally preferable, but in guns and especially cannons, slower-burning powder decreases firing stresses. This allows for lighter, longer (and more accurate) barrels with associated decreases in production and maintenance costs. Further modifications of its burning rate were achieved by shaping the powder grains into prismatic shapes, typically single-perforated hexagonal or octagonal prisms.|$|E
50|$|Methyl nitrate is a {{sensitive}} explosive. When ignited it burns extremely fiercely with a gray-blue flame. Methyl nitrate has {{a relatively low}} <b>brisance</b> in comparison to other explosives, including other nitrate esters. The sensitivity of methyl nitrate to initiation by detonation is among the greatest known, with even a number one blasting cap, the lowest power available, producing a near full detonation of the explosive.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of ERA is the <b>brisance,</b> or detonation speed of its explosive element. A more brisant explosive and greater plate velocity will result in more plate material being fed {{into the path of}} the oncoming jet, greatly increasing the plate's effective thickness. This effect is especially pronounced in the rear plate receding away from the jet, which triples in effective thickness with double the velocity.|$|E
50|$|Explosive forging {{uses the}} {{detonation}} {{of a high}} explosive charge to create a shockwave. This effect is used to harden rail track cast components and, coupled with the Misznay-Schardin effect, {{in the operation of}} explosively forged penetrators. Greater hardening can be achieved by using a lower quantity of an explosive with greater <b>brisance,</b> so that the force applied is greater but the material spends less time in hydrostatic tension.|$|E
50|$|Sensitivity, {{along with}} {{stability}} and <b>brisance</b> {{are three of}} the most significant properties of explosives that affect their use and application. All explosive compounds have a certain amount of energy required to initiate. If an explosive is too sensitive, it may go off accidentally. A safer explosive is less sensitive and will not explode if accidentally dropped or mishandled. However, such explosives are more difficult to initiate intentionally.|$|E
50|$|Minol (pronounced mine-ol) is a {{military}} explosive developed by the Admiralty early in the Second World War to augment supplies of trinitrotoluene (TNT) and RDX, which were then in short supply. The aluminium component in Minol significantly prolongs the explosive pulse, making it ideal for use in underwater naval weapons (e.g. sea mines—for which it was developed—depth charges and torpedoes) where munitions with a longer explosive pulse are more destructive than those with high <b>brisance.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} use of PETN is as an {{explosive}} with high <b>brisance.</b> It {{is more difficult}} to detonate than primary explosives, so dropping or igniting it will typically not cause an explosion (at atmospheric pressure it is difficult to ignite and burns relatively slowly), but is more sensitive to shock and friction than other secondary explosives such as TNT or tetryl. Under certain conditions a deflagration to detonation transition can occur.|$|E
50|$|In quarrying, high {{explosives}} {{are generally}} preferred for shattering rock. However, {{because of its}} low <b>brisance,</b> black powder causes fewer fractures and results in more usable stone compared to other explosives, making black powder useful for blasting monumental stone such as granite and marble. Black powder is well suited for blank rounds, signal flares, burst charges, and rescue-line launches. Black powder is also used in fireworks for lifting shells, in rockets as fuel, and in certain special effects.|$|E
50|$|When stored below 65 °C (149 °F) Tetrytol {{does not}} change stability, acid content, {{sensitivity}} or <b>brisance.</b> However, temperatures at 65 °C or above will allow {{the formation of an}} oily extrudate and distortion of blocks. Although tetryl undergoes partial decomposition on melting, the melting of tetrytol does not have the same effect. Even when Tetrytol is melted and solidified numerous times it causes no change in freezing point, sensitivity to impact or 100 °C vacuum stability test value.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of oxyliquits is that, once mixed, they {{are sensitive to}} sparks, shock, and heat, in addition to reported cases of spontaneous ignition. The power relative to weight is high, but the density is low, so the <b>brisance</b> is low as well. Ignition by a fuse alone is sometimes unreliable. The charge should be detonated within 5 minutes of soaking, but even after 15 minutes it may be capable of exploding, even though weaker and with production of carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|Because sensitivity, <b>brisance,</b> and {{strength}} are properties {{resulting from a}} complex explosive chemical reaction, a simple relationship such as oxygen balance cannot be depended upon to yield universally consistent results. When using oxygen balance to predict properties of one explosive relative to another, {{it is to be}} expected that one with an oxygen balance closer to zero will be the more brisant, powerful, and sensitive; however, many exceptions to this rule do exist. More complicated predictive calculations, such as those discussed in the next section of the explosive materials article, result in more accurate predictions.|$|E
50|$|Cordite is {{a family}} of {{smokeless}} propellants developed and produced in the United Kingdom since 1889 to replace gunpowder as a military propellant. Like gunpowder, cordite is classified as a low explosive because of its slow burning rates and consequently low <b>brisance.</b> These produce a subsonic deflagration wave rather than the supersonic detonation wave produced by brisants, or high explosives. The hot gases produced by burning gunpowder or cordite generate sufficient pressure to propel a bullet or shell to its target, but not so quickly as to routinely destroy {{the barrel of the}} gun.|$|E
50|$|Oxygen {{balance is}} an {{expression}} {{that is used to}} indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to convert all of its carbon to carbon dioxide, all of its hydrogen to water, and all of its metal to metal oxide with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero oxygen balance. The molecule is said to have a positive oxygen balance if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative oxygen balance if it contains less oxygen than is needed. The sensitivity, strength, and <b>brisance</b> of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon oxygen balance and tend to approach their maxima as oxygen balance approaches zero.|$|E
5000|$|Astrolite G, {{the most}} common type of Astrolite, is a mixture of {{ammonium}} nitrate and hydrazine at a ratio of 2:1, measured in weight, forming a clear, viscous liquid approximately the consistency of motor oil. It is a relatively stable (secondary) high explosive compound, requiring a blasting cap to detonate. It has a detonation velocity of approximately 8,600 m/s, twice the explosive strength of TNT. It has been widely referred to as the [...] "world's most powerful non-nuclear explosive", caused largely by a comparison of Astrolite G's detonation velocity to that of first and second-generation high explosives such as nitroglycerine and TNT. Current-generation high explosive compounds such as PETN and RDX can feature comparable detonation velocities and <b>brisance</b> to Astrolite G.|$|E
5000|$|Gunpowder (Black powder) is {{a finely}} ground, pressed and {{granulated}} mechanical pyrotechnic mixture of sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate. It {{can be produced}} {{in a range of}} grain sizes. The size and shape of the grains can increase or decrease the relative surface area, and change the burning rate significantly. The burning rate of black powder is relatively insensitive to pressure, meaning it will burn quickly and predictably even without confinement, making it also suitable for use as a low explosive. It has a very slow decomposition rate, and therefore a very low <b>brisance.</b> It is not, in the strictest sense of the term, an explosive, but a [...] "deflagrant", as it does not detonate but decomposes by deflagration due to its subsonic mechanism of flame-front propagation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} {{composition of}} dynamite {{consisted of three}} parts [...] "explosive oil" [...] (as nitroglycerin was called), one part diatomaceous earth as the absorbent, and a small admixture of sodium carbonate antacid as the stabilizer. Ethylene glycol dinitrate was later added to the nitroglycerin to lower its freezing point and keep it from freezing into a slush at low temperatures, which made it unstable, or from sweating out when it thawed. Diatomaceous earth is not usually used today as an absorbent medium {{and it has been}} replaced by cheaper media such as sawdust, wood pulp, flour, or starch. Other stabilizers, such as calcium carbonate or zinc oxide, can be used in the place of sodium carbonate. Sodium nitrate is added to the medium as an oxidizer to improve the dynamite's <b>brisance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Oxygen balance (OB, or OB%) is an {{expression}} {{that is used to}} indicate the degree to which an explosive can be oxidized. If an explosive molecule contains just enough oxygen to form carbon dioxide from carbon, water from hydrogen molecules, all of its sulfur dioxide from sulfur, and all metal oxides from metals with no excess, the molecule is said to have a zero oxygen balance. The molecule is said to have a positive oxygen balance if it contains more oxygen than is needed and a negative oxygen balance if it contains less oxygen than is needed; the combustion will then be incomplete, and large amount of toxic gases like carbon monoxide will be present. The sensitivity, strength, and <b>brisance</b> of an explosive are all somewhat dependent upon oxygen balance and tend to approach their maxima as oxygen balance approaches zero.|$|E
50|$|The {{law for the}} {{construction}} of the Stelling van Amsterdam was passed in 1874 - a few years after the Unification of Germany which placed a powerful new Great Power on the Netherlands' eastern border. During the preparations prior to construction, it became apparent that the design was already outdated by modern technical advances. The invention of the <b>brisance</b> grenade (which would explode on impact of the target) necessitated the change from masonry to concrete forts. The Dutch did not have the required experience yet using and building with concrete so extensive tests had to be performed; concrete structures were shelled with the heaviest artillery available at that time. Further delays resulted {{from the fact that the}} sand foundations had to settle for several years before the forts could be built on them. Only in 1897 could the actual construction finally begin.|$|E
5000|$|Nitromethane was {{not known}} to be a high {{explosive}} until a railroad tanker car loaded with it exploded on [...] After much testing, it was realized that nitromethane was a more energetic high explosive than TNT, although TNT has a higher velocity of detonation (VoD) and <b>brisance.</b> Both of these explosives are oxygen-poor, and some benefits are gained from mixing with an oxidizer, such as ammonium nitrate. Pure nitromethane is an insensitive explosive with a VoD of approximately 6400 m/s, but even so inhibitors may be used to reduce the hazards. The tank car explosion was speculated to be due to adiabatic compression, a hazard common to all liquid explosives. This is when small entrained air bubbles compress and superheat with rapid rises in pressure. It was thought that an operator rapidly snapped shut a valve creating a [...] "hammer-lock" [...] pressure surge.|$|E
