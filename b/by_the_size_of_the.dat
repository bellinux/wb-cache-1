5|$|Each of the valid Band1 {{permutations}} can {{be expanded}} (completed) into a specific number of solutions with the Band2,3 permutations. By {{virtue of their}} similarity, each member of an equivalence class {{will have the same}} number of completions. Consequently, we only need to construct the solutions for one member of each equivalence class and then multiply the number of solutions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equivalence class. We are still left with the task of identifying and calculating the size of each equivalence class. Further progress requires the dexterous application of computational techniques to catalogue (classify and count) the permutations into equivalence classes.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} micro-founded general {{equilibrium}} model with heterogeneous agents to identify pertinent constraints to financial inclusion. We evaluate quantitatively the policy impacts of relaxing each of these constraints separately, and in combination, on GDP and inequality. We focus on three dimensions of financial inclusion: access (determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> participation costs), depth (determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> collateral constraints resulting from limited commitment), and intermediation efficiency (determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> interest rate spreads and default possibilities due to costly monitoring). We take the model to a firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey for six countries at varying degrees of economic development—three low-income countries (Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique), and three emerging market countries (Malaysia, the Philippines, and Egypt). The results suggest that alleviating different financial frictions have a differential impact across countries, with country-specific characteristics playing {{a central role in}} determining the linkages and trade...|$|R

5|$|Virtually all {{microbes}} {{can trigger}} an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication {{of many different}} types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens. It has been estimated that humans generate about 10billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from {{a relatively small number of}} antibody genes.|$|E
5|$|By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes {{had begun}} invading Italy {{from the north}} as their culture {{expanded}} throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the Romans at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but the Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded the Etruscan province of Siena {{from the north and}} attacked the town of Clusium, not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally the Romans found themselves not just in conflict with the Senones, but their primary target. The Romans met them in pitched battle at the Battle of the Allia around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town before being either driven off or bought off.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of this combined squadron was observed by Captain Keats on Superb, which {{after returning to}} Cadiz had retained station off the port with HMS Thames and HMS Pasley. Thames was inshore searching a seized American merchant ship, and witnessed {{the emergence of the}} squadron, retreating before four ships of the line that approached the British frigate. Superb was sighted shortly afterwards and also retreated before a ship of the line and two frigates, reconstituting his small squadron in the wake of Moreno's force. Keats immediately sent Pasley ahead to Gibraltar to warn Saumarez, the brig arriving at 15:00 closely followed by {{the main body of the}} combined squadron, from which Saint Antoine had detached during the departure from Cadiz and was following behind, shadowed by Superb. Moreno's squadron anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar, out of reach of the British batteries on Gibraltar and waited there for Linois to complete his repairs, Saint Antoine joining the squadron on the morning of 10 July. Keats then brought his ships into Gibraltar, where efforts to repair the squadron were increased, with the knowledge that Moreno would soon be sailing to Cadiz with Linois squadron. Saumarez, concerned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combined squadron, sent urgent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Keith in the Eastern Mediterranean requesting support in the belief that Moreno would be delayed at least two weeks due to the condition of Linois's ships. Saumarez was wrong: Moreno planned to convoy the battered squadron the short distance to Cadiz as soon as they were seaworthy.|$|E
