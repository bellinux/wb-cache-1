40|$|The {{diffusion}} coefficients {{are reported}} of rubbery ternary systems {{consisting of the}} polymer, its monomer analogue (i. e., the saturated equivalent of the monomer), and trace quantities of oligomers (dimer, trimer, tetramer and hexamer) for 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). These have been obtained with pulsed-field-gradient NMR spectroscopy with a polymer weight fraction (f(p)) of 0 {{less than or equal}} to fp {{less than or equal to}} 0. 4. The oligomers are macromonomers synthesized with a cobalt catalytic chain-transfer agent. The diffusion coefficients are about an order of magnitude smaller than those for monomers such as methyl methacrylate; this effect is ascribed to hydrogen bonding in HEMA. The diffusion coefficient D-i of an i-meric oligomer has been fitted with moderate accuracy by an empirical universal scaling relation, D-i(f(p)) /D- 1 (f(p)) approximate to i(-(0. 66 ?)), previously found to provide an adequate fit to corresponding data for styrene and for methyl and <b>butyl</b> <b>methacrylates.</b> The approximate empirical scaling relation seems to hold for a remarkably wide range of types of monomer/polymer systems.

The bulk reactivity ratios were comparable to those estimated in the solution experiments and were used to successfully predict copolymer composition up to high conversions of monomer to polymer for various reaction conditions.

The morphology and mechanical properties of the ternary blend were also examined in this study. EBAGMA was more effective in toughening recycled PET/GF blends than POE-g-MAH; this resulted from its better compatibility with PET and stronger fiber/matrix bonding, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy images. The PET/GF/EBAGMA ternary blend had improved impact strength and well-balanced mechanical properties at a loading of 8 wt % EBAGMA. The addition of POE-g-MAH weakened the fiber/matrix bonding due to more POE-g-MAH coated on the GF, which led to weakened impact strength, tensile strength, and flexural modulus. According to dynamic rheometer testing, the use of both EBAGMA and POE-g-MAH remarkably increased the melt storage modulus and dynamic viscosity.

40|$|Water in oil {{emulsion}} {{occurs at}} many {{stages in the}} production and treatment of crude oil. About two third of petroleum production of every oil field exists {{in the form of}} water in oil emulsion. The emulsion stability results from the presence of interfacial barrier preventing coalescence of the dispersed water droplets. This is due to the present of polar components such as asphaltenes, resins, wax and naphtenic acids in the crude oil. Therefore before transporting or refining the oil, it is essential to separate the water for economic and operational reasons. Minimizing the water level in the oil reduces pipeline corrosion and maximizes pipeline usage. The most effective method to overcome the problem is to demulsify the crude by using demulsifiers. The demulsifiers will destabilize the interfacial film between the droplets. It has been reported that the combination of oil-soluble demulsifiers and water-soluble demulsifiers produced great result in water separation. From the screening process of single oil-soluble demulsifiers, the most effective chemicals as demulsifier are TOMAC, hexylamine and dioctylamine while methyl <b>methacrylate,</b> <b>butyl</b> acrylate and acrylic acid are the most effective chemicals in water-soluble group. The new formulation of demulsifier was formulated by using Statistical Analysis System software. From this analysis, the optimum concentration needed for TOMAC, hexylamine, dioctylamine, methyl <b>methacrylate,</b> <b>butyl</b> acrylate and acrylic acid are 48. 7 ppm, 0 ppm, 8 ppm, 48. 2 ppm, 26. 5 ppm and 29. 9 ppm, respectively.

Mobility increases with increasing content of <b>butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> units, that acts as an internal plasticizer.

40|$|Injured bone initiates {{the healing}} process by forming a blood clot at the damaged site. However, in severe damage, {{synthetic}} bone implants are used to provide structural integrity and restore {{the healing process}}. The implant unavoidably comes into direct contact with whole blood, leading to a blood clot formation on its surface. Despite this, most research in bone tissue engineering virtually ignores {{the important role of}} a blood clot in supporting healing. Surface chemistry of a biomaterial is a crucial property in mediating blood-biomaterials interactions, and hence the formation of the resultant blood clot. Surfaces presenting mixtures of functional groups carboxyl (–COOH) and methyl (–CH 3) have been shown to enhance platelet response and coagulation activation, leading to the formation of fibrin fibres. In addition, {{it has been shown that}} varying the compositions of these functional groups and the length of alkyl groups further modulate the immune complement response. In this study, we hypothesised that a biomaterial surface with mixture of –COOH/–CH 3 (methyl), –CH 2 CH 3 (ethyl) or –(CH 2) 3 CH 3 (butyl) groups at different ratios would modulate blood coagulation and complement activation, and eventually tailor the structural and functional properties of the blood clot formed on the surface, which subsequently impacts new bone formation. Firstly, we synthesised a series of materials composed of acrylic acid (AA), and methyl (MMA), ethyl (EMA) or <b>butyl</b> <b>methacrylates</b> (BMA) at different ratios and coated on the inner surfaces of incubation vials. Our surface analysis showed that the amount of –COOH groups on the surface coatings was lower than the ratios of AA prepared in the materials even though the surface content of –COOH groups increased with increasing in AA ratios. It was indicated that the surface hydrophobicity increased with increasing alkyl chain length: –CH 3 > –CH 2 CH 3 > –(CH 2) 3 CH 3, and decreased with increasing –COOH groups. No significant differences in surface hydrophobicity was found on surfaces with –CH 3 and –CH 2 CH 3 groups in the presence of –COOH groups. The material coating was as smooth as uncoated glass and without any major flaws. The average roughness of material-coated surface (3. 99 ± 0. 54 nm) was slightly higher than that of uncoated glass surface (2. 22 ± 0. 29 nm). However, no significant differences in surface average roughness was found among surfaces with the same functionalities at different –COOH ratios nor among surfaces with different alkyl groups but the same –COOH ratios. These suggested that the surface functional groups and their compositions had a combined effect on modulating surface hydrophobicity but not surface roughness. The second part of our study was to investigate the effect of surface functional groups and their compositions on blood cascade activation and structural properties of the formed clots. It was found that surfaces with –COOH/–(CH 2) 3 CH 3 induced a faster coagulation activation than those with –COOH/–CH 3 and –CH 2 CH 3, regardless of the –COOH ratios. An increase in –COOH ratios on –COOH/–CH 3 and –CH 2 CH 3 surfaces decreased the rate of activation. Moreover, all material-coated surfaces markedly reduced the complement activation compared to uncoated glass surfaces, and the pattern of complement activation was entirely similar to that of surface-induced coagulation, suggesting there is an interaction between two cascades. The clots formed on material-coated surfaces had thicker fibrin with a tighter network at the exterior when compared to uncoated glass surfaces. Compared to the clot exteriors, thicker fibrins with a loose network were found in clot interiors. Coated surfaces resulted in more rigid clots with a significantly slower fibrinolysis after 1 h of lysis when compared to uncoated glass surfaces. Significant differences in fibrinolysis after 1 h of lysis among clots on material-coated surfaces correlated well with the differences in fibrin thickness and density at clot exterior. In addition, more growth factors were released during clot formation than during clot lysis. From an intact clot, there was a correlation between the amount of PDGF-AB release and fibrin density. Highest amount of PDGF-AB was released from clots formed on surfaces with 40...|$|R

SPSs with high sulfonation degrees (water-soluble) and low sulfonation degrees (water-insoluble) can stabilize oil-in-water emulsions; these emulsions were transformed into water-in-oil HIPEs by varying salt concentrations and/or changing the pH. SPS, with a sulfonation degree of 11. 6 %, is the most efficient, and as low as 0. 2 (w/v) % of the organic phase is enough to stabilize the HIPEs. Phase inversion of the oil-in-water emulsions occurred to form water-in-oil HIPEs by increasing the salt concentration in the aqueous phase. Two phase inversion points from oil-in-water emulsions to water-in-oil HIPEs were observed at pH 1 and 13.

Abnormally low heats observed with hydroxyethyl methacrylate and 2 -hydroxypropyl methacrylate are attributed to the solvation of the monomer, less solvation being possible in the polymer as a result of shielding. Kinetics of polymerization. The microcalorimeter has been used to obtain rates of polymerization of a number of monomers in emulsion systems. The rates with the acrylates are consistently higher than those with the methacrylates, and this is attributed to there being less steric hindrance in the acrylate polymerization. Low rates found with the monomers containing a hydroxyl groups are explained as due to solvation in the initial monomer state. In both the acrylates and methacrylates the rates go through a maximum as one goes up the series methyl: ethyl: butyl: hexyl. This is discussed in terms of inductive and steric effects. Heats of vaporization. Heats of vaporization of fourteen alcohols, having from one to five carbon atoms, have been determined in a Calvet microcalorimeter, using a special technique. The method consisted of allowing the alcohol to vaporize into a vacuum, the heat required for the vaporization being provided by passing a current through a resistance wire which was immersed in oil in a U-tube surrounded by the alcohol. The additivity scheme previously devised by Laidler for heats of formation and related properties was applied to the results, and the agreement with experiment was within a few tenth of a percent. Additivity. An empirical bond energy scheme has been derived and applied to several physico-chemical properties of several families of compounds. The scheme proposed is a modification of Tatevskii's scheme. It defines three types of C-H bonds and several types of C-C bonds depending on their multiplicity and their environment. Other functional groups (e. g. -CHO, -COH) have been considered as a group and have been treated as such. They are assigned group symbols and their contribution to the physico-chemical property is a group contribution. The scheme has been applied to alkanes, alkenes, dienes and cylic hydrocarbons for the following properties; molar volume, molar refraction, entropy of formation and heat of atomization, all at 25 °C. Molar sound velocities and diamagnetic susceptibilities are two other properties treated for several families of compounds...|$|R

Acrylic copolymer of 95 % of <b>butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> and 5 % of methacrylic acid was used as polymer matrix of the composite. It was shown that GMI meander sensing elements are capable of detecting Ni nanoparticles spread in the polymer matrix.

40|$|Statistical group {{transfer}} copolymerization (GTP) of acrylates with methacrylates {{have been}} performed for four binary systems using 1 -methoxy- 2 -methyl- 1 -trimethylsilyloxypropene (initiator) and tetrabutylammonium bibenzoate (catalyst) in tetrahydrofuran solution. The copolymer compositions were determined by H- 1 n. m. r. spectroscopy and the results evaluated by the extended Kelen-Tudos method. The monomer pairs concerned are (1) ethyl acrylate (EA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA), (2) methyl acrylate (MA) and ethyl methacrylate (EMA), (3) MA and <b>butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (BMA) and (4) MA and iso <b>butyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (i-BMA). The reactivity ratios {{were found to be}} gamma(EA) = 14. 15, gamma(MMA) = 0 01, gamma(MA) = 14. 41, gamma(EMA) = 0 01, gamma(MA) 13. 96, gamma(BMA) = 0. 23, gamma(MA) = 8. 66 and gamma(iBMA) = 0. 08 respectively. Statistical anionic copolymerizations were also carried out for two monomer pairs to compare with the results for GTP. The reactivity ratios are gamma(EA) = 9. 67, gamma(MMA) = 0. 11 gamma(MA) = 3. 51 and gamma(EMA) = 0 20. It was found that acrylate is much more reactive than methacrylate; the reactivity ratios are quite different from unity and show a high similarity in GTP and anionic polymerization.

40|$|Termination rate coefficients, kt, for the terpolymerization of {{mixtures}} {{containing the}} three acrylates: methyl, butyl, and dodecyl acrylate or the corresponding {{members of the}} <b>methacrylate</b> family: methyl, <b>butyl,</b> and dodecyl <b>methacrylate,</b> have been measured via the single pulse (SP) -PLP technique. In the homopolymerization {{of each of the}} six monomers an initial plateau region of almost constant kt is seen which extends at least up to 15 % and, for dodecyl acrylate and dodecyl methacrylate, even up to about 50 % monomer conversion. Terpolymerization kt in this region of low and moderate conversion is remarkably well described by a rather simple correlation which exclusively contains homopolymerization kt and the composition of the monomer mixture. This correlation turns out to be very useful for the modeling of kt in mixtures of monomers that exhibit such an initial plateau region of kt. For the systems under investigation, terpolymerization kt, may be estimated within ± 30 %. This finding is very remarkable in view of the enormous differences in homopolymerization kt, within each monomer family, e. g., kt, of methyl acrylate exceeds the corresponding dodecyl acrylate value by a factor of 50 (or 5000 %). The entire set of experiments has been carried out at 40 °C and 1000 bar where the signal to noise ratio of the laser-induced single pulse experiments is very satisfactory. No reason is seen why the conclusions about modeling of terpolymerization kt should not be valid at other reaction conditions including ambient pressure. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D- 69451 Weinheim 1999...|$|R
40|$|The {{peculiar}} rectangular {{outline of}} the spores of Bacillus apiarius Katznelson, observed while measuring spores in the electron microscope (Fitz-James and Young, 1959), prompted this study {{of the structure of}} these spores. Electron microscopy of thin sections and of carbon replicas revealed that the odd horned and rec-tangular outline {{was the result of a}} remarkably thick and ridged spore coat. METHODS The culture of B. apiarius used and the pro-cedure for obtaining spores has been fully described (Fitz-James and Young, 1959). Fixation and embedding for electron microscopy. The usual procedures of osmium fixation proved unsuitable for the spores of this bacillus. Even overnight exposure at room temperature to 1 per cent osmium left the interior of the spore unfixed. Reasonably good fixation and subsequent embed-ding was achieved either by first boiling the spores for 30 min or by partly disrupting them in a Mickle (1948) disintegrator while suspended in fixative. Fixatives used were either osmium sucrose (Caulfield, 1957) or osmium-CaCl 2 (Brad-bury and Meek, 1958) solutions. Fixed spores were washed first in their respec-tive buffers, followed by 50 per cent alcohol and then dehydrated and methacrylate impregnated by standard procedures. Prepolymerized <b>butyl</b> and methyl <b>methacrylate</b> (10 : 1) dissolved to a thick syrup in the same monomers were used to transfer the samples to gelatin capsules. Polymerization was completed by 4 to 6 hr exposure to ultraviolet light (Hanovia, Slough, England).

40|$|The grana of chloroplasts of starch-free {{leaves of}} Nicotiana rustica are {{described}} in detail. Leaf sections were fixed in 2. 5 per cent KMnO 4 and embedded in mixtures of <b>butyl</b> and ethyl <b>methacrylate.</b> Chain length of the polymer was modified by use of a transfer agent. The grana are composed of compartments consisting of electron-scattering partitions and electron-transparent loculi. Compartments are not open to the stroma so that the grana are distinct subplastid organelles. Adjacent grana are connected by an anastomosing fretwork system composed of flexuous channels bordered by electron-scattering membranes. Ten different kinds of granum margins are described. These marginal variations depend upon grana-fretwork connections and internal marginal connections between adjacent loculi. A study of serial sections suggests, {{at least in some}} plastids, the occurrence of a possible orderly spiral arrangement of compartment-fretwork connections. Adjacent grana may have common compartments. Grana may branch. Variations in shape may depend upon the angle the section bears to the axis of the cylinder. This should also influence the relative thickness and sharpness of the partitions. Since all shapes and variations in partition thickness and sharpness cannot be accounted for {{on the basis of the}} orientation of the grana, such variations probably occur naturally. Grana vary in size, ranging from those few which have a single partition to those having 50 or more compartments which extend completely through the width of a plastid. Relationships between grana of different sizes and between compartments and frets indicate the possibility of growth of grana from union or extension of compartments and formation of compartments from the union of frets...|$|R
