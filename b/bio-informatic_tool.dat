40|$|The O-GlcNAc {{modification}} is, akin to phosphorylation, {{an abundant}} modification which {{plays an important}} role in cellular processes. The addition of OGlcNAc to proteins is regulated by the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). This enzyme is ubiquitously expressed in mammals. The human OGT spans approximately 43 kb of genomic DNA, and to date, 3 OGT isoforms have been sequenced (two nuclear and one mitochondrial). In mammals, OGT exist as different isoforms, such as in the rat and the mouse, differing by 30 nucleotides in their N-terminal (exon 2). In this study, the mouse OGT isoforms were investigated. In addition, the expression of the full OGT transcript and various transcripts was studied by real-time PCR in mouse tissues (liver, heart, kidney, testis, lung, spleen, ear, stomach, intestine, bone, tail and brain). The highest level of full length mouse OGT was found in spleen followed by testis and lung. The human OGT was shown to have highest expression in pancreas. Further investigations showed that mice express both isoforms (one which uses both exon 2 A and 2 B and one which skips exon 2 A and only uses exon 2 B). The first isoform showed highest expression in heart and aorta and the second one in liver and lung, suggesting that mouse OGT exists in different isoforms of varying abundance. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are the major regulators of protein biological functions. PTMs are catalyzed by their respective enzymes which are sequence specific. Depending on the environment and signaling contexts, proteins are modified and instantly functional. In this study, the protein consensus sequences of 4 different modifications were investigated by utilizing the <b>bio-informatic</b> <b>tool</b> MAPRes. This tool mines association rules of a modified residue in peptides. Phosphorylated Ser/Thr/Tyr showed a polar sequence environment withPro at various positions. O-GlcNAc modified Ser/Thr occured in an environment with vicinal Val (- 1 position) and Pro (- 2 and - 3 positions), acetylated Lys occured in a basic environment with a preference for His or Tyr at + 1 and Ser at + 7 positions. Methylated Lys also showed a preference for basic amino acids, but compared with acetylated Lys, which have a high preference for vicinal Lys, methylated Lys showed a higher preference for Arg. Methylated Arg showed a high preference for Gly both up- and downstream the peptide chain. In addition, the Yin Yang site sequence environment was also investigated and showed that such sites were located in a polar environment with Pro at various positions. These results suggest that Pro is a very important amino acid in the vicinity of modified amino acids. Furthermore the position of Pro could be determinant in deciding whether a residue is phosphorylated, O-GlcNAc modified or both (Yin Yang site) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. - The {{transcription}} factor Forkhead box O 1 (FOXO 1) {{is a key}} regulator of metabolic processes such as regulation of the cell cycle and cancer. Different post translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination control the structure, function regulation and subcellular localization of FOXO 1. In this work the role of different modifications and their interplay, involving the regulating the transcriptional activity of FOXO 1, is investigated by using various <b>bio-informatic</b> <b>tools.</b> Amongst these is the YinOYang prediction method, which predicts Yin Yang sites in proteins (sites, where O-glycosylation and phosphorylation may compete with each other). Moreover acetylation and methylation may also work together to regulate FOXO 1 transcriptional activity. This study suggest that phosphorylation and acetylation deactivate FOXO 1 ’s transcriptional activity by disrupting binding between DNA and FOXO 1, and promote its cytoplasmic localization and degradation of the FOXO 1 {{transcription factor}}. Furthermore, glycosylation and methylation increase the DNA bindin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) is {{an eight}} beta-barrel, trans-membrane structure, which participates in host immune response, cell proliferation, {{pathogenicity}} and controlled cell death program. The current study employs the <b>bio-informatics</b> <b>tool</b> {{to unravel the}} structural and functional properties of the WSP infecting drosophila. The present study was focused on sequence analysis, insilico prediction of the secondary and tertiary structure of wsp sequence. Sequence analysis and physiochemical properties revealed that this protein is highly stable, negatively charged and having more hydrophobic regions. SOPMA was used to predict secondary structure of wsp, which revealed that the protein contains more of random coils and extended strands than alpha helix and beta sheets. SVM prot analysis revealed the functionality of protein including the details of metal binding sites.

40|$|Male urinary lipocalin family proteins, {{practically}} odorant-binding proteins {{but also}} could be pheromones by themselves, in rodents act as a shuttle for chemosignal communication and facilitate delivery of the signals for access to congeners. However, presence of this protein in urine of female rodents {{has not yet been}} reported. Therefore, the present investigation was carried out to find if lipocalin family protein is present in the urine of female house rat and, if so, to find whether its expression differs between the phases in the estrous cycle. The rat urinary protein was separated in single dimensional gel electrophoresis. A 14. 5 kDa lipocalin protein appeared in the urine prominently during the estrus and metestrus phases compared to proestrus and diestrus phases. The expression of this protein in the urine was very low in ovariectomized rats. MALDI-TOF/MS analysis affirmed the 14. 5 kDa protein as a lipocalin family protein. Analysis adopting <b>bio-informatics</b> <b>tools</b> further proved the protein as a lipocalin family member. Thus, this study for the first time demonstrated the presence of a lipocalin family protein in the urine of a female rodent and it was highly expressed during estrus phase.

40|$|Standard Illumina mate-paired {{libraries}} {{are constructed}} from 3 - to 5 -kb DNA fragments by a blunt-end circularization. Sequencing reads that {{pass through the}} junction of the two joined ends of a 3 – 5 -kb DNA fragment {{are not easy to}} identify and pose problems during mapping and de novo assembly. Longer read lengths increase the possibility that a read will cross the junction. To solve this problem, we developed a mate-paired protocol for use with Illumina sequencing technology that uses Cre-Lox recombination instead of blunt end circularization. In this method, a LoxP sequence is incorporated at the junction site. This sequence allows screening reads for junctions without using a reference genome. Junction reads can be trimmed or split at the junction. Moreover, the location of the LoxP sequence in the reads distinguishes mate-paired reads from spurious paired-end reads. We tested this new method by preparing and sequencing a mate-paired library with an insert size of 3 [*]kb from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

However, it is still based on pre-selected target chemicals. Thus, assessment may strongly benefit from the application of non-target screening (NTS) based on state-of-the-art LC–HRMS and GC–HRMS that is able to record comprehensive chemical fingerprints of complex environmental mixtures and is already applied in routine monitoring such as at the River Rhine, where since 2012 almost 2000 samples have been screened with NTS [52]. Open digital repositories {{can be used to}} archive current-state full scan HRMS analysis for retrospective and joint exploitation [53, 54].

It may be assumed that complex environmental mixtures in water bodies are not just randomly composed but the result of confluence of source-related patterns modified by environmental fate. Considering contamination not only as a mixture of ten thousands of individual chemicals but also as an overlay of chemical fingerprints related to different sources would be a paradigm shift that might strongly impact on chemical monitoring towards a more comprehensive {{but at the same time}} simplified approach. It will be of particular value for management by indicating predominating pollution sources impacting on water quality.|$|R

Here, we investigated whether this treatment induces modulation of miRNAs in tumor cells and their relevance to chemotherapy response. Array analysis identified 20 differentially expressed miRNAs in human IGROV- 1 ovarian tumor cells from CpG-ODN-treated mice versus controls (16 down- and 4 up-regulated). Evaluation {{of the role}} of the 3 most differentially expressed miRNAs on sensitivity to cisplatin of IGROV- 1 cells revealed significantly increased cisplatin cytotoxicity upon ectopic expression of hsa-miR- 302 b (up-modulated in our array), but no increased effect upon reduced expression of hsa-miR- 424 or hsa-miR- 340 (down-modulated in our array). Accordingly, hsa-miR- 302 b expression was significantly associated with time to relapse or overall survival in two data sets of platinum-treated ovarian cancer patients. Use of <b>bio-informatics</b> <b>tools</b> identified 19 mRNAs potentially targeted by hsa-miR- 302 b, including HDAC 4 gene, which has been reported to mediate cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer. Both HDAC 4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in IGROV- 1 cells overexpressing hsa-miR- 302 b. Altogether, these findings indicate that hsa-miR- 302 b acts as a "chemosensitizer" in human ovarian carcinoma cells and may represent a biomarker able to predict response to cisplatin treatment. Moreover, the identification of miRNAs that improve sensitivity to chemotherapy provides the experimental underpinning for their possible future clinical use...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of autoimmune diseases {{has shown a}} significant increase in developed countries during the last 40 years. The cause of this increase is still unknown, and reliable methods for the detection of individuals at risk of developing autoimmune disease are not available yet. To explore new methods for the diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune disease, we have studied the repertoire of natural autoantibodies (NA) and its relationship with autoimmune disease using large arrays of defined antigens. NA are found in healthy humans and mice, apparently in the absence of immunization with their target antigens. We used knock-out mice to demonstrate that the repertoire of NA is influenced by factors not directly related to antigenic stimulation such as endogenous levels of histamine. By studying strains of mice known to differ in their susceptibility to autoimmune disease, we could conclude that the repertoire of NA reflects the susceptibility to develop autoimmune disease. The study of the human repertoire of NA required the development of <b>bio-informatic</b> <b>tools</b> to overcome the variation introduced by individual differences in the genetic background and immune history. We found that human NA are organized in clusters that can differentiate healthy subjects from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus or Behçet’s disease patients. The development of new tools to undertake large-scale NA analysis could also enhance our understanding of the immune system, and leave us {{in a better position to}} face the up-coming epidemics of autoimmune disorders...|$|R
40|$|Background: Glycosylation can {{significantly}} improve physicochemical or biological properties of small molecules such as vitamins, fragrances and antibiotics. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are carbohydrate-active enzymes that can efficiently catalyse such reactions. We recently discovered a promising biocatalyst (GT- 1) for the glycosylation {{of a wide}} variety of compounds, but its thermostability will be crucial for industrial applications. Materials and Methods: GT- 1 was recombinantly expressed and purified via Ni-NTA chromatography. Thermal half-life time (t 50 (50 °C)) at 50 °C was assessed by sampling at fixed intervals until the residual activity had dropped to 50 %, while the melting temperature (Tm) was determined via differential scanning fluorimetry. The <b>bio-informatic</b> <b>tools</b> YASARA and 3 DM were used to select target positions for engineering. Results: GT- 1 was succesfully expressed and yields up to 40 mg purified protein per liter culture were obtained. Further, t 50 (50 °C) and Tm values of respectively 90 min and 56 °C were found. Discussion: The kinetic stability of GT- 1 was rather low. Indeed, after 1 min of incubation at 50 °C, residual activity already dropped to 70 %. Clearly, enzyme engineering strategies need to be developed. Therefore, a homology model was constructed and structural analysis revealed a strikingly large amount of open spaces. Filling these cavities with larger amino acids should increase hydrophobic packing, yielding a more stable enzyme. Conclusion: The kinetic and thermal stability of GT- 1 was assessed. Engineering the enzyme’s stability by a combination of smart (sequence-based) and rational (structure-based) mutagenesis will be key to biocatalyst development...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{recognition}} of a common source norovirus outbreak is supported by finding identical norovirus sequences in patients. Norovirus sequencing {{has been established in}} many (national) public health laboratories and academic centers, but often partial and different genome sequences are used. Therefore, agreement on a target sequence of sufficient diversity to resolve links between outbreaks is crucial. Although harmonization of laboratory methods is one of the keystone activities of networks that have the aim to identify common source norovirus outbreaks, this has proven difficult to accomplish, particularly in the international context. Here, we aimed at providing a method enabling identification of the genomic region informative of a common source norovirus outbreak by <b>bio-informatic</b> <b>tools.</b> The data set of 502 unique full length capsid gene sequences available from the public domain, combined with epidemiological data including linkage information was used to build over 3, 000 maximum likelihood (ML) trees for different sequence lengths and regions. All ML trees were evaluated for robustness and specificity of clustering of known linked norovirus outbreaks against the background diversity of strains. Great differences were seen in the robustness of commonly used PCR targets for cluster detection. The capsid gene region spanning nucleotides 900 – 1, 400 was identified as the region optimally substituting for the full length capsid region. Reliability of this approach depends {{on the quality of the}} background data set, and we recommend periodic reassessment of this growing data set.

40|$|Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius (GT) is a thermophilic, ethanol-producing {{bacterium}} {{capable of}} utilising both hexose and pentose sugars for fermentation. One strategy to improve fermentation yields {{would be to}} engineer GT strains to secrete hydrolases {{to increase the amount}} of available sugars from various feedstocks. Therefore, optimised protein secretion would be vital to improve feedstock utilisation. Secretion in the related mesophile Bacillus subtilis (BS) has been well studied, and several strategies have been developed to improve secretion of heterologous proteins in BS, one such strategy being the manipulation or changing of the signal peptide. One aim is to identify any differences in the secretion machinery and signal sequences between GT and BS. Another aim is to analyse any effects of overproduction of hydrolases and to identify any bottlenecks in protein secretion in GT. Using <b>bio-informatics</b> <b>tools</b> we find that although GT is a thermophile, the signal peptides in this organism do not differ significantly from those in BS. From a shotgun mass spectrometry approach it was also observed that unlike BS, GT undergoes significant cell lysis during growth releasing cytoplasmic proteins into the extracellular milieu, which could have implications on the levels of secreted hydrolases. A model enzyme was selected and over-produced at high levels in order to stress the secretion system in GT so as to identify any bottlenecks in secretion. The results thus far indicate that the rate limiting step in secretion could be post-translocation where the enzyme is degraded by proteases in the cell wall and extracellular milieu. The addition of protease inhibitor to growth media, increases the activity and abundance of the enzyme, suggesting that proteolysis may be a major factor when over-producing secreted enzymes at high levels...|$|R

For the purpose of fine mapping and isolation of putative Rvi 5 locus, two new populations were developed from crosses between ‘Golden Delicious’ × ‘Murray’ and ‘Galaxy’ × ‘Murray’. A total of 1243 plants that were obtained from above crosses were screened by using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers. SSR markers Hi 07 h 02 and CH 05 d 08 previously reported as co-segregating and not co-segregating with Rvi 5 (Vm) gene were used as starting and end point of ‘Murray’ BAC library screening. Nine new SSR markers were designed for the region in between SSR Hi 07 h 02 and CH 05 d 08 using the ‘Golden Delicious’ genome sequence. Among the designed new SSR markers only four were polymorphic for the parents and Polymorphic markers (SSR FMACH_Vm 1 to SSR FMACH_Vm 4) were used to identify the positive BAC clones.

40|$|The first {{dimension}} of chemokine heterogeneity is reflected by their discovery and purification as natural proteins. Each of those chemokines attracted a specific inflammatory leukocyte type. With {{the introduction of}} genomic technologies, a second wave of chemokine heterogeneity was established by the discovery of putative chemokine-like sequences and by demonstrating chemotactic activity of the gene products in physiological leukocyte homing. In the postgenomic era, the third {{dimension of}} chemokine heterogeneity is the description of posttranslational modifications on most chemokines. Proteolysis of chemokines, for instance by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV/CD 26) and by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is already well established as a biological control mechanism to activate, potentiate, dampen or abrogate chemokine activities. Other posttranslational modifications are less known. Theoretical N-linked and O-linked attachment sites for chemokine glycosylation were searched with <b>bio-informatic</b> <b>tools</b> and {{it was found that}} most chemokines are not glycosylated. These findings are corroborated with a low number of experimental studies demonstrating N- or O-glycosylation of natural chemokine ligands. Because attached oligosaccharides protect proteins against proteolytic degradation, their absence may explain the fast turnover of chemokines in the protease-rich environments of infection and inflammation. All chemokines interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Whether lectin-like GAG-binding induces cellular signaling is not clear, but these interactions are important for leukocyte migration and have already been exploited to reduce inflammation. In addition to selective proteolysis, citrullination and nitration/nitrosylation are being added as biologically relevant modifications contributing to functional chemokine heterogeneity. Resulting chemokine isoforms with reduced affinity for GPCRs reduce leukocyte migration in various models of inflammation. Here, these third dimension modifications are compared, with reflections on the biological and pathological contexts in which these posttranslational modifications take place and contribute to the repertoire of chemokine functions and with an emphasis on autoimmune diseases. status: publishe...|$|R

Conventional methods are cell-based and lengthy, therefore V 3 sequence based prediction algorithms are becoming increasingly attractive as monitoring tools. Here we report a comparative analysis of viral tropism of strains circulating in Cameroon where diverse and emerging variant strains are prevalent. Methods Viruses were isolated from 17 HIV positive individuals from three cities in Cameroon. Ghost cell lines expressing either CCR 5 or CXCR 4 with CD 4 or CD 4 alone (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) {{were used to determine}} co-receptor usage. HIV replication was determined by measuring p 24 antigen levels. Plasma viral load (VL) was determined using the Versant bDNA assay. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on the V 3 region and sequences were edited, aligned and translated into amino acids as described in the algorithm. <b>Bio-informatics</b> <b>tools</b> based on the 11 / 25 and charge rule were used to predict co-receptor usage. Results The majority of patient isolates in our study were CRF 02 _AG or CRF 02 _AG containing recombinants. Tropism of these complex viruses based on the cell culture assay was determined to be R 5 in 15 / 17 (88. 2 %) patients. However, two patient isolates were dual tropic R 5 X 4 and had drug-specific mutations. Of these two patients, one was on antiretroviral treatment with a VL of 20, 899 copies/ml and the other was drug-naïve with 141, 198 copies/ml. Genotype based prediction was overall in good agreement with phenotype for R 5 viruses, where 93 % (14 / 15) of results were comparable, dual tropic viruses being reported as X 4 viruses by prediction. Conclusion Our results indicate that most HIV strains in Cameroon were R 5 tropic and some harbored drug-resistant mutations. V 3 sequence based prediction compared well with cell based assays for R 5 strains and may be useful even in settings where highly diverse strains are prevalent. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between Medicago truncatula and Phytophthora medicaginis were examined using skl, a mutant blocked in ethylene perception, {{and a range}} of wild accessions of this plant species. P. medicaginis infection of M. truncatula plants resulted in compatible responses, whereas the mutant genotype was found to be hyper-susceptible to the pathogen. Phytophthora reproduction and colonization rates of Medicago tissues supported this conclusion. Infection of skl with different pathogens reinforced this observation. Ethylene production in infected A 17 and skl roots showed reduced ethylene evolution in the mutant and suggested that a positive feedback loop, known as autocatalytic ethylene production, amplified the ethylene signal. To complement the study, expression analyses of defense response genes in this interaction were studied by real time RTPCR of Phytophthora-infected and mock-infected roots. The genes analyzed were PAL, CHS, IFR, ACC oxidase, GST, and PR 10. The sequences needed for the analysis were found through the scrutiny of the M. truncatula EST database employing phylogenetics and <b>bio-informatics</b> <b>tools.</b> In A 17 all the genes studied were up-regulated, although the specific gene expression patterns differed. The comparison of gene expression between A 17 and skl genotypes allowed the differentiation between ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent responses. Discrete results showed that ACC oxidase homologues were downregulated in the ethylene perception mutant, corroborating the ethylene observations. However, the expression of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid metabolism was increased in skl relative to A 17, suggestive of an antagonism between the ethylene perception pathway and the regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway. This result implied that Medicago phytoalexins accumulate in the disease interaction, but raised questions about their role in resistance to Phytophthora infection. This study establishes a link between mechanisms that regulate symbiotic infection and the regulation of disease resistance to Oomycete pathogens, especially P. medicaginis. The results served to identify a series of Phytophthora-induced genes, which remain pathogen-responsive {{even in the absence of}} a functional ethylene perception pathway.

In particular, the complexity of biological information necessitates powerful bioinformatics computational resources both {{at the level of}} storage and analysis of data. Moreover, the heterogeneous bioinformatics-related knowledge of scientists involved {{in agricultural}} research makes it fundamental to provide an in-situ training program dedicated to the most utilized computational tools. All these challenges are being tackled by the 2 ̆ 7 ESCOGITARE 2 ̆ 7 project which should provide an e-Science based, virtual lab structure for plant and animal genomics to help in the understanding of important traits such as yield, stress resistance and quality. The recently founded Italian Agricultural Research Council can be considered as a good example of application of such a collaborative research approach due to the number of the belonging institutes and to the wide range of competences characterizing each of them. Aim of the 2 ̆ 7 ESCOGITARE 2 ̆ 7 Project is thus to provide a Grid-based infrastructure to CRA Institutes in order enable them to find and share their know-how, data and computational power in a collaborative work context. This target will be reached in this project by using both Grid and videoconference technologies. In particular, we are implementing Grid infrastructure prototype to allow discovery, management and secure access to a set of high-level services compliant to the Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) specification. In order to avoid starting from scratch GlobusToolkit 4 Core middleware was chosen. Web Services can be used to virtualize computational and data resources in order to allow workflow composition by using an orchestration approach. End users can create a specific workflow by using the Active BPEL Designer tool and a collection of dynamically discovered high level services description. The output of this operation is an abstract sharable workflow where each node corresponds to a web service invocation. At execution time every action in the workflow will be scheduled to a particular instance of a related general Web Service description and the workflow result can be made available on the portal. We are also implementing a set of administration and configuration tools in order to easily add and manage a node to the Grid. Future works foreseen wrapping of mostly used <b>bio-informatics</b> <b>tools</b> like MPI-Blast as an high-level service.

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is {{the leading}} cause of human {{gastroenteritis}} world-wide, and the antecedent infection in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Although much progress has been made regarding its virulence determinants,our understanding of the molecular basis of C. jejuni pathogenesis still lags behind that of other enteric pathogens. Bacterial pathogenesis is often dependent on proteinaceous virulence factors transported to the bacterial cell surface or released into the external environment. Understanding the molecular basis of interactions between these proteins and host cells is necessary in understanding and controlling infections. Background: Previously identified adhesins of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 have still not provided us with a total understanding of the pathogenesis of campylobacteriosis. It is hypothesized that as yet unidentified C. jejuni surface proteins interact with host proteins contributing to colonisation and pathogenesis. This study sought to screen the genome of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 to identify additional genes that may code for other adhesins using phage display technology and in silico sequence analysis. Methods: A phage display library was constructed by the insertion of randomly fragmented chromosomal DNA of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 into the phagemid vector pG 8 SAET. Following affinity panning of the library against holo- and apo-lactoferrin, enriched clones were screened with ELISA to identify affinity-binding clones. Several phage clones were randomly selected and their C. jejuni DNA inserts sequenced and analysed with <b>bio-informatic</b> <b>tools.</b> In order to identify novel autotransporter proteins of C. jejuni, the amino acid sequences of previously described adhesion-associated autotransporters were employed in BLAST searches of the predicted coding sequences of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 genome database. Results: Screening of the phage display library resulted in the identification of C. jejuni NCTC 11168 gene, Cj 0609 c, encoding a putative periplasmic protein, designated LimC, predicted to be a member of the SGNH-family of hydrolases, a diverse family of lipases and esterases. Searching the genome of C. jejuni NCTC 11168, Cj 0628 was identified as coding a protein with characteristics of autotransporters, designated CapA. CapA was demonstrated to be surface-exposed, mutants of which had a lowered ability to associate with or invade Caco- 2 cells and failed to colonize chicken guts, indicating that CapA plays a role in host association and colonization by Campylobacter. Conclusion: LimC may be involved in binding of C. jejuni to lactoferrin for iron acquisition in vivo, and/or play further role in adhesion, colonization and internalisation of C. jejuni into host cells. CapA also plays a role in adhesion. Further characterization of these proteins should contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of C. jejuni...|$|R
40|$|Background: A human ribosomal protein L 9 (RPL 9) encodes {{a protein}} {{that is a}} {{component}} of the 60 S subunit. RPL 9 is located on chromosome 4 p 14 and is approximately 5. 5 kb in length and contains 8 exons. The message for human RPL 9 is 712 nucleotides long. Some of the functions of RPL 9 documented so far include the crucial involvement of the gene product in cell proliferation and protein biosynthesis. Lipoic acid synthetase (LIAS) is a 1. 73 kb gene also located at chromosome 4 p 14. Alternative splicing occurs at these locus and two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified but in this study the results represents both isoforms together. The protein encoded by LIAS gene belongs to the biotin and lipoic acid synthetases family and localizes in the mitochondrion. Function of lipoic acid synthetase is not yet well documented. Some studies have attempted to characterise its function by looking at the biological pathways at which LIAS gene product plays a crucial role, for example the biosynthesis of alpha-lipoic acid. Alpha lipoic acid is a natural antioxidant and it is also naturally-occurring enzyme co-factor found in a number of multi-enzyme complexes regulating oxidative metabolism. Motivation for study: RPL 9 and LIAS were previously found to be mutated in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cell lines and these mutant lines had gained resistance to apoptosis. Aim: The main objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the expression pattern of RPL 9 and LIAS in lung cancer and to characterise their role in apoptosis and also to determine if the expression pattern of this genes varies between normal and diseased state of the tissue. Methods: In Situ hybridization, quantitative Real Time PCR, TUNEL and Bio-informatics have been employed in order to attain the objectives of this study. Results: In Situ hybridization showed that RPL 9 localises in the cytoplasm and it is up-regulated in lung cancer relative to normal lung. LIAS localises in the cytoplasm and it is also up-regulated in lung cancer. The expression of RPL 9 was relatively higher than that of LIAS determined by the intensity of localisation. Quantitative real time PCR confirmed the up-regulation of RPL 9 and LIAS in lung cancer. RPL 9 and LIAS were found to be up-regulated 8 and 4 fold respectively in lung A 549 lung adenocarcinoma relative to MRC 5 normal lung fibroblast cell lines. TUNEL showed the highest DNA fragmentation in adenocarcinoma, followed by squamous cell lung carcinoma then large cell lung carcinoma which is the same pattern observed in RPL 9 and LIAS mRNA localisation by In Situ hybridization. To further characterise the role of RPL 9 and LIAS in human, <b>Bio-informatics</b> <b>tools</b> were used and the results revealed that RPL 9 is highly conserved through evolution, up-to 100...|$|R
40|$|Quick Summary is an {{innovate}} {{implementation of}} an automatic document summarizer that inputs a document in the English language and evaluates each sentence.

The program then asks the user to specify the number of sentences the person wishes to highlight. For example should the user ask to have three of the most important sentences, it would highlight the first and most important sentence in green. Commonly this is the sentence containing the conclusion. Then Quick Summary finds the second most important sentence usually called a satellite and highlights it in yellow. This is usually the topic sentence. Then the program finds the third most important sentence and highlights it in red. The implementations of this technology are useful in a society of information overload when a person typically receives 42 emails a day (Microsoft).

40|$|PhDThe overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide additional data to assist clinicians and experimental neurologists alike {{in the quest for}} better understanding, more accurately diagnosing and more successfully treating patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease (PD). The general theme of the thesis is the interaction between certain environmental stimuli, including the exposure to adverse events during early central nervous system (CNS) development and the manifestation of elements of neurodegeneration, whether by means of neurochemical changes or expressed as a dysfunctional voluntary motor system. The first chapter provides a general introduction to the research theme of the thesis. This includes, in particular, a discussion on current understanding concerning the etiology and clinical profile of PD, the relative contribution made by genetic factors compared to environmental ones, and current treatment strategies for treating the disease. Mention is also made of the failure of these therapeutic applications for reversing or protecting against the disease, due to the side-effects associated with them. The material covered in chapter 1 provides the basis for the more complete discussion concerning these various aspects, contained in the chapters to follow. The overall aim was also to characterise the effects of commonly used toxin-induced animal models of PD, and the extent of vulnerability that the CNS displays towards them. The destruction of dopaminergic neurons following the administration of 6 -OHDA at targeted points along the nigrostriatal tract is used extensively to model PD pathology in rats and is an established animal model of the disease. However, mature or even aged animals are mainly used in these studies, while the effects that the toxin might have on the developing CNS remain unclear. The study reported in chapter 4 aimed to elucidate some of 6 -OHDA’s actions on the young adolescent (35 days-old) CNS by comparing the motor and biochemical effects of a unilateral infusion of the toxin into two anatomically distinct basal ganglia loci: The medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and the striatum. Animals were randomly assigned to receive either a direct delivery of 6 -OHDA (12 μg/ 4 μl) into the MFB or an indirect injection, into the striatum. Although both lesion types were used, the MFB model is considered a more accurate portrayal of end-stage PD, while the striatum-model better reflects the long-term progressive pathology of the disease. The different lesions’ effects on motor function were determined by observing animal’s asymmetrical forelimb use to correct for weigh shifting during the vertical exploration of a cylindrical enclosure. Following the final behavioral assessment, the concentration of dopamine (DA) and DA metabolites remaining in the post-mortem brains were determined using 4 HPLC electrochemistry (HPLC-EC) and the levels compared between the two groups. The HPLC-EC results revealed a compensatory effect for DA production and DA turnover on the lesioned hemisphere side of the toxin-infused animal group. Thus, following 6 -OHDA treatment, there appears to be extensive adaptive mechanisms in place within the remaining dopaminergic terminals that may be sufficient for maintaining relatively high extracellular and synaptic concentrations of DA. However, since substantial changes in motor-function were observed, it is suggested that the capacity of the remaining dopaminergic neurons to respond to increased functional demands may be limited. In addition, the behavioral results indicate that the distinct indices relating to different functional deficits depend on the lesioning of anatomically distinct structures along the nigrostrial tract. It has long been known that far fewer women are diagnosed with PD than men are. This seeming protection offered to females against degenerative disease of the CNS may relate to estrogen, although the hormone’s mechanism of action on the dopaminergic system is poorly defined. With an estimated 10 - 15 million women using oral contraceptives (OCs) in the United States alone, the aim of chapter 2 was to examine the evidence for a possible relationship between PD and the female reproductive hormone estrogen. A review of the current literature available on the topic was performed by consulting Medline, and by performing a search of the case-reports contained within the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Drug Monitoring database, for possible PD-related symptoms that may arise from estrogen replacement therapy (ERT). The results, whilst conflicting, seem to suggest that estrogen protects women from obtaining the disease, or at least some features of it. Intensive research efforts are called for, with sufficient power to establish the relationship between ERT and the onset and development of parkinsonism. Chapter 3 reports on the results obtained from an experiment that subjected young Sprague-Dawley rats, 35 days of age, to a lower and a higher dose of 6 -OHDA delivered to the MFB. Control rats received equivalent saline infusions. At 14 days post-surgery, the rats were evaluated for forelimb akinesia. For the higher dose of 6 - OHDA the female rats were less impaired than males in making adjustment steps in response to a weight shift and in the vibrissae-evoked forelimb placing test. In addition, Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity was significantly higher for the female rats. Early gender differences in cell survival factors and/or other promoters of neuroplasticity {{may have contributed to the}} beneficial outcome seen in the females. For example, nerve growth factor (NGF) was found to be higher in the female rats following administration of the DA neurotoxin. It is unclear whether gonadal steroids are involved, and, if so, whether female hormones are protective or whether male hormones are prodegenerative. Determining the mechanisms for the improved outcome seen in the young female rats may lead to potential treatment strategies against PD. 5 Many studies have shown that early life stress may lead to impaired brain development, and may be a risk factor for developing psychiatric diseases, including clinical depression. However, few studies have investigated the impact that early stress may have on the onset and development of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. The study reported on in chapter 5 conjointly subjected rat pups to a maternal separation (MS) paradigm that is a well characterised model of adverse early life events, and a unilateral, intrastriatal injection of 6 - OHDA. The combined effects of these models on motor deficits and brain protein levels were investigated. Specifically, the animals were assessed for behavioral changes at 28 days postlesion with a battery of tests that are sensitive to the degree of DA loss sustained. The results show that animals that had been subjected to MS display poorer performance in the vibrissae and single-limb akinesia test compared to non-MS control animals (that had also been subjected to the toxin exposure). In addition, there was a significant increase in the loss of TH staining in MS rats compared to non-MS ones. The results from this study therefore suggest that exposure to adverse experiences during the early stages of life may contribute towards making dopaminergic neurons more susceptible to subsequent insults to the CNS occurring during mature stages of life. Therefore, taken together, early exposure to stress may predispose an individual towards the onset and development of neurodegenerative disease, which especially becomes a threat during the later stages of adult life. Moreover, within the framework of these characteristics, the capacity of a widely-used pharmacological agent (statins) was tested for possible future therapeutic application in PD (chapter 7). Although the precise cause of sporadic PD remains an enigma, evidence suggests that it may associate with defective activity of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Mitochondrial DNA transmit and express this defect in host cells, resulting in increased oxygen free radical production, depressed antioxidant enzyme activities, and greater susceptibility to apoptotic cell death. Simvastatin is a member of the 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) group of drugs that are widely used for lowering cholesterol levels in patients who display elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The study aimed to investigate the effects that statin-treatment have on motor-function and at the mitochondrial-protein level, using rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, as a rat-model of PD. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated either with simvastatin (6 mg/day for 14 days) or with a placebo. Two different tests to assess motor function were used: The apomorphine-rotation test, and the vibrissae-elicited forelimb placement test. Following the drug administration protocol, the nigrostriatal tract was unilaterally lesioned with either rotenone (3 μg/ 4 μl) or, for the controls, were sham-operated by infusing the vehicle (DMSO:PEG) only. Five days later the rats were killed and a highly purified concentration of isolated mitochondria was prepared from the substantia nigra (SN) sections. 2 - 6 Dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) with subsequent identification of the spots using electronspray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometrical (ESI-Q-TOF MS) was performed and the results BLAST-searched using <b>bio-informatics</b> <b>tools</b> for naming the identified peptides. The motor test results indicate that while unilateral rotenone causes behavioral asymmetries, treatment with simvastatin improved motor function relative to the rotenoneinduced ones. Mass Spectroscopy identified 23 mitochondrial proteins that differ significantly in protein expression (p < 0. 05) following simvastatin treatment. The altered proteins were broadly classified according to their cellular function into 6 categories, with the majority involved in energy metabolism. This study effectively illustrated how neuroproteomics, with its sophisticated techniques and non-biased ability to quantify proteins, provides a methodology with which to study the changes in neurons associated with neurodegeneration. As an emerging tool for establishing disease-associated protein profiles, it also generates a greater understanding as to how these proteins interact and undergo post-translational modifications. Furthermore, due to the advances made in bioInformatics, insight is created concerning their functional characteristics. Chapter 4 summarises the most prominent proteomics techniques and discuss major advances made in the fast-growing field of neuroproteomics in PD. Ultimately, it is hoped that the application of this technology will lead towards a presymptomatic diagnosis of PD, and the identification of risk factors and new therapeutic targets at which pharmacological intervention can be aimed. The final chapter (chapter 8) provides a retrospective look at the academic work that had been performed for the purpose of this thesis, recaps on the main findings, and also highlights certain aspects of the project and provides relevant suggestions for future research. Lastly, the appendix provides a detailed overview of the methods followed for the experiments described in this thesis. It provides not only a comprehensive description of the techniques that had been followed, but provides information concerning the care taken with the animals (i. e. post-surgery) in order to control for the potential influence of experimental variables on the results...|$|R
