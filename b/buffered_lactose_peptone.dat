40|$|The {{object of}} this paper was to study the minimum tempera-ture of {{fermentation}} separately from that for growth, and to explain, if possible, the cause for a minimum temperature. Since both these life functions are chemical reactions, they should continue, though at a greatly reduced speed, until the medium freezes solid. This is certainly not always the case with the growth of bacteria; most of them completely cease to grow at temperatures 5 to 10 or more degrees above the freezing point. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH A first set of experiments was carried out with the technique used by Rahn (1932 p. 134) using Streptococcus lactis, S. fecalis, S. glycerinaceus, S. cremoris, S. liquefaciens, S. mastitidis and LactobaciUus acidophilus. The bacteria were cultivated at 30 'C. in a heavily <b>buffered</b> <b>lactose</b> broth (for the Lactobacillus, tomato juice was added). After twenty-four to thirty-six hours, the cultures were neutralized and centrifuged. The bacterial sedi-ment, after being cooled to the desired temperature, was sus-pended in sterile milk of the same temperature., This series demonstrated the influence of low temperature upon fermentation, independent of growth. Some of the results are given in figure 1. I It was intended to make the inoculum so large that no multiplication would take place, but with Lactobacillus and S. glycerinaceus, this aim was not accom-plished as the frequent plate counts revealed.

Since growth and acid production by lactic streptococci are dependent on their ability to metabolize lactose, the enzymes β-galactosidase, which hydrolyizes lactose, and galactoside-permease, which is responsible for the entry and intracellular accumulation of lactose, were also studied. From Streptococcus lactis C 2, a fast strain which produced sufficient acid to coagulate sterile nonfat milk in 18 hours at 21 C, a slow mutant was isolated which required incubation for at least 48 hours to effect coagulation. Nonfat milk cultures of these two organisms were compared to find causes for the reduced acid production by the slow strain. These two bacteria had the same generation time (1. 4 hours) in the exponential growth phase, and produced the same amount of acid per cell. The average viable population of the fast culture after 18 hours at 21 C, however, was about four times as great as the slow. Also, the fast culture was four times more proteolytic in nonfat milk than the slow. The slow organism appeared to have lost its capacity to synthesize proteolytic enzymes. Tryptic and pancreatic hydroysates of casein stimulated acid production in milk by the slow and fast strains; acid hydrolyized casein was not an effective stimulant. There was, therefore, a direct relationship between available nitrogen, in the form of peptides, and total growth and acid production in milk. Acid development in milk by the fast strain was also enhanced by adenine, hypoxanthine, adenosine, or inosine. Therefore, there appeared also to be a relationship between the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes in the fast strain and the availability of purine bases or nucleosides. The slow strain, however, having lost its ability to synthesize proteolytic enzymes, derived no benefit from these nucleic acid derivatives. Synthesis of β-galactosidase by several strains of lactic streptococci was induced by lactose. The rate of hydrolysis of orthonitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside was used to measure enzyme activity. The enzyme of all but one strain was unstable when whole cells were sonicated or treated with toluene; the enzyme of one strain, Streptococcus lactis 7962, was stable to these treatments, which resulted in at least a five-fold increase in activity over that found in whole cells. The optimal assay conditions for toluene-treated cells of this strain were 37 C and pH 7. 0 in sodium phosphate <b>buffer.</b> <b>Lactose</b> was the most effective inducer of enzyme synthesis. Methyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and galactose were also inducers of the enzyme, but were not as effective as lactose. Melibiose, maltose, calcium lactobionate, and glucose were poor inducers of enzyme synthesis. Exogenously supplied glucose repressed induced β-galactosidase synthesis; galactose only slightly inhibited induced enzyme synthesis. Lactose-C¹⁴ uptake by S. lactis 7962 was mediated by a β-galactoside-permease. Synthesis of this enzyme was induced by lactose. Maltose induced synthesis of this enzyme, but less effectively than lactose. Glucose was not an inducer. Glucose also repressed synthesis of induced β-galactoside-permease. The means of control of induced β-galactosidase and β-galactoside-permease synthesis in S. lactis was similar to that in Escherichia coli...|$|R
30|$|To {{test the}} effect of {{different}} carbon and nitrogen sources like glucose, <b>lactose,</b> yeast extract, <b>peptone</b> and beef extract on production of antimicrobial peptides, 0.5 % of each of them added to minimal medium with following composition (g/l): Na 2 HPO 4.2 H 2 O, 7.9; KH 2 PO 4, 3.0; NaCl, 0.5; NH 4 Cl, 1.0; pH 7.2. The antimicrobial peptides production was measured as zone of inhibition against indicator strains. For the characterization of peptides, culture was grown in 1000 ml of NB using 2 l flasks to obtain large quantity of antimicrobial peptides. One percent (v/v) of overnight grown culture of SK.DU. 4 was inoculated to 1 l of NB medium and grown for 24 h on a rotary shaker at 30 °C. Subsequently cells were separated by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 20 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was mixed with 2 % (w/v) of Diaion HP- 20 (Supelco, SigmaAldrich, USA) resin and the antimicrobial peptide was eluted in methanol. Methanol was evaporated using a rota vapour (BUCHI Rota vapor R- 200), the antimicrobial peptide was redissolved in Milli-Q water and further purification was achieved through reverse phase HPLC (1260 Infinity, Agilent Technologies, USA) using a semi-preparative C 18 column (Pursuit 10 C 18 250 × 21.2 mm). Acetonitrile and 0.1 % TFA were used as mobile phase. The purified bacteriocin was tested for antimicrobial activity and applied on Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16 %)/ 6 M urea.|$|R
40|$|A direct, {{low-cost}} {{method to}} determine the concentration of lactose is an important goal with possible impact in various types of industry. in this study, a biosensor is reported that exploits the specific interaction between lactose and the enzyme beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) normally employed to process lactose into glucose and galactose for lactose-intolerant people. the biosensor was made with beta-Gal immobilized in layer-by-layer (LbL) films with the polyelectrolyte poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) and poly(vinyl sufonate) (PVS) on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode modified {{with a layer of}} Prussian Blue (PB). With an ITO/PB/(PEI/PVS) (1) (PEI/beta-Gal) (30) architecture, lactose could be determined with an amperometric method with sensitivity of 0. 31 mu A mmol(- 1) cm(- 2) and detection limit of 1. 13 mmol L- 1, which is sufficient for detecting lactose in milk and for clinical exams. Detection occurred via a cascade reaction involving glucose oxidase titrated as electrolytic solution in the electrochemical cell, while PB allowed for operation at 0. 0 V versus saturated calomel electrode, thus avoiding effects from interfering species. Sum-frequency generation spectroscopy data for the interface between the LbL film and a <b>buffer</b> containing <b>lactose</b> indicated that beta-Gal lost order, which is the first demonstration of structural effects induced by the molecular recognition interaction with lactose.

40|$|Pasteurella pestis, {{harvested}} after 24 to 30 hr {{of growth}} in a casein hydrolysate medium at 26 C, was resuspended and shaken in 3 % lactose- 0. 1 m phosphate buffer for 4 hr at the same temperature. Certain characteristics of these starved cells were {{compared with those of}} control cells. No differences in the amounts of cellular carbohydrate or lipid were detected. The concentrations of the principal free amino acids were greater in the shaken cells, except that they contained no measureable arginine, and the normally large pools of intracellular tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were reduced. Greater viable-cell counts resulted with the cells that were shaken in <b>lactose</b> <b>buffer</b> than with the control cells when each was incubated at 5 C for several weeks. However, the reduced viabilities were apparent losses caused by the formation of aggregates of cells. The clumping of cells was caused by the polymerization of extracellular nucleic acids, principally deoxyribonucleic acid, that were excreted by the cells. Cell clumping could be partially prevented by prior shaking of the suspended cells, which removed some of the deleterious material, or by the action of crystalline deoxyribonuclease...|$|R

Bacteriol. 84 : 217 – 227. 1962. —Germinated conidia of Neurospora crassa {{suspended in}} <b>buffer</b> take up <b>lactose,</b> and this uptake {{can be attributed}} to the intracellular accumulation and to the metabolism of lactose. The former process predominates initially, and the latter after a few hours of incubation. The accumulation of lactose appears to be mediated by a very specific transport system, which can bring about intracellular concentrations that greatly exceed the external concentration of lactose. Both the influx and efflux of lactose appear to be dependent on metabolic energy, since azide and low temperature inhibit these events. The steroid hormone 11 -deoxycorticosterone also reduces the uptake and prevents the accumulation of lactose. The metabolism of lactose was clearly demonstrated, but the pathway(s) of metabolism was not defined. The amount of β-galactosidase activity extractable from the cells was insufficient to be solely responsible for the initial step in lactose metabolism. The present studies are discussed in relationship to ion permeability and lactose metabolism in N. crassa, and to galactoside permeability in Escherichia coli...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the days}} of Pasteur it has been known that under {{anaerobic}} conditions microorganisms display special powers of attacking carbohydrate molecules. As a rule, however, such observations have been made on mass cultures with {{no knowledge of the}} actual number of ceils concerned. In the ordinary routine bacteriological tests for fermentation, even the amount and type of gas produced is only conjectural since the changing reaction of the medium influences to an unknown degree its power to absorb gaseous substances and to diffuse them from its free surface into the atmosphere. Where this error has been avoided experiments have usually been conducted in closed vessels in the presence of accumulating waste products of metabolism which produce highly abnormal conditions. In other contributions from this laboratory (Walker and Winslow, 1932; Walker, Winslow, Huntington, and Mooney (1934)), data have been presented with regard to the metabolic activity of Escherichia coli in media continuously aerated with air which had previously been freed from ammonia and carbon dioxide. Simultaneous determinations of the population present made possible computations of yield per cell per hour. Such a method of cultivation presents far more favorable conditions for the study of bacterial metabolism than the ordinary procedure of growing them in closed flasks, since it removes at least the volatile waste products of their life processes. It was found, in the first study cited, that the addition of <b>lactose</b> to a <b>peptone</b> water medium caused a marked decrease in the yield of ammonia (per cell per hour) but that the yield of carbon dioxide remained substantially unaffected...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Despite {{the use of}} high {{proportions}} of the chemically undefined lipoprotein/phospholipid-rich egg-yolk in extenders, boar sperm are highly sensitive to cooling, which induces ROS generation and disrupts the plasma membrane. Here, we studied whether replacement of hen egg-yolk by commercially defined lecithin phospholipids, derived from egg (LPGE: phosphatidyl glycerol, LPCE: phosphatidyl choline) or soybean (LPCS: phosphatidyl choline), could individually ameliorate such oxidative effects during cryopreservation of ejaculated (sperm rich fraction, SRF) or of cauda-epididymal sperm, retrieved post-mortem from the same males. Methods: A conventional extender (<b>lactose</b> <b>buffer,</b> with 20 % egg-yolk, 0. 5 % OEP and 3 % glycerol) was used as control. Cryodamage was assessed as loss of sperm motility, membrane and acrosome intactness, early membrane destabilization changes, mitochondrial potential, superoxide and ROS production, to finally determine lipid peroxidation (LPO) using specific probes. Results and conclusion: In general, the exogenous phospholipids assayed were unable of maintaining neither sperm motility nor viability post-thaw compared to controls, owing to increased ROS production and lipid peroxidation. In our study, mitochondrial superoxide production resulted in very high levels for all groups, whereas both ROS production and lipid peroxidation were reduced in the control group, containing emulsified hen egg yolk. Further studies using various dosage and combination of LPCS should be followed for their eventual protective effect.
