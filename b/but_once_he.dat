5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> took office, {{he had to}} come down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E

25|$|Richardson et al. {{provide the}} example of {{behavioral}} therapy and psychodynamic therapy. If a therapist wanted {{to understand how the}} world affects his clients, he might integrate behavioral therapy into his practice. <b>But,</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> wanted to understand the inner dynamics of the psyche, he would have to integrate psychodynamic therapy in with behavioral therapy. The problem is that psychodynamic therapy says human suffering is caused by the conflicts and turmoil within the inner psyche while behavioral therapy says that human suffering is caused by external stimuli, reinforcement, and other forms of conditioning. These two theories are in direct contradiction to each other.|$|E

25|$|At St Lawrence Ground, Kent Spitfires inflicted a loss on Scottish Saltires, their seventh {{successive}} {{loss in the}} National League, as the Scottish bowlers {{struggled with}} containing Kent's batsmen and few Scottish batsmen made it into double figures. Lacking all-rounder Ryan Watson and economical bowler Paul Hoffmann, Scotland were in trouble from the outset, and Kent made 259 for 4 in their 45 overs. South Africans Andrew Hall and Justin Kemp made fifties, the latter an unbeaten 65 off 47 deliveries including four sixes. Jonathan Beukes offered some resistance with 35 for the Scots, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> was caught and bowled by James Tredwell Scotland lost the last six wickets for 32 runs, ending all out for 115.

Li Mi's general Xu Shiji, who controlled a major part of Li Mi's former territory, also submitted, and Emperor Gaozu, impressed with Xu's faithfulness to Li Mi, bestowed the imperial surname of Li on Xu. Gaozu created Li Mi the Duke of Xing, but only made him the Minister of Feasts, a post that Li Mi viewed as below his stature. Around New Year 619, Li Mi requested Emperor Gaozu's permission to head east to persuade some of his former subordinates to submit to Tang, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> left Chang'an, planned to restore his independence.

25|$|Wicked Priest: The Wicked Priest is the Teacher of Righteousness's main opponent, {{who also}} sought to kill the Teacher of Righteousness. The {{identity}} of the Wicked Priest is more clear {{than that of the}} Teacher of Righteousness, with scholars suggesting that he was a Hasmonean high priest such as Jonathan and Alexander Jannaeus. The Wicked Priest is referenced the most in the Commentary on Habukkuk, which states that the Wicked Priest was originally reliable, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> became ruler he forsook God for riches and rebelled against God and committed abhorrent deeds. In the Commentary on the Psalms, the Wicked Priest sought to kill the Teacher of Righteousness for sending a law to him, some scholars have suggested that this law was 4QMMT. If the Wicked Priest was in fact Jonathan Jannaeus, then he met his own end in 142 B.C.E at the hands of Diodotus Tryphon, which would match well with the Habakkuk Commentary that comments on the terrible end met by the Wicked Priest.|$|E

25|$|Faisalabad Wolves {{overcame the}} reigning English Twenty20 Cup champions Somerset Sabres {{thanks to the}} all-round efforts of Mohammad Hafeez. Opening the batting, he hit six sixes and six fours in a 35-ball 79, and helped by the 17 extras and 40 from Ijaz Ahmed junior, the Pakistani club made 207 for 5. Arul Suppiah took one wicket and conceded five runs for Somerset in his lone over, but was still taken off, {{possibly}} due to the two wides he bowled. Somerset needed 10.35 off every over, and they took ten off the first, but wicket-keeper Carl Gazzard had to retire hurt and Wood was caught by Hafeez, leaving the score at 31 for 2 (effectively, counting Gazzard's retirement as a wicket) with Ian Blackwell at the crease. He took 14 fours and two sixes in a 48-ball 82, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>he</b> departed {{the remainder of the}} batting order failed {{to keep up with the}} asking rate of nearly twelve an over.
