Most users enjoy fast download of heavy pages, and the experience of using the web is highly visual. The mobile Internet, e. g. WAP or i-Mode, provides a considerably more limited environment for Internet usage. Although <b>bigger</b> <b>colour</b> <b>displays</b> are rapidly becoming more common with mobile devices, the network bandwidth still is limited. An interesting question for the mobile Internet site developers is: What is more important for the mobile Internet users, a graphical user interface with images, or quick download times? Users are used to have both of these on the fixed web, but in the mobile Internet, you need to select one or the other. Nokia Research Center conducted usability tests where we found that quick download time is more important than visual look of pages when it comes to subjective satisfaction of the users. ...|$|R

Most notably the Forte has 16GB of [...] "flash play" [...] sample memory used for brand new piano, electric piano and clavinet samples. The same [...] "German D" [...] piano from the Artis is available in the Forte, but far more extensively sampled. The Forte adds two more dynamic layers, and string resonance. By comparison, the German D piano is 128MB in size on the Artis, and 4GB on the Forte. On top of the [...] "German D" [...] the Forte features a [...] "Japanese Grand", which is a sampled Yamaha C7 grand piano, also 4GB in size. Other features are a bigger sound library, bigger effects library, a <b>bigger,</b> full <b>colour</b> <b>display,</b> and more.|$|R

40|$|The bright colours of {{feathers}} {{are among the}} most striking displays in nature and are frequently used as sexual signals. Feathers can be coloured by pigments or by ordered tissue, and these mechanisms have traditionally been treated as distinct modes of display. Here we show that some yellow plumage colour is created both by reflection of light from white structural tissue and absorption of light by carotenoids. Thus, structural components {{of feathers}} contribute substantially to yellow ‘carotenoid’ displays, but the effect of variation in structural components on variation in <b>colour</b> <b>displays</b> is, to our knowledge, unstudied. The presence of structural colour in some carotenoid-based <b>colour</b> <b>displays</b> will have to be considered in studies of colour signalling...|$|R

40|$|Combinations of {{microstructural}} and pigmentary {{components of}} barbs create the <b>colour</b> <b>displays</b> of feathers. It follows that evolutionary changes in <b>colour</b> <b>displays</b> must reflect {{changes in the}} underlying production mechanisms, but rarely have the mechanisms of feather colour evolution been studied. Among bluebirds in the genus Sialia, male rump colour varies among species from dark blue to light blue while breast colour varies from blue to rusty. We use spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier analysis to identify the morphology responsible for these divergent <b>colour</b> <b>displays.</b> The morphology of blue rump barbs is similar among the three species, with an outer keratin cortex layer surrounding a medullary ‘spongy layer’ and a basal row of melanin granules. A spongy layer is also present in blue breast barbs of mountain bluebirds Sialia currucoides and in rusty breast barbs of western Sialia mexicana and eastern bluebirds Sialia sialis. In blue barbs melanin is basal to the spongy layer, but is not present in the outer cortex or spongy layer, while in rusty barbs, melanin is present only in the cortex. The placement of melanin in the cortex masks expression of structural blue, creating a rusty display. Such shifts in microstructures and pigments may be widespread mechanisms for the evolutionary changes in the colours of feathers and other reflective structures across colourful organisms...|$|R
