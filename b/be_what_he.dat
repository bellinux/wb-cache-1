5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

500|$|For this game, Dante {{was made}} young, {{consumed}} by hatred and inexperienced {{resulting in a}} fighting style similar to a street brawler rather {{than that of a}} skilled swordsman. As a result of the reboot's theme being [...] "rebellion" [...] most of Dante's actions are based around it. Antoniades stated that Dante is about [...] "being cool and making you feel cool when you're playing it," [...] and, as such, they felt that his attire from previous games would be found comical. Antoniades added he felt the classic Dante was not appealing anymore and when comparing the new Dante with the title character from Bayonetta he did not see her style to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted for the reboot. Antoniades responded to criticism stating they would not change it as it is supposed to fit within the game's setting. Additionally, he stated he would have liked this Dante in response to the criticism.|$|E
500|$|The eighth {{song and}} second {{instrumental}} on Why Should the Fire Die?, [...] "Stumptown", {{was written by}} Chris Thile. The song was written {{as a tribute to}} Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Chris Thile's favorite coffee house in the world. [...] "Stumptown" [...] is also the album's shortest song, at one minute and forty three seconds. [...] "Anthony", the ninth track, is the only song recorded by Nickel Creek that was written solely by Sara Watkins. [...] "Anthony", which features a ukulele melody, was described by several critics to be [...] "old-timey". One of three Thile-Watkins-Watkins composed pieces on the album, [...] "Best Of Luck" [...] was the tenth track on Why Should the Fire Die?. Sara Watkins had the lead vocal for [...] "Best Of Luck", and was complimented by critics for her [...] "snippy" [...] and [...] "assertive" [...] vocal. prefix Magazine pegged the song to be the formula that makes [...] "this album, and trio, unstoppable". The eleventh track, [...] "Doubting Thomas", was written by Chris Thile and is named after Doubting Thomas, a biblical term. All the members of Nickel Creek came from devout Christian families, and the song is about questioning faith. The third and final instrumental, [...] "First and Last Waltz", is Why Should the Fire Die?s twelfth track. One of the three songs written by all of Nickel Creek's members, it comes before the penultimate track, [...] "Helena". At Nickel Creek's concerts, the song was played as a segue into [...] "Helena". The album recording of [...] "First And Last Waltz" [...] has been called a [...] "chilly effects-draped recital piece", due to its use of sound effects. [...] "Helena", the penultimate track, was written by Chris Thile. Producer Eric Valentine provided drumming duties for this song. Thile described the track to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered [...] "the ultimate climax" [...] of Why Should the Fire Die?, and some contemporary critics found the song to be the highlight of the album. [...] The final song on Why Should the Fire Die?, the title track, is a slow waltz. PopMatters described the song as being [...] "gorgeously sung", but [...] "an odd choice to conclude a record that is so often bidding for the true fun of pop music".|$|E
500|$|On October 27, Increase Mather {{recorded}} his {{one and only}} diary entry for all of 1683: [...] "Randolph arrived at Boston." [...] Phips quickly began to provide {{a show of force}} for Randolph by insisting other ships strike their colors and firing across their bows if they did not. [...] Knepp claims that Narborough did not condone this, and many historians have followed his lead in treating Phips' activities in Boston harbor as arrogant showboating, but it seems clear from the letters of Randolph and Blathwayt [...] that Phips was not doing this merely for some explosive fun. Phips cites personal instructions from the King and indeed Charles II was known to have insisted on a salute to his flag. As Phips was creating chaos for the Massachusetts government, he continued to pursue his original intention of gathering diving equipment and divers to take to the Bahamas. Phips later followed the same procedures of requiring ships to strike in the West Indies and with a new crew in Bermuda. Phips lack of experience in the Royal Navy would suggest he likely made mistakes and did not always go about this procedure in the best way. It must have been a strange and uncomfortable chore for someone whose loyalties were with Boston (in '76 the records show initiated the building of a house in Boston). Randolph was never one to withhold criticism, but he did not complain of Phips activities in Boston harbor that winter and Randolph even seems to have assisted Phips by searching a ship for him. [...] But choosing a threatening posture showed Randolph's inability to understand the New England character and it did not produce the effect Randolph intended. The magistrates voted to submit to the crown, but the deputies resisted. [...] Phips and the Rose became a focal point for the resistance, as Knepp dutifully recorded without understanding the subtext: [...] "Phips crew say that they would as soon fire against this town as against Algiers and called us rebels," [...] is one deposition Knepp records though Knepp seems to believe he is merely recording a barroom brawl. [...] "...one of the constables in particular told him that he thought Capt. Phips had been a town born child, Captain Phips answering him, 'Let him <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would, he had been sworn at sixteen years of age to be true to the King and his government." [...] (As if in an act of delayed vengeance, HMS Rose would be boarded and de-masted, and its captain John George imprisoned, less than six years later during the Boston Revolution.) ...|$|E

His third textbook was Recombinant DNA, which described the ways in which genetic engineering has brought much new information about how organisms function. The textbooks are still in print.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dialogue}} is much dismissed {{because it seems}} to recommend clever evil over witless evil. This is not the real point, however.

2500|$|Prior to {{the death}} of Joseph Smith, the First Presidency had made nearly all the major {{decisions}} and led the Church of Christ both naturally and spiritually. [...] On June 1, 1841, Sidney Rigdon had been ordained by Joseph Smith as a [...] "Prophet, Seer and Revelator"—which was one of the same ecclesiastical titles held by Smith. The Church of Jesus Christ maintains that as First Counselor to Smith, Rigdon should naturally have been the leader of the church after Smith's death. With this understanding, The Church of Jesus Christ actively opposes the opinion that the Quorum of Twelve had the right to lead the church. The Church of Jesus Christ argues that Rigdon should have been allowed to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> claimed to be— a [...] "guardian" [...] over the church until proper proceedings could decide the next president— and that proceedings which resulted in Brigham Young leading the church constituted a procedural violation.|$|E
