Additionally, it is of special concern that PFOA biomagnifies in endangered species or vulnerable populations as shown by the findings of PFOA in polar bears.

Therefore, PFOA is considered to fulfill the PBT-criteria as defined in REACH. Because of the dissociation of PFOA as well as APFO under environmental conditions the results for PFOA can be transferred to APFO. Hence, APFO fulfills the REACH PBT-criteria, too.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that in addition to narcosis certain chemicals in crude oils and refined petroleum products may induce specific modes of action, such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonism. The risks these toxic compounds pose to organisms depend on internal exposure levels, as driven by the chemicals' bioaccumulation potential. Information on this potential however is lacking, as the chemicals' identity mostly is unknown. This study showed that AhR agonists bioaccumulate from oil-spiked sediments into aquatic worms and persist in the worms for at least several weeks. Chemical fractionations of eight pure oils into saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA), followed by effect-directed analyses using in vitro reporter gene assays revealed that the agonists predominantly are aromatic and resin-like chemicals. Some of the compounds were easily metabolized in vitro, while others were resistant to biotransformation. HPLC-assisted hydrophobicity profiling subsequently indicated that the AhR-active chemicals had a high to extremely high bioaccumulation potential, considering their estimated logK(ow) values of 4 to > 10. Most of the AhR agonism, however, was assigned to compounds with logK(ow) of 5 - 8. These compounds were present mainly in the mid to high boiling point fractions of the oils (C(14) -C(32) alkane range), which are usually not being considered (the most) toxic in current risk assessment. The fractionations further revealed considerable oil and fraction-dependent antagonism in pure oils and SARA fractions. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that crude oils and refined petroleum products contain numerous compounds that can activate the AhR and which because of their likely persistence and extremely high bioaccumulation potential could be potential PBT (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic) or vPvB (very persistent and very <b>bioaccumulative)</b> <b>substance</b> candidates. Many chemicals were identified by GC-MS, but the responsible individual compounds could not be exactly identified in the complex mixtures of thousands of compounds.

Here we show that poorly metabolizable, moderately hydrophobic substances with a KOW between 100 and 100, 000, which do not biomagnify (that is, increase in chemical concentration in organisms with increasing trophic level) in aquatic food webs, can biomagnify to a high degree in food webs containing air-breathing animals (including humans) because of their high octanol-air partition coefficient (KOA) and corresponding low rate of respiratory elimination to air.

The proposed framework is such that it is compatible to the current EIF risk assessment models that are used in the Norwegian offshore oil and gas industry. The risk assessment approach selected for this framework is based on the use of critical body residues (CBR); i. e., body-tissue concentrations above which adverse effects are expected. A three-tiered risk assessment approach is distinguished: tier 1 for worst-case screening purposes; tier 2 based on probabilistic risk assessment using species sensitivity distributions and tier 3 focusing on population modelling for specific species. The latter tier is, because of its specific characteristics, not elaborated in detail. It is proposed to use a food-chain accumulation model to translate species sensitivity thresholds on the basis of CBR into external threshold concentrations, those external thresholds could then be used to either derive an ecosystem PNEC (tier I) or Species Sensitivity Distribution (tier II).

40|$|The report {{provides}} the PBT {{assessment of the}} substance 5 tert butyl 2, 4, 6 trinitro-m-xylene (musk xylene). It has been prepared by The Netherlands {{in the frame of}} Council Regulation (EEC) No. 793 / 93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances, following the principles for assessment of the risks to humans and the environment, laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1488 / 94. In 2005 the environmental risk assessment for musk xylene concluded that there was a need for further information and/or testing because the substance {{is considered to be a}} PBT candidate chemical and a further PBT ¿ testing strategy was proposed. Conclusion regarding persistency: the extractable part of musk xylene in sediment is subject to anaerobic degradation with half-lives of equal to or below 60 days. Musk xylene is therefore considered to be not persistent in sediment. In this assessment the observed irreversible binding to sediment is considered as dissipation. Given the fact that the metabolites in the ocean die-away test stayed in the water phase while the parent compound musk xylene volatilized and the fact that the ratio metabolites : parent compound was still close to one after 159 days, it is concluded that the half-life for biodegradation in seawater is more than 150 days, which significantly exceeds the criterion of 60 days. Musk xylene is therefore considered to be very persistent in water. Conclusion regarding bioaccumulation: The experimental bioaccumulation studies for musk xylene in fish showed a wide range of BCFs, among which values above the vB criterion of 5, 000 l/kg. Based on the evaluation of the critical study and its results it can be concluded that musk xylene is very bioaccumulative. Conclusion regarding toxicity: there is no substantiated evidence that musk xylene can cause endocrine disrupting effects. However, musk xylene is classified as Carcinogenic Category 3), although it is realised that it is a borderline case. The overall conclusion for musk xylene is that regarding toxicity it is considered to be a borderline case. However, in view of the vPvB properties of musk xylene, no additional testing is required. It is concluded in the Addendum that musk xylene is a very persistent and very <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>substance</b> and is considered to be borderline T.

40|$|Whole {{effluent}} assessments (WEA) {{are being}} investigated as potential tools for controlling aqueous industrial discharges and minimizing environmental impact. The present study investigated how toxicity {{and the presence}} of potentially <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>substances</b> altered when refinery effluents were subjected to biodegradation tests. Three petrochemical effluents were assessed, two freshwater and one saline, and subjected to two different types of biodegradation tests, resembling either a ready style (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) -die away) or an inherent style (Zahn-Wellens) test and the toxicity and potential to bioaccumulate parameters were re-analysed during and after biodegradation. A high proportion of the potentially <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>substances</b> (PBS) in these effluents was easily biodegradable. Biodegradation not only lowered the PBS concentration but also toxicity. Appropriate controls are required however, as some increases in toxicity were observed after 4 h. In the present study, six other petrochemical effluents were also assessed for their PBS content and toxicity to increase the understanding of the relationship between PBS and toxicity. The results showed that the PBS concentrations in these samples were lower than the estimated benchmarks of acute toxicity for algae, fish and crustacean, although two samples were above the critical PBS values for chronic narcotic toxicity for Daphnia magna, which support the assumption that narcotic effects are mainly responsible for the observed toxicity in refinery effluents. It can be concluded that for facilities processing petroleum products that the measurement of PBS is a suitable surrogate for toxicity tests at the screening stage.

In a water environment they usually accumulate in sediments, which makes them resistant to biodegradation processes induced by, e. g., the UV light.

The trends of mercury serve as a mirror of the industrial changes in Eastern Germany. A comparison with other sample specimens further emphasizes its usefulness in biomagnification studies. The p,p'-DDE concentrations demonstrate the diverse application history of the insecticide pp'-DDT, as well as the high persistency of this transformation product. Furthermore the mussel's biometric parameters highlight various water body specific developments, which in turn illustrate the different developments of its living conditions in the large German river systems. In the meantime, the severely lacking sample availability at many sampling sites partially underscores these changes. Reduced nutrient availability, predatory pressure, and competition by the invasive quagga mussel, D. rostriformis, are being discussed as possible causes.

30|$|Our {{screening}} criteria used for LRTP {{are based on}} two different concepts: On the one hand, we refer {{to the definition of}} the Stockholm Convention which states that a substance will ‘migrate [] significantly through the air’ [3] if its atmospheric oxidation half-life exceeds 2 days. This criterion alone, however, does not consider the environmental distribution and degradation behaviour in various compartments. In Annex D of the Stockholm Convention, it is thus complemented by additional conditions with regard to ‘environmental fate properties and/or model results that demonstrate that the chemical has a potential for long-range environmental transport’. Therefore, we also consider the well-acknowledged concept of the characteristic travel distance (CTD) as a screening criterion for the identification of compounds with LRTP which is investigated in parallel to the half-life criterion. The CTD is calculated by the multimedia model ELPOS [21]. This approach {{is based on the assumption}} that compounds which show a similar CTD to the CTD of acknowledged reference chemicals for POP-like behaviour should also be considered as substances that might have LRTP [22]. In addition, each substance is cross-checked for LRTP with the available list of 120 organic high-production-volume chemicals (HPVCs) identified by Brown and Wania [8] and a list of top 28 persistent and <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>substances</b> identified by Muir and Howard [9] which all indicate to be transported to remote regions.|$|R

Solid-phase microextraction is especially capable of extracting total water concentrations {{as well as the}} freely dissolved fraction of analytes in the water phase, which is available for bioconcentration in fish.

40|$|Bioaccumulation plays a {{vital role}} in {{understanding}} the fate of a substance in the environment and is key to the regulation of chemicals in several jurisdictions. The current assessment approaches commonly use the octanol-water partition coefficient (log KOW) as an indicator for bioaccumulation and the bioconcentration factor (BCF) as a standard criterion to identify <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>substances</b> show limitations. The log KOW {{does not take into account}} active transport phenomena or special structural properties (e. g., amphiphilic substances or dissociating substances) and therefore additional screening criteria are required. Regulatory BCF studies are so far restricted to fish and uptake through the gills. Studies on (terrestrial) air-breathing organisms are missing. Though there are alternative tests such as the dietary exposure bioaccumulation fish test described in the recently revised OECD test guideline 305, it still remains unclear how to deal with results of alternative tests in regulatory decision-making processes. A substantial number of bioaccumulation fish tests are required in regulation. The development of improved test systems following the 3 R principles, namely to replace, reduce and refine animal testing, is thus required. All these aspects stress the importance to further develop the assessment of bioaccumulation. The Dessau Workshop on Bioaccumulation which was held from June 26 th to 27 th 2014, in Dessau, Germany, provided a comprehensive overview of the state of the art of bioaccumulation assessment, provided insights into the problems and challenges addressed by the regulatory authorities and described new research concepts and their regulatory implications.

40|$|Ecosystems can {{be defined}} as complex {{networks}} implying trophic relationships between species but also as functions to maintain ecosystem equilibrium. The basic paradigm in REACH or Biocides regulations or in the Water framework Directive assumed that the protection of the most sensitive species protect the structure and thus the function of the ecosystem. As the concept of the most sensitive {{does not take into account}} bioaccumulation mechanisms, this has to be completed (for <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>substances</b> only) by the study of the predator compartment, which is assumed to reach the maximum concentration. Classical method described in the ECHA guidelines targets an undefined bird or mammal as predator feeding from their usual prey: fishes and/or worms. This unspecific scenario can be perceived as very simple and the exposure of the top predator in complex ecosystem may insufficiently be captured in case of biomagnification of chemical substances. In the plant protection product area, the assessment is slightly different when considering the initial hypotheses since the risk is basically evaluated independently for each trophic levels, and the assessment of secondary poisoning is linked to the crop under consideration: including type and age of crops to identify specific targets: bird, small mammalian, of various trophic regimen. Yet, industrial chemical following sludge applications (from Sewage Treatment Plant) ends up the very same agricultural field receiving plant protection products. The present work includes a case study comparing the two assessment frameworks for a selection of substances with different bioaccumulation potential. Nevertheless, the approaches used in these regulations remain overall linked to a generic environment. They do not consider the surrounding habitats and the impact of anthropic activities on landscape modeling. In other contexts, such exposure tools that could be adapted to specific or local trophic networks are developed, including a selection of target species, its habitats and diet. These models such as Terrasys or BERISP have the option to supply information on the top predators or modify the presence of specific habitat and thus the trophic network.

Chlorine and chlorine compounds are used in the bleaching of pulp. A large number of organochlorine chemicals of widely differing properties are, or have been, produced from this bleaching. These range from the highly hydrophobic, persistent and <b>bioaccumulative</b> toxic <b>substances,</b> such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, to the higher molecular weight, non-hydrophobic material usually characterized by absorbable organic halogen. Chlorine dioxide and chlorine react with lignin by different chemical processes and produce different organochlorine products. Use of molecular chlorine as a bleaching agent results in the formation and release of chlorinated organic compounds, sometimes at concentrations that present an un-acceptable risk to the receiving environment and the food chain. Alternatives to the use of mo-lecular chlorine, such as chlorine dioxide, result in reductions in the quantities of organochlorines produced, and the degree of chlorine substitution in the organochlorines formed. This, in turn, leads to reduced persistence, reduced potential for bioaccumulation and food chain transfer, reduced toxicity and reductions in adverse ecological effects. However, sufficient evidence ex-ists from responses observed at non-bleached mills to show that other (probably non-halogen-ated) compounds are released or formed during the production of pulp and cause responses such as induction of MFOs, changes in hormone levels, and reproductive effects...|$|R

The number of individual synthetic organic chemicals produced and the total global chemical production volume are increasing. The majority of these anthropogenic chemicals are not monitored in environmental matrices nor in the indoor environment even though some are associated with undesirable consequences and the range of possible chemical impacts is still far from being fully understood. Chemicals that remain in the environment for a long time and/or distribute over a large area have high exposure potential, and will present particularly acute challenges if a currently unknown undesirable effect is discovered.   This thesis describes the development of a set of in silico methods to identify and prioritize chemicals with high exposure potential that are currently not subject to national or international restrictions. In brief, we i) compiled databases of contaminants of potential concern, ii) established models to predict key properties to fill data gaps in the absence of experimental data, and iii) developed and applied methods to screen chemicals to identify those that should be assigned high priority for future study.   Paper I delivers screening-level models to predict partition ratios of organic chemicals between polymeric materials commonly found indoors, and both air and water. These models can be used in high-throughput exposure assessment studies, passive sampling experiments, and models of emissions, fate and transport of chemicals.   Paper II presents a scoring method to prioritize 464 organic chemicals of emerging Arctic concern for their potential to fit a set of four exposure-based hazard profiles. These four profiles represent persistent organic pollutants (POPs) regulated under the Stockholm Convention, very persistent and very <b>bioaccumulative</b> <b>substances</b> (vPvBs) regulated under REACH and for two novel and unregulated profiles derived from the planetary boundary threats framework; airborne persistent contaminants (APCs) and waterborne persistent contaminants (WPCs). APCs and WPCs are chemicals that are mobile in air and water, respectively, and that contaminate the environment in a poorly reversible manner due to their persistence. The prioritization method is based on a reference set of 148 chemicals that is used to contextualize the scoring results.   Paper III describes the prioritization of 8, 648 chemicals that were reportedly produced in five OECD countries. Paper III elucidates the relationship between the elemental composition of these chemicals and the exposure-based hazard scores, and presents a strategy to disentangle overlaps among the four exposure hazard profiles by categorizing chemicals according to the spatial coverage of profiles they best fit.   Paper IV focuses on refining the prioritization method described in Papers II and III using a set of 5, 600 hypothetical chemicals. The refined method is used to prioritize the chemicals from Papers II and III, and an additional 4, 567 chemicals from the REACH database.   The in silico methods developed in this thesis can be applied to conduct screening-level exposure assessments using only chemical structures as a starting point. Substances prioritized as having high potential to be POPs, vPvB, APC, or WPC should be considered for more detailed study to unequivocally determine their identity and physicochemical properties. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Manuscript. Paper 4 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
50|$|Information {{disclosure}} {{gives an}} opportunity to the public to immediately react and avoid exposure to potential chemical hazards and risks for example by changing consumer behavior or applying pressure on the chemical firms etc. In the other hand, information disclosure also can motivate firms to search for safer alternatives. TSCA allows companies to claim their precise chemical volumes, components, chemical uses, and essentially any information provided to the EPA as business confidential except in the cases that chemical need health and safety studies. In this extent of TSCA, the EPA’ s ability is restricted to share information including the company’s identities, the chemical’s structures to any public groups except the designated contractors, or to law enforcement officials. It {{is important that the}} state and local environmental non-governmental agencies, environmental advocates and other public groups in obtaining chemical information in order to develop contingency plans and effective emergency responses in cases of highly toxic exposures. However, the EPA can only disclose confidential business information when it determines such disclosure is necessary to protect human health or the environment from an unreasonable risk. Similar to TSCA, REACH mandates chemical companies to disclosure of health and safety information that allows public to have an access to the basic chemical information, including brief profiles of hazardous properties, authorized uses, and risk management measures. Also one of the main strength of REACH is in {{the extent to which the}} government intends to make the public receive as much as information possible, including identification of substances of a very high concern that are subject to authorization. REACH considers the full chemical composition, the preparation, the precise use, the detailed function or application of the chemical, the precise tonnage or volume of the chemical manufactured or placed on the market and the relationships between manufacturers, importers and downstream users as confidential for the industry’s economic purpose. PBTs (<b>Bioaccumulative</b> and Toxic <b>Substances)</b> and vPvB (Very Persistent and Very <b>Bioaccumulative</b> and Toxic <b>Substances),</b> and other chemicals that are classified as dangerous, REACH requires firms to submit safety data sheet. Therefore, the downstream users, manufacturers, retailers and importers will have the information they need to safely use and handle the chemicals. Unlike TSCA, REACH can share the firm’s chemical information with state, government authorities and EU organizations under an agreement between the firm and the other responsible parties.|$|R
