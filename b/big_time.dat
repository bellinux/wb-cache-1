5|$|The {{road race}} {{stages in the}} Netherlands were both marred by {{repeated}} crashes, which led to some unexpected <b>big</b> <b>time</b> gaps before the transfer to Italy. The overall standings were very turbulent in the first week, with four different riders holding the race leader's pink jersey. The 11th stage greatly re-shaped the overall standings, when several riders, including Sastre, gained almost 13minutes against {{the remainder of the}} field. Porte took the pink jersey after this stage. Two days later, Arroyo took the jersey, and kept it for five days. He eventually lost it to Basso on the first of two very difficult mountain stages to close out the Giro. Success was fairly widespread among the Giro's 22teams, as 17 of them came away with either a stage win, classification win, or stint in the pink jersey.|$|E

5|$|At Shores Christian Academy, Clinkscales {{became a}} top {{player on the}} {{basketball}} team, averaging 21 points and 12 assists during his senior year. On January 3, 2004, he recorded 24 points and eight assists, including a layup with four seconds left in regulation, to defeat Trinity Catholic by one point. In another contest that month, Clinkscales notched 31 points and 11 assists in a triple-overtime loss to Gainesville High School, the top-ranked team at the Diamondback Challenge tournament. In the Florida Christian Athletic League's south quarterfinals, he posted 40 points and 14 assists to beat Ocala Word of Faith by a 100–32 margin. In the district title contest, he put up 26 points, 15 assists, six rebounds, and three steals. Clinkscales' team won the National Association of Christian Athletes championship behind a 36-win season, and he was named the Ocala Star-Banner boys' basketball player of the year. Despite his success at Ocala, the low competition level prevented him from drawing national attention. However, {{he was in the}} spotlight playing for the Atlanta Celtics, an Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) program made up of players such as Dwight Howard, Josh Smith, and Randolph Morris. He joined the team because they required a reliable point guard. The Celtics won the Adidas <b>Big</b> <b>Time</b> Tournament, sparking coaches' interest in him once again. Basketball news website The Hoop Scoop named Clinkscales the 47th-best high school player in his class as he entered college. He was rated a three-star recruit by both Rivals.com and 247Sports.com.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we proceed with {{investigation}} of connections between Fokker-Planck equation and continuum mechanics. We base upon expressions from our work [2], {{based upon the}} spectral decomposition of Fokker- Planck equation solution. In this decomposition we preserve only terms with the smallest degrees of damping. We find, that macroscopic parameters of Fokker-Planck flows, obtained in this way, satisfy the set of conservation laws of classic hydrodynamics. The expression for stresses (30) contains additional term- this term is negligible in <b>big</b> <b>times</b> limit. We proved also, that the velocities field alone satisfy Burgers equation without mass forces- but with some additional term. This term is also negligible in <b>big</b> <b>times</b> limit. For the zero degree theory, considered in [1], there are no additional terms. But this theory is valid only for the potential velocities field, fully deductible from density- the potential is proportional to density logarithm. In this theory we can not specify initial conditions for velocities independently from density. Taking in account of the next degree terms could partly solve this problem, but result in some loss of exactness...|$|R
