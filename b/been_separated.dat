5|$|A. m. croceum:The Santa Cruz long-toed {{salamander}} (A. m. croceum) is most {{closely related to}} the 'coastal' or 'western' subspecies. This conclusion is the most parsimonious biogeographic explanation with nearest populations of A. m. macrodactylum separated by approximately 300km across the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California. The isolated endemic populations are listed as an endangered subspecies. Based on the biogeography and molecular clock calibrations, this subspecies may have <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> from the remainder of the distribution since the Miocene, molecular clock calibrations estimating 13.9 million years of separation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{individual}} {{known as}} Captain Haddock {{had lived in}} this period, who had commanded a fire ship, the Anne and Christopher. It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> from their squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at Málaga to purchase goods that could be taken back to Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, Haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where {{he was ordered to}} forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months.|$|E

5|$|Blackburn's other accomplishments {{included}} {{establishing a}} state railroad commission and reorganizing the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College. Kentucky A had <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> from Kentucky University under Blackburn's predecessor, James B. McCreary; Blackburn now advocated {{that it be}} put {{under the control of}} and supported by the state. This was done, and the rechartered institution, located at Lexington, became known commonly as the State College; in 1916, it was renamed the University of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of sibling species, species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> for millions of years. A paramount example of evolutionary stasis is the fern Osmunda claytoniana. Based on paleontological evidence it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due {{to leave}} the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother's sister—who lived in nearby Edgbaston, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham {{building}} firm. This arrangement lasted {{only a few months}} before Horatio, impatient to be reunited with his sister from whom he had <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.|$|E

5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> into three {{varieties}} (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or peridium) and spores. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated. This study and others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect {{the development of these}} characteristics.|$|E
5|$|M. c. ashbyi, {{described}} by Mathews in 1912, is found on Kangaroo Island, and has <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> {{from the mainland}} subspecies for around 9000 years. Birds of this subspecies are larger, have narrower bills and darker plumage than birds on nearby mainland South Australia. Females from Kangaroo Island are more uniformly grey in plumage than mainland birds.|$|E
5|$|Panchayati Raj now covers {{almost all}} states and Union territories. One-third {{of the total}} number of seats have been {{reserved}} for women in Panchayats at every level; in the case of Bihar, half the seats have been reserved for women.

5|$|She and Sanjaya {{divorced}} on 14 October 2009, {{after having}} <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> for several months; {{towards the end}} of their relationship, Sanjaya spent more time in Bali than in the couple's home in Jakarta. Mambo was romantically involved with the association football player Febrianto Wijaya, and they considered marrying. The relationship, however, fell through, and in 2013 Mambo married Steve Wantania, a music-video maker in the United States. The couple have two children, a daughter Queen Chara born in June 17, 2015 and a son King Luke born in August 17, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Seven Days Battles, Lee's {{forces had}} <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> and {{scattered}} due to swamps, narrow roads and other geographic obstacles, and occasionally due to unclear orders. As {{the days of}} marching and fighting wore {{on the number of}} stragglers swelled to fill narrow roads and significantly deplete the Confederate ranks, presenting a significant additional strain on their combat readiness. These hindrances continued during the Battle of Malvern Hill, with both Magruder and Huger making mistakes in the deployment of their forces.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Julio quickly {{weakened}} over land, {{although it}} initially maintained strong convection near its center. By early on August 26, however, the low-level and upper-level circulations separated, with the upper-circulation continuing quickly northeastward into mainland Mexico; the low-level circulation slowed as it entered the Gulf of California, after having <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> from its deep convection. Later in the day, the NHC discontinued advisories {{after the storm}} failed to maintain enough organized convection {{to be considered a}} tropical cyclone.The remnants of Julio were absorbed by a thermal low over the Mojave Desert on August 27.|$|E

5|$|Two other Chroogomphus {{species with}} a {{morphology}} and coloration similar to C.vinicolor include C.rutilus and C.ochraceous. C.vinicolor is most reliably distinguished from these {{on the basis}} of having thick-walled cystidia (up to 5–7.5μm at the widest part). The other two species have <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> {{on the basis of}} color, with C.ochraceous having brighter colors (yellowish-orange to ochraceous) than C.rutilus. Molecular analyses of European and North American collections suggest that C.rutilus is restricted to Europe, C.ochraceous only occurs in North America, and that cap coloration cannot be reliably used for species determination.|$|E
5|$|Working with Edward W. Washburn {{from the}} Bureau of Standards, Urey {{subsequently}} discovered {{the reason for}} the anomalous sample. Brickwedde's hydrogen had <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> from water by electrolysis, resulting in depleted sample. Moreover, Francis William Aston now reported that his calculated value for the atomic weight of hydrogen was wrong, thereby invalidating Birge and Menzel's original reasoning. The discovery of deuterium stood, however.|$|E
5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a marbled newt, {{shows that the}} genus already existed {{at that time and}} contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the split between the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have <b>been</b> <b>separated</b> for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E
50|$|The Philippine Sea {{is by the}} Philippines and Taiwan to the west, Japan to the north, the Marianas to {{the east}} and Palau to the south.
