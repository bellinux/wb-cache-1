The conductive section may be of carbon, metal or a material coated with either of these materials, and heating may come from directly or inductively applied electrical power. During temporary shut-down for thermal sterilisation, flow of air or liq. is maintained through an identical <b>back-up</b> <b>filter.</b> ADVANTAGE - Filter maintaining pure air supply for long periods can be sterilised without preliminary disassembly...|$|E
40|$|Inland {{atmospheric}} aerosols were sampled {{by members}} of JARE- 29 (1988 - 1989) using a modified Andersen type cascade impacter, which consists of 12 impacter stages and a <b>back-up</b> <b>filter</b> and can fractionate aerosol particles down to 0. 04 micron. MSA (methane sulfonic acid) and nssSO_ 4 showed their maximum in size distribution at 0. 2 - 0. 3 micron. Their distribution curves run parallel with similar trend and strongly suggest their same or closely related origin. Na has its maximum at 0. 6 - 0. 7 micron; its marine origin is indicated by the similar trend of Mg and also by the Mg/Na ratio close to that in seawater. Therefore, MSA and nssSO_ 4 ratio {{at the peak of}} size distribution was at nearly 0. 1,which is higher than 0. 2 over the Antarctic sea and at Syowa Station, and suggests their supply from a warmer low-latitude sea area...|$|E

40|$|After {{more than}} ten years of {{operation}} of the EPIC camera on board the X-ray observatory XMM-Newton, we have reviewed the status of its Thin and Medium filters by performing both laboratory measurements on <b>back-up</b> <b>filters,</b> and analysis of data collected in-flight. We have selected a set of Thin and Medium <b>back-up</b> <b>filters</b> among those still available in the EPIC consortium, and have started a program to investigate their status by different laboratory measurements including: UV/VIS transmission, X-ray transmission, RAMAN IR spectroscopy, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and Atomic Force Microscopy.

40|$|We are {{conducting}} a measurement program on <b>back-up</b> <b>filters</b> of the XMM-Newton EPIC camera aimed at monitoring possible aging effects during the mission lifetime. One thin and one medium EPIC <b>back-up</b> <b>filters</b> have been stored since 1997 {{in an environment}} similar to {{that one of the}} flight filters (dry nitrogen box before launch, high vacuum after launch). The transmission of the two filters has been measured periodically in the 1900 - 10000 Å wavelength range where effects of aging would be clearly evident. The preliminary results, after 5 years of monitoring, show that a slight aging effect has occurred on both filters which, however, has no significant impact onto the EPIC calibration for the correct analysis of the X-ray astrophysical observations...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} 15 years of {{operation}} of the EPIC camera on board the XMM-Newton X-ray observatory, {{we have reviewed the}} status of its Thin and Medium filters. We have selected a set of Thin and Medium <b>back-up</b> <b>filters</b> among those still available in the EPIC consortium and have started a program to investigate their status by different laboratory measurements including: UV/VIS transmission, Raman scattering, X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and Atomic Force Microscopy. Furthermore, we have investigated the status of the EPIC flight filters by performing an analysis of the optical loading in the PN offset maps to gauge variations in the optical and UV transmission. We both investigated repeated observations of single optically bright targets and performed a statistical analysis of the extent of loading versus visual magnitude at different epochs. We report the results of the measurements conducted up to now. Most notably, we find no evidence for change in the UV/VIS transmission of the <b>back-up</b> <b>filters</b> in ground tests spanning a 2 year period and we find no evidence for change in the optical transmission of the thin filter of the EPIC-pn camera from 2002 to 2012.

40|$|AbstractA renewed Electrical Low Pressure Impactor (ELPI+) was {{introduced}} by Dekati Ltd. in late 2010. This study presents the collection efficiencies of the ELPI+ cascade impactor stages and the <b>back-up</b> <b>filter</b> {{as well as the}} charging efficiency of the corona charger in the size range of 0. 01 – 10 μm. According to the measurements the impactor cut diameters are within ± 10 % to the predecessor except the upmost stage for which the difference was found to be − 18 %. The secondary collection of nanoparticles was found to be similar to the predecessor for stages with the largest cut diameters but higher for the stages with the smallest cut diameters. The charging efficiency is higher for the new charger compared to the old one by 54 % at 20 nm particle size. This study also presents the first use of the Single Charged Aerosol Reference (SCAR) for impactor and charger calibrations...|$|E
40|$|Ambient aerosol size {{distribution}} {{is an important}} factor influencing aerosol behavior and properties including particle deposition in lungs and aerosol influence on clouds. Both influences are also driven by aerosol hygroscopicity. Cascade impactors used for size resolved determination of chemical composition suffer from changes of ambient RH during sampling. Due to this factor the same particle might be deposited at different impactor stage when it is sampled at noon at 40 % RH or in the early morning at 99 % RH. Therefore, we used a diffusional aerosol dryer and a 7 -stage modified Berner low pressure impactor with a <b>back-up</b> <b>filter</b> during the heating campaigns in 2008. The samples were analyzed for water-soluble ions (Cl-, SO 42 -, NO 3 -, Na+, NH 4 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +) and water-soluble organic carbon as a main species that influence aerosol hygroscopicity. Due to the drying, the aerosol {{size distribution}}s were not influenced by the daily variability of ambient relative humidity...|$|E
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are reviewed including their chemical and chemical- physical features, {{their impact on}} health and the environment. Different behaviour of PAHs is mentioned. The detailed instruction for the measurement using high-volume cascade impactor BGI 900 (Hi-Vol) is described. Cleaning, equilibration, weighting, protection against contamination of the substrates and technique of the measurement were introduced. The experiment was done: under the last teflon <b>back-up</b> <b>filter</b> the extra PUF substrate was placed, where after the air exposition the significant amounts of gaseous phase of phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene and benzo(a) anthracene were captured. The extent of the volatile PAHs capture correlated positively with the vapour pressure (ranging from 10 - 4 to 10 - 1 Pa.). The other measured PAHs (coronene, benzo(ghi) perylene, chrysene, benzo(b) fluoranthene, benzo(k) fluoranthene, benzo(a) pyrene, dibenzo(a,h) anthracene and indeno(1, 2, 3 -cd) pyrene) with vapour pressure from 10 - 5 to 10 - 10 Pa were not captured. The experiment found out that polyurethane (PUF) substrates captured in noticeable amount the volatile phase of PAHs and therefore the correction for the capture of gaseous phase in the particle size fractions of PAHs was calculated. The deduction for the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} of some trace and major metals (Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn) and of some important alkali and earth alkal; elements {{considered to be}} reference elements of either marine or continental origin, have been measured in the atmosphere (total and particle size fractionated) and in wet and dry fall-out from the sampling station West-Hinder (51 231 N-O 2 26 'E). This station is situated in a coastal marine environment potentially influenced by inputs of continental origin. Total aerosol samples were collected onto Whatman 41 filters with high-volume samplers. Size fractionated aerosols samples are taken with a 5 stages high-volume cascade impactor plus <b>back-up</b> <b>filter.</b> All samplings were performed at well defined conditions of wind-direction and wind-speed to avoid any contamination. Data of wind-direction were processed by an electronic control system which activated the air samplers if the winds were from a preset sector. Atmospheric dry fall-out is tentatively collected on vaselinated plexiglass surface. Rainwater is manually collected with polyethylene funnels. Field measurements of dry fall-out are compared to calculated fluxes based on a theoretical model. Wet fall-out is estimated from rainwater concentrations and measured annual rainfall at sea. These {{results suggest that the}} dominant transfer process of heavy metals from atmosphere to sea occurs by rain...|$|E

The objectives were to determine the enrichment of the clean air masses coming from the Atlantic by different chemical species resulting from NO 2 SO 2, HCl and NH 3 emissions from the industrial areas at the Reconcavo and to estimate the changes in air quality regarding between 2008 and 2010. The following sampling devices were used: passive samplers (PS) and continuous analyzers for NO 2 and SO 2; diffusion tubes coated with citric acid for ammonia and NaF for strong acids (HCl, HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4), the latter in a thermodiffusion system with a <b>back-up</b> <b>filter</b> for collection of the thermically stable (140 °C) ammonium salts and other particles 14. 9 μm). The analytical methodology for the discontinuous measures included ion chromatography (SO 2 as SO 42 − in the PS, anions of the PM and as representants of the acids in the gas phase) and molecular spectrophotometry using the Griess–Saltzman method (λ = 540 nm) and indophenol method (λ = 630 nm) for determination of NO 2 and NH 3, respectively. Clean air masses from the Atlantic (13 nmol m− 3 HCl, 2. 9 nmol m− 3 HNO 3, 1. 6 nmol m− 3 H 2 SO 4, 9. 8 nmol m− 3 SO 2, 16 nmol m− 3 NO 2 and 84 nmol m− 3 NH 3) are slighted enriched in the gas and particulate phase with respect to HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4, respectively, by emissions of the industrial complex. However, enrichment occurs for HCl, SO 2, NO 2 and NH 3. In the area of industrial complex influence hydrochloric acid predominates over the other two strong acids, as expected, due to its direct emission from the petrochemical waste incinerator. Ammonium chloride is the predominant gas to particle transformations. During the period of 2008 – 2010 a decrease varying between 18 and 49 % is observed on the levels of almost all compounds in Lamarão do Passé, downwind from an oil refinery but not in Camaçari, downwind from the industrial complex, where all other compounds presented an increased in their concentrations with the exception of HNO 3 and HCl...|$|E
