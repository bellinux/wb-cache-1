50|$|In Medieval England, double weaves called {{compound}} weft-faced twills featured weft or filling yarns {{in multiple}} colors, {{with the design}} completely covering the face warp yarns and the unused colors for any particular section woven into a <b>binding</b> <b>warp</b> on the reverse side.|$|E
5000|$|Structurally, samite is a weft-faced {{compound}} twill, plain or figured (patterned), {{in which}} the main warp threads are hidden {{on both sides of}} the fabric by the floats of the ground and patterning wefts, with only the <b>binding</b> <b>warps</b> visible. By the later medieval period, the term samite was applied to any rich, heavy silk material which had a satin-like gloss, indeed [...] "satin" [...] began as a term for lustrous samite.|$|R
2500|$|Of {{the five}} basic weaves used in Byzantium and the Islamic weaving {{centers of the}} Mediterranean – tabby, twill, damask, lampas and {{tapestry}} – the most important product was the weft-faced compound twill called samite. The word is derived from Old French samit, from medieval Latin samitum, examitum deriving from the Byzantine Greek [...] ἑξάμιτον hexamiton [...] "six threads", usually interpreted as indicating the use of six yarns in the warp. In samite, the main warp threads are hidden {{on both sides of}} the fabric by the ground and patterning wefts, with only the <b>binding</b> <b>warps</b> that hold the wefts in place visible.|$|R
6000|$|The {{mischief}} of borrowing, {{the persistent}} ill-luck which cleaves to property thus obtained, have been proverbial since the young prophet dropped the axe-head {{in the deep}} water, and cried, [...] "Alas, for it is borrowed." [...] The old prophet, readily altering the specific gravity of the article, enabled his disciple to regain it. But there are no prophets now, none, at least, who can repair our follies, and remove their baneful effects by a friendly miracle. What miracle can restore the books we borrow and lose, or the books we borrow and spoil with ink, or with candle-wax, or which children scrawl or paint over, or which [...] "the dog ate," [...] like the famous poll-book at an Irish election, that fell into the broth, and ultimately into the jaws of an illiterate animal? Books are such delicate things! Yet men--and still more frequently women--read them {{so close to the}} fire that the <b>bindings</b> <b>warp,</b> and start, and gape like the shells of a moribund oyster. Other people never have a paper- knife, and cut the leaves of books with cards, railway tickets, scissors, their own fingers, or any other weapon that chances to seem convenient. Then books are easily dirtied. A little dust falls into the leaves, and is smudged by the fingers. No fuller on earth can cleanse it. The art of man can remove certain sorts of stains, but only by stripping the book of its binding, and washing leaf by leaf in certain acids, an expensive and dangerous process. There are books for use, stout, everyday articles, and books for pious contemplation, original editions, or tomes that have belonged to great collectors. The borrower, who only wants to extract a passage of which he is in momentary need, is a person heedless of these distinctions. He enters a friend's house, or (for this sort of borrower thrives at college) a friend's rooms, seizes a first edition of Keats, or Shelley, or an Aldine Homer, or Elzevir Caesar of the good date, and hurries away with it, leaving a hasty scrawl, [...] "I have taken your Shelley," [...] signed with initials. Perhaps the owner of the book never sees the note. Perhaps he does not recognize the hand. The borrower is just the man to forget the whole transaction. So there is a blank in the shelves, a gap among the orderly volumes, a blank never to be filled up, unless our amateur advertises his woes in the newspapers.|$|R
40|$|Collagen VI and WARP are {{extracellular}} structural macromolecules {{present in}} cartilage and associated with BM suprastructures in non-skeletal tissues. We have previously shown that in WARP-deficient mice, collagen VI is specifically reduced in {{regions of the}} peripheral nerve ECM where WARP is expressed, suggesting that both macromolecules {{are part of the}} same suprastructure. The object {{of this study was to}} conduct a detailed analysis of WARP-collagen VI interactions in vitro in cartilage, a tissue rich in WARP and collagen VI. Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse and human articular cartilage showed that WARP and collagen VI co-localize in the pericellular matrix of superficial zone articular chondrocytes. EM analysis on extracts of human articular cartilage showed that WARP associates closely with collagen VI-containing suprastructures. Additional evidence of an interaction is provided by immunogold EM and immunoblot analysis showing that WARP was present in collagen VI-containing networks isolated from cartilage. Further characterization were done by solid phase binding studies and reconstitution experiments using purified recombinant WARP and isolated collagen VI. Collagen VI binds to WARP with an apparent K(d) of approximately 22 nM and the <b>binding</b> site(s) for <b>WARP</b> resides within the triple helical domain since WARP binds to both intact collagen VI tetramers and pepsinized collagen VI. Together, these data confirm and extend our previous findings by demonstrating that WARP and collagen VI form high affinity associations in vivo in cartilage. We conclude that WARP is ideally placed to function as an adapter protein in the cartilage pericellular matrix...|$|R
