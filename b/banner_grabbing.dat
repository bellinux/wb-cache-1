50|$|Some {{examples}} of service ports used for <b>banner</b> <b>grabbing</b> are {{those used by}} Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP); ports 80, 21, and 25 respectively. Tools commonly used to perform <b>banner</b> <b>grabbing</b> are Telnet,nmap,zmap which is included with most operating systems, and Netcat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Banner</b> <b>grabbing</b> is a {{technique}} used to glean information about a computer system on a network and the services running on its open ports. Administrators can use this to take inventory of the systems and services on their network. However, an intruder can use <b>banner</b> <b>grabbing</b> {{in order to find}} network hosts that are running versions of applications and operating systems with known exploits.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOS ngerprinting {{tries to}} {{identify}} the type and version of a system based on gathered information of a target host. It is an essential step for many subsequent penetration attempts and attacks. Traditional OS ngerprinting depends on <b>banner</b> <b>grabbing</b> schemes or network trafc analysis results {{to identify the}} system. These interactive procedures can be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or fooled by fake network packets. In this paper, we propose a new OS ngerprinting mechanism in virtual machine hypervisors that adopt the memory de-duplication technique. Specically, when multiple memory pages with the same contents occupy only one physical page, their reading and writing access delay will demonstrate some special properties. We use the accumulated access delay to the memory pages that are unique to some specic OS images to derive {{out whether or not}} our VM instance and the target VM are using the same OS. The experiment results on VMware ESXi hypervisor with both Windows and Ubuntu Linux OS images show the practicability of the attack. We also discuss the mechanisms to defend against such attacks by the hypervisors and VMs. I...|$|E
40|$|Advertisers {{often use}} flashy {{animated}} <b>banners</b> to <b>grab</b> a web users attention. The empirical evidence however seems to contradict this commonly used tactic. In 2002 Bayles {{found no evidence}} of a correlation between animation and memory recall. In 2004 Burke, Hornof, Nilsen, and Gorman confirmed this by finding in a series of two experiments tha...|$|R

For safety reasons, seatbelts were installed {{and the original}} gasoline engine that ran the Ferris wheel has been replaced with an electric one. The Magical Midway also includes a clairvoyant caravan, a variety of carnival games of skill, a Banner Line (a large art exhibit of carnival <b>banners),</b> a <b>Grab</b> Joint and Candy Joint (with classic carnival drinks and candies), and a vintage 1920s high striker.|$|R
5000|$|The Hermitage of San Blas {{right side}} toward the Batuecas [...] Formerly {{known as the}} Martyrs of Los Santos, until not long ago was the village cemetery. Worship is no longer {{performed}} there, however for locals it is particularly important for the pilgrimage of [...] "The Flag Day". They carry the <b>banner</b> that was <b>grabbed</b> by the townswomen in fighting against the Portuguese in 1475, which has been celebrated since that day with wine {{at the expense of}} the Duke of Alba. Today is paid by the municipality of La Alberca.|$|R
