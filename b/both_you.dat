25|$|Senator Johnson urged Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates to {{act quickly}} on the recommendation. “... {{it is my hope}} that <b>both</b> <b>you</b> and the President can move forward on Master Sergeant Keeble’s case as expeditiously as possible,” Johnson said in a letter to Gates quoted in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.|$|E
25|$|Since {{our father}} divided the kingdom between us, <b>both</b> <b>you</b> and I {{are held to}} share the land and its produce with our magnates, with whose help our forefathers possessed the lost land and repulsed the Arabs. Therefore, as the other magnates, whom you deprived, have {{returned}} their fiefs to count Ponce de Minerva, and you would not believe the rumours against them, I am returning behind my borders.|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation 3 version's {{critical}} review scores suffered {{because of the}} technical issues first uncovered by 1UP.com. While discussing the retail version on a podcast, 1UP.com staff members agreed {{that a significant number}} of the frame rate problems had been resolved, but not all of them. They concluded that the PlayStation 3 version was not quite as smooth as the Xbox 360 version and recommended that [...] "if you own <b>both</b> , <b>you</b> should do the 360" [...] version. Kotaku's Michael McWhertor echoed that recommendation, though stated that those who only have a PlayStation 3 should still consider The Orange Box.|$|E

500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty things about you, they must be communists. Therefore they threaten <b>both</b> <b>you</b> and me. Don't you think we should silence these communists from speaking?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the vice}} {{president}} mentioned, John Kerry comes {{from the state of}} Massachusetts, which has taken as big a step as any state in the union to legalize gay marriage. Yet <b>both</b> <b>you</b> and Senator Kerry say you oppose it. Are you trying to have it both ways? ...|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Czisch {{described}} the concept in an interview, saying [...] "For example, {{if we look}} at wind energy in Europe. We have a winter wind region where the maximum production is in winter and in the Sahara region in northern Africa the highest wind production is in the summer and if you combine <b>both,</b> <b>you</b> come quite close {{to the needs of the}} people living in the whole area - let's say from northern Russia down to the southern part of the Sahara." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Blackstone, {{author of}} the famous Commentaries on the Laws of England (four volumes, 1765–1769) was one of Wilmot's close friends. Blackstone wrote to him on 22 February 1766, after the {{publication}} of the first volume of the Commentaries: [...] "Sir, Lord Mansfield did me the honour to inform me, that <b>both</b> <b>you</b> and himself had been so obliging as to mark out a few of the many errors, which I am sensible are to be met with in the Book which I lately published. Nothing can flatter me so much as that you have thought it worth the pains of such a revisal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goldman {{was unhappy}} with the movie; The Guardian says that he changes the subject {{when asked about the}} movie, but {{suggests}} that his displeasure may be because he was pressured to add a romantic interest to the film. [...] In his memoir, Goldman says of the film that if he could live his life over, he would have written the same screenplays, [...] "Only I wouldn't have come near All the President's Men." [...] He said that he has never written as many versions of a screenplay as he did for that movie. [...] Speaking of his choice to write the script, he said [...] "Many movies that get made are not long on art and are long on commerce. This was a project that seemed it might be <b>both.</b> <b>You</b> don't get many and you can't turn them down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>both</b> of <b>you</b> can't go," [...] {{answered}} Dave, with a grim smile. [...] "Somebody {{has got to}} stay here,--in fact, I {{think it}} would be better that <b>both</b> of <b>you</b> stay with the girls--in case I don't get back with help by morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} very, very kind," [...] she answered. [...] "He was always that, {{from the first}} time I saw <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> Do <b>you</b> remember? It was down in the lower gardens." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I look on <b>both</b> of <b>you</b> and Eleanor as all one on {{the present}} occasion. I am {{considered}} to be falling over a precipice, and she has got hold of my coat tails. Of course you wouldn't be Christians if <b>you</b> didn't <b>both</b> of <b>you</b> seize a foot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We brought {{scarcely}} {{anything with}} us, because we didn't expect to need {{things in this}} way; {{but this is my}} own, and I want to give it to <b>you</b> <b>both.</b> One of <b>you</b> can't use it by himself, and so it will be more like a present for <b>both</b> of <b>you</b> together, than most things would be." [...] And she handed me a box of dominoes.|$|R
6000|$|Her ladyship ignored him. [...] "He owes it to <b>you</b> <b>both</b> that <b>you</b> have estranged {{him from}} his father, set up a breach between them that is never like to be healed. 'Tis what he owes you." ...|$|R
