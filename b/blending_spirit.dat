5000|$|The ‘Kham Khong’ {{song was}} very popular and avidly instilled a {{patriotic}} sense into {{the hearts of}} Thai people. Such a dramatic effect influenced the Excise Department to use ‘Mekhong’ to name the 35-degree special <b>blended</b> <b>spirit</b> that was newly produced in 1941.|$|R
50|$|The {{concession}} agreement expired in 1927 {{during the reign}} of King Prajadhipok. The Department then cancelled the concession for spirit distillation and distribution before taking over the spirit production on April the 1st, 1929. The distillery was modernized and it produced a new ’28-degree’ <b>blended</b> <b>spirit</b> under a number of brands including ‘Chiang-Chun’, which is still available today. As for spirit distribution, the Department continued with the concession and appointed wholesalers for each area.|$|R
50|$|A master blender is an {{individual}} who decides on the composition of <b>blended</b> <b>spirits.</b> For example, in the Scotch whisky industry, master blenders choose which single malts and grain whiskies are combined to make particular blended whisky. An important objective is often to maintain consistency over time. A typical blend might be composed of 20 different whiskies whose taste and price will vary over time, and, of course, {{it is possible that}} any one of them will go out of production. Consequently, it is sometimes necessary to replace whiskies that go into the blend. Other responsibilities include checking the maturation of spirits.|$|R
50|$|Later, the Excise Department concocted another ‘blended spirit’ using herbs {{combined}} with a traditional medicated liquor recipe. Herbs and spices were fermented {{in a spirit of}} high alcohol content before adding the desired flavor, aroma and the preferred degree of alcohol. The result was a new kind of spirit which was smooth enough to be drunk neat. It was further developed into a ‘special blended spirit’ which could be enjoyed neat or with a mix of soda. In those days, the preferred drink was imported whiskey mixed with soda. This imported whiskey resulted in a substantial loss of income to the country each year. The special <b>blended</b> <b>spirit</b> produced by the Excise Department helped reduce imports significantly.|$|R

5000|$|Bourbon {{that has}} an age stated on its label must be labeled with {{the age of the}} {{youngest}} whiskey in the bottle (not counting the age of any added neutral grain spirits in a bourbon that is labeled as <b>blended,</b> as neutral-grain <b>spirits</b> are not considered whiskey under the regulations and are not required to be aged at all).|$|R
50|$|Most Canadian whiskies are <b>blends.</b> Any grain <b>spirit</b> aged for {{at least}} three years in Canada may be called Canadian whisky.

5|$|In Shaivism of Indonesia, {{the popular}} name for Shiva has been Bhattara Guru, which {{is derived from}} Sanskrit Bhattaraka which means “noble lord". He is {{conceptualized}} as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all Gurus in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Bhattara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus <b>blended</b> their <b>spirits</b> and heroes with him. Bhattara Guru's wife in southeast Asia is the same Hindu deity Durga, who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualized with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others. Shiva has been called Sadasiva, Paramasiva, Mahadeva in benevolent forms, and Kala, Bhairava, Mahakala in his fierce forms. The Indonesian Hindu texts present the same philosophical diversity of Shaivism traditions found on the subcontinent. However, among the texts that have survived into the contemporary era, the more common are of those of Shaiva Siddhanta (locally also called Siwa Siddhanta, Sridanta).|$|R
50|$|A common {{characteristic}} of many IMFLs, distinct from spirits {{elsewhere in the}} world, is that irrespective of the final product the starting ingredient is a neutral spirit distilled from molasses, a byproduct of the sugar industry. This neutral spirit at 96% alcohol by volume is first reduced to 42.8% using demineralized water, whereupon flavors and other spirits are added. Caramel is added at this stage to impart colour to the spirit. Most commonly, grain or malt-based whisky, which may include imported Irish or Scotch whisky is <b>blended</b> with the <b>spirit.</b> The same applies to other IMFL spirits, like rum or vodka. However, some recent entrants distill spirits per traditional methods even when manufacturing in India.|$|R

In its century-plus of productions, Triangle has commented upon Princeton-specific topics, from examinations and campus safety to the Honor Code and the eating clubs, in addition to broader movements and events, including war protests, political scandals, women’s rights, and affirmative action. Although Triangle essentially recreates itself every year with an entirely new, full-scale musical-comedy, the club remains committed to its longstanding traditions, from the annual national tour to the kickline, and perpetuates its unique <b>spirit,</b> <b>blending</b> topical humor with collegiate irreverence and outright playfulness.|$|R
25|$|Colonialism was a {{capitalist}} venture moved by appropriation and plundering of foreign lands. It {{was supported by}} military force and a discourse that legitimized its violence {{in the name of}} progress and a universal civilizing mission. This discourse is complex and multi-faceted. It was elaborated in the 19th century by colonial ideologues such as Joseph-Ernest Renan and Arthur de Gobineau, but its roots reach far back in history. In Rethinking Postcolonialism: Colonialist Discourse in Modern Literature and the Legacy of Classical Writers, Amar Acheraiou discusses the history of colonialist discourse and traces its spirit to ancient Greece, including Europe’s claim to racial supremacy and right to rule over non-Europeans harboured by Renan and other 19th century colonial ideologues. He argues that modern colonial representations of the colonized as “inferior”, “stagnant” and “degenerate” were borrowed from Greek and Latin authors like Lysias (440-380 BC), Isocrates (436-338 BC), Plato (427-327 BC), Aristotle (384—322 BC), Cicero (106-43 BC), and Sallust (86-34 BC), who all considered their racial others – the Persians, Scythians, Egyptians as “backward”, “inferior”, and “effeminate”. Among these ancient writers Aristotle is the one who articulated more thoroughly these ancient racial assumptions, which served as a source of inspiration for modern colonists. In The Politics, he established a racial classification and ranked the Greeks superior to the rest. He considered them as an ideal race to rule over Asian and other ‘barbarian’ peoples, for they knew how to <b>blend</b> the <b>spirit</b> of the European “war-like races” with Asiatic “intelligence” and “competence”.|$|R
5000|$|The {{age of the}} cognac is {{calculated}} {{as that of the}} youngest component used in the blend. The blend is usually of different ages and (in the case of the larger and more commercial producers) from different local areas. This blending, or marriage, of different eaux-de-vie is important to obtain a complexity of flavours absent from an eau-de-vie from a single distillery or vineyard. Each cognac house has a master taster (maître de chai), who is responsible for <b>blending</b> the <b>spirits,</b> so that cognac produced by a company will have a consistent house style and quality. In this respect it is similar to the process of blending whisky or non-vintage Champagne to achieve a consistent brand flavor. A very small number of producers, such as Guillon Painturaud and Moyet, do not blend their final product from different ages of eaux-de-vie and therefore produce a [...] "purer" [...] flavour (a practice roughly equivalent to the production of single malt Scotch whisky).Hundreds of vineyards in the Cognac AOC region sell their own cognac. These are likewise blended from the eaux-de-vie of different years, but they are single-vineyard cognacs, varying slightly from year to year and according to the taste of the producer, hence lacking some of the predictability of the better-known commercial products. Depending on their success in marketing, small producers may sell a larger or smaller proportion of their product to individual buyers, wine dealers, bars and restaurants, the remainder being acquired by larger cognac houses for blending. The success of artisanal cognacs has encouraged some larger industrial-scale producers to produce single-vineyard cognacs.|$|R
50|$|The blue agave {{plant has}} spiked leaves and a round, fleshy core (the piña). The leaves are chopped {{off and the}} core is cooked and crushed to create juice, which is {{fermented}} and distilled to make tequila. The resulting unaged, clear tequila is then diluted with water to bring the alcohol content down to around 40%. Pure tequila is distilled 100% from the sap of the blue agave plant, while mixto tequilas only need {{to be at least}} 51% blue agave in order to legally be called tequila. In 1964, tequila makers were allowed to obtain up to 30% of the sugars in tequila from sources other than the agave plant. During a blue agave shortage in the 1970s, Mexican regulations were further revised to require that tequila contain only 51.5% agave. Agave plants take 10 to 12 years to mature and become ripe, while sugarcane can be harvested every year, so <b>blending</b> the agave <b>spirit</b> with sugarcane spirit is a cheaper method, while using 100% blue agave plant is more expensive.|$|R

5000|$|The Blanton's brand was {{launched}} in 1984 {{under the guidance of}} the distillery's master distiller Elmer T. Lee, as the first modern bourbon brand marketed as a single barrel bourbon. The original brand name was [...] "Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon". A single barrel bourbon is one for which each bottling batch is produced from the contents of only one particular aging barrel - not mixed with whiskey from any other barrels (and not <b>blended</b> with neutral <b>spirits,</b> colorings, or flavorings). The company says that producing a high quality whiskey using this production method requires constant monitoring of every barrel {{in the middle of the}} warehouse by the Master Distiller. The barrels are dumped by hand without using machinery. There are eight different stopper designs, each with a different letter of the alphabet molded into it and topped with a figurine of a racehorse and jockey. When placed in order, spelling [...] "B L A N T O N' S", the horse and jockey's poses display eight different scenes of a horse race, from standing at the gate, to crossing the finish line with a win.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States Code of Federal Regulations, the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits [...] {{define a}} [...] "malt whisky" [...] as a whisky {{produced}} at an alcohol by volume (abv) level not exceeding 80% from a fermented mash of {{not less than}} 51% malted barley grain and stored for aging in charred new oak containers at less than 62.5% abv. The regulations also define a [...] "rye malt whisky" [...] in a corresponding manner using rye grain. If such a whisky has been aged {{for at least two}} years, contains no added coloring and flavoring, and has not been <b>blended</b> with neutral <b>spirits</b> or other types of whisky, the additional adjective straight can be applied, as in [...] "straight malt whisky" [...] and [...] "straight rye malt whisky". If the whisky is not totally straight but at least 51% of its content is [...] "straight malt whisky", the word [...] "malt" [...] can still be used, but the product must be described as a [...] "blend", as in [...] "blended malt whisky" [...] or [...] "malt whiskey - a blend". There is no aging requirement for the parts of a blended whiskey other than the part that is straight whiskey - e.g., the product may contain neutral spirits that have not been aged and have been made from other types of grain.|$|R
60|$|He {{suddenly}} resumed {{the conversation}} {{in a more}} cheerful tone. Holding a volume of Petrarch in his hand, he touched lightly, but with grace, on Italian poetry; then diverged into his travels, recounted an adventure with sprightliness, and replied to Miss Temple's lively remarks with gaiety and readiness. The morning advanced; Miss Temple closed her portfolio and visited her flowers, inviting him to follow her. Her invitation was scarcely necessary, his movements were regulated by hers; he was as faithful to her as her shadow. From the conservatory they entered the garden; Ferdinand was as fond of gardens as Miss Temple. She praised the flower-garden of Armine. He gave her some account of its principal creator. The character of Glastonbury highly interested Miss Temple. Love is confidential; it has no fear of ridicule. Ferdinand entered with freedom and yet with grace into family details, from which, at another time and to another person, {{he would have been}} the first to shrink. The imagination of Miss Temple was greatly interested by his simple, and, to her, affecting account of this ancient line living in their hereditary solitude, with all their noble pride and haughty poverty. The scene, the circumstances, were all such as please a maiden's fancy; and he, the natural hero of this singular history, seemed deficient in none of those heroic qualities which the wildest spirit of romance might require for the completion of its spell. Beautiful as his ancestors, and, she was sure, as brave, young, spirited, graceful, and accomplished, a gay and daring <b>spirit</b> <b>blended</b> with the mournful melody of his voice, and occasionally contrasted with the somewhat subdued and chastened character of his demeanour.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} {{remarkable}} that Margery actually grew to be attached to Peter, often manifesting toward the chief attentions and feelings such as a daughter is apt to exhibit toward a father. This arose from the high and courteous bearing of this extraordinary savage. At all times, an Indian warrior is apt to maintain the dignified and courteous bearing that has so often been remarked in the race, {{but it is very}} seldom that he goes {{out of his way to}} manifest attention to the squaws. Doubtless these men have the feelings of humanity, and love their wives and offspring like others; but it is so essential a part of their training to suppress the exhibition of such emotions, that it is seldom the mere looker-on has occasion to note them. Peter, however, had neither wife nor child; or if they existed, no one knew where either was to be found. The same mystery shrouded this part of his history as veiled all the rest. In his hunts, various opportunities occurred for exhibiting to the females manly attentions, by offering to them the choicest pieces of his game, and pointing out the most approved Indian modes of cooking the meats, so as to preserve their savory properties. This he did sparingly at first, and as a part of a system of profound deception; but day by day, and hour after hour, most especially with Margery, did his manner become sensibly less distant, and more natural. The artlessness, the gentle qualities, <b>blended</b> with feminine <b>spirit</b> as they were, and the innocent gayety of the girl, appeared to win on this nearly remorseless savage, in spite of his efforts to resist her influence. Perhaps the beauty of Margery contributed its share in exciting these novel emotions in the breast of one so stern. We do not mean that Peter yielded to feelings akin-to love; of this, he was in a manner incapable; but a man can submit to a gentle regard for woman that shall be totally free from passion. This sort of regard Peter certainly began to entertain for Margery; and like begetting like, as money produces money, it is not surprising that the confidence of the girl herself, as well as her sympathies, should continue to increase in the favor of this terrible Indian.|$|R
