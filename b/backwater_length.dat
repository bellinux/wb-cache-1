40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} an accurate approximation of the Froude number (F) for circular channels {{which is part}} of the gradually varied flow (GVF) equation. The proposed approximation is developed using optimization technique to minimize the relative error between the exact and estimated values, resulting in a maximum error of 0. 6 % compared with 14 % for the existing approximate method. The approximate F is used in the governing GVF equation to develop an exact analytical solution of this equation using the concept of simplest partial fractions. A comparison of the proposed and approximate solutions for <b>backwater</b> <b>length</b> shows that the error of the existing approximate solution could reach up to 30 % for large normal flow depths...|$|E
40|$|River delta {{complexes}} {{are built}} {{in part through}} repeated river-channel avulsions, which often occur about a persistent spatial node creating delta lobes that form a fan-like morphology. Predicting the location of avulsions is poorly understood, but {{it is essential for}} wetland restoration, hazard mitigation, reservoir characterization, and delta morphodynamics. Following previous work, we show that the upstream distance from the river mouth where avulsions occur is coincident with the <b>backwater</b> <b>length,</b> i. e., the upstream extent of river flow that is affected by hydrodynamic processes in the receiving basin. To explain this observation we formulate a fluvial morphodynamic model that is coupled to an offshore spreading river plume and subject it to a range of river discharges. Results show that avulsion is less likely in the downstream portion of the backwater zone because, during high-flow events, the water surface is drawn down near the river mouth to match that of the offshore plume, resulting in river-bed scour and a reduced likelihood of overbank flow. Furthermore, during low-discharge events, flow deceleration near the upstream extent of backwater causes enhanced deposition locally and a reduced channel-fill timescale there. Both mechanisms favor preferential avulsion in the upstream part of the backwater zone. These dynamics are fundamentally due to variable river discharges and a coupled offshore river plume, with implications for predicting delta response to climate and sea level change, and fluvio-deltaic stratigraphy...|$|E
40|$|Horseshoe waterfalls are {{ubiquitous}} in natural streams, bedrock canyons, and engineering structures. Nevertheless, water flow patterns upstream of horseshoe waterfalls are poorly known and likely {{differ from the}} better studied case of a one-dimensional linear step because of flow focusing into the horseshoe. This is a significant knowledge gap because the hydraulics at waterfalls controls sediment transport and bedrock incision, which can compromise the integrity of engineered structures and influence the evolution of river canyons on Earth and Mars. Here we develop new semiempirical theory for the spatial acceleration of water upstream of, and the cumulative discharge into, horseshoe canyons and waterfalls. To this end, we performed 110 numerical experiments by solving the 2 -D depth-averaged shallow-water equations {{for a wide range}} of flood depths, widths and discharges, and canyon lengths, widths and bed gradients. We show that the upstream, normal flow Froude number is the dominant control on lateral flow focusing and acceleration into the canyon head and that focusing is limited when the flood width is small compared to a cross-stream <b>backwater</b> <b>length</b> scale. In addition, for sheet floods much wider than the canyon, flow focusing into the canyon head leads to reduced discharge (and drying in cases) across the canyon sidewalls, which is especially pronounced for canyons that are much longer than they are wide. Our results provide new expectations for morphodynamic feedbacks between floods and topography, and thus canyon formation...|$|E

40|$|Burning of {{pastures}} is {{a management}} practice adopted by graziers worldwide. When rain falls on burnt pastures, {{it can lead}} to increased pollutant transport in runoff. However, this transport can be modified by vegetative buffers which intercept the runoff downslope of burnt areas. This study examines the effects of different pasture buffer lengths (0, 2, and 5 m) on sediment and chemical transport from two pasture sites near Wivenhoe Dam, the main water reservoir for Brisbane City. Simulated rainfall (100 mm/h) was applied to 18 plots on pasture sites after they were burnt, and insoluble and soluble components were measured in the runoff. Most eroded sediment/organic debris accumulated against the first row of the grass buffer strips or was deposited in the upslope <b>backwater</b> region. Buffer <b>length</b> had little impact on the runoff concentrations of NO 3 - and NO 2 - (NOx), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total nitrogen from the 5 -m-length upslope plots but was significant for sediment loss rate, filterable reactive phosphate, ammonium, and total and dissolved organic carbon. Pasture type was significant for NOx, ammonium, sediment loss rate, and total organic carbon only. Burning increased enrichment ratios of nutrients and carbon in the runoff compared with unburnt plots, but a 2 -m buffer strip subsequently reduced the enrichment ratio values by > 30 %. Buffers strips of unburnt pasture grass may provide an effective tool for post-fire erosion control following prescribed burning; however, further work including scaling to larger plot sizes and catchment level is required.

40|$|Recent {{field work}} at the Wax Lake Delta (WLD) in coastal Louisiana {{indicates}} lateral outflow from channels to islands upstream of the receiving basin; in this region of the delta the flow transitions from confined to unconfined (i. e., from a uniform discharge profile to a nonuniform discharge profile). The hydraulics of this transition zone and the controls exerted by vegetation, topography, and river discharge fluctuations are analyzed in this work. The shallow water equations are numerically solved in two model domains: an idealized channel-island complex and the full domain of the WLD. In both domains, a significant fraction of the river discharge flows laterally from the channels to deltaic islands before reaching the receiving basin. Vegetation roughness within the delta islands significantly impacts the fraction and rate of lateral outflow from the channel, while river discharge fluctuations have a limited effect, due to the backwater control on the subcritical flow. The presence of vegetation in the islands tends to increase velocities within the channel, except in the region upstream of significant lateral outflow, where the velocity increases with decreasing vegetation roughness due to the lowered water level that reduces the flow cross-section. The topography establishes a lateral water surface gradient between the channel and the islands even with low vegetation roughness, which drives lateral flow. A velocity spreading angle is used to mark the transition from confined to unconfined flow; the angle generally increases up to the onset of unconfined flow and then decreases as the flow approaches the receiving basin and the flow in the island tends to align {{with that of the}} channel. The lateral outflow from the primary channels influences the hydraulics of the flow throughout the <b>backwater</b> <b>length.</b> The transition between confined and unconfined flow in coastal river deltas has {{a significant impact on the}} flow hydraulics and the resulting transport dynamics of solids and solutes...|$|E
40|$|The seaward end {{of modern}} rivers is {{characterized}} by the interactions of marine and fluvial processes, a tract known as the fluvial to marine transition zone (FMTZ), which varies between systems due to the relative strength of these processes. To understand how fluvial and tidal process interactions and the FMTZ are preserved in the rock record, large-scale outcrops of deltaic deposits of the Middle Jurassic Lajas Formation (Neuqu√©n Basin, Argentina) have been investigated. Fluvial-tidal indicators consist of cyclically distributed carbonaceous drapes in unidirectional, seaward-oriented cross-stratifications, which are interpreted as the result of tidal modulation of the fluvial current in the inner part of the FMTZ. Heterolithic deposits with dm-scale interbedding of coarser- and finer-grained facies with mixed fluvial and tidal affinities are interpreted to indicate fluvial discharge fluctuations (seasonality) and subordinate tidal influence. Many other potential tidal indicators are argued {{to be the result of}} fluvial-tidal interactions with overall fluvial dominance, or of purely fluvial processes. No purely tidal or tide-dominated facies were recognized in the studied deposits. Moreover, fluvial-tidal features are found mainly in deposits interpreted as interflood (forming during low river stage) in distal (delta front) or off-axis (interdistributary) parts of the system. Along major channel axes, the interpreted FMTZ is mainly represented by the fluvial-dominated section, whereas little or no tide-dominated section is identified. The system is interpreted to have been hyposynchronous with a poorly developed turbidity maximum. These conditions and the architectural elements described, including major and minor distributary channels, terminal distributary channels, mouth bars and crevasse mouth bars, are consistent with an interpretation of a fluvial-dominated, tide-influenced delta system and with an estimated short <b>backwater</b> <b>length</b> and inferred microtidal conditions. The improved identification of process interactions, and their preservation in ancient FMTZs, is fundamental to refining interpretations of ancient deltaic successions...|$|E
40|$|Rivers may {{dramatically}} {{change course}} on a fluvial plain. Such an avulsion temporarily leads to two active channels connected at a bifurcation. Here we study {{the effect of}} dynamic meandering at the bifurcation {{and the effect of}} channel width adjustment to changing discharge in both downstream branches on the evolution of a bifurcation and coexisting channels. As an example, we reconstructed the last major avulsion at the Rhine delta apex. We combined historical and geological data to reconstruct a slowly developing avulsion process spanning 2000 years and involving channel width adjustment and meandering at the bifurcation. Based on earlier idealised models, we developed a onedimensional model for long-term morphodynamic prediction of upstream channel and bifurcates connected at the bifurcation node. The model predicts flow and sediment partitioning at the node, including the effect of migrating meanders at the bifurcation and channel width adjustment. Bifurcate channel width adaptation to changing discharge partitioning dramatically slows the pacing of bifurcation evolution because the sediment balance for width adjustment and bed evolution are coupled. The model further shows that meandering at the bifurcation modulates channel abandonment or enlargement periodically. This explains hitherto unrecognised reactivation signals in the sedimentary record of the studied bifurcation meander belts, newly identified in our geological reconstruction. Historical maps show that bifurcation migration due to meander bend dynamics increases the bifurcation angle, which increases the rate of closure of one bifurcate. The combination of model and reconstruction identifies the relevant timescales for bifurcation evolution and avulsion duration. These are the time required to fill one downstream channel over one <b>backwater</b> <b>length,</b> the time to translate one meander wavelength downstream and, for strong river banks, the adaptation timescale to adjust channel width. The findings have relevance for all avulsions where channel width can adjust to changing discharge and where meandering occurs...|$|E
40|$|The Colombian {{government}} aims {{to establish}} a connection that bridges the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The new connection will largely {{take place on the}} current Atrato River, which has not yet been upgraded for a more extensive use of navigation in the near future. A bottleneck in the river is the delta area. Without structural dredging activities the river is completely inaccessible. This study investigates the morphodynamics of a river mouth of the Atrato delta, in order to improve its accessibility to provide navigation in the future and to minimize the dredging activities. In short, the main objectives of this study are (1) to gain insights into the morphodynamics of the delta, (2) to develop a hydrodynamic model on an unstructured grid, (3) to develop a morphodynamic model on a structured grid and consequently (4) apply these models to investigate measures that aim to improve the accessibility of a river mouth. In this study an approach is used to model the hydrodynamics first at a large scale and subsequently modelling the morphodynamics at a more detailed level. A hydrodynamic model is set up with an unstructured grid, which appears to be a powerful tool to model a topographical complex area such as the Atrato delta. The hydrodynamic model gives insights into the hydrodynamics of the delta and is capable to create specific time-dependent boundary conditions for the more detailed morphodynamic model. This approach solves the problem of enormous <b>backwater</b> adaptation <b>lengths,</b> which are initiated by the tidal movement and a large amount of bifurcations. Subsequently, a model with a structured grid has been set up to simulate the morphology around a river mouth. The morphodynamic model is able to identify the major processes that cause sediment deposition. The key process appears to be the sudden spreading and deceleration of the riverine water when the river flows into the Golfo de Urab√°. As the result of the relative strength of the outflowing fresh water compared to the tidal power, the flow velocities are almost constantly located seawards. This explains the low sediment deposition rates in the river part of the delta. The enhanced flocculationin saline water results in a compact zone of sedimentation. This report discusses four possible measures that aim to improve the navigability in the delta and to minimize dredging activities. Modelsare set up to simulate their effects on the delta hydrodynamically as well as morphodynamically. The modelled measures are (1) a sand trap, (2) an artificial outlet channel, (3) sediment diversion channels and (4) the artificial extension of a river mouth. The model forecasts that none of the investigated measures will avoid dredging activities completely. A navigable artificial river mouth situated more upstream in the river even leads to closuresof the current river mouths. Of the examined measures, the implementations of a sand trap and sediment diversion channels raise the most potential to reduce the sediment supply to the current river mouths, without deteriorating the navigability {{in other parts of the}} river. The artificial extension of a river mouth with breakwaters does not decrease the sediment supply towards the river mouths. However, the sediment deposition process takes place in deeper water, which minimizes the dredging maintenance for at least several years. The findings of this study should be regarded as the first step in the extension of knowledge on the morphodynamics of the Atrato delta. At this stage the models will help to understand the morphodynamics at the delta in more detail and hopefully encourage the collection of more valuable data. For that purpose a measuring and monitoring program is presented in this report. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This study {{presents}} {{a combination of}} numerical and analytical investigations of fluid and sediment transport mechanics through the river-ocean interface. This region is defined broadly as the region within the river that {{is influenced by the}} receiving basin [...] both the salinity and the oscillating and mean basin heights [...] as well as the portion of the river influenced by the presence of a distinct fluvial buoyant water mass. More narrowly, we consider in this study an atidal salt wedge, the upstream hydraulic transition zone in the unstratified river, and the near-field river plume. The first main chapter {{presents a}} hydraulic model of the salt wedge estuary in sloped and landward-converging channels. It is found that the non-dimensionalized intrusion length {{is a function of the}} freshwater Froude number, as noted in previous studies, as well as new parameters describing the channel geometry. Further, it is found that the primary geometric influence on the intrusion length is the channel bottom slope. Comparison to field data is given indicating that the influence of nonzero bottom slope may account for the discrepancy between observation and the canonical flat estuary theory Schijf+Schonfeld 1953. Next, we link our hydraulic model of the salt wedge to a hydraulic model of the upstream river transition zone, which is influenced by the depth of the receiving basin and is not in normal flow. We add to this a parameterization of total sediment transport in the unstratified river Engelund+Hansen 1967 and a newly developed hydraulic model of sediment transport in the salt wedge. The model retains the key mechanistic features of sediment transport in highly stratified estuaries and is ideal for morphodynamic applications. We find that the principle influence of the salt wedge is an increase in net deposition in the lower river and the introduction of a secondary maximum aggradation length scale in addition to the <b>backwater</b> <b>length</b> discussed in Chatanantavet_et_al 2012. Finally, we present experimental simulations of the steady state estuary and river plume. The results of the estuary experiments quantify the influence of bottom slope on the reduction of sensitivity of intrusion length to river discharge and confirm the results of the hydraulic model. The plume experiments indicate that the plume transitions to a jet-like outflow for sufficiently large values of F_f in which the spreading rate is determined by lateral entrainment instead of the plume buoyancy and the liftoff is pushed far offshore. This transition is not gradual but rather step-like, being concentrated on one value (or a narrow band of values of) F_f. Both this critical value of F_f and the jet spreading rate depend crucially on the plume inflow aspect ratio. This jet-like behavior is anticipated to have crucial implications for delta progradation processes and the magnitude of sediment erosion in the lower river during flood events...|$|E
