500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think they sort of remembered me from that. It was nice to be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick.

Sternberg {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "I had lost friends <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had known {{what it was to}} bury my own dead, even my firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more deeply than I did over the news." [...] Cope's Quaker funeral consisted of six men: Osborn, his colleague William Berryman Scott, Cope's friend Persifor Frazer, son-in-law Collins, Horatio Wood, and Harrison Allen. The six sat around Cope's coffin among the fossils and Cope's pets, a tortoise and a Gila monster, for what Osborn called [...] "a perfect Quaker silence... an interminable length of time." [...] Anticipating the quiet, Osborn had brought along a Bible and read an excerpt from the Book of Job, ending by saying, [...] "These are the problems to which our friend devoted his life." ...|$|E

Bennington commented on the collaborations, stating that [...] "We really felt like {{if we need to}} be inspired and move in another direction. I think when we got Page in, Mike had written this chorus and sang it, and his voice had this tone, and it was unlike anything I'd heard from him <b>before.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> was like, [...] "Dude this is crazy, this sounds like a Helmet song! It's cool!" [...] And we were like, [...] "Dude, why don't we {{see if we can get}} like Page in here?" [...] You know?

500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Lisa Respers France of CNN felt that [...] "Laryngitis" [...] highlighted a trend of Glee storylines becoming progressively sadder, rather than comedic. She {{wrote that the}} plotlines came across as lecturing, and concluded: [...] "I still heart Glee, which is clearly {{one of the best}} shows on television right now. I just think they may want to lighten the life lessons a bit or spread them out more over several episodes rather than clobbering us all at once." [...] Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV wrote that he was uncertain what to make of the episode, noting: [...] "Sure, there were some high points, and it was a pretty enjoyable watch, but unlike the last few episodes this one left me a little high and dry." [...] Batallones observed that the Sean storyline felt [...] "totally forced into the episode, making Rachel's epiphany [...] very forced and unnatural." [...] Entertainment Weekly Darren Franich was also troubled by the storyline, noting: [...] "It seems like the height of vanity to basically use this storyline to teach Rachel an important lesson about being herself. [...] Glee has used disabled actors <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it's worth debating whether the show honors that or uses it shamelessly." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there <b>before</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoping to {{continue}} the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and Bruce Campbell were considered for the role. In particular, Campbell, following his involvement with the sixth season episode [...] "Terms of Endearment", was considered, but, due to a contractual obligation, could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think they sort of remembered me from that. It was nice {{to be involved in}} that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role". In the end, the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. Reportedly, Patrick was cast {{due to the fact that}} his featured role in [...] (1991) would attract a great 18- to 35-year-old male demographic to the show. In fact, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in the demographic, solely due to Patrick's casting.|$|E

Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this <b>before.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E

It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the first two segments worked better than the third, [...] "but this is a marvelous episode, and set a high standard for the Halloween specials to come." [...] In 2008, Canwest News Service chose [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] {{as one of the}} top five scariest episodes from television's past. They singled out Marge saying [...] "This family has had its differences and we've squabbled, but we've never had knife fights <b>before,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> blame this house" [...] as a memorable line from the episode. Two of the episode's segments were singled out by critics as exemplary parts of the Treehouse of Horror series. [...] "The Raven" [...] was selected as the second best Treehouse of Horror segment by Ryan J. Budke of TV Squad in 2005. Budke described the segment as [...] "one of the most refined Simpsons pop references ever" [...] and knows [...] "people that consider this the point that they realized The Simpsons could be both highly hilarious and highly intelligent." [...] "Hungry are the Damned" [...] was selected as the fifth best Treehouse of Horror segment by Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski of IGN in 2008.
