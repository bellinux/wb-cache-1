2500|$|The {{original}} Type 38 gun had a conical interrupted-thread breech, {{a single}} <b>box</b> <b>type</b> trail which limited gun elevation to only 16°30'. Also, {{there were no}} equilibrators as the trunnions were at the gun barrel's center of [...] balance. All of these shortcomings were remedied with a redesign following World War I.|$|E
2500|$|The Pander D had {{a single}} piece, two spar wing which was {{attached}} to the upper fuselage longerons with pairs of yoked U-bolts. [...] The spars were of the <b>box</b> <b>type</b> with spruce flanges and plywood webs, the front one forming a narrow chord D-box with ply covering around the wing leading edge. Aft of the front spar, the wing and ailerons, the latter mounted on false spars, were fabric covered. [...] Similar methods were used in the tail structure.|$|E
2500|$|Filling {{stations}} were {{essential to the}} success of a trans-national road such as Route66. Stations evolved their own unique design types and filling station architecture varied by period, {{at one time or another}} all major design types were represented along US66 in Illinois. The existence of Route66, and its alignment which ran parallel to much of the Chicago–St. Louis-running Chicago and Alton Railroad, itself made gasoline distribution simpler. The earliest gas {{stations were}} curbside but these were quickly rendered obsolete because of their tendency to back up traffic when a customer used the roadside pumps. The curbside filling station was the first type of business to use the actual term [...] "filling station". Other types of gas stations evolved such as the house or cottage type, the house and canopy, the house and bays, and the oblong <b>box</b> <b>type.</b> Examples of extant filling stations along Route66 in Illinois can be found in varying states of disrepair, and a few have been fully restored.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Boxed</b> <b>types</b> : Some data {{structures}} {{that are too}} simple to be made full-fledged class types (with all the overhead incurred) may {{still need to be}} registered with the type system. For example, we might have a class to which we want to add a [...] property, whose values should be instances of a structure that looks like [...] To avoid having to subclass , we can create a <b>boxed</b> <b>type</b> to represent this structure, and provide functions for copying and freeing. GObject ships with a handful of <b>boxed</b> <b>types</b> wrapping simple GLib data types. Another use for <b>boxed</b> <b>types</b> is as a way to wrap foreign objects in a tagged container that the type system can identify and will know how to copy and free.|$|R

50|$|There is {{a direct}} {{equivalence}} between an unboxed primitive type and a reference to an immutable, <b>boxed</b> object <b>type.</b> In fact, {{it is possible to}} substitute all the primitive types in a program with <b>boxed</b> object <b>types.</b> Whereas assignment from one primitive to another will copy its value, assignment from one reference to a boxed object to another will copy the reference value to refer to the same object as the first reference. However, this will not cause any problems, because the objects are immutable, so there is semantically no real difference between two references to the same object or to different objects (unless you look at physical equality). For all operations other than assignment, such as arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators, one can unbox the <b>boxed</b> <b>type,</b> perform the operation, and re-box the result as needed. Thus, it is possible to not store primitive types at all.|$|R

5000|$|Opaque pointer types : Sometimes, for {{objects that}} need to be neither copied or reference-counted nor freed, even a <b>boxed</b> <b>type</b> would be overkill. While such objects can be used in GObject by simply {{treating}} them as opaque pointers (...) , it is often a good idea to create a derived pointer type, documenting the fact that the pointers should reference a particular kind of object, even though nothing else is said about it.|$|R
40|$|Nonserotypeable pneumococci (NSP) are {{commonly}} carried by Australian Indigenous children in remote communities. The {{purpose of this}} study was to characterize carriage isolates of NSP from Indigenous children vaccinated with the seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 7) and to use these data to guide decisions on reporting of NSP. A total of 182 NSP were characterized by <b>BOX</b> <b>typing,</b> antibiogram analysis, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of common <b>BOX</b> <b>types.</b> NSP positive for the wzg capsule gene were analyzed by a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot hybridization assay (mPCR/RLB-H) targeting capsule genes to determine the serotype. Among 182 NSP, 49 <b>BOX</b> <b>types</b> were identified. MLST of 10 representative isolates found 7 STs, including ST 448 (which accounted for 11 % of NSP). Non-penicillin susceptibility was evident in 51 % of the isolates. Pneumococcal wzg sequences were detected in only 23 (13 %) NSP, including 10 that contained an ∼ 1. 2 -kb insert in the region. mPCR/RLB-H identified serotype 14 wzy sequences in all 10 NSP, and 1 also contained a serotype 3 -specific wze sequence. Among the remaining 13 wzg-positive NSP, few belonged to the serotypes represented in PCV 7. It appears that most NSP identified in Australian Indigenous children are from a true nonencapsulated lineage. Few NSP represented serotypes in PCV 7 that suppress capsular expression. High rates of carriage and penicillin resistance and the occasional presence of capsule genes suggest a role for NSP in the maintenance and survival of capsulated pneumococci. To avoid the inflation of pneumococcal carriage and antibiotic resistance rates, in clinical trials, we recommend separate reporting of rates of capsular strains and NSP and the exclusion of data for NSP from primary analyses...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concepts of}} grey box and display <b>box</b> data <b>types.</b> These make explicit the idea that state variables in abstract data types are not always hidden. Programming languages have visibility rules which make representations observable and modifiable. Specifications in model-based notations may have implicit assumptions about visible state components, or are used in contexts where the representation does matter. Grey <b>box</b> data <b>types</b> are like the "standard" black <b>box</b> data <b>types,</b> except that they contain explicit subspaces of the state which are modifiable and observable. Display boxes indirectly observe the state by adding displays to a black box. Refinement rules for both these alternative data types are given, based on their interpretations as black boxes. 1 Introduction Programming languages that support modularisation and encapsulation of data types with their operations have various {{ways of dealing with}} the variables that represent the "state" of the data type.

In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season.
