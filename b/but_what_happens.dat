Still, she's {{more interesting than the}} other gays on this show, which are dwindling in numbers since Erica left for parts unknown." [...] Commenting on Hahn's abrupt departure from the show, Dorothy Snarker, writing for LGBT website AfterEllen.com observed of Robbins and Torres' relationship: [...] "I [...] can't help but be wary of how the Grey's writers will handle this relationship.

500|$|Discussing the {{likelihood}} a Tangled sequel, Howard {{explained to the}} Los Angeles Times [...] "We don't {{want to do a}} sequel for the sake of sequels ... The story has to be worth telling." [...] Because the original film [...] "buttons up" [...] well, the directors wanted to avoid simply creating a movie wedding featuring Rapunzel and Flynn because [...] "that's not entertainment", so Greno and Howard conceived a funny story about Pascal and Maximus instead, providing the animators and writers with [...] "an opportunity {{to do a lot of}} slapstick" [...] that was mostly absent in Tangled. Wanting the film [...] "to be a movie for everyone", the directors [...] "figured out a way to give [...] exactly what they wanted, so there is a beautiful grand wedding in the short, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> pretty quickly, those two goofballs Maximus and Pascal lose the wedding rings ... It turned into this big, zany, cartoony, fun, action-packed short."

They don't understand why I wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready to work again. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> at GH should stay at GH." [...] Phelps dismissed rumors that she has [...] "lured" [...] Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as [...] "interesting". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put [...] "two and two together", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. [...] "It’s just like a sports player...when a deal does not work out with his team, there might be another team out there that might want him," [...] Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the [...] "significant increase" [...] in viewers, which Burton was a [...] "big reason" [...] for.|$|E

2500|$|New X-ray {{observations}} by the Chandra X-ray Observatory show {{three distinct}} structures: an outer, horseshoe-shaped ring about 2 light years in diameter, a hot inner core about 3 light-months in diameter, {{and a hot}} central source less than 1 light-month in diameter which may contain the superstar that drives the whole show. The outer ring provides evidence of another large explosion that occurred over 1,000 years ago. These three structures around Eta Carinae are thought to represent shock waves produced by matter rushing away from the superstar at supersonic speeds. The temperature of the shock-heated gas ranges from 60 MK in the central regions to 3 MK on the horseshoe-shaped outer structure. [...] "The Chandra image contains some puzzles for existing ideas of how a star can produce such hot and intense X-rays," [...] says Prof. Kris Davidson of the University of Minnesota. Davidson is principal investigator for the Eta Carina observations by the Hubble Space telescope. [...] "In the most popular theory, X-rays are made by colliding gas streams from two stars so close together that they'd look like a point source to us. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to gas streams that escape to farther distances?

He is quite content to exchange Narcissus and his Pool for the signal box at a railway junction, where goods and travellers pass perpetually upon their logical glittering road. Wilde was a monarchist, though content that monarchy should turn demagogue for its own safety, and he held a theatre by the means whereby he held a London dinner table.

There was a scene on the wharf, which, {{as a matter of}} fact, I witnessed. It was early morning. He must have been waiting for her on purpose. I was there by the merest chance, having been called to an urgent consultation by the doctor of the German gunboat in the harbour.

It was a strange sight, Mrs. Gould: the long jetty, with this raving Cargador in his crimson sash and the girl all in black, at the end; the early Sunday morning quiet of the harbour {{in the shade of the}} mountains; nothing but a canoe or two moving between the ships at anchor, and the German gunboat's gig coming to take me off.

To be sure, we can't help knowing something about God, even if we've never heard the Gospel, the good news that our Saviour brought us. For we know everything comes from God: don't you say almost every day, 'This and that will happen, please God,' and 'We shall begin to cut the grass soon, please God to send us a little more sunshine'? We know very well we are altogether in the hands of God. We didn't bring ourselves into the world, we can't keep ourselves alive while we're sleeping; the daylight, and the wind, and the corn, and the cows to give us milk--everything we have comes from God. And he gave us our souls and put love between parents and children, and husband and wife. But is that as much as we want to know about God? We see he is great and mighty, and can do what he will: we are lost, as if we was struggling in great waters, when we try to think of him.|$|E
