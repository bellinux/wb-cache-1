25|$|Castle Eden Brewery, {{owned by}} David Soley, took over Camerons in April 2002 for £35 million, moving all {{operations}} to Hartlepool and closing down the Castle Eden plant. The Kronenbourg 1664 contract was renewed by Scottish & Newcastle in December 2002. In 2003, £500,000 was spent {{to build a}} new <b>bottling</b> <b>line</b> and an on-site microbrewery, The Lion's Den. In 2008, Cameron's spent £4 million expanding its capacity from 375,000 barrels to around 800,000 barrels. This followed the agreement of a contract with Scottish & Newcastle to supply Kronenbourg 1664, Foster's and John Smith's bitter until 2019. Previously the brewery had only produced Kronenbourg 1664.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, James Page had a stock offering, and {{the first}} $400,000 was {{specifically}} earmarked for the <b>bottling</b> <b>line.</b> It advertised the stock offering on six-packs, soliciting investments as small as $285. The company announced that it had successfully raised the maximum $855,000 from over 1,000 supporters in January, 2000. But the money was never used to fund expansion; instead {{it was used to}} lower the company's debt burdens, and the <b>bottling</b> <b>line</b> was never built. In 2002, the brewery was shut down. The company continued to contract-brew beer at other regional breweries.|$|E

5000|$|Scenes From Lynchburg (1998-): Around 1998 {{the company}} started {{to sell the}} first 1-liter bottle in a new <b>bottle</b> <b>line</b> called the [...] "Scenes from Lynchburg". This first bottle was sold only in Europe. It was to include seven {{different}} bottles with a little picture/drawing of something - a scene - from Lynchburg. Almost every year a new bottle was made and sold around airports in Europe. Around 2001 the company started selling the same designed bottles in a 750-ml version in Canada, also trying to bring out a new bottle each year. In 2003 the first U.S. version was sold exclusively in Lynchburg also in a 750-ml version with 43% proof whiskey instead of the 40% used in Canada. What started as a <b>bottle</b> <b>line</b> of seven <b>bottles</b> expanded {{to a total of}} 12 scenes in the 1-liter size, eight in the 750-ml size, and three for Canada. The series appears to have ended.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, small bottles {{are most}} popular for the {{on-premises}} market, {{where they are}} sold by the bucketful. The motivation in the 1970s was to target lighter drinkers, {{and to ensure that}} the lager beer stayed cold until finished. The market for beer in small bottles is smaller than that in regular size bottles, which cause added difficulties and expense: the bottles themselves are harder to source, and require either a separate <b>bottling</b> <b>line</b> or retooling the <b>bottling</b> <b>line</b> between runs. As a result, US craft breweries only rarely bottle in small bottles; temporary examples include Flying Dog Brewery (2007-2009) and Rogue Ales (2009-2011, using extra bottles from Flying Dog).|$|E
