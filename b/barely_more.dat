None of his six teams managed an appearance in the NCAA Tournament; only the 1985–86 team participated in postseason competition, losing {{in the second round}} of the NIT.

The editor of the paper for its entire duration was Stefan Heym. The Deutsches Volksecho published material on the Communist Party's People's Front policy, news from Nazi Germany, and reports on the international anti-fascist movement and contained a women's column, meeting dates of German cultural and political organizations, and advertisements.

The Radio Fund's trustees estimated cost of launching a station at $100,000 and hoped to invest the balance to generate sufficient interest income to allow for perpetual operations. While this grand vision of substantial funding proved overly optimistic, the necessary funds for the acquisition of a station were successfully raised from party members and sympathetic labor unions during the first half of 1927.|$|E

When, as expected, the government of revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain on 1 February 1793 Nymphe was still in dock, and not ready for sea until the 6th. Nymphe finally sailed on the 12th, with <b>barely</b> <b>more</b> than half her complement, which included 32 marines, and 80 Cornish tin-miners, all mere landsmen.

25|$|In all {{first-class}} {{matches in}} 1871, {{a total of}} 17 centuries were scored and Grace accounted for 10 of them, including the first century in a first-class match at Trent Bridge. He averaged 78.25 and the next best average by a batsman playing {{more than a single}} innings was 39.57, <b>barely</b> <b>more</b> than half his figure.

Besides Grace and apart from Jupp and Ted Pooley who were the highest runscorers, other leading batsmen in 1871 were Richard Daft, Robert Carpenter, Fred Grace, Henry Charlwood and Ephraim Lockwood.

25|$|Since the 1970s further issues arose {{between the}} two {{countries}} over sovereignty rights in the Aegean Sea. The Balkan Wars of 1913 had given Greece all the Aegean islands except Imbros and Tenedos, some of them only a few kilometres (<b>barely</b> <b>more</b> than three nautical miles) off the Turkish coast. Since the end of World War II Turkish officials insisted that this led to questions regarding the delimitation of territorial waters, air space and other related zones of control. The conflict was motivated both by considerations of military tactical advantages and by questions of economic exploitation of the Aegean. The latter issue became particularly significant as after 1970 there were expectations of finding oil in the Aegean. This was highlighted during the crisis in 1987, when a Turkish ship was about to enter disputed waters to conduct an oil survey. The Greek Prime Minister of the time, Andreas Papandreou, ordered the ship to be sunk if found within disputed waters claimed by Greece. Consultations about this issue were held in Davos between the Greek and Turkish Prime Ministers.|$|E
25|$|Gessner first {{attended}} the Carolinum in Zürich, then later entered the Fraumünster seminary. There he studied classical languages, appearing as Penia (Poverty) in Aristophanes' Pluto, {{at the age}} of 15. In school, he impressed his teachers so much that a few of them helped sponsor him so that he could further his education, including arranging a scholarship for him to attend university in France to study theology (1532–1533) {{at the age of}} 17. There he {{attended the}} Bourges and University of Paris. But religious persecution forced him to leave Paris for Strassburg, but being unable to secure employment, returned to Zürich. One of his teachers in Zürich acted as a foster father to him {{after the death of his}} father at the Battle of Kappel (1531), another provided him with three years of board and lodging, while yet another arranged his further education at the upper school in Strassbourg, the Strassbourg Academy. There he broadened his knowledge of ancient languages by studying Hebrew. In 1535, religious unrest drove him back to Zürich, where he made what some considered an imprudent marriage at the age of 19, of a woman from another poor family who had no dowry. Although some of his friends again came to his aid, he was appointed to obtaining a teaching position for him, this was in the lowest class and attracted a stipend <b>barely</b> <b>more</b> than a pittance. However he then obtained paid leave of absence to study medicine at the University of Basel (1536).|$|E

500|$|Eastwood {{began working}} on smaller, more {{personal}} projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed Bird (1988), a biopic starring Forest Whitaker as jazz musician Charlie [...] "Bird" [...] Parker. Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and Spike Lee, son of jazz bassist Bill Lee and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking {{that it did not}} capture his true essence and sense of humor. Eastwood received two Golden Globes for the film, the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his lifelong contribution, and the Best Director award. However, Bird was a commercial failure, earning just $11million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people. Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly received comedy Pink Cadillac (1989). The film is about a bounty hunter and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman (Bernadette Peters) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink Cadillac. The film failed both critically and commercially, earning <b>barely</b> <b>more</b> than Bird and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.|$|E

500|$|According to McGuire, {{the game}} {{did not start}} with any game plan to get Chamberlain 100 points.

Free throws were the weakest part of his game, making <b>barely</b> <b>more</b> than half in his first seasons. He had started {{shooting}} free throws underhanded that season per McGuire's suggestion. Chamberlain at that point was thinking more about a free throw shooting record than scoring a lot of points; the NBA record was 24 free throws made in a game. Imhoff was soon benched because of foul trouble. After one foul, he snapped at the referee, [...] "Well, why don't you just give the guy a hundred now and we'll all go home!" [...] Neither referee had ever been a lead official before, and Imhoff privately wished a stronger lead was working the game. By halftime, the Warriors had lost some of their edge, but still led 79–68. Chamberlain's point total stood at 41. The Warriors felt little excitement, as he had scored 60 or more points on 15 previous occasions. [...] "I often came into the locker room with 30 or 35 points, therefore, 41 points was not a big deal", Chamberlain later explained.
