25|$|This planar {{geometry}} and rectilinear nature are also echoed and scaled down {{in nearly every}} individual member of the structure’s interior and exterior façade. Metal paneling, glazing, exterior ornamentation are all representative of the buildings overall dimension. Furthermore, it is evident from any elevation, that rectilinear overlap has been transferred from plan to section.

At the south base of the rock is a large space enclosed by walls and gates, with great porticos on the inner side.

Here she led a constricted, {{monotonous}} existence, <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> by a few trips to the Rhine and Bonn. She composed poetry, but not prolifically. In 1834 her sister Jenny married Joseph von Laßberg, a specialist in medieval German poetry. The following summer, Annette and her mother travelled to Laßberg's castle Eppishausen in the Swiss Alps. She was inspired by the scenery and on friendly terms with Laßberg, but neither he nor his friends appreciated modern literature and Droste's hopes that they might help her to publish her work came to nothing.|$|E
25|$|The Compromise proved widely popular politically, {{and both}} parties {{committed}} {{themselves in their}} platforms to the finality of the Compromise on sectional issues. The strongest opposition in the South occurred in the states of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, but Unionists soon prevailed, spearheaded by Georgians Alexander Stephens, Robert Toombs, and Howell Cobb {{and the creation of}} the Georgia Platform. The peace was <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> by the divisive Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 introduced by Stephen Douglas, which had the effect of repealing the Missouri Compromise and led directly to the formation of the Republican Party, whose capture of the national government in 1860 led directly to the secession crisis of 1860–1861.|$|E
25|$|In 758, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur {{attempted}} to strengthen diplomatic {{ties with the}} Khazars, ordering Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami, one of his nobles and the military governor of Armenia, to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan Baghatur, but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general Ras Tarkhan invaded south of the Caucasus in 762–764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> {{by a series of}} raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.|$|E

At 11:30 on 15 December, GMS 1 entered Vientiane from the north, only to be stopped by PAVN artillery and small arms fire from Wattay. At 13:30, Kouprasith sent 80 troops in an attempted amphibious landing to cut off Kong Le's retreat, but the waterborne force overshot its objective. Meantime, BP 1 paratroopers loyal to Phoumi moved door to door hunting down Kong Le's BP 2 paratroopers who had been isolated, but continued to snipe away.

25|$|Often {{in social}} life, animals {{fight for the}} right to reproduce, as well as social supremacy. A common example of {{fighting}} for social and sexual supremacy is the so-called pecking order among poultry. Every time a group of poultry cohabitate for a certain time length, they establish a pecking order. In these groups, one chicken dominates the others and can peck without being pecked. A second chicken can peck all the others except the first, and so on. Higher level chickens are easily distinguished by their well-cured aspect, as opposed to lower level chickens. While the pecking order is establishing, frequent and violent fights can happen, but once established, it is <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> when other individuals enter the group, in which case the pecking order re-establishes from scratch.|$|E
25|$|Sampras {{was known}} for his natural attacking serve-and-volley game, all-round game, and strong {{competitive}} instinct. Sampras's best surface was undoubtedly the fast-playing grass courts, Sampras won seven Wimbledon titles (1993–95, 1997-2000), <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> by a loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual winner Richard Krajicek, tying him with William Renshaw and one behind Roger Federer for the most titles in Wimbledon history. Sampras also shares the record of five US Open titles in the Open Era with Jimmy Connors and Federer. He won back-to-back US Open titles in 1995 and 1996, despite vomiting on the court at 1–1 in the final set tiebreak due to dehydration in the 1996 quarterfinals against Àlex Corretja. Combined with his two Australian Open titles, this gave Sampras a total of fourteen majors won on grass and hard courts.|$|E

25|$|Roddick did not {{fare well}} during the clay-court season, {{withdrawing}} from Rome due {{for personal reasons}} and from Madrid due to a stomach virus. Roddick then lost {{in the third round}} of the 2010 French Open to Teymuraz Gabashvili in straight sets. Failure at Roland Garros was followed by another disappointment when Roddick suffered his earliest ever exit in the 2010 Aegon Championships, a grass-court Wimbledon tune-up event. He was beaten by Dudi Sela in the third round. At Wimbledon, Roddick was seeded fifth, which was two spots higher than his ATP ranking of seven. He was defeated in the fourth round by world No. 82 Lu Yen-hsun of Taiwan in five sets. Like his final match with Roger Federer the previous year, his serve was <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> once during the match, in the fifth set.|$|E
25|$|The English Electric Canberra is a {{twin-engine}} bomber aircraft, {{capable of}} conducting high-altitude flights and {{making use of}} jet propulsion. The overall design {{has been described as}} being of a simple nature, somewhat resembling a scaled-up Gloster Meteor fighter, except for its use of a mid-wing. The Canberra principally differed from its preceding piston-powered wartime bombers via its twin Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. The fuselage was circular in cross section, tapered at both ends and, cockpit aside, entirely without protrusions; the line of the large, low-aspect ratio wings was <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> by the tubular engine nacelles. The Canberra had a two-man crew under a fighter-style cabin which was furnished with a large blown canopy, but delays {{in the development of the}} intended automatic radar bombsight resulted in the addition of a bomb aimer's position housed within the nose. The pilot and navigator were positioned in a tandem arrangement on Martin-Baker ejection seats.|$|E
25|$|Ferrero {{had a bad}} {{start to}} the 2010 season. Ferrero began the year at the Heineken Open, where he retired against Michael Lammer with an injury {{trailing}} 1–3 in the second round, after receiving a first round bye. At the Australian Open, he lost to Ivan Dodig, after being two sets to love up and seemingly cruising to victory. His mind slipped mid-match and he got crushed {{during the last three}} sets of the match, 6–2, 6–1, 4–6, 1–6, 1–6. Ferrero then competed in the Brasil Open as the no. 1 seed. He earned his first win of the season against Eduardo Schwank, 7–6, 6–3. In the following round he defeated Nicolás Massú, 6–2, 5–7, 6–2 (despite failing to serve out the match 5–4 in the second set), Carlos Berlocq, 6–3, 6–2, in the quarterfinals, and Ricardo Mello, 6–4, 6–2, in the semifinals. In the final, he crushed Łukasz Kubot, 6–1, 6–0, in 61 minutes, conceding one of his services games but in turn, breaking all of his opponent's service games. At the Copa Telmex, seeded No. 2, he won against top seed David Ferrer in the final, 5–7, 6–4, 6–3, after defeating Juan Mónaco in the semifinals, 6–2, 7–6. This was his second title in a row and extended his winning streak to 10. The tournament victory also raised his ranking to World No. 16. At the Abierto Mexicano in Acapulco, he had comfortable victories over qualifier Diego Junqueira, 6–2, 6–3, and Igor Andreev, 6–4, 6–3. Carrying on his fiery form, he defeated defending champion Nicolás Almagro, 6–1, 5–7, 6–2, in the quarterfinals, not facing any break points in the first and third sets and being <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> once. He defeated Juan Mónaco in the semifinals, when the Argentinian retired with an abdominal strain after losing the first set 7–5. Ferrero faced David Ferrer in his third straight final and lost, 3–6, 6–3, 1–6. Both players admitted that Ferrero's fatigue {{played a major role in}} the final set. This ended his 14-match winning streak. Despite the loss, he rose to No. 14 in the world, the first time he was ranked that high since 11 October 2004, when he was ranked 13th.|$|E
