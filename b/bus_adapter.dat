Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements (as {{they have less}} air drag) and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives. Enterprise HDDs are commonly connected through Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) or Fibre Channel (FC).

50|$|ATTO {{continued}} {{to build on}} its early successes, releasing its Fibre Channel host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters,</b> bridges and hubs in 1996. A few years later, in 1999, ATTO introduced its first enterprise-class ATA-based RAID storage array. In 2002, the company released the iPBridge, an iSCSI to SCSI bridge, which would {{pave the way for}} later developments in bridging technologies. In the early 2000s, ATTO started a focus on the Fibre Channel market, developing and releasing the Celerity&#8482; line of Fibre Channel host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters</b> in 2003 with 1Gb connectivity. By 2005, ATTO expanded its Celerity offerings with the 4Gb host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters,</b> as well as introducing the FibreBridge&#174; storage controller for data centers and the FastStream&#174; Fibre Channel RAID controllers. In 2007, ATTO stepped into the SAS/SATA market with ExpressSAS&#174; RAID and host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters.</b> The following year, ATTO released 8Gb Fibre Channel and 6Gb ExpressSAS adapters, and in 2009 the company rolled out the first 8Gb Fibre Channel storage controller. ATTO introduced its FibreConnect&#8482; family of switches in 2010 and introduced a revised product in 2012, providing scalable, end-to-end SAN connectivity. In 2011, ATTO released its first FastFrame&#8482; network interface cards and converged network adapters, enabling connectivity to Ethernet networks. In 2012, ATTO introduced its ThunderLink&#174; and ThunderStream&#174; devices, the company’s first Thunderbolt enabled products.|$|R

50|$|The BBU DIMM was {{originally}} {{designed for use}} as the cache of RAID HBAs (host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters)</b> or systems, to enable data in the cache to survive a power failure.

50|$|ATTO Technology, Inc. is a {{manufacturer}} of storage connectivity products for data-intensive computing. ATTO manufactures Fibre Channel and SAS/SATA host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters,</b> RAID adapters, Fibre Channel switches, protocol conversion bridges, storage controllers, MacOS&#174; iSCSI initiator software and acceleration software with storage interface connectivity to SATA, SAS, Fibre Channel, Thunderbolt&#8482; devices, Ethernet and NVMe.|$|R
50|$|A Caching SAN Adapter {{incorporates}} {{a class of}} host-based, intelligent I/O optimization engines that provide integrated storage network connectivity, storage capacity, and the embedded processing required to make all cache management entirely transparent to the host. The only host-resident software required for operation is a standard host operating system (OS) device driver. A Caching SAN Adapter appears to the host as a standard Host <b>Bus</b> <b>Adapter</b> and uses a common Host <b>Bus</b> <b>Adapter</b> driver.|$|E
50|$|Historical Word serial {{interfaces}} connect a {{hard disk drive}} to a <b>bus</b> <b>adapter</b> with one cable for combined data/control. (As for all early interfaces above, each drive also has an additional power cable, usually direct to the power supply unit.) The earliest versions of these interfaces typically had an 8 bit parallel data transfer to/from the drive, but 16-bit versions became much more common, and there are 32 bit versions. The word nature of data transfer makes {{the design of a}} host <b>bus</b> <b>adapter</b> significantly simpler than that of the precursor HDD controller.|$|E
50|$|The SGPIO bus {{consists}} of 4 electrical signals. It originates (or is driven by) an initiator, typically a host <b>bus</b> <b>adapter</b> or SAS Expander, and {{arrives at a}} target, typically a backplane.|$|E
50|$|Larry Boucher, Wayne Higashi, and Bernard Nieman founded Adaptec in 1981.At first, Adaptec {{focused on}} devices with Parallel SCSI interfaces. Popular host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters</b> {{included}} the 154x/15xx ISA family, the 2940 PCI family, and the 29160/-320 family. With advancements in technology, RAID functions were added while interfaces evolved to PCIe and SAS.|$|R

50|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{did not have}} Ethernet hardware included in their design and <b>bus</b> <b>adapters</b> were initially expensive. A solution to was to use the, at the time, standard parallel port, typically used for connection to a printer or similar output device. The ports on two computers are connected with a so-called null-printer cable, sometimes called a LapLink cable.|$|R
50|$|A {{hardware}} initiator uses dedicated hardware, {{typically in}} combination with firmware running on that hardware, to implement iSCSI. A hardware initiator mitigates the overhead of iSCSI and TCP processing and Ethernet interrupts, and therefore may improve the performance of servers that use iSCSI.An iSCSI host <b>bus</b> <b>adapter</b> (more commonly, HBA) implements a hardware initiator. A typical HBA is packaged as {{a combination of a}} Gigabit (or 10 Gigabit) Ethernet network interface controller, some kind of TCP/IP offload engine (TOE) technology and a SCSI <b>bus</b> <b>adapter,</b> which is how it appears to the operating system.An iSCSI HBA can include PCI option ROM to allow booting from an iSCSI SAN.|$|E
50|$|The SGPIO signal {{consists}} of 4 electrical signals; it typically originates from a host <b>bus</b> <b>adapter</b> (HBA). iPass connectors carry both SAS/SATA electrical {{connections between the}} HBA and the hard drives {{as well as the}} 4 SGPIO signals.|$|E
50|$|States for drives or slots can be, for example, empty, failed, rebuilding, etc. The {{state of}} a drive or slot is {{determined}} by the host <b>bus</b> <b>adapter,</b> and is typically transmitted to the backplane through SGPIO-signals on a cable.|$|E
50|$|Native Command Queuing was {{preceded by}} Parallel ATA's version of Tagged Command Queuing (TCQ). ATA's attempt at {{integrating}} TCQ was constrained by the requirement that ATA host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters</b> use ISA <b>bus</b> device protocols {{to interact with the}} operating system. The resulting high CPU overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for TCQ.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} enables one physical {{adapter card}} {{to appear as}} multiple virtual network interface cards (vNICs) and virtual host <b>bus</b> <b>adapters</b> (vHBAs). Virtual NICs and HBAs function as conventional NICs and HBAs, and {{are designed to be}} compatible with existing operating systems, hypervisors, and applications. To networking resources (LANs and SANs), they appear as normal cards.|$|R
50|$|ViStor is a {{software}} {{implementation of a}} Virtual Tape Library (VTL). It was released in 2007 to OEM's in Asia specifically who create VTL appliances using the ViStor software. Software runs on a version of Linux and supports the iSCSI protocol as well supporting Emulex Fibre Channel Host <b>Bus</b> <b>Adapters.</b> This product was no longer supported after the HDS acquisition.|$|R
50|$|The term host <b>bus</b> <b>adapter</b> (HBA) is {{most often}} {{used to refer to}} a Fibre Channel {{interface}} card. Fibre Channel HBAs are available for open systems, computer architectures, and buses, including PCI and SBus (obsolete today). Each HBA has a unique World Wide Name (WWN), which is similar to an Ethernet MAC address in that it uses an OUI assigned by the IEEE. However, WWNs are longer (8 bytes).There are two types of WWNs on a HBA; a node WWN (WWNN), which is shared by all ports on a host <b>bus</b> <b>adapter,</b> and a port WWN (WWPN), which is unique to each port. There are HBA models of different speeds: 1Gbit/s, 2Gbit/s, 4Gbit/s, 8Gbit/s, 10Gbit/s, 16Gbit/s and 20Gbit/s.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{disk array}} {{controller}} may fit inside a computer, {{either as a}} PCI expansion card or just built onto a motherboard.

50|$|In {{a typical}} system architecture, the host <b>bus</b> <b>adapter</b> (HBA) connects to a {{backplane}} through a 4× iPass cable. The SGPIO-signals run inside this cable. The backplane may then optionally {{connect to the}} baseboard management controller of a motherboard through an I²C or SMBus.|$|E
