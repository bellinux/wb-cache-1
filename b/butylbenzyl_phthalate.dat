40|$|The {{concentrations}} of phthalate esters (PAEs) in Chinese hospitals were investigated by simultaneously determining {{concentrations of}} gas- and particle-phase PAEs. PAEs were detected in two third-class first-grade hospitals, two second-class first-grade hospitals, {{and a community}} health service center. Hospital drugstores had the highest concentration (24. 19 mu g/m(3)), which was 1. 54 times that of newly decorated houses. The second highest concentration {{was found in the}} transfusion rooms, averaging 21. 89 mu g/m(3); this was followed by the concentrations of PAEs in the nurse&# 39;s workstations, the wards, and the doctor&# 39;s offices, with mean concentrations of 20. 66, 20. 0, and 16. 92 mu g/m(3), respectively. The lowest concentrations were found in the hallways (16. 30 mu g/m(3)). Of the six different kinds of PAEs found, major pollutants included diethyl <b>phthalates,</b> dibutyl <b>phthalates,</b> <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalates</b> and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalates, comprising more than 80 % of all PAEs present. Meanwhile, a comparison between different wards showed that PAE concentrations in the maternity wards were 1. 63 times higher than in the main wards. Based on known health hazards, our results suggest that the PAEs seriously influence the health of the pregnant women and babies; therefore, it is of great importance to take the phthalate concentrations in hospitals into consideration. In addition, hospital indoor air was more seriously contaminated than the air of newly decorated houses. (C) 2015 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

40|$|Phthalate {{plasticizers}} {{are found}} in consumer products and home furnishing materials. Phthalate urinary metabolites are detected in nearly every sample in population-based studies indicating widespread exposure. Prior epidemiologic studies have associated vinyl flooring, a proxy for phthalate exposure, or house dust concentrations of phthalates with eczema and asthma in children. However, these studies lack adequate exposure measurements, consideration of the early life period, and prospective designs. In light of these gaps in the literature, we designed epidemiologic analyses to address our overarching hypothesis that early life exposure to a mixture of phthalates will have associations with adverse allergic and respiratory health outcomes in children. We tested this hypothesis in five self-contained manuscripts that characterize sources of exposure to phthalates in early life, demonstrate the application of new statistical methods for estimating effects of these highly correlated biomarkers, and test the association between early life exposure to phthalates and eczema and airway inflammation in children. Participants were enrolled from the longitudinal birth cohort of the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) in New York City. Phthalate metabolites were measured in prenatal and child urine samples at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Questionnaires and visual inspections were combined with phthalate measurements from personal and indoor air sampling and urinary metabolite concentrations to examine sources and patterns of phthalate exposure associated with personal care product use and flooring materials in the home. The use of perfume and personal care products was associated with higher exposure to the metabolite of diethyl phthalate (DEP) but not di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP). Vinyl flooring in the home was associated with higher indoor air and urinary metabolite concentrations for <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBzP) but not di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Because some phthalates share exposure sources and have multiple metabolites, the urinary biomarker concentrations can be highly correlated. Using a reanalysis of the association between prenatal phthalate metabolites and reduced gestational age, we demonstrate that simple Bayesian models can estimate effects for highly correlated exposure measures without the instability of conventional modeling approaches. We found that prenatal concentrations of the metabolite of <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> {{were associated with the}} report of early-eczema but not atopy among children in the cohort. In a cross-sectional analysis, children's urinary concentrations of metabolites of diethyl phthalate and <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> were both associated with higher fractional exhaled nitric oxide, a marker of airway inflammation. These findings suggest several important sources of exposure to phthalates and demonstrate new methods for highly correlated exposures that have not been widely applied in the environmental health sciences. The association of biomarkers of exposure to <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> and eczema extend the findings of previous studies.

40|$|Phthalates are {{endocrine}} disruptors frequently {{occurring in}} the general and industrial environment and in many industrial products. Moreover, they are also suspected of being carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic, and they show diverse toxicity profiles depending on their structures. The European Union and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) have included many phthalates {{in the list of}} priority substances with potential endocrine-disrupting action. They are: dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DINP), di-iso-decyl phthalate (DIDP), di-n-decyl phthalate (DnDP), and dioctyl phthalate (DOP).

To predict possible human exposure to phthalates in cosmetics, the levels of DEHP, diethyl phtha-late (DEP), DBP, and <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBP) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 102 branded hair sprays, perfumes, deodorants, and nail polishes.

One hundred and forty-eight Taiwanese maternal and infant pairs were recruited from E-Da hospital in southern Taiwan between 2009 and 2010 for analysis. One-spot urine samples and blood samples in the third trimester of pregnant women and their cord blood samples at delivery were collected. Nine phthalate metabolites in urine were determined by triple quadrupole liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, whereas serum from pregnant women and their cord blood were used to measure thyroid profiles (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], thyroxine, free thyroxine, and triiodothyronine) by radioimmunoassay. Median levels of urinary mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono-ethyl phthalate, and mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate (Î¼g/g creatinine) were the three highest phthalate metabolites, which were 37. 81, 34. 51, and 21. 73, respectively.

40|$|Sewage, {{a complex}} mixture of organic and {{inorganic}} chemicals, {{is considered to}} be a major source of environmental pollution. A random screen of 20 organic man-made chemicals present in liquid effluents revealed that half appeared able to interact with the estradiol receptor. This was demonstrated by their ability to inhibit binding of 17 beta-estradiol to the fish estrogen receptor. Further studies, using mammalian estrogen screens in vitro, revealed that the two phthalate esters <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBP) and di-n-butylphthalate (DBP) and a food antioxidant, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were estrogenic; however, they were all less estrogenic than the environmental estrogen octylphenol. Phthalate esters, used in the production of various plastics (including PVC), are among the most common industrial chemicals. Their ubiquity in the environment and tendency to bioconcentrate in animal fat are well known. Neither BBP nor DBP were able to act as antagonists, indicating that, in the presence of endogenous estrogens, their overall effect would be cumulative. Recently, it has been suggested that environmental estrogens may be etiological agents in several human diseases, including disorders of the male reproductive tract and breast and testicular cancers.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{assessed}} {{the health risks}} for children exposed to phthalate through several pathways including house dust, surface wipes and hand wipes in child facilities and indoor playgrounds. Methods: The indoor samples were collected from various childrenâ€™s facilities (40 playrooms, 42 daycare centers, 44 kindergartens, and 42 indoor-playgrounds) in both summer (Jul-Sep, 2007) and winter (Jan-Feb, 2008). Hazard index (HI) was estimated for the non-carcinogens and the examined phthalates were diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBzP). The present study examined these four kinds of samples, i. e., indoor dust, surface wipes of product and hand wipes. Results: Among the phthalates, the detection rates of DEHP were 98 % in dust samples, 100 % in surface wipe samples, and 95 % in hand wipe samples. In this study, phthalate levels obtained from floor dust, product surface and childrenâ€™s hand wipe samples were similar to or slightly less compared to previous studies.

40|$|Phthalate esters are {{widespread}} contaminants {{that can}} cause endocrine disruption in vertebrates.

We observed that DEHP has no significant impact on both asexual and sexual reproduction up to 2 mg/L. DBP has a positive effect on asexual reproduction at concentrations from 0. 05 to 1 mg/L, but depresses it at 2 mg/L. Sexual reproduction is only affected with 2 mg/L and the impact observed is negative. BBP displayed a negative impact on both asexual and sexual reproduction at 1 and 2 mg/L. However we showed that the impacts of BBP on fertilization rates observed are due to the decrease in population growth rates at these concentrations and are not due to a direct impact of BBP on the fertilization process. Similar conclusions are likely applicable to the impacts on mixis and production of cysts as well. Our results show that sexual reproduction in B. calyciflorus is not more sensitive than asexual reproduction to any of the substances tested which indicates the mode of action of these molecules is related to general toxicity, not to an interference with potential endocrine regulation of sexual reproduction.

Methods: Phthalate metabolites were measured in spot urine collected from 300 pregnant inner-city women. Children were examined by an allergist or pulmonologist based on the first parental report of wheeze, other respiratory symptoms, and/or use of asthma rescue/controller medication in the preceding 12 months on repeat follow-up questionnaires. Standardized diagnostic criteria were used to classify these children as either having or not having current asthma {{at the time of the}} physician examination. Children without any report of wheeze or the other asthma-like symptoms were classified as nonasthmatics at the time of the last negative questionnaire. Modified Poisson regression analyses were used to estimate relative risks (RR) controlling for specific gravity and potential confounders. Results: Of 300 children, 154 (51 %) were examined by a physician because of reports of wheeze, other asthma-like symptoms, and/or medication use; 94 were diagnosed with current asthma and 60 without current asthma. The remaining 146 children were classified as nonasthmatic.

40|$|Recent {{cross-sectional}} {{studies suggest}} {{a link between}} <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBzP) in house dust and childhood eczema. |We aimed to evaluate whether concentrations of monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), the main BBzP metabolite in urine, during pregnancy are associated prospectively with eczema in young children, and whether this association varies by the child's sensitization to indoor allergens or serological evidence of any allergies. |MBzP was measured in spot urine samples during the third trimester of pregnancy from 407 African-American and Dominican women residing in New York City in 1999 - 2006. Repeated questionnaires asked mothers whether their doctor ever said their child had eczema. Child blood samples at 24, 36, and 60 months of age were analyzed for total, anti-cockroach, dust mite, and mouse IgE. Relative risks (RR) were estimated with multivariable modified Poisson regression. Analyses included a multinomial logistic regression model for early- and late-onset eczema versus no eczema through 60 months of age. |MBzP was detected in > 99 % of samples (geometric mean = 13. 6; interquartile range: 5. 7 - 31. 1 ng/mL). By 24 months, 30 % of children developed eczema, with the proportion higher among African Americans (48 %) than among Dominicans (21 %) (p < 0. 001). An interquartile range increase in log MBzP concentration was associated positively with early-onset eczema (RR = 1. 52 for eczema by 24 months; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 21, 1. 91, p = 0. 0003, n = 113 reporting eczema/ 376 total sample), adjusting for urine specific gravity, sex, and race/ethnicity. MBzP {{was not associated with}} allergic sensitization, nor did seroatopy modify consistently the MBzP and eczema association. |Prenatal exposure to BBzP may influence the risk of developing eczema in early childhood...|$|E
40|$|Background: Phthalates are {{ubiquitous}} environmental contaminants. Because {{of potential}} {{adverse effects on}} human health, <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> [BBzP; metabolite, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) ], di-n-butyl phthalate [DnBP; metabolite, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) ], and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are being replaced by substitutes including other phthalates; however, {{little is known about}} consequent trends in population-level exposures. Objective: We examined temporal trends in urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in the general U. S. population and whether trends vary by sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: We combined data on 11 phthalate metabolites for 11, 071 participants from five cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001 - 2010). Percent changes and least square geometric means (LSGMs) were calculated from multivariate regression models. Results: LSGM concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, MnBP, MBzP, and Î£DEHP metabolites decreased between 2001 - 2002 and 2009 - 2010 [percent change (95 % CI) : - 42 % (- 49, - 34); - 17 % (- 23, - 9); - 32 % (- 39, - 23) and - 37 % (- 46, - 26), respectively]. In contrast, LSGM concentrations of monoisobutyl phthalate, mono(3 -carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), monocarboxyoctyl phthalate, and monocarboxynonyl phthalate (MCNP) increased over the study period [percent change (95 % CI) : 206 % (178, 236); 25 % (8, 45); 149 % (102, 207); and 15 % (1, 30), respectively]. Trends varied by subpopulations for certain phthalates. For example, LSGM concentrations of Î£DEHP metabolites, MCPP, and MCNP were higher in children than adults, but the gap between groups narrowed over time (p interaction < 0. 01). Conclusions: Exposure of the U. S. population to phthalates has changed in the last decade. Data gaps make it difficult to explain trends, but legislative activity and advocacy campaigns by nongovernmental organizations {{may play a role in}} changing trends...|$|E
40|$|The {{variability}} and {{predictors of}} urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in preschool-aged children {{have not been}} thoroughly examined. Additionally, the impact of temporal changes in the use and restriction of phthalates in children's products has not been assessed. Our objective was to identify demographic, behavioral, and temporal predictors of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in young children. Between 2004 and 2011, we collected up to five urine samples from each of 296 children participating in a prospective birth cohort during annual study visits at ages 1 - 5 years. We used linear mixed models to calculate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), a measure of within-individual reproducibility, and identify demographic predictors of urinary phthalate metabolites. We used multivariable linear regression to examine cross-sectional relationships between food packaging or personal care product use and phthalate metabolites measured at age 5 years. Across annual measurements, monoethyl phthalate exhibited the least variation (ICC = 0. 38), while di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (3 DEHP) metabolites exhibited the most variation (ICC = 0. 09). Concentrations changed with age, suggesting age-related changes in phthalate exposure and perhaps metabolism. Our findings suggest that fast food consumption may {{be a source of}} <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> and di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) exposure, and some personal care products may be sources of diethyl phthalate exposure. Concentrations of 3 DEHP metabolites decreased over the study period; however, concentrations of DiNP metabolites increased. This finding suggests that manufacturer practices and regulations, like the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, may decrease DEHP exposure, but additional work characterizing the nature and toxicity of replacements is critically needed.

40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} {{phthalate}} exposures may adversely affect child respiratory health. |We evaluated associations between asthma diagnosed in children between 5 and 11 {{years of age}} and prenatal exposures to <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBzP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP). |Phthalate metabolites were measured in spot urine collected from 300 pregnant inner-city women. Children were examined by an allergist or pulmonologist based on the first parental report of wheeze, other respiratory symptoms, and/or use of asthma rescue/controller medication in the preceding 12 months on repeat follow-up questionnaires. Standardized diagnostic criteria were used to classify these children as either having or not having current asthma {{at the time of the}} physician examination. Children without any report of wheeze or the other asthma-like symptoms were classified as nonasthmatics at the time of the last negative questionnaire. Modified Poisson regression analyses were used to estimate relative risks (RR) controlling for specific gravity and potential confounders. |Of 300 children, 154 (51 %) were examined by a physician because of reports of wheeze, other asthma-like symptoms, and/or medication use; 94 were diagnosed with current asthma and 60 without current asthma. The remaining 146 children were classified as nonasthmatic. Compared with levels in nonasthmatics, prenatal metabolites of BBzP and DnBP were associated with a history of asthma-like symptoms (p 70 % higher among children with maternal prenatal BBzP and DnBP metabolite concentrations in the third versus the first tertile. |Prenatal exposure to BBzP and DnBP may increase the risk of asthma among inner-city children.

40|$|AbstractThe German Environmental Specimen Bank (ESB) {{continuously}} collects 24 -h urine samples {{since the}} early 1980 s in Germany. In this study we analyzed 300 urine samples from the years 2007 to 2015 for 21 phthalate metabolites (representing exposure to 11 parent phthalates) and combined the data with two previous retrospective measurement campaigns (1988 to 2003 and 2002 to 2008). The combined dataset comprised 1162 24 -h urine samples spanning the years 1988 to 2015. With this detailed set of human biomonitoring data we describe {{the time course of}} phthalate exposure in Germany over a time frame of 27 years. For the metabolites of the endocrine disrupting phthalates di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBzP) we observed a roughly ten-fold decline in median metabolite levels from their peak levels in the late 1980 s/early 1990 s compared to most recent levels from 2015. Probably, bans (first enacted in 1999) and classifications/labelings (enacted in 2001 and 2004) in the European Union lead to this drop. A decline in di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP) metabolite levels set in only quite recently, possibly due to its later classification as a reproductive toxicant in the EU in 2009. In a considerable number of samples collected before 2002 health based guidance values (BE, HBM I) have been exceeded for DnBP (27. 2 %) and DEHP (2. 3 %) but also in recent samples some individual exceedances can still be observed (DEHP 1. 0 %). A decrease in concentration for all low molecular weight phthalates, labelled or not, was seen in the most recent years of sampling. For the high molecular weight phthalates, DEHP seems to have been substituted in part by di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP), but DiNP metabolite levels have also been declining in the last years. Probably, non-phthalate alternatives increasingly take over for the phthalates in Germany. A comparison with NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from the United States covering the years 1999 to 2012 revealed both similarities and differences in phthalate exposure between Germany and the US. Exposure to critical phthalates has decreased in both countries with metabolite levels more and more aligning with each other, but high molecular weight phthalates substituting DEHP (such as DiNP) seem to become more important in the US than in Germany...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundSystemic {{absorption}} of phthalates and parabens {{has been demonstrated}} after dermal application of body lotion, and medical devices such as intravenous bags and tubing {{have been identified as}} a source of exposure to di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). However, use of products during medical procedures such as aqueous gel applied during obstetrical ultrasound in pregnancy has not been investigated as a potential source of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure. Human studies have associated EDCs with various adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is a need to identify sources of inadvertent exposure to EDCs especially during vulnerable developmental periods such as pregnancy. ObjectivesWe conducted a pilot study to determine whether use of gel during routine obstetrical ultrasound increased urinary concentrations of phthalate and phenol biomarkers. MethodsWe recruited 13 women from the Massachusetts General Hospital who provided spot urine samples {{at the time of their}} second trimester anatomic survey. The first sample was collected prior to the procedure (pre-exposure, time 1), and two additional samples were obtained at approximately 12 Ì† 0132 hours (time 2) and 72 Ì† 01312 hours (time 3) post-exposure following the scan. ResultsUrinary concentrations of several DEHP metabolites and metabolite of diisononyl cyclohexane- 1, 2 -dicarboxylate (DINCH) increased across time. For example, the geometric mean concentrations of mono(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate increased from 3. 1 ng/ml to 7. 1 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 03) between time 1 and time 3. We also observed significant differences in concentrations of metabolites of <b>butylbenzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBzP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP). For example, mono-n-butyl phthalate (metabolite of DnBP) decreased from 3. 5 ng/ml to 1. 8 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 04) between time 1 and time 2, but then increased to 6. 6 ng/ml (p-value= 0. 002) at time 3. Propylparaben concentrations increased from 8. 9 ng/ml to 33. 6 ng/ml between time 1 and time 2 (p-value= 0. 005), followed by a decrease to 12. 9 ng/ml at time 3 (p-value= 0. 01). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the observed differences are due to other sources of exposure to these compounds. ConclusionsWhile additional research is needed, this pilot study potentially identifies a previously unknown source of phthalate and paraben exposure among pregnant women undergoing routine ultrasound examination.
