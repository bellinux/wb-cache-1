2500|$|As for humidity, the preservationist or {{conservator}} should aim for {{a relative}} humidity of 50%, though, as with temperature, some small fluctuation is allowable, {{as long as}} it occurs gradually (Mailand). [...] In enclosed display or storage cases, humidity can be somewhat maintained through the use of silica gel crystals. [...] These crystals should not be placed in contact with the textiles, but may be placed in breathable muslin bags and hung inside the case to maintain a constant humidity; they should be monitored periodically, however, to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are working.|$|E
2500|$|This ten-day process, {{known as}} [...] "Rookie Week," [...] is usually {{held in the}} last couple weeks of February. It is this week in which riders go through a literal [...] "crash" [...] course in bike and track basics. Everyday, Monday through Friday, there are two hours and fifteen minute track times held {{separately}} for men and women. Rookies must be present for 100% of the time for which they are available. (For the most part, the only accepted excuses are school and health related.) Rookies that do not comply with this, earn their team a two-second penalty on race day. During the ten days, Rookies are trained by members of the Rider's Council on how to ride in packs, ride in pacelines, draft, mount and dismount, and how to perform full exchanges. At the end [...] "Rookie Week" [...] all rookies are tested to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are able to demonstrate all the necessary skills that one needs to be a safe and successful rider.|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not. But {{your watch}} will {{probably}} be in vain, for tigers are uncommonly sagacious creatures and {{seem to me to}} have exceptional powers for scenting danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{makes no}} difference, sire," [...] Sir Walter replied. [...] "I will place him {{among the young}} gentlemen, my pages and esquires, and <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will receive {{him as one of}} themselves." ...|$|R

60|$|But {{their first}} {{surprise}} was past, the Settlement men, who were quick-witted people, {{entered into the}} spirit of the plot readily enough; indeed, Peter caused them to repeat the story to him, so that he might <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had its details by heart.|$|E
