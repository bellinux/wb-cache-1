50|$|The {{company offers}} a {{comprehensive}} range of pattress boxes, dry lining boxes and <b>bulkhead</b> <b>light</b> fittings.|$|E
40|$|Most {{people do}} not think of {{darkness}} as a luxury. But {{if you live in}} a council flat with a <b>bulkhead</b> <b>light</b> shining into your window all night long, you might. Light, especially in the urban realm, is a powerful thing. People make spaces through light, it is the stuff of our everyday lives … so perhaps it is not surprising that it reinforces the growing social inequality in our towns and cities...|$|E
50|$|In 2005, it was {{reported}} that Danny F II had been detained at Adelaide because of defects which included holed <b>bulkheads,</b> defective navigation <b>lights</b> and radio equipment and defective watertight doors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{underwater}} protection {{consisted of}} a [...] "sandwich" [...] of void spaces, <b>light</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> liquid loading compartments, compartments filled with rubber-based, water-excluding compound called ébonite-mousse, and a heavy internal holding bulkhead to absorb the explosion of a torpedo warhead.|$|R
25|$|As on Dunkerque, the {{underwater}} protection {{consisted of a}} sandwich of void spaces, <b>light</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> liquid loading compartments or compartments filled with a rubber-based water-excluding compound (ébonite-mousse), and a heavy internal holding bulkhead to absorb the explosion of a torpedo head.|$|R
50|$|The ship started {{life as the}} Cleopatra, a mixed {{passenger}} liner and animal carrier. She was built alongside four others at Earle's Shipbuilding and Engine Company, Hull, for the Wilson & Furness-Leyland Line. She was rated A1 at Lloyd's of London. She was built for 'safety at sea' and was equipped with eight watertight <b>bulkheads,</b> failsafe <b>lighting</b> and pumping systems, eight lifeboats capable of carrying 59 passengers each and three compasses. She could carry 120 first class passengers, with stalls for 700 cattle.|$|R
50|$|The {{underwater}} protection {{was exactly}} the same (7m wide) as on Richelieu. It consisted of a sandwich of void spaces, <b>light</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> liquid loading compartments or compartments filled with a rubber-based water-excluding compound (ébonite-mousse), and a heavy internal holding bulkhead to absorb the explosion of a torpedo head.|$|R
50|$|As on Dunkerque, the {{underwater}} protection {{consisted of a}} sandwich of void spaces, <b>light</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> liquid loading compartments or compartments filled with a rubber-based water-excluding compound (ébonite-mousse), and a heavy internal holding bulkhead to absorb the explosion of a torpedo head. The maximum width was around 7 m. The reduction of 0.5 m in comparison with Dunkerque was necessary to accommodate three boilers {{side by side in}} the boiler rooms.|$|R
40|$|Bending {{tests were}} made of two {{circular}} cylinders of corrugated aluminum-alloy sheet. In each test failure occurred by bending of the corrugations in a plane normal to the skin. It was found, after analysis {{of the effect of}} short end bays, that the computed stress on the extreme fiber of a corrugated cylinder is in excess of that for a flat panel of the same basic pattern and panel length tested as a pin-ended column. It is concluded that this increased strength was due to the effects of curvature of the pitch line. It is also concluded from the tests that <b>light</b> <b>bulkheads</b> closely spaced strengthen corrugated cylinders very materially...|$|R
500|$|A shell, {{falling short}} and {{travelling}} underwater, struck below the armoured belt and penetrated to a magazine. During the same action, Prince of Wales received a hit {{of this type}} from a 15-inch shell, which travelled underwater for about 80 feet (25 m), struck about 28 feet (8 m) below the waterline, penetrated several <b>light</b> <b>bulkheads</b> and fetched up, without exploding, against the torpedo bulkhead. The second board considered this theory improbable, arguing that the fuse, had it worked at all, would have detonated the shell before it reached the ship. According to Jurens's calculations, one of Bismarcks shells that fell approximately [...] short of Hood could have penetrated {{the side of the}} ship beneath the armour belt and would have detonated {{in the vicinity of the}} ship's magazines if the fuse worked.|$|R
5000|$|After the 1 April {{amphibious assault}} on Okinawa, she {{continued}} to screen the larger ships of TG 54.3 and provided call fire {{in support of the}} troops ashore. Her combat service, however, proved extremely short; less than a month, in fact. On the afternoon of 12 April, she was screening the battleship [...] when three Japanese [...] "Jills" [...] made a coordinated attack on her. They came at the destroyers port quarter from an altitude of about 15 ft above water. Zellars rang up 25 kn to unmask all batteries and opened fire. She splashed the lead attacker at a range of 1800 yd and caught the second some 3000 yd away. The destroyer then shifted fire to the third intruder and began scoring 40-millimeter hits on him. The Japanese pilot, however, pressed home his attack and crashed into Zellars port side, forward of the bridge in her number 2 handling room. His 500-kilogram bomb tore through several <b>light</b> <b>bulkheads</b> before exploding on the starboard side of the ship in the scullery. She temporarily lost all power, and the fireroom had to be secured. Meanwhile, the after 20-millimeter guns continued to ward off additional tormentors and assisted in splashing another plane. That evening, she limped into Kerama Retto with extensive damage. After temporary patching, the destroyer headed back toward the United States and arrived at Terminal Island, California, on 1 June. During some two and one-half months in which the ship underwent repairs and overhaul, World War II ended.|$|R
