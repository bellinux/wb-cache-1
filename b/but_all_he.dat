5|$|After {{the school}} bus is destroyed, Homer is forced to drive several {{students}} to school. Along the way, he listens to a classic rock radio station and is shocked to discover {{that all of the}} kids hate it. After several more days of the kids hating his music, Homer visits a music store and realizes that what he likes is no longer considered cool. As a result, Homer decides to take Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival. At the festival, Homer tries to act cool by wearing a Rastafarian hat, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> does is humiliate himself and is confronted by an angry crowd of Generation Xers who mistake him for a narc. After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs at his stomach. The festival head is impressed and Homer is hired {{as a part of the}} festival's freak show.|$|E
25|$|Demeter of Mysia had {{a seven-day}} festival at Pellené in Arcadia. Pausanias passed the shrine to Demeter at Mysia {{on the road}} from Mycenae to Argos <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> could draw out to explain the archaic name was a myth of an eponymous Mysius who venerated Demeter.|$|E
500|$|At dinner, Peter {{breaks the}} news to his children, but decides {{to keep it from}} Lois. He tries {{different}} jobs, such as cereal mascot and sneeze guard, but fails miserably. Brian pressures him to tell her the truth, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> manages to do is to tell Lois how fat she is. Brian insists that Peter must look out for his family's welfare. With the word [...] "welfare" [...] in his mind, Peter soon applies for a government assistance at a welfare office. But a processing error creates a weekly check for $150,000. Telling Lois he received a big raise, Peter spends his money on many foolish and extravagant things, such as renting the Statue of David, treating Meg to cosmetic surgery and even {{going so far as to}} surround his house with a moat to protect them from the Black Knight.|$|E
60|$|He {{started by}} sneering {{at the little}} game that Squire Brown 'ad left, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>'e</b> could do didn't seem to make much difference; things {{disappeared}} in a most eggstrordinary way, and the keepers went pretty near crazy, while the things the squire said about Claybury and Claybury men was disgraceful.|$|R
60|$|They {{turned the}} room upside down pretty near, and then Ginger Dick struck a match {{and looked up}} the chimney, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>'e</b> found was that it 'adn't been swept for about twenty years, and wot with temper and soot 'e looked so frightful that Peter was arf afraid of 'im.|$|R

500|$|Gerald {{tells us}} further that a Breton knight {{had come to}} the church for Mass and found a band of about twenty young men, all armed and {{equipped}} according to the local custom. He asked [...] "which was the abbot, and they pointed out to him a man with a long spear in his hand, who was walking in front of the others". He then {{tells the story of the}} murder of a bishop of Llanbadarn, murdered by the predecessors of the present generation of clergy. We cannot be sure how much of this was true. But Gerald disapproved of married clergy (which had been declining generally though only finally abolished by Rome in the eleventh century and deplored in principle the inheritance of church office. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> tells us of Llanbadarn is hearsay, apart from the name of the abbot. In any case, no move was made by Archbishop Baldwin in favour of reform: the Lord Rhys was with them, and they would not have wished to offend him. In any event, it would have been a matter for the Bishop of St David's, who was Peter de Leia. There is then no further information about Llanbadarn for nearly sixty years.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few minutes}} before 3:00p.m. at about [...] in {{altitude}} and near Mineral, Washington, he gave up his search and started heading eastward towards Yakima. He saw a bright flashing light, similar to sunlight reflecting from a mirror. Afraid he might be dangerously close to another aircraft, Arnold scanned the skies around him, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> could see was a DC-4 to his left and behind him, about [...] away.|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{thought that}} {{by using the}} word [...] "dogma", Crick was {{implying}} {{that this was a}} rule that could not be questioned, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> really meant was that it was a compelling idea without much solid evidence to support it. In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology. Crick had by this time become a highly influential theoretical molecular biologist.|$|E
60|$|He stopped. Jefferson was his friend, <b>but</b> after <b>all</b> <b>he</b> was to {{some extent}} his employer's antagonist. The other noted his pause.|$|R

2500|$|The mournful Soliquisto, a once {{great music}} hall artiste, {{believes}} {{he has come to}} the end of his career. [...] He used to headline halls like the Hackney Empire, but now he is lucky to play small rooms at the end of piers. [...] His act has always consisted of trained animals: a singing parakeet (Parakeet to Meet You), and two all-dancing, all-singing catsone male, Stinkfoot, and one female, Persian Moll. [...] Each of these were creations of true brilliance, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> has left now is Moll, his ventriloquist's dummy Screwy, and his eager nephew and assistant Buster. [...] He and his company ("Soliquisto & His Not So Dumb Friends") have returned for a week’s engagement at the very end-of-the-pier venue where nine years before he had mysteriously lost his famous songbird and his most precious creation, the even more famous Stinkfoot. [...] Buster works with him, acting in all capacities: props, costumes, manager, and even as a ludicrous stand-in for the lost Stinkfoot. [...] Buster is ambitious, and knows his uncle was once the best. [...] He is convinced there’s a secret to being a true artist and if only Solisquisto would tell him that secret, Buster too could be a great artist. [...] Soliquisto has told Buster in every way he can what the secret is, most pointedly in the song Follow Your Nose, but Buster cannot “hear” him.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the 1978 season, Oakland owner Finley again {{sought to}} discard Coleman, {{asking him to}} report to the Athletics' minor league club in Vancouver. [...] Coleman refused and {{compiled}} a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. [...] Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000. [...] Finley reportedly [...] "blew his top" [...] after Coleman gave up a home run to Chicago's Lamar Johnson. Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. [...] Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. [...] Coleman noted {{at the time that he}} was happy to escape Finley. [...] After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: [...] "He's a very fine old man, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> does is throw that slop up there. Maybe he can do all right. He doesn't throw hard enough now to break a pane of glass. He was spending his spare time trying to teach our young guys to pitch. [...] How can he do that when he can't pitch himself?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1816, Lays had the {{satisfaction}} of enjoying one final triumph in the comic opera Le rossignol by Louis-Sébastien Lebrun (1764–1829), set {{in the foothills of}} his native Pyrenees. Lays took one of his favourite stock parts, [...] "a bailiff in his fifties, a lover of good food and beautiful young women, naive and credulous, convinced of his own powers of seduction. The audience, at first amused and then enthralled, gave him a standing ovation which cheered his heart." [...] However, things subsequently took a turn for the worse. In 1817, the restored Intendant of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi, Papillon de la Ferté abolished all additional emoluments granted by Napoleon, leaving the singer to survive on his meagre salary from the school of music and the minimum pay from the Opéra, at the very time when his son, stricken with tuberculosis, required expensive medical treatment and his four daughters needed money for their dowries. Lays turned to Luigi Cherubini. Lays had repeatedly supported Cherubini when Napoleon had shown signs of dislike for the composer. Cherubini had now become one of the leading figures in the musical establishment under the Restoration. He immediately intervened on Lays's behalf, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> could obtain from Ferté was the advice that the singer should go {{on a tour of the}} provinces as a way of supplementing his income.Having obtained leave of absence, Lays appeared in Nancy (where performances were interrupted by the death of the leading soprano) and Strasbourg, where Lays himself was obliged to interrupt them with disastrous effects on his finances: he had been unexpectedly summoned back to Paris on the pretext he was urgently needed for rehearsals of a new opera, Les jeux floraux; in reality, the rehearsals only took place two months later. Lays then applied to the royal administration, insisting he should be granted some of the potential economic benefits provided by law, but, after the new opera's premiere, his demands received a blanket rejection. According to Quéruel, when he protested stridently about this decision, he was forced into unpaid leave from his theatrical activities in late 1818. He subsequently spent about two years of hardship, during which his need to provide a dowry for his eldest daughter Marie-Cécile forced him further into debt.|$|E
