25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that wheat is beneficial {{to grow in}} the off season compared to other crops as its planting occurs, depending on the agro-climatic condition, in late fall or early spring. This results in reduced application of fertilizers and pesticides and less need for irrigation, and helps in preventing soil erosion. However some of the negative effects identified in a study conducted by the FAO are natural habitat loss due to encroachment into new lands after degraded lands are abandoned, loss of indigenous species affecting the biodiversity, and milling operation causing dust pollution. Historically, habitat conversion in the US has occurred in agropastoral land areas as in many other countries and is considered a natural development. In the western US, habitat conversion is still an ongoing process due to the subsidies provided by the government for wheat and other crops in the US has made it financially profitable to develop areas which otherwise would lie fallow; <b>bluestem</b> prairie is one such area. However, habitat expansion for wheat has stabilized since 2000.|$|E

25|$|Tallgrass prairies {{are found}} in the {{southern}} and eastern section of the great plains. It once covered 170 million acres in North America. Now, less than 4% remains, mostly in the Kansas Flint Hills. This area is lower and wetter than the High Plains and is warmer than many other regions. Some areas here receive more than 40 inches of annual precipitation. Grasses here include <b>bluestems,</b> along with many other species. Historically, many areas of the Midwest that are now forested were once tallgrass prairie. Fire is very important in maintaining the prairie. Without it, many areas can become forested.|$|R
50|$|Factors {{such as the}} patchiness of {{vegetation}} and species composition of the ground layer may affect habitat suitability by influencing foraging success {{and the availability of}} food and nesting material. In Georgia, Bachman's sparrows did not occur in open areas with uniformly dense herbaceous vegetation, despite these sites having a similar volume {{of vegetation}} ≤3 feet (1 m) above ground as recently burned pineland sites that were occupied by Bachman's sparrow. Although measurements were not taken, observations of Bachman's sparrow in clearcuts in eastern Texas suggest they may favor tall grass in clumpy rather that uniform distribution. In loblolly and shortleaf pine plantations of Arkansas, explanations suggested for a lack of evidence of ground layer features influencing selection of breeding territories included importance of habitat characteristics that were not measured, such as patchiness of the herbaceous layer and species composition. In a predominantly longleaf pine forest in Georgia, Bachman's sparrows were significantly (p=0.04) more abundant in areas where ground cover was primarily Beyrich threeawn (Aristida beyrichiana), compared to relatively disturbed communities of <b>bluestems</b> (Andropogon spp.) and silkgrass (Pityopsis spp.).|$|R
40|$|This {{potential}} {{natural vegetation}} group {{is common to}} the Interior Highlands and xeric upland sites {{to the south and}} west of the Mississippi River. In Highlands it occupies all but steep north slopes at all elevations. This vegetation type is found along sandstone ridges. Moisture regime is xeric to dry-mesic. This group also occurs on gently dissected upland cherty plains in Missouri (in addition to sandstone ridges). In the Missouri Ozarks, this type is primarily confined to gently to moderately sloping, upland plains and is distinguished from R 5 OAHIdy, which occurs on more steeply dissected ridges and steep southwest facing slopes. Vegetation Description In the northern part of this geographic area shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), xeric oaks and some hickory dominate the overstory with a high percentage of oak on steep north slopes and on post oak (Quercus stellata) flats. Associated species include post oak, blackjack oak (Quercus marylandica), mockernut hickory (Carya alba) on drier sites and to the west black hickory (Carya texana).

As this area is now under protection, it can be restored to the status of pine barrens, especially with the use of controlled burning. The remaining pine barrens are dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida), a tall shrub layer consisting of bear oak and dwarf chestnut oak (Quercus ilicifolia and Quercus prinoides), and a low shrub layer composed of lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium and Vaccinium pallidum), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), and sweet fern (Comptonia peregrina). Between areas of pitch pine-scrub oak barrens are small patches of grassland dominated by prairie grasses, including big <b>bluestem</b> (Andropogon gerardi), little <b>bluestem</b> (Schizachyrium scoparium), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), as well as small trees like the shrubby willows (Salix humilis and Salix tristis).

40|$|Major {{changes in}} {{grassland}} {{have now been}} followed for a decade over a considerable portion of true prairie in Nebraska and Kansas. The replacement of portions of this association by mixed prairie has been described (Weaver, 2 ̆ 743). This major change resulted from the enormous increase or invasion of western wheat grass (Agropyron smithii) {{and the development of}} an understory of blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis) or buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides). But numerous areas of true prairie were only partially occupied by western wheat grass. Nearly all of the original cover of <b>bluestems</b> and associated species, however, was greatly opened if not completely destroyed by successive years of desiccation (1934 to 1940). Some degree of recovery was attained during the best years of the dry cycle {{and at the end of}} the drought several types or communities of vegetation formed a veritable mosaic in the prairie landscape. In this paper the vegetation of four representative prairies is described as it appeared at the end of the drought.

40|$|The {{long period}} of desiccation, which began in 1934, finally {{terminated}} in 1940. The western portion of True Prairie was greatly decimated and a veritable mosaic of types of vegetation resulted. These ranged from well-preserved relict communities of <b>bluestems</b> (Andropogon) to mixed stands of grasses on nearly bared soil, but included communities of western wheat grass (Agropyron smithii), short grasses (Bouteloua gracilis and Buchloe dactyloides), needle grass (Stipa spartea), and prairie drop seed (Sporobolus heterolepis). These types varied in size from a few square rods to many acres (fig. 1). One 15 - acre prairie, which was mapped in detail, revealed five types, each of which was dominated by a single species, and eight mixed types where two species in each were in definite control. Some {{of these types of}} vegetation, moreover, recurred in several parts of this prairie. Over the entire western margin of True Prairie, wide areas of soil were often still open to invaders in 1940 and others were populated only thinly by individuals of a potential grassland type. Even the vegetation in relict communities had usually been greatly thinned by the drought, and dynamic development involved in mutual invasions, competition, and reaction was pronounced (fig. 2). In this process of revegetation western wheat grass played an important part...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} the ALMANAC model in simulating leaf canopy growth and biomass production of a plant functional group, specifically “exotic warm-season perennial grasses,” represented by buffelgrass [Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link] and “Old World Bluestems” (Bothriochloa Kuntze, Capillipedium Stapf, and Dichanthium Willemet). Study Design: Leaf area index (LAI) over the growing season, the light extinction coefficient (k) for Beer's Law, and the radiation use efficiency (RUE) were quantified for Old World <b>Bluestems</b> and buffelgrass. Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted in central Oklahoma in 2005 and 2007 and in south-central Texas in 2008 and 2009. Methodology: Serial dates of measurement over the growing season of leaf area index, light extinction coefficient for Beer's Law, and the radiation use efficiency were used to quantify these growth parameters for simulation modeling. Results: All assayed grasses in the exotic warm-season perennial grasses functional group had similar values for LAI (mean = 4), k (mean = - 0. 5), and RUE (mean = 1. 3 g MJ- 1 IPAR). Conclusion: When these parameters were applied in a simulation model, the model successfully simulated mean yields near the reported yields for exotic warm-season perennial grasses on all simulated soils in Texas and Oklahoma and in Mexico. These results suggest that with further parameterization, the applicability of such process-based models could be expanded from species simulation to functional group simulation, whereby land managers could determine potential adaptability, water use, soil erosion, and forage productivity of various plant functional groups over a wide range of soils and climatic conditions...|$|R
