40|$|Surface {{modification}} of silica by acetylene plasma polymerization is applied {{in order to}} improve the dispersion in and compatibility with single rubbers and their blends. Silica, used as a reinforcing filler for elastomers, is coated with a polyacetylene (PA) film under vacuum conditions. Water penetration measurements show a change in surface energy due to the PA-film deposition. The weight loss measured by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) is higher for the PA-coated silica compared to the untreated filler, confirming the deposition of the PA film on the silica surface. Time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) shows the well-defined PA cluster peaks in the high mass region. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements show silica aggregates, coalesced by the coating with smooth and uniform surfaces, but without significant change in specific surface area. Elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements also confirms the deposition of the polymeric film on the silica surface, as the carbon content is increased. The performance of single polymers and their incompatible blends based on S-SBR and EPDM, filled with untreated, PA- and silane-treated silica, is investigated by measurements of the <b>bound</b> <b>rubber</b> content, weight loss related to <b>bound</b> <b>rubber,</b> cure kinetics, reinforcement parameter, Payne effect, and mechanical properties. The PA- and silane-modified silica-filled pure S-SBR and EPDM samples show a lower filler–filler networking compared to the unmodified silica-filled elastomers. Decrease in the reinforcement parameter (F) for the plasma-polymerized silica-filled samples also proves a better dispersion compared to silane-modified and untreated silica-filled samples.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of silanes to improve processability and properties of silica-reinforced rubber compounds {{is critical to}} the successful commercial use of silica as a filler in tires and other applications. The use of silanes to promote polymer–filler interactions is expected to limit the development of a percolated filler network and may also affect the mobility of polymer chains near the particles. Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) was reinforced with silica particles at a filler volume fraction of 0. 19, and various levels of filler–filler shielding agent (n-octyltriethoxysilane) and polymer– filler coupling agent (3 -mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane) were incorporated. Both types of silane inhibited the filler flocculation process during annealing the uncured rubber materials, thus reducing the magnitude of the Payne effect. In contrast to the significant reinforcement effects noted in the strain-dependent shear modulus, the bulk modulus from hydrostatic compression was largely unaltered by the silanes. Addition of polymer–filler linkages using the coupling agent yielded <b>bound</b> <b>rubber</b> values up to 71 %; however, this <b>bound</b> <b>rubber</b> exhibited glass transition behavior which was similar to the bulk SBR response, as determined by calorimetry and viscoelastic testing.

Reaction parameters such as the mode of initiation, initiator system, reaction time, pH of the reaction medium, swelling time have been investigated in natural rubber latex. Of the free radical generating systems examined the redox system consisted of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide and tetra ethylene pentamine (TBHP/TEP) appeared to be most effective in natural rubber latex. Infra-red spectroscopy has been used to estimate the concentration of the bound anlioxidants and ageing behaviour was assessed by oxygen absorption and continuous stress relaxation. The curing characteristics of the grafted rubber samples were studied in detai 1 using the Monsanto rheometer. It was found that antioxidants which do not contain vinyl groups also react under the same conditions with natural rubber latex. Some of these appeared to be marginally more effective than the corresponding vinyl antioxidants. It was observed {{that in the case of}} the vinyl antioxidants only a part of the added antioxidant grafted into the rubber and the rest remained unchanged or was oxidised to coloured products.
