5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
5|$|Plato, in his Laws, {{set forth}} rules that governed not the ideal state, which he {{described}} in The Republic, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> felt might be obtainable in the real world. Included amongst them were some dealing with inheritance and heiresses. In general outline, they conformed to Athenian practice, with {{the daughter of a}} man who died without male heirs becoming an epikleros. Plato gave rules governing who the husband of the epikleros might be, and said that the inherited plot might not be divided or added to another plot. The main departure from Athenian law came if there was no direct heir, and the inheritance go to collateral relations. In that case, Plato assigned the inheritance not to one person, but to a pair, one male and one female, and ordered that they must marry and provide an heir to the estate, much like the epikleros.|$|E

25|$|<b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{most wanted}} was to write a {{biography}} of Napoleon. Now Sir Walter Scott was writing his own life of Napoleon, from a strictly conservative point of view, and Hazlitt wanted to produce one from a countervailing, liberal perspective. Really, his stance on Napoleon was his own, as he had idolised Napoleon for decades, and he prepared to return to Paris to undertake the research. First, however, he brought to fruition another favourite idea.|$|E

His weekly sermons, which sold for a penny each, were widely circulated and still remain {{one of the all-time}} best selling series of writings published in history.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} December 1744, Saxe had {{prepared}} {{plans for a}} spring offensive in the Low Countries. He had {{made up his mind}} not only as to what he would do, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would compel his enemy to do, correctly calculating the operational and political difficulties that such a diverse opponent would face. This opponent comprised Britain, the Dutch Republic, Austria, and Saxony, who had concluded the defensive Treaty of Warsaw in January 1745 – the Quadruple Alliance – by which all contractants committed themselves to uphold the Pragmatic Sanction and the House of Austria's claim to the imperial crown. To the Low Countries, the British sent the son of King George II, the 24-year-old Duke of Cumberland, as the new captain general of Britain's army, while Maria Theresa sent the experienced Count Königsegg to command Austrian forces. The trio of generals was completed by Prince Waldeck, commander of the Dutch contingent in theatre. They hoped to gain the initiative by the establishment of forward magazines and an early opening of the campaign season. Major supply and ammunition depot magazines were set up for the British by General Ligonier at Ghent, Oudenarde and Tournai, while the Dutch general, Vander – Duyn, placed theirs at Mons, Charleroi and Tournai.|$|E

In his career, Boyd has only ever scored three headed goals, and says that he is much more comfortable with the ball at his feet.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an [...] "A-" [...] rating and praised it in [...] "The romanticism has a {{personal}} dimension – for Edward is, of course, Burton's surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions. Like Edward, he finds the light." [...] He also commented very positively on character of Edward, [...] "... who is Burton's purest achievement as a director so far." [...] Of Depp he wrote, [...] "Depp may not be doing that much acting beneath his neo-Kabuki makeup, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does is tremulous and affecting."

[...] On May 14, with the Rangers trailing 21 in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners, he homered against Brandon Morrow to give the Rangers a 32 victory. After a 1-for-29 slump, Davis hit two home runs on May 26 in a 73 victory over the New York Yankees. He had four hits on June 25, the fourth a 12th-inning two-run home run against Esmerling Vásquez in a 98 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E

500|$|Anarky's {{introduction}} {{during the}} late 1980s {{was part of a}} larger shift among supervillains in the Batman franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to [...] "question the whole bad/good guy divide." [...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really wants is to save the world... and maybe he's right." ...|$|E

Goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig Harbison {{describes}} the blending of realism and symbolism as perhaps [...] "the {{most important aspect}} of early Flemish art". The first generation of Netherlandish painters were preoccupied with making religious symbols more realistic. Van Eyck incorporated a wide variety of iconographic elements, often conveying what he saw as a co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. The iconography was embedded in the work unobtrusively; typically the references comprised small but key background details. The embedded symbols were meant to meld into the scenes and [...] "was a deliberate strategy to create an experience of spiritual revelation". Van Eyck's religious paintings in particular [...] "always present the spectator with a transfigured view of visible reality". [...] To him the day-to-day is harmoniously steeped in symbolism, such that, according to Harbison, [...] "descriptive data were rearranged... so that they illustrated not earthly existence <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered supernatural truth." [...] This blend of the earthly and heavenly evidences van Eyck's belief that the [...] "essential truth of Christian doctrine" [...] can be found in [...] "the marriage of secular and sacred worlds, of reality and symbol". He depicts overly large Madonnas, whose unrealistic size shows the separation between the heavenly from earthly, but placed them in everyday settings such as churches, domestic chambers or seated with court officials.|$|E

500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, {{what you see is}} what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would think of him.|$|E

2500|$|Even with {{a spiritual}} power {{as the answer}} to meaning, another {{question}} arises: What is the purpose of a belief in God? Kierkegaard believed that there is no human-comprehensible purpose of God, making faith in God absurd itself. Camus on the other hand states that to believe in God is to [...] "deny one of the terms of the contradiction" [...] between humanity and the universe (and is therefore not absurd <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls [...] "philosophical suicide"). Camus (as well as Kierkegaard), though, suggests that while absurdity does not lead to belief in God, neither does it lead to the denial of God.
