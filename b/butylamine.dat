Whereas the short chain length <b>butylamines</b> and the longer chain length amines (C s or higher) generally yielded poor emulsions, hexylamine and 2 -ethylhexylamine gave stable emulsions over a wide pit range. The stability of these emulsions is discussed in terms of orientation of the polymer at the droplet-continuous phase interface.

They prevent the droplets of the internal phase from losing their discreteness, even upon close approach. It should be noted that these surface active agents may not influence the rate of cream-ing to any significant degree. Some hydrophilic polymers which act by modifying the rheological properties of the dispersion medium, i. e., viscosity and yield value, may further increase the stability of such emulsions. These polymers act by decreasing the rate of creaming without, in many instances, influencing directly the rate of coalescence...|$|R
40|$|Increasing fuel {{efficiency}} {{has been a}} goal for chemists for several decades. Particularly, a more efficient fuel can increase the range of liquid-hydrocarbon-fueled ram-jets and cruise missiles. A storable high-energy fuel that spontaneously ignites upon addition of an oxidizer {{is defined as a}} hypergolic fuel. Hypergolic storable fuels provide an increase in energy per unit volume of fuel and eliminate the need for an external ignition system. Several classes of functionalized hydrocarbons such as amines, boranes, and phosphines are known to be hypergolic with nitric acid oxidizers, but only hydrazine and its simple derivatives 5 have been found to exhibit true hypergolic behavior with H 2 O 2. Hydrogen peroxide is a good candidate for an oxidizer due to its reduced toxicity and improved storage capability. Hydrazine-based fuels are expensive, highly corrosive, and toxic, thus providing the need for investigation of other fuels that may be hypergolic with H 2 O 2. Strained hydrocarbons have been studied as high-density fuels. Some examples including benzvalene and cubane, exhibit an increase in heat of combustion as the density of the fuel increases. Many conventional hydrocarbon fuels, such as JP- 5 and JP- 10, show a decrease in heat of combustion as density of the fuel increases. Strained hydrocarbons can therefore increase the range of the missile by increasing the combustion efficiency per volume of fuel. The goal of this research is to investigate hypergolic behavior of strained hydrocarbons by adding an amine functional group which has been found to hypergolic with nitric acid oxidizers. N,N-Dimethyl-[3]-triangulane- 7 -methylamine (l), cyclopropylamines (2), cyclobutylamines (3), propylamines (4), and <b>butylamines</b> (5) were synthesized and investigated. The amino group should react with oxygen, providing the initiation step for ring decomposition.

40|$|Femtosecond {{upconversion}} experiment {{has been}} carried out for epicocconone and its <b>butylamine</b> adduct in acetonitrile and tert-butanol. An ultrafast component is found to dominate the decay of fluorescence of epicocconone in acetonitrile solution. Upon reacting with <b>butylamine,</b> a model for the epicocconone-protein adduct, this ultrafast component remains almost unaffected but an additional rise time occurs, indicating the formation of a highly emissive species from the locally excited state. This phenomenon is central to the extraordinary applications of epicocconone in biotechnology. The magnitude of the rise time of the <b>butylamine</b> adduct {{is similar to that of}} the longer component of the decay of epicocconone in acetonitrile, suggesting that the dynamics of epicocconone and its <b>butylamine</b> adduct are similar. The ultrafast component is slowed upon increasing the viscosity of the solvent. This results in a marked increase in quantum yield and suggests that it corresponds to rapid bond isomerization, leading to a nonradiative decay. Surprisingly, in water/sucrose mixtures, the ultrafast component remains unaffected but there is still an increase in quantum yield, suggesting that there are at least two nonradiative pathways, one involving bond isomerization and another involving proton transfer.

Ion pair of propionic acid and <b>butylamine</b> could be re-suspended in hexane by the co-substrate (butanol) with an alcohol: ion pair ratio of 2 : 1.

The basic lipase of Humicola lanuginosa (HLL) present the same pH profile displaced to basic values. A mechanism based on the ionisation of the active site, supported by molecular modelling study, is proposed. About 80 % of the activity disappear when <b>butylamine</b> is used with Crl and HLL. Exchanging <b>butylamine</b> by tert-butylamine allow to recover the activity for HLL but not for Crl. The stucture of the oxyanion hole of the active centre is proposed to be involved in this phenomena. Localisation of the enzyme active sites in the hydrogel is performed via the synthesis of an amphiphilic phosphonate inhibitor (n-dodecyl, n-paranitrophenyl, n-hexylphosphonate) leading to limit the enzymatic activity at the alginate/hexane interface. Dissociation of agglomerate of 100 - 140 µm beads in hexane could be prevented by the use of cationic surfactants (n-cetyl, n-,n-,n-, trimetylammonium chloride, CTAC). Enzyme inactivation (30 %) is probably due to denaturation of lipase molecules located at the interface.

Solubility was partially controlled by the saturated solution pH with the <b>butylamine</b> counterion increasing the solution pH and solubility and dissolution to the greatest extent. As the chain length increased, solubility was reduced due to the increasing lipophilic nature of the counterion. The benzylamine and cyclohexylamine counterions produced crystalline, stable salts but did not improve solubility and dissolution significantly compared to the parent compound. The substitution of hydroxyl groups to tert-butylamine counterions produced an increase in solubility and dissolution. AMP 2 resulted in the most enhanced solubility and dissolution compared to the parent drug but using the tris salt did not further improve solubility due to a very stable crystal lattice structure.
