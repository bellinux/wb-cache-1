It furnishes authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and access control to security node to transmit data packets with IPsec protocol.

The IPsec engine block should be embodied by H/W and in-line mode transaction for high speed IPsec processing. Our VPN-AB is implemented with high speed security processor that supports many cryptographic algorithms and in-line mode. We evaluate a small TCSS communication environment, and measure a performance of VPN-AB in the environment.

40|$|A passive adversary can {{eavesdrop}} stored {{content or}} downloaded content of some storage nodes, {{in order to}} learn illegally about the file stored across a distributed storage system (DSS). Previous work in the literature focuses on code constructions that trade storage capacity for perfect security. In other words, by decreasing the amount of original data that it can store, the system can guarantee that the adversary, which eavesdrops up to a certain number of storage nodes, obtains no information (in Shannon's sense) about the original data. In this work we introduce the concept of <b>block</b> <b>security</b> for DSS and investigate minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) codes that are block secure against adversaries of varied eavesdropping strengths. Such MBR codes guarantee that no information about any group of original data units up to a certain size is revealed, without sacrificing the storage capacity of the system. The size of such secure groups varies according to the number of nodes that the adversary can eavesdrop. We show that code constructions based on Cauchy matrices provide <b>block</b> <b>security.</b> The opposite conclusion is drawn for codes based on Vandermonde matrices. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} designing codes for distributed storage that protect user data against eavesdroppers that can gain access to network links {{as well as individual}} nodes. Our goal is to achieve weak security (also known as <b>block</b> <b>security)</b> that requires that the eavesdroppers {{would not be able to}} decode individual files or combinations of a small number of files. The standard approach for achieving <b>block</b> <b>security</b> is to use a joint design scheme that consists of (inner) storage code and the (outer) coset code. However, jointly designing the codes requires that the user, who pre-processes and stores the files, should know the underlying storage code in order to design the (outer) linear transformation for achieving weak security. In many practical scenarios, such as storing the files on the third party cloud storage system, it may not be possible for the user to know the underlying storage code. In this work, we present universal schemes that separate the outer code design from the storage code design for minimum storage regenerating codes (MSR). Our schemes allow the independent design of the storage code and the outer code. Our schemes use small field size and can be used in a broad range of practical settings.
