25|$|On 5 February 1896 the Lamington, hauling {{fruit from}} Valencia, Spain to New York City ran aground 15 {{miles east of}} the Fire Island Lighthouse. Life saving crews from the Coast Guard Stations at <b>Blue</b> <b>Point,</b> Lone Hill and Bellport were able to rescue much of her crew from the wreck using {{breeches}} buoys on the first day. Salvage operations began almost immediately by men and tugs from the Merritt Wrecking Company, which likely kept her from breaking up during a storm that swept waves in over the deck and pushed her farther inland. At the first break in the storm the remaining crew, and one small Spanish pony, were rescued. After her cargo was removed, she was refloated on 26 February and towed to New York.|$|E
25|$|Care {{should be}} taken when {{consuming}} oysters. Purists insist on eating them raw, with no dressing save perhaps lemon juice, vinegar (most commonly shallot vinegar), or cocktail sauce. Upscale restaurants pair raw oysters with a home-made Mignonette sauce, which consists primarily of fresh chopped shallot, mixed peppercorn, dry white wine and lemon juice or sherry vinegar. Like fine wine, raw oysters have complex flavors that vary greatly among varieties and regions: salty, briny, buttery, metallic, or even fruity. The texture is soft and fleshy, but crisp on the palate. North American varieties include: Kumamoto and Yaquina Bay from Oregon, Duxbury and Wellfleet from Massachusetts, Malpeque from Prince Edward Island, Canada, <b>Blue</b> <b>Point</b> from Long Island, New York, Pemaquid from Maine, and Cape May oysters from New Jersey. Variations in water salinity, alkalinity, and mineral/nutritional content influence their flavor profile.|$|E

The locality, within North Sydney Council, is home to the <b>Blues</b> <b>Point</b> Tower, a controversial residential tower designed by Harry Seidler.

2500|$|Ebbitt House {{struggled}} {{to compete against}} the larger and more lavish Willard Hotel and the Raleigh Hotel (built in 1893). From the late 1860s until the 1910s, it was considered [...] "Army and Navy Headquarters" [...] {{because of the number}} of military personnel who lived there and the large number of veterans' meetings held there. In November 1889, Caleb Willard hired Henry C. Burch and Charles E. Gibbs (both veteran hotel managers in the city) to run Ebbitt House. Over the next two years, Burch and Gibbs completely refurnished all the rooms (adding new furniture and Belgian carpets), re-papered or added painted frescoes to the ceilings, and installed new furniture in the hallways. [...] On the east side was the now-famous Red Parlor, a gentleman's lounge fitted with rich red and gold draperies, fabric wall coverings, and upholstered furniture. [...] The restaurant, called [...] "cheerful and sunny" [...] by the Washington Post, fronted onto 14th Street NW, was lit with crystal chandeliers, and could seat up to 225 people. [...] It was completely remodeled by Burch and Gibbs: guests dined at tables set with tablecloths imported from Scotland, using Haviland & Co. Limoges porcelain china, silver-handled knives and forks manufactured by Reed & Barton, and Bohemian glassware. [...] Cut-glass flower vases, finger bowls, and water bottles were used for serving. [...] Diners sat in high-backed leather chairs. [...] At breakfast, the waiters wore brown cutaway jackets, vests, and pants with a gold stripe, while in the evening they changed into black tuxedos. [...] The kitchen was renovated, with new steam tables and massive coffee urns (manufactured by Brambull, Deane & Co. of New York City) installed. [...] The menu — served buffet-style — included <b>Blue</b> <b>Point</b> oysters, green sea turtle, Kennebec River salmon, mutton, chicken, hominy fritters, stewed diamondback terrapin, canvasback duck, English pheasant, and a variety of vegetables, fruits, cheese, crackers, nuts, pies, and puddings. [...] Wines, whiskeys, and brandies were served from two large storerooms. Despite the success of the changes, Gibbs left Ebbitt House in 1893 after purchasing Wormley's Hotel. Burch became the sole manager of the hotel. He conducted extensive renovations to the exterior of the hotel in 1895. An enormous two-story mansard roof, with central and corner pavilions influenced by the French Beaux-Arts movement, was added to the top floor, replacing the original single-story, restrained mansard roof.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{geometric}} {{spanning tree}} {{of a point}} set S is a tree whose vertex set is S and whose edge set {{is a set of}} non-crossing straight line segments with endpoints in S. Given a set of red points and a set of <b>blue</b> <b>points</b> in the plane, the red/blue spanning tree problem is to find a geometric spanning tree for red points and a geometric spanning tree for <b>blue</b> <b>points</b> such that the number of crossing points of the two trees is a minimum. If no three points are collinear, we show that the minimum number of crossing points is completely determined by the number of maximal red (or blue) chains on the convex hull of all red <b>points</b> and <b>blue</b> <b>points.</b> We design an optimal algorithm for constructing a geometric spanning tree of all the red points and a geometric spanning tree of all the <b>blue</b> <b>points</b> with the minimum number of crossing points. If collinear points are allowed, we prove that the problem of deciding whether there exists a geometric spanning path of all the red points and a geometric spanning path of all the <b>blue</b> <b>points</b> without crossing is NP-complete...|$|R
