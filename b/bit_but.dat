In November 1801, the College's Board of Visitors adopted a resolution requiring all professors to hold their lectures on campus.

25|$|To do this, he {{compared}} the high-temperature and low temperature limits. At infinite temperature, β = 0, all configurations have equal probability. Each spin is completely independent of any other, and if typical configurations at infinite temperature are plotted so that plus/minus {{are represented by}} black and white, they look like television snow. For high, but not infinite temperature, there are small correlations between neighboring positions, the snow tends to clump a little <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> the screen stays random looking, {{and there is no}} net excess of black or white.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|E

25|$|Side reins are {{adjusted}} {{longer for}} less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened, and raised higher (from {{point of shoulder}} {{up to the point}} of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. For green horses, the side reins are adjusted so that the horse can take contact with the <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> does not have to flex beyond its abilities. A good starting point is to adjust the reins so the green horse carries its head approximately 4inches in front of the vertical. In any case, the head is not to be pulled behind the vertical.|$|E
25|$|That same day, GM 15 {{was ordered}} to advance from Khang Kho; they were {{supported}} by a Thai mercenary battalion. On 2 November, they were struck by the earliest ever start for a PAVN dry season offensive. As Task Force Charlie was shoved back to Ban Pa Dong and Khang Kho, GM 32 took an additional 80 killed and 85 wounded. Thus rendered no longer fit for combat, they were returned to MR 3. GM 15 clung to Khang Kho for a <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> withdrew by 14 November. On 26 November, they were returned to Military Region 1. Task Force Charlie was finished.|$|E
25|$|A {{player can}} select {{numerous}} Advantages and Disadvantages to differentiate the character; the system supports both mundane traits (such as above-average or below-average Wealth, Status and Reputation) {{as well as}} more exotic special abilities and weaknesses. These are categorized as physical, mental or social, and as exotic, supernatural, or mundane. Advantages benefit the character and cost points to purchase. Selecting Disadvantages returns character points and allows players to limit their characters in one way in exchange for being more powerful or gifted in other areas. Disadvantages include such positive attributes as honesty and truthfulness which limit the way a character is played. There are also many Perks and Quirks to choose from which give a character some personality. Perks (minor Advantages) and Quirks (minor Disadvantages) benefit or hinder the character a <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> they mostly add role-playing flavor.|$|E

Ray Costelloe (who would later marry Oliver Strachey) was an early heterosexual interest of Keynes.

On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it. In his first vlog, he detailed, [...] "I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a <b>bit.</b> <b>But</b> somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube."

500|$|While Pink Floyd {{were working}} on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio, during which Thorgerson {{recalled}} that he [...] "sat round and talked for a <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> he wasn't really there." [...] He had changed significantly in appearance, {{so much so that the}} band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television sources and critics. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, calling it [...] "without a doubt, the most [...] episode I've seen in quite some time" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "if Family Guy {{wants to make the}} show itself the butt of every joke, it needs to ramp up the conflict and tone down on the flights of fancy–most of those are funny for a <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> excess can ruin just about anything." [...] Another complaint of the episode were the Back to the Future references and the storyline.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the band}} {{have since been}} dismissive and {{critical}} of the work. Recalling the album in later years, Waters said: [...] "Ummagumma – what a disaster!", while in 1995, Gilmour described the album as [...] "horrible". In a 1984 interview, Mason said: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} very good and interesting little exercise, the whole business of everyone doing a <b>bit.</b> <b>But</b> I still feel really that that's quite a good example of the sum being greater than the parts..." [...] Later, he described it as [...] "a failed experiment", adding that [...] "the most significant thing is that we didn't do it again".|$|E
500|$|The role of Holly {{was created}} by series co-creator Ryan Murphy {{specifically}} for Paltrow, a personal friend. Murphy suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of the December 2010 release of the film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Murphy said of Paltrow, [...] "Gwyneth is a great singer. She's done it a little <b>bit</b> <b>but</b> I really want to show it off and show everyone how great she is." [...] It {{was not the first}} time Paltrow had sung on screen: she played a karaoke singer in the movie Duets in 2000, and had a number one hit in Australia for her duet of [...] "Cruisin' from its soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|In January 1968, EMI filmed the Beatles for {{a promotional}} trailer {{intended}} to advertise the animated film Yellow Submarine, {{loosely based on}} the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition. Though critics admired the film for its visual style, humour and music, the soundtrack album issued seven months later received a less enthusiastic response. By late 1968, relations within the band were deteriorating. The tension grew during the recording of their self-titled double album, {{also known as the}} [...] "White Album". Matters worsened the following year during the Let It Be sessions, when a camera crew filmed McCartney lecturing the group: [...] "We've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away... we were always fighting [...] discipline a <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> it's silly to fight that discipline if it's our own".|$|E

Moxon confirmed to the St. Petersburg Times that his firm assisted the Scientologists with their litigation against CAN for mostly no charge, and that Scientology churches [...] "helped a little <b>bit,</b> <b>but</b> very little" [...] with the case. Moxon asserted that his legal services were requested by individual Scientologists because of his religious discrimination litigation experience. [...] "These were filed by [...] Scientologists who were victimized by CAN. That’s the long and short of it," [...] said Moxon. Moxon stated to 60 Minutes [...] "They didn't--they didn't spring up serendipitously. A number of Scientologists came to our firm and said, 'I'm being discriminated against by CAN.'" ...|$|E

[...] "My Moment" [...] was written and produced by Brandon [...] "Blue" [...] Hamilton and Quinton Tolbert, and co-produced by Charlton Pettus. The single release was first announced on July 11, 2011. Two days later, Black unveiled the single's artwork through her Twitter account. On July 18, the accompanying music video was uploaded on Black's YouTube channel, while the single was released digitally on the iTunes Store on July 19.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} {{planning}} stages of season two, CBS executive Tony Barch suggested Mills {{for the role}} of Abby Cunningham.

Casting agent Barbara Miller-Gidaly introduced Mills and Jacobs. After meeting with Miller-Gidaly, Jacobs decided to have Mills test for the role, which was unusual for an established actress. She auditioned shortly after and convinced the producers that she was the right person for the part. Jacobs said, [...] "She came back that afternoon and she read and she was great, and it meant reshaping the role a little <b>bit,</b> <b>but,</b> um, not that much.
