40|$|Skinfold {{thickness}} {{measurements were}} made at biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac sites on both sides on 265 full-term newborn infants. The mothers were classified as thin (25), normal (179), or obese (61) {{on the basis of}} their triceps skinfold thicknesses. At all skinfold sites the <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> the obese mothers were significantly fatter than the <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> normal mothers, and the <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> the normal mothers were significantly fatter than those of the thin mothers. There was a highly significant positive correlation between maternal triceps thickness and the <b>baby's</b> sum <b>of</b> skinfold thicknesses. Hypertension was common during the pregnancies of the obese mothers and was associated with a significant reduction in the babies' skinfold thicknesses.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the mean {{platelet}} volumes (MPV) in <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> preeclamptic and normal pregnant women and to investigate the correlation between thrombocytopenia and MPV in the <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> preeclamptic mothers. Materials and Method: A total of 63 newborns with similar gestational age were included in this retrospective study. They were divided into three groups as 21 <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> preeclamptic mothers with thrombocytopenia (Group A), 21 without thrombocytopenia (Group B) and 21 <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> normal pregnant women without thrombocytopenia (Group C). Hematologic data of the patients, obtained in the first 72 hours of their life, were achieved from their medical records. Groups were compared according to their birth weights, platelet counts and mean platelet volumes (MPV). Results: Gestastional age and birth weights of all groups were similar. The platelet count of group A was significantly lower (p< 0. 001). MPV seemed to increase as platelet counts decreased when the groups were compared. However no significant correlation was found between MPV and platelet counts and no significant difference between MPVs (p= 0. 052). Conclusion: Increase in MPV is accepted as a sign of platelet destruction and decrease as a sign of platelet production insufficiency. Our results showed that the etiology <b>of</b> thrombocytopenia in <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> preeclamptic mothers can not be explained with the help of MPV.

40|$|Background: Pregnancy {{outcomes}} {{in women with}} preexisting diabetes {{are known to be}} worse than in the healthy population: rates of congenital malformations have been reported to be 2 to 10 -fold higher. This is due to poor glycaemic control. Objectives: To determine rates of congenital malformations in <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> mothers with type 1 (DM 1) and type 2 (DM 2) diabetes and compare with the healthy population. Methods: Patients with pre-existing DM 1 or DM 2 during pregnancy were identiﬁed on the General Practice Research Database using diagnoses, prescribing, use of testing equipment and referral records. Mothers were matched to babies using registration records with the same family number, within 2 months of delivery date. Major congenital malformations were identiﬁed in the baby’s record and malformations veriﬁed with at least two related medical records; free text entries were checked. Results: Between January 1992 and March 2007 1, 057 DM 1 patients had 1, 329 pregnancies and 365 DM 2 patients had 441 pregnancies that resulted in a live birth. Eighty-four major malformations were found in 78 <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> DM 1 mothers: 41 were cardiac, 11 were urogenital and eight were limb defects. Twenty-six major malformations were identiﬁed in 22 <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> DM 2 mothers (seven cardiac defects). Overall, 5. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> DM 1 mothers and 5. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> DM 2 mothers had a malformation compared to 2 – 3 % in the healthy population. The malformation rate for <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> DM 2 mothers was comparable with another study (5. 8 %) but was lower for DM 1 (8. 2 %). The proportion of cardiac malformations in <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> DM 1 mothers was three times higher than in the healthy population. Conclusions: Babies whose mothers had DM 1 or DM 2 during pregnancy had double the rate of malformations. Pregnancy loss due to malformation has not been included but previous work found a greater proportion of terminations for medical reasons (1 % in DM 1, 1. 8 % in DM 2) compared to healthy pregnancies (0. 8 %). Limitations include potentially differential recording <b>of</b> malformations between <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> mothers with DM 1 and DM 2 and the lack of records of glycaemic control.

40|$|Objectives: To compare mean birth weights, gestational {{ages and}} odds of preterm birth and {{low birth weight}} <b>of</b> live {{singleton}} <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> black African or Caribbean ethnicity born in 2005 or 2006 by mother's country of birth. Design: Secondary analysis of data from linked birth registration and NHS Numbers for Babies data set. Setting: Births to women in England and Wales in 2005 and 2006. Participants: <b>Babies</b> <b>of</b> African and Caribbean ethnicity born in England and Wales in 2005 – 2006, whose mothers were born in African and Caribbean countries or the UK. Birth outcomes for 51 599 singleton births were analysed. Main outcome measures: Gestational age and birth weight. Results: Mothers born in Eastern or Northern Africa had babies at higher mean gestational ages (39. 38 and 39. 41 weeks, respectively) and lower odds of preterm birth (OR= 0. 80 and 0. 65, respectively) compared with 39. 00 weeks for babies with mothers born in the UK. <b>Babies</b> <b>of</b> African ethnicity whose mothers were born in Middle or Western Africa had mean birth weights of 3327 and 3311 g, respectively. These {{were significantly higher than}} the mean birth weight of 3257 g for <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> the UK-born mothers. Their odds of low birth weight (OR= 0. 75 and 0. 72, respectively) were significantly lower. <b>Babies</b> <b>of</b> Caribbean ethnicity whose mothers were born in the Caribbean had higher mean birth weight and lower odds of low birth weight than those whose mothers were born in the UK. Conclusions: The study shows that in <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> African and Caribbean ethnicity, rates of low birth weight and preterm birth varied by mothers' countries of birth. Ethnicity and country of birth are important factors associated with perinatal health, but assessing them singly can mask important heterogeneity in birth outcomes within categories particularly in relation to African ethnicity.

25|$|A Cochrane review {{suggests}} that active management (use of uterotonic drugs, cord clamping and controlled cord traction) {{during the third}} stage of labour reduces severe bleeding and anemia. However, the review also found that active management increased the mother's blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and pain. In the active management group more women returned to hospital with bleeding after discharge, {{and there was also}} a reduction in birthweight due to infants having a lower blood volume. The effects on the <b>baby</b> <b>of</b> early cord clamping was discussed in another review which found that delayed cord clamping improved iron stores longer term in the infants. Although {{they were more likely to}} need phototherapy (light therapy) to treat jaundice, the improved iron stores are expected to be worth increasing the practice of delayed cord clamping in healthy term babies. For preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks) a review of the research found that delaying cord clamping by 30–45 seconds increased the amount of blood flow to the baby. This is important as increased blood volume in the baby made them less likely to develop some serious complications. Much of the research around this subject is poor quality so further, larger research projects are likely to produce more reliable results.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{evaluate}} signs <b>of</b> haemolysis in <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> Rh-D negative {{mothers who}} underwent prophylaxis with anti-D immunoglobulin during pregnancy.  DESIGN—The following were evaluated in all <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> Rh-D negative mothers born within a three month period in our department: haemoglobin level, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, reticulocytes, bilirubin level, and direct Coombs' test (direct anti-globulin test). The babies {{were divided into}} two groups according to number of doses of anti-D immunoglobulin received by the mother (one or two), and then further divided by their Rh status (negative or positive). Findings were also compared with a control group <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> O-Rh positive mothers.  RESULTS—The study group consisted <b>of</b> 101 <b>babies</b> and the control group <b>of</b> 37 <b>babies.</b> No statistically significant differences were found for any of the haematological variables between the <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> mothers who received one or two doses of anti-D immunoglobulin, or between the Rh negative babies (n = 35), and the controls. Although 20 % of the Rh positive babies born to mothers receiving two doses of anti-D immunoglobulin had a positive result in the direct Coombs' test compared with only 2. 4 % <b>of</b> the <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> mothers treated with only one dose, no signs of haemolysis were documented in the babies with a positive Coombs test.  CONCLUSION—The prevention of Rh isoimmunisation with anti-D immunoglobulin (one or two doses) during pregnancy does not jeopardise the newborn. Blood group typing and direct Coombs' test should be performed in every newborn of an Rh negative mother to establish whether there is a necessity to administer anti-D. In the presence of a positive direct Coombs' test, the type of antibodies should be identified. ...|$|R
40|$|The Relationship between Maternal Labour Analgesia and Infant Breastfeeding in the First Four Days After Birth. [...] This {{prospective}} {{ex post facto}} study {{explored the}} relationship between two commonly used labour analgesics, meperidine and alphaprodine, and delay in establishing effective breastfeeding in healthy neonates from birth to four days post-birth. [...] The major purposes {{of the study were}} to describe the pattern of initiation of breastfeeding in healthy neonates whose mothers received no analgesia in labour and to compare the patterns of initiating breastfeeding in <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> mothers who received no medication in labour with those babies whose mothers received labour analgesic medication. [...] Infant suckling was assessed by an Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (IBFAT). The IBFAT is a new instrument which was developed for {{the purpose of the study}} to assess and measure infant breastfeeding competence. [...] The subjects of the study were 60 healthy fullterm newborn infants who were delivered spontaneously following uncomplicated labours and deliveries. Selection was on an as-they-come basis on admission to the well-baby, nursery. Final sample was 86. 9 % of the total eligible population. [...] The IBFAT was completed by the mother for every feeding and by the researcher at some randomly selected feedings until effective feeding was established. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by comparing the researcher's scores with the mother's scores. Inter-rater reliability was 91 %. [...] The researcher was blind to the medication status <b>of</b> each <b>baby</b> until data collection was completed. Following completion of data collection the babies were divided into three groups depending upon whether or not medication had been administered to the mother. The final groups were two medicated groups and one non-medicated comparison group. [...] First, a descriptive analysis was done on the pattern of initiation <b>of</b> breastfeeding in <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> unmedicated mothers. Then the hypothesis, that <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> mothers who received analgesia during labour would take longer to establish effective breastfeeding than <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> unmedicated mothers, was tested with oneway analysis of variance and Dunnett’s t-test. To rule out parity as a confounding variable, the analysis was repeated on the <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> multiparous mothers only in the alphaprodine (n = 20) and the non-medicated (n = 18) groups. [...] The results of the study showed that 66. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> mothers who received no analgesia during labour were breastfeeding effectively by 12. 5 hours after birth and that 85. 7 % had established breastfeeding by 24 hours. A statistical analysis of inter-group scores in both the mixed parity and the multiparous only groups, suggested that <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> mothers who received a standard dose of analgesic medication within one to four hours prior to delivery took significantly longer to establish effective breastfeeding than those whose mothers received no medication. There was no statistically significant difference when the mother received the medication within one hour prior to delivery. <b>Babies</b> <b>of</b> primiparous mothers took significantly longer than <b>babies</b> <b>of</b> multiparous mothers in all groups. A number of possible explanations are advanced for this result. [...] Delay in initiation of breastfeeding has potentially deleterious effects on both mother and baby. From the results of the study a number of suggestions for further nursing research, practice and education are put forward...|$|R
