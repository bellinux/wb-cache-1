5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the <b>Bayer</b> <b>process,</b> gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Red mud is an {{industrial}} waste generated during {{the production of}} alumina by <b>Bayer’s</b> <b>process.</b> Using this red mud as the filler, particulate reinforced polyester composites have been prepared and their dry sliding wear behavior has been studied experimentally. For this a standard pin-on-disc test set-up and Taguchi’s orthogonal arrays were used. Taguchi’s experimental design method {{eliminates the need for}} repeated experiments and thus saves time, materials, and cost. It identifies the significant control factors and their interactions predominantly influencing the wear rate. From the experimental findings, an optimal combination of control factors was obtained on the basis of which a predictive model was proposed. This model was validated by performing a confirmation experiment with an arbitrarily chosen set of factor combinations. Finally, the optimal factor settings for minimum wear rate under specified experimental conditions have been determined using a genetic algorithm...|$|R

Its disposal remains a worldwide problem in terms of environmental concerns. It is generally agreed that to improve hardness and wear resistance of MMCs by using hard intermetallic compound as reinforcement into the copper matrix. The reinforcing materials are generally SiC, Al 2 O 3 etc are costly. The red mud alone contains all these reinforcement elements. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to explore the use of red mud as a reinforcing material as a low cost. The present investigation is aimed at producing copper red mud composite using copper as matrix and red mud as reinforcement. Copper red mud mixtures with different volume percentages were prepared. Copper red mud composites improve strength, stiffness and wear resistance. The density and coefficient of thermal expansion of composite decrease, and their hardness and wear resistance increases as their red mud content increases. The major drawbacks of these copper based composites are reduced conductivity and poor machinability. These two factors are strongly influence the popularity of the developed copper based composites in several technological fields of applications. To overcome this soft phase graphite is used as a additional reinforcement to the copper red mud composite. Graphite being a solid lubricant can improve th...|$|R

Firing was performed in a propane firing kiln at 1000 degrees C for 1 or 4 h soaking. For oxidising atmosphere, water absorption varies between 18. 9 and 19. 5 % and bending strength between 25. 9 and 27. 9 MPa. The crystalline phases identified are haematite Fe 2 O 3, quartz SiO 2, plagioclase [anorthite (Ca, Na) (Al, Si) (2) Si 2 O 8], clinopyroxene [augite Ca(Mg, Fe+ 3, Al) (Si, Al) (2) O- 6] and corundum Al 2 O 3. The microstructure is comprised of Si rich vitrified areas that contain quartz and have closed, round pores and an assemblage of particles creating a mass with open and interlinked pores and no signs of glassy phase. For reducing atmosphere and 1 or 4 h soaking, water absorption varies between 18. 2 and 18. 7 % and bending strength is similar to 29. 5 MPa. The crystalline phases identified are qualitatively {{the same as for}} the oxidising atmosphere. The microstructure is comprised of two concentric zones due to the reduced gas permeability in the core of the body. The outer shell is highly vitrified with closed and rounded pores. The microstructure in the core of the body resembles that of samples fired in oxidising atmosphere; however, the average pore size is higher and the vitrified regions are more extensively formed. The build-up of compressive stresses in the outer shell may also account for the increase in the bending strength; however, cracks {{were developed}} in few occasions. In all cases, quartz participates in the development of liquid phase and dissolves in the melt.
