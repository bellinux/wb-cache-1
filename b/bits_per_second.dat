5|$|The BASIC {{interpreter}} {{was developed}} from that {{used on the}} ZX81 and a ZX81 BASIC program can be typed into a Spectrum largely unmodified, but Spectrum BASIC included many extra features {{making it easier to}} use. The ZX Spectrum character set was expanded from that of the ZX81, which did not feature lower-case letters. Spectrum BASIC included extra keywords for the more advanced display and sound, and supported multi-statement lines. The cassette interface was much more advanced, saving and loading around five times faster than the ZX81 (1500 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> compared to 307), and unlike the ZX81, the Spectrum could maintain the TV display during tape storage and retrieval operations. As well as being able to save programs, the Spectrum could save the contents of arrays, the contents of the screen memory, and the contents of any defined range of memory addresses.|$|E

25|$|In digital {{communication}} systems, the physical layer gross bitrate, raw bitrate, data signaling rate, gross {{data transfer rate}} or uncoded transmission rate (sometimes written as a variable Rb or fb) is {{the total number of}} physically transferred <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> over a communication link, including useful data as well as protocol overhead.|$|E

25|$|The reason: {{under the}} {{original}} flight plan, when Huygens was to descend to Titan, {{it would have}} accelerated relative to Cassini, causing the Doppler shift of its signal to vary. Consequently, the hardware of Cassinis receiver {{was designed to be}} able to receive over a range of shifted frequencies. However, the firmware failed to take into account that the Doppler shift would have changed not only the carrier frequency, but also the timing of the payload bits, coded by phase-shift keying at 8192 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{graphical}} character-based interactive {{environment is}} Club Caribe. First released as Habitat in 1988, Club Caribe {{was introduced by}} LucasArts for Q-Link customers on their Commodore 64 computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items. Although the game's open world was very basic, its use of online avatars (already well-established off-line by Ultima and other games) and the combination of chat and graphics was revolutionary. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted {{by the need to}} support modem data transfer rates as low as 300 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Habitat's graphics were stored locally on floppy disk, eliminating the need for network transfer.|$|E

Gallager {{was hired as a}} consultant, and convinced the company to develop quadrature amplitude modulation techniques using two sidebands instead of single-sideband modulation. This technique was later refined by Dave Forney (hired in 1965) into a successful modem (modulator and demodulator) product.Within a few years it had about 20% of the market, which then was dominated by American Telephone & Telegraph.|$|R

25|$|Because of the inverse-square law {{in radio}} communications, the digital data rates {{used in the}} downlinks from the Voyagers have been {{continually}} decreasing the farther that they get from the Earth. For example, the data rate used from Jupiter was about 115,000 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> That was halved at the distance of Saturn, and it has gone down continually since then. Some measures were taken on the ground {{along the way to}} reduce the effects of the inverse-square law. In between 1982 and 1985, the diameters of the three main parabolic dish antennas of the Deep Space Network were increased from 64m to 70m, dramatically increasing their areas for gathering weak microwave signals.|$|E
25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second,</b> resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording – increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E
25|$|The navigational {{message is}} {{modulated}} at 50 <b>bits</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The superframe {{of the open}} signal is 7500 bits long and consists of 5 frames of 30 seconds, taking 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) to transmit the continuous message. Each frame is 1500 bits long and consists of 15 strings of 100 bits (2 seconds for each string), with 85 bits (1.7 seconds) for data and check-sum bits, and 15 bits (0.3 seconds) for time mark. Strings 1-4 provide immediate data for the transmitting satellite, and are repeated every frame; the data include ephemeris, clock and frequency offsets, and satellite status. Strings 5-15 provide non-immediate data (i.e. almanac) for each satellite in the constellation, with frames I-IV each describing five satellites, and frame V describing remaining four satellites.|$|E
