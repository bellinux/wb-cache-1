Hogg's work lives on through the Ima Hogg Foundation, which she founded in 1964 and which was the major <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> her will.|$|E
5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of the explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E

5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury {{over the issue of}} whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown in {{the relationship between the two}} eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
5|$|The Ripper murders mark an {{important}} watershed {{in the treatment}} of crime by journalists. Jack the Ripper was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication of inexpensive newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{association}} {{is a registered}} charity and though fundraising {{has been a problem}} the centre is the sole <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the 'Lee Adamson Memorial Fund'; a fundraising trust set up when Adamson, a Deckham resident and volunteer at the centre, died of meningitis in 1998. By 2011, the fund had raised around £15,000 and a plaque was installed in his honour at the centre.|$|E

5|$|Works {{from her}} {{collection}} {{were given to}} Wheaton College in 1922 during her 50th-year reunion, including an oil sketch by Alix d'Anethan and a seascape by Alfred Stevens. She loaned her paintings to the Worcester Art Museum, and the Fitchburg Public Library was a <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> photographs, prints, engravings, textiles, dishes, and furniture. She {{was involved in the}} placement of art at the library so that visitors to every department would have the opportunity to view the works of art, including European prints and rare engravings that span several centuries.|$|E
5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E
5|$|Boston College wide {{receiver}} Rich Gunnell was the game's leading receiver, having {{been the primary}} <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> Davis' prolific passing. Gunnell finished the game having caught seven passes for 114 yards and one touchdown. Virginia Tech {{wide receiver}} Dyrell Roberts was the game's second-leading receiver. He caught four passes for 44 yards. Tech's second-most proficient receiver was running back Darren Evans, who caught three passes for 22 yards. Evans was the game's leading rusher, having carried the ball 31 times for 114 yards and a touchdown. On the opposite side, Boston College running back Montel Harris led the Eagles {{on the ground with}} nine carries for 34 yards.|$|E

5|$|Ferraro's first {{full-time}} political job came in , {{when she}} was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York, by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. At the time, women prosecutors in the city were uncommon. Grumblings {{that she was the}} <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> nepotism were countered by her being rated as qualified by a screening committee and by her early job performance in the Investigations Bureau. The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant district attorneys assigned to her. In this role, she became a strong advocate for abused children. She was admitted to the U.S. Supreme Court Bar in 1978.|$|E
5|$|Larkin {{had asked}} {{on his deathbed}} that his diaries be destroyed. The request was granted by Jones, the main <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> his will, and Betty Mackereth; the latter {{shredded}} the unread diaries page by page, then had them burned. His will {{was found to be}} contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left one million pounds to St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Shackleford {{was placed}} into {{training}} with Dale Romans, who raced the colt twice as a 2-year-old.

In the Kentucky Derby he finished fourth, and then, at 13-1 odds, {{went on to win}} the Preakness Stakes on May 21, 2011. In doing so, Shackleford became the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the largest payoff purse in Preakness history, winning not only the $600,000 winner's purse, but also $550,000 as the XpressBet Bonus winner for a total payout of $1,150,000.

5|$|The 1896 {{establishment}} of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper {{that he was to}} partly own, was part of his response. Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899. This time, he was the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it. In that year he was Secretary for Railways and Public Works in the seven-day government of Anderson Dawson, the first parliamentary Labour government in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Napoleonic Wars were {{therefore}} ones in which Britain invested {{large amounts of}} capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy, which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, {{including those of the}} Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815. Britain was again the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> peace treaties: France ceded the Ionian Islands, Malta (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), Mauritius, Saint Lucia, and Tobago; Spain ceded Trinidad; the Netherlands Guyana, and the Cape Colony. Britain returned Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, and Réunion to France, and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands, while gaining control of Ceylon (1795–1815).|$|E
5|$|Though Stewart {{was named}} the most {{valuable}} player for the Volunteers, multiple Tennessee players had statistically significant games. Volunteer quarterback Peyton Manning finished the game having completed 12 of his 19 pass attempts for 189 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Backup Tennessee quarterback Brandon Stewart completed all three of his pass attempts, accumulating 49 yards in the process. Tennessee receiver Joey Kent was the primary <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the Volunteer passing attack, leading all receivers during the game with six receptions for 116 yards. Tennessee's passing touchdowns went to Kendrick Jones, who also had 37 receiving yards and 76 rushing yards; and Marcus Nash, who caught three passes for 54 yards.|$|E

5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the ensuing scandal. Against this idea {{it has been argued that}} he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this {{aggressive}} interpretation {{was used}} to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty with Cuba that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a banana republic. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and {{was used to}} justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In , the Dodgers {{moved from}} the Los Angeles Coliseum, which had a 250-foot left field line, to pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium. The new park had a large foul {{territory}} and a comparatively poor hitting background. Koufax was an immediate <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the change, lowering his home ERA from 4.29 to 1.75. On June 30 against the expansion New York Mets, Koufax threw his first no-hitter. In the first inning of that game, Koufax struck out three batters on nine pitches to become the sixth National League pitcher and the 11th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish a nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning. With the no-hitter, a 4-2 record, 73 strikeouts, and a 1.23 ERA for June, he was named Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award. It {{would be the only}} time in his career he earned this distinction.|$|E
