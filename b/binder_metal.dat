For the manufacture of WC-Ni Hard Metal according to Si content, the researcher manufactured WC-Ni mixed powder which 0 wt. %~ 1. 5 wt. % of Si was added to after selecting Ni which a fixed amount of B was added to, and then manufactured sintered body by implementing vacuum-sintering to the mixed powder. This study implemented the analysis with HRA, TRS, XRD, SEM, and EPMA to observe densification, alloying reaction, and mechanical properties of the sintered body.

40|$|Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP™) is a {{manufacturing}} technique {{in which a}} powdered material is used to build parts with complicated geometries directly from a three dimensional computer model. This technique {{has been used in}} the past to manufacture metal parts with complicated geometries. The three different materials used in the making of tools by 3 DP™ are <b>binder,</b> <b>metal</b> powder and the low melting infiitrant. The original material system used for hard tools is 420 martensitic stainless steel powder, a Cu-lOSn alloy as the infiltrant and acrysol as the binder. Although almost 50 tools have been manufactured using this materials system, there were several concerns which had to be dealt with, including dimensional control, porosity control, erosion and interaction between the skeleton and the infiltrant. Another requirement is a "hardenable" material system that is soft initially and that can be hardened after machining. This thesis describes {{the development of a new}} hardenable material system in which most of the concerns with the 420 /bronze system are eliminated. The new material system that was selected uses a Mo powder skeleton and a 56 Cu- 22 Ni- 22 Mn infiltrant. The Cu-Ni-Mn alloy is age hardenable. Acrysol was retained as the binder material again. Experiments were carried out to study the printing, debinding/sintering and infiltration steps. An extra age hardening step was also introduced after infiltration. The process parameters for each of the steps were developed and several tools have been manufactured successfully. The thesis describes each of the post processing steps in detail with regards to experiments that were performed or literature that was obtained from past work. The tools that were manufactured with the new material system showed better properties on the whole than those manufactured with the previous material system. by Zubin Jamshed Irani. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that sample resistivity is the controlling factor in electrokinetic impregnation was substantiated. Experiments show that dense clay- bonded silicon carbide can be impregnated {{beneath the surface}} pores whereas only surface pore impregnation is achieved with both dense and porous graphite. The resistivity of the materials differ {{by a factor of}} about 1 O/sup 10 /. Although deep penetration of the substrate by the particles of the coating system is not achieved during deposition, there is evidence of considerable diffusion of the binder-carbide solid solution into the pores of the graphite after sintering. A number of sintered, crack-free, and adherent TaC coatings on ATJ graphite panels were prepared which showed evidence of surface pore penetration. The attainment of satisfactory reproducibility was difficult because of preferential deposition of the <b>binder</b> <b>metal</b> and contamination from erosion of the chrome-manganese steel ball mill. Efforts to prevent contamination by lining the mill with rubber were unsatisfactory. A silicon carbide liner for the mill was ordered and will be received in December. To prevent preferential deposition, precoating of the tantalum carbide particles with nickel by chemical precipitation and electroless nickel plating was investigated. Nickel coatings were obtained by both techniques; however, the chemically precipitated nickel was not adherent when the coated particles were placed in the electrophoretic bath. Good adherence was obtained by electroless plating; but this material, when sintered, cracked during the cooling cycle. Further investigation established that both iron and nickel are required as binders to obtain well-sintered Tar. Work was begun on the preparation of coated rocket nozzle liners for testing at NOL. Graphite nozzles were machined to the WM-D- 800 - 2 configuration, and a cell was designed for obtaiining a uniform electrophoretic deposit. Test coatings were within the required thickness tolerance of plus or minus 0. 002 in. The coatings, thus far, have cracked {{at the edge of the}} nozzle throat during the heat-up cycle. This is believed to result from a temperature differential in the furnace and from improper control of the binder composition. The furnace is being modified to minimize the temperature gradient, and variability in the binder composition will be eliminated when the carbide liner is installed in the ball mill. Thermal shock tests were performed on coated graphite panels. The specimens were plunged into a 2500 deg C zone, held at temperature for 2 min, and then removed from the hot zone. Microscopic examination of the coating after testing indicated no ill effects. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringIn {{secondary}} {{system of}} pressurized water reactors (PWRs), carbon steel undergoes severe corrosion owing to high temperature and pressure, and fast flow velocity. These circumstance, named as flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC), induces corrosion and eventually failure of power piping. Flow velocity brings about destruction of oxide layer by electrochemical corrosion and mechanical shear stress at the oxide/water interfaces. The piping {{system in the}} secondary circuit of PWRs mainly consists of carbon steels being vulnerable to FAC because Fe, main element of carbon steel, forms Fe 3 O 4 dissolved to secondary water system by changing to Fe ion. To mitigate corrosion of carbon steel, chemical and mechanical treatments to carbon steel or changing secondary water chemistry has been widely studied. Addition of Cr and/or Mo to carbon steel components {{is one of the}} adequate countermeasure to mitigate FAC by anodic passivation. Mechanical treatments are controlling surface roughness because reducing surface roughness can decrease flow turbulence at the oxide/water interface. Increasing pH, dissolved oxygen contents, and addition of advanced corrosion inhibitor to secondary system can decrease corrosion rate of carbon steels. However, maintaining homogeneous chemistry condition of water is hardly possible and changing chemical composition of carbon steel needs not only research of corrosion properties but also other mechanical properties. In contrast, application of coatings to the steel surface can be easily applied to the secondary system. Therefore, thermal spray to steel surface using less corrosive metal is widely used. Among them, cold spray has advantage with lower process temperature than that of other spray coatings which leads to low residual stress and oxidation or decarburization of coating. In this study, tungsten carbide (WC) and nickel (Ni) particles are used as feedstock materials for the coating. WC exhibits high corrosion resistance in acidic aqueous media due to the phase stability. Moreover, the oxidation resistance of WC in O 2 containing atmosphere at high temperature is applied to industry which is exposed to severe corrosive environments However, in alkaline solution, the dissolution of WC increases by forming WO 4 -. Moreover, high melting temperature and poor plastic deformation make cold spray coating difficult. To suppress the corrosion of and increase the deposition efficiency of the coating, Ni, which has better plastic deformation and lower corrosion potential and melting temperature than WC, is used as a <b>binder</b> <b>metal.</b> Ni acts like a sacrificial metal to WC so corrosion and oxidation of Ni occur before those of WC. To evaluate the potential of the coating as an effective corrosion barrier, series of corrosion tests at simulated secondary water chemistry is carried out and quantitative analysis is conducted. Surface and cross-section morphologies of the coatings before and after FAC simulation tests is investigated by scanning electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron microscopy. Electrochemical experiments are carried out for quantitative analysis. Cold spray coatings using WC- 10 Ni with different Ni contents have rough and porous surface but significant changes of surface is not observed by SEM image. However, lower current density is measured at 25 Ni coating than carbon steel, P 22, 20 Ni and 30 Ni coating from potentiodynamic polarization experiments in pH 9. 3 ETA solution at room temperature. After 2 weeks FAC experiments, weight loss of coating is increased with increases Ni contents in coating but weight of 20 Ni coating is increased. On the other hands, weight loss occurs at 20 Ni and 30 Ni coating and weight of 25 Ni coating is increased after 4 weeks FAC experiments. Although weight change of coatings is smaller than carbon steel after 2 weeks and 4 weeks FAC experiments, weight change of 25 Ni coating shows better corrosion performance than P 22 comparing with 20 Ni and 30 Ni coating. As a result, Ni has lower corrosion potential than WC and it induces galvanic corrosion of Ni and prevents WC corrosion or oxidation at early stage of corrosion process. Moreover, oxidation product of Ni, Ni(OH) 2 is dissolved into water by Ni ion because of poor thermal stability of Ni(OH) ¬ 2. Therefore, high Ni contents in coating increases weight loss during the early stages by Ni(OH) 2 dissolution. However, after 4 weeks of immersion, WC oxidizes and transforms into WO 3 increasingly which is influenced by Ni contents. 30 Ni coating induces continuous weight loss during FAC simulation because of low WC contents which means weight gain by WO 3 formation is smaller than weight loss by Ni(OH) 2 dissolution. Therefore, weight loss occurs at 30 Ni coating. Contrarily, 20 Ni coating do not protect WC dissolution after 2 weeks because the absence of Ni and Ni(OH) 2. accelerates WC oxidation and WO 3 dissolution to water. To be concluded, WC- 10 Ni + 25 Ni coating specimens exhibit the best corrosion resistive performance, the lower corrosion current density and the small weight change than other coatings. Therefore, WC- 10 Ni + 25 Ni coating is possibly suggested to one of the option to mitigate corrosion of carbon steels. ope...|$|E

All the cermet coatings had the same phase structure such as WC and W 2 C. However, the phase intensities of these phases are different in each coating, mainly due to the different in solidification rate in each case. Moreover, the microhardness measurements {{were found to be}} different in each coating. The results show that the binder type has a significance effect of the physical and mechanical properties of the sprayed coatings...|$|R
40|$|A {{composition}} containing 30 to 70 percent chromium carbide, 5 to 20 percent soft noble metal, 5 to 20 percent metal fluorides, and 20 to 60 percent <b>metal</b> <b>binder</b> {{is used in}} a powdered metallurgy {{process for}} the production of self-lubricating components, such as bearings. The use of the material allows the self-lubricating bearing to maintain its low friction properties over an extended range of operating temperatures...|$|R

Popular with {{students}} in the United States, Canada and parts of Latin America from the 1970s to the 1990s, it featured sliding plastic rings (instead of standard snap-closed <b>metal</b> <b>binder</b> rings), folders, and pockets to keep schoolwork and papers, and a wrap around flap with a Velcro closure (originally a metal snap closure).|$|R
40|$|Most {{important}} processes {{during the}} heat treatment of hardmetal mixtures are drying, dewaxing, outgassing, melting of the <b>metal</b> <b>binder</b> phase and sintering. Methods of thermal analysis (thermodilatometry, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and mass spectrometry) {{are used for}} understanding these processes. Changes in the gas phase composition during the heat treatment (including pressure changes) result in changes of temperature ranges for phase transformations and reactions, kinetics, mechanisms of gas reactions and the carbon balance of the hardmetal mixture. The carbon balance which {{is very important for}} a high product quality and grain growth inhibitors influence the sintering behaviour and the melting of the <b>metal</b> <b>binder</b> phase. Thermal analysis describes experimental the interactions between gas and hardmetal mixture (for instance reactive gases like H 2, CH 4, CO, H 2 O, CO 2, O 2) and the effect of gas pressure or inert gases (Ar, He). The achieved process knowledge enables hardmetal producers to keep reproducible quality, to improve the control of the carbon balance, to reduce tolerances and scrap...|$|R
