Boosters are essential to avoid the creation of clusters of newly susceptible subjects among adolescents and adults, previously successfully vaccinated, due both to the decay of immunity and the reduced spreading of microrganisms. The 2005 - 2007 Italian National Vaccination Plan (INVP) has underlined the importance of reaching and maintaining high vaccination coverage rates in childhood and of planning <b>booster</b> <b>vaccinations</b> for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and polio, beginning from pre-school age and every ten years in adult life.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{widespread}} immunization programs, a clear {{increase in}} pertussis incidence {{is apparent in}} many developed countries during the last decades. Consequently, additional immunization strategies are considered to reduce the burden of disease. The {{aim of this study}} is to design an individual-based stochastic dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population in order to predict the epidemiologic and economic consequences of the implementation of universal <b>booster</b> <b>vaccination</b> programs. Using this framework, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of universal adolescent pertussis <b>booster</b> <b>vaccination</b> at the age of 12 years in the Netherlands. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We designed a discrete event simulation (DES) model to predict the epidemiological and economic consequences of implementing universal adolescent <b>booster</b> <b>vaccination.</b> We used national age-specific notification data over the period 1996 - 2000 [...] corrected for underreporting [...] to calibrate the model assuming a steady state situation. Subsequently, <b>booster</b> <b>vaccination</b> was introduced. Input parameters of the model were derived from literature, national data sources (e. g. costing data, incidence and hospitalization data) and expert opinions. As there is no consensus on the duration of immunity acquired by natural infection, we considered two scenarios for this duration of protection (i. e. 8 and 15 years). In both scenarios, total pertussis incidence decreased as a result of adolescent vaccination. From a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness was estimated at € 4418 /QALY (range: 3205 - 6364 € per QALY) and € 6371 /QALY (range: 4139 - 9549 € per QALY) for the 8 - and 15 -year protection scenarios, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the outcomes are most sensitive to the quality of life weights used for pertussis disease. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge we designed the first individual-based dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in the population. This study indicates that adolescent pertussis vaccination is likely to be a cost-effective intervention for The Netherlands. The model is suited to investigate further pertussis <b>booster</b> <b>vaccination</b> strategies...|$|E
40|$|Objective. In SLE, a {{decreased}} antibody {{response on}} influenza vaccination has been reported. In this study, we assessed whether a <b>booster</b> <b>vaccination</b> could improve antibody responses, {{as determined by}} seroprotection rates, in SLE patients. Methods. SLE patients (n = 52) with quiescent disease (SLEDAI = 40. Results. Following the first vaccination, seroprotection rates and geometric mean titres (GMTs) to each vaccine strain increased in both SLE patients and controls to comparable levels. Seroprotection rates in SLE patients after the first vaccination were 86. 5 % to A/H 1 N 1, 80. 8 % to A/H 3 N 2 and 61. 5 % to the B-strain while GMTs were 92. 6, 56. 2 and 39. 2, respectively. Overall, the <b>booster</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{did not lead to}} a further rise of seroprotection rates and GMTs in SLE patients. However, in patients not vaccinated in the previous year, GMT and seroconversion rate to A/H 1 N 1 did rise following the <b>booster</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Both influenza vaccinations did not increase SLEDAI scores. Conclusions. Additional value of a booster influenza vaccination in SLE is limited to patients who were not vaccinated in the previous year...|$|E
40|$|IAVI- 006 was {{the first}} large randomised, double-blinded, {{placebo-controlled}} Phase I clinical trial to systematically investigate the prime-boost strategy for induction of HIV- 1 specific CD 8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) in a factorial trial design using (i) priming with 0. 5 mg or 2 mg of pTHr. HIVA DNA vaccine, followed by (ii) two <b>booster</b> <b>vaccinations</b> with 5 x 10 (7) MVA. HIVA at weeks 8 and 12 (early boost) or weeks 20 and 24 (late boost). This study set the basis for later clinical trials and demonstrated the safety of these candidate HIV vaccines. The safety and immunogenicity results are presented and the lessons derived from this clinical trial are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The current {{target groups}} for measles, mumps and rubella {{vaccination}} in the Islamic Republic of Iran are children at 12 months and 4 - 6 years. A {{study of the}} age-specific seroprevalence of antibodies against mumps in children aged 3 - 18 years in Shahrekord aimed to establish the need for <b>booster</b> <b>vaccinations</b> to cover non-immune children. Of 338 children, 19. 8 were seronegative. Age-specific seronegativity was 33. 3, 20. 5 and 4. 6 in age groups 7 - 11, 12 - 14 and 15 - 18 years respectively. To obtain herd immunity, we suggest that for the next 5 years children aged 7 - 11 years entering guidance school are selected as the main group for vaccination...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case of a {{clinical}} manifest hepatitis B virus infection and a potentially misleading HBV serological profile in an HIV- 1 positive patient despite previous HBV vaccination. The patient presented with an acute hepatitis B and there was no indication of chronic HBV infection or the presence of a mutation in the 'a' determinant. Remarkably, simultaneously with high HBV surface antigen and HBV viral load, high anti-HBs antibodies were present. If, due to previous HBV vaccination only anti-HBs was tested in this patient, the result of the high anti-HBs antibodies could be very misleading and offering a false sense of security. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to assess HBV specific immunological memory and determining the role of HBV <b>booster</b> <b>vaccinations</b> in immunocompromised individual...|$|R
