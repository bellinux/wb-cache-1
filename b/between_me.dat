[...] Van Damme was offered a role in The Expendables, but ultimately turned it down.|$|E
500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment <b>between</b> <b>me</b> and the same fate." ...|$|E

500|$|Remixed {{versions}} {{of these songs}} were to {{form the basis of}} Herbert's album All the Ghosts, which was released by Naim Edge in July 2009 in Europe to critical acclaim, including four-starred reviews from The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian; the album was released in the United States in June 2010. This album also featured two further recordings– including a cover version of David Bowie's [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"– by Robert Harder, who had previously collaborated with Herbert as recording engineer of <b>Between</b> <b>Me</b> and the Wardrobe. It was remastered for vinyl by Steve Rooke at Abbey Road Studios, London and reissued in LP format in 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)" [...] {{is one of}} its author's {{most popular}} songs, among fans and music critics, and {{features}} a series of much-praised slide-guitar solos from Harrison. The recording signalled a deliberate departure from his earlier post-Beatles work, in the scaling down of the big sound synonymous with All Things Must Pass and his other co-productions with Phil Spector over 1970–71. Aside from Harrison, the musicians on the track are Nicky Hopkins, Jim Keltner, Klaus Voormann and Gary Wright. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of his desire to be free of karma and the constant cycle of rebirth; he later described the song as [...] "a prayer and personal statement <b>between</b> <b>me,</b> the Lord, and whoever likes it".|$|E

500|$|Herbert left Universal Classics and Jazz {{to pursue}} a less {{commercial}} and more personal musical direction and then self-financed a project in which she collaborated with Polar Bear's Seb Rochford in a production role. <b>Between</b> <b>Me</b> and the Wardrobe, an album of self-penned songs, was recorded in three days and was never intended for general release. The album was initially made available, in 2006, on Herbert's own Monkeywood label before being picked up by Blue Note Records, making Herbert their first UK signing in 30 years. In a five-starred review, Stuart Nicholson of The Observer said that on this album she [...] "lets the lyrics do the work for her. They are well thought out, moving between artfully constructed soft-focus simplicities to poignant yearning".|$|E
500|$|In 1930, while laid up with {{a sprained}} leg, Brooks {{began a series of}} more than 100 {{drawings}} of humans, angels, demons, animals, and monsters, all formed out of continuous curved lines. She said that when she started a line she did not know where it would go, and that the drawings [...] "evolve from the subconscious...ithout premeditation." [...] Brooks was writing her unpublished memoir No Pleasant Memories {{at the same time she}} began this series of drawings. [...] Critics have interpreted them as exploring the continuing effect of her childhood on hera theme expressed even in the symbol she used to sign them, a wing on a spring. [...] Decades later, at 85, she said [...] "My dead mother gets <b>between</b> <b>me</b> and life." ...|$|E
500|$|Both [...] "The Lord Loves the One" [...] and the album's {{title track}} were {{directly}} inspired by Prabhupada's teachings. Greene writes of Harrison adapting {{a passage from}} the Bhagavad Gita into his lyrics for [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] and adds: [...] "Some of the songs distilled spiritual concepts into phrases so elegant they resembled Vedic sutras: short codes that contain volumes of meaning." [...] On [...] "Give Me Love", Harrison blended the Hindu bhajan style (or devotional song) with Western gospel music, repeating the formula of his 1970–71 international hit [...] "My Sweet Lord". In his 1980 autobiography, I Me Mine, he describes the song as [...] "a prayer and personal statement <b>between</b> <b>me,</b> the Lord, and whoever likes it".|$|E

500|$|Remembered {{well for}} his turns of phrase and his puns, Wanderone once wrote, [...] "If you {{happened}} to drive from Mobile to Dowell [...] with a carload of pool hustlers, {{you would get}} bit so hard and so often that you would need a malaria vaccine and a new bankroll as well", a reference {{not only to the}} area's notorious mosquitos but also the predatory nature of hustlers. Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, [...] "Boys, the only difference <b>between</b> <b>me</b> and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg." [...] Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] is a mid-tempo {{dancefloor}} track. The {{song was}} produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl what we do (what we do) / And where we do (and where we do) / The things we do (things we do) / Are just <b>between</b> <b>me</b> and you (oh yeah)." [...] Rolling Stone noted the chorus for 50 Cent's [...] "amateur-sounding tenor croon".|$|E
500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand <b>between</b> <b>me</b> and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

500|$|After the film's release, {{rumors of}} {{possible}} sequels began circulating in different interviews and in film fansites. In 2000, Bruce Willis {{was quoted as}} hoping for an Unbreakable trilogy. In December 2000, Shyamalan denied rumors he wrote Unbreakable as the first installment of a trilogy, saying he was not even thinking about it. In August 2001, Shyamalan stated that, because of successful DVD sales, he had approached Touchstone Pictures about an Unbreakable sequel, an idea Shyamalan said the studio originally turned down because of the film's poor box office performance. In a September 2008 article, Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson said there was some discussion of a sequel when the film was being made, but that it mostly died with the poor box office. Jackson said he was still interested in a sequel but Shyamalan was non-committal. In February 2010, Willis said that Shyamalan was [...] "still thinking about doing the fight movie <b>between</b> <b>me</b> and Sam {{that we were going}} to do", and stated that as long as Jackson was able to participate he would be [...] "up for it".|$|E
500|$|He {{became a}} minor celebrity {{during the two}} months of {{volcanic}} activity preceding the eruption, giving interviews to reporters and expressing his opinion that the danger from the volcano was exaggerated, saying, [...] "I don't have any idea whether it will blow [...] But I don't believe it {{to the point that}} I'm going to pack up." [...] Truman discarded all of his concerns about the volcano and his situation, stating [...] "If the mountain goes, I'm going with it. This area is heavily timbered, Spirit Lake is in <b>between</b> <b>me</b> and the mountain, and the mountain is a mile away, the mountain ain't gonna hurt me." [...] According to The Bulletin, he responded to being knocked from his bed by precursor earthquakes by moving his mattress to his basement. At one point, Truman [...] "scoffed" [...] at the public's concern for his safety. He became something of a [...] "folk hero" [...] and from March until May, was the subject of many songs and poems by children. One group of children from Salem, Oregon, sent him banners inscribed [...] "Harry - We Love You", while Truman received fan letters including several marriage proposals.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond <b>between</b> <b>me</b> and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
