Adrien Begrand from PopMatters felt that the simplicity of the album made it a [...] "classy piece of work" [...] and commented that Minogue's experience and choice of collaborators resulted in [...] "the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless, brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [...] and Christina [...] ".
