His widow Harriet McDougal and his publisher, Tor Books president Tom Doherty made the decision to have the book completed posthumously, with McDougal saying, [...] "I am sad to see the series end. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> far more distressed to leave it unfinished, incomplete and dangling forever." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bloodline" [...] aired the {{day after}} Fringes fourth season renewal was {{announced}} by Fox Entertainment, which came {{in the wake of}} various actors communicating directly with fans to watch the series. Actor Lance Reddick noted of the renewal, [...] "I know so often fans think that they need us... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> digging ditches or something else if it wasn't for you. So — thank you. Really." [...] SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall was surprised but delighted by the network's decision, stating [...] "That any network, let alone Fox, had the patience and the faith to renew this show is, for me, little short of a miracle. It was a week, it seems, for wonders." ...|$|E
500|$|With [...] "Ironic", Morissette denoted {{her support}} for {{same-sex}} marriage. In March 2004, Morissette amended a lyric at the fifteenth annual GLAAD Media Awards: [...] "It's meeting {{the man of}} my dreams /And then meeting his beautiful husband". She commented to USA Today that her support about same-sex unions [...] "goes a step further than clever lyrics." [...] She remarked that [...] " [...] fantasy would now be to marry some of [...] gay couple friends." [...] Later in June 2004, she said to VH1: [...] "I don't have any gay-couple friends who are formally engaged, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> honored to support the gay community in that way ... I did it {{as a sort of}} spontaneous thing at a radio station about a month ago with a couple, and my heart was so with them." [...] Morissette recorded an acoustic version of the song with the changed lyric for her iTunes Originals release, in 2004. Another acoustic version was recorded for the album Jagged Little Pill Acoustic, as well for the compilation album Cities 97 Sampler, Volume 16 (2004). The song was also performed in a duo with Avril Lavigne at the House of Blues in 2005.|$|E

500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1999, at a {{press conference}} in New York City to discuss The Phantom Menace, Lucas {{described}} the [...] "nine year commitment" [...] required to make a Star Wars trilogy. In 2002, he said: [...] "Basically what I said as a joke was, 'Maybe when Harrison and Carrie are in their 70s, we'll come back and do another version.' The thing I didn't realize then, and that I do realize now very clearly, is that not only would they be in their 70s, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in my 70s too." [...] In 2007, Lucas described making the films at that age as [...] "an idea that seemed amusing at the time, but doesn't seem realistic now", and suggested that 'off-the-cuff' comments he had made in earlier years had been misconstrued as absolute statements.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{cost-saving}} measure HSBC is offshoring processing work {{to lower}} cost economies {{in order to}} reduce the cost of providing services in developed countries. These locations take on work such as data processing and customer service, but also internal software engineering at Pune (India), Gurgaon (India), Bangalore (India), Chennai (India), Hyderabad (India), Vishakhapatnam (India), Kolkata (India), Guangzhou (China), Curitiba (Brazil) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). Chief Operating Officer Alan Jebson said in March 2005 that he would be very surprised if fewer than 25,000 people were working in the centres over the next three years: [...] "I don't have a precise target <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> surprised if we had less than 15 (global service centres) in three years' time." [...] He went on to say that each centre cost the bank from $20m to $30m to set up, but that for every job moved the bank saves about $20,000 (£10,400). Trades unions, particularly in the UK and US, blame these centres for job losses in developed countries, and also for the effective imposition of wage caps on their members.|$|E

2500|$|To Calvin, who {{had written}} his summary of Christian {{doctrine}} Institutio Christianae Religionis (Institutes of the Christian Religion), Servetus' latest book was an attack on his personally held theories regarding Christian belief, theories that he put forth as [...] "established Christian doctrine". Calvin sent {{a copy of his}} own book as his reply. Servetus promptly returned it, thoroughly annotated with critical observations. Calvin wrote to Servetus, [...] "I neither hate you nor despise you; nor do I wish to persecute you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> as hard as iron when I behold you insulting sound doctrine with so great audacity." [...] In time their correspondence grew more heated until Calvin ended it. Servetus sent Calvin several more letters, to which Calvin took offense. Chapter XXI, page 481 Thus, Calvin's antagonism against Servetus seems to have been based not simply on his views but also on Servetus's tone, which he considered inappropriate. Calvin revealed the intentions of his offended pride when writing to his friend William Farel on 13 February 1546: ...|$|E
