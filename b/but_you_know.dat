5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

There has been just tremendous timidity {{on the part of the}} party, generally, although there have been a handful of exceptions. <b>But,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E
500|$|Another person {{planned to}} voice a {{character}} in the film was Janeane Garofalo, who was set to star alongside Farley as Princess Fiona. However, she was fired from the project with little explanation. Years later, Garofalo stated [...] "I was never told why [...] I assume because I sound like a man sometimes? I don't know why.

500|$|Baconnaise {{has been}} {{featured}} on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart several {{times as a}} repeat joke. In 2009, Jon Stewart used it in a skit that drew negative attention from Seattle Post-Intelligencers Leslie Kelly. Stewart commented, [...] "Baconnaise, {{for people who want}} to get heart disease <b>but,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> too lazy to actually make bacon." [...] In 2010, Jon Stewart again lampooned Baconnaise with a fake clip of the billboard in Times Square that drew a response from J's Foods. According to J's Foods, a plan to run an actual billboard ad was made, but it was declined by Comedy Central. Using it as a prop in a later episode, Stewart referred to Baconnaise as [...] "capitalism's greatest triumph".|$|E

[...] Charlie and Angelo split up and Anderson admitted she was happy that there is always drama in Charlie's love life and she added [...] "I think it's going to be full-on for Ms Buckton this year. <b>But,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> romances in Summer Bay never last." [...] Of breaking Charlie and Angelo up, Welsh said, [...] "The thinking behind that was to challenge the characters and do something a bit different." [...] He went on to explain that with characters who have been together a long time, there is a temptation to repeat storylines and the team wanted to change the dynamic between Charlie and Angelo.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1938 Formby began work on Trouble Brewing, {{released}} the following year with 19-year-old Googie Withers as the female lead; Kimmins again directed. Withers later recounted that Formby did not speak to her until, during a break in filming when Beryl was not present, he whispered {{out of the corner}} of his mouth [...] "I'm sorry, love, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> I'm not allowed to speak to you", something she thought was [...] "very sweet". His second release of 1939—shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War—was Come On George!, which cast Pat Kirkwood in the female lead; the pair disliked each other intensely, and neither of the Formbys liked several of the other senior cast members. Come On George! was screened for troops serving in France before being released in Britain.|$|E
500|$|The surname [...] "Affleck" [...] is of Scottish origin. Affleck {{appeared}} on the PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots in 2014. When told during filming that an ancestor had been a slave owner in Georgia, Affleck responded: [...] "God. It gives me kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. <b>But,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> there it is, part of our history ... We tend to separate ourselves from these things by going like, 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'." [...] Later, a representative for Affleck told host Henry Louis Gates Jr. via email that Affleck [...] "was uneasy about the slave owner" [...] and the information {{was not included in}} the show's final cut. When this became public knowledge during the 2015 Sony email hacking scandal, Affleck said he had been [...] "embarrassed" [...] by the information.|$|E

500|$|Much of Connor's {{development}} in season {{three and four}} is his continuous shifting alliances between protagonists and antagonists; {{he is unable to}} find his place or his purpose for being. Jeffrey Bell says that all the confusing and conflicting circumstances never allow Connor a break, which he thinks [...] "makes him empathetic in midst of making all wrong choices". Steven S. DeKnight says: [...] We really wanted to highlight [...] that he is a tragic victim of circumstance. He never had a childhood, he's been lied to and manipulated and in this episode we find out his whole reason for being was to bring this other thing into this world, so he's been played his entire life. You really root for him to make the right decision in this one, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> tragic figure he doesn't.|$|E
500|$|... "Desperate Souls" [...] partly {{deals with}} the {{aftermath}} of Sheriff Graham's death from the previous episode. Though her character is associated with evil, actress Lana Parrilla attempted to keep Regina as human as possible. She clarified, [...] "You will see how there is a genuine love and care for Graham…There was a physical connection to the character. He did become sort of a boy toy in both worlds. <b>But,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> {{at the end of}} the day, in Storybrooke, she’s still trying to fill this void that Maleficent warned her about." [...] Leading up to the episode broadcast, Parrilla also gave a preview of what viewers could expect. Of the episode's plot, she explained, [...] "We will be seeing some dirty politics between Regina and Mr. Gold. You’re going to see how threatening that is to Regina, and, as you know, she really takes on these challenges full force." ...|$|E

Rihanna's vocals on the song sound similar to the vocals by Justin Timberlake on his 2002 single [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] (Justified, 2002). Lyrically, in [...] "Jump" [...] Rihanna preaches to her former partner that she won't be chasing him. Jude Rodgers of The Guardian {{described}} it as a [...] "see sex wriggling everywhere". In the song, the singer sings [...] "Skrillex-worthy" [...] lines, [...] "You think I give a damn/ <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> who I am/ I don't go around chasing no dude". The chorus features Rihanna singing, [...] "If you want it, let's do it/ Ridin' my pony/ My saddle is waitin'/ Come and jump on it." ...|$|E

500|$|Maginnis {{describes}} {{the opening of}} the song as [...] "a burst of howling guitar feedback and jubilant, church-like organ", adding: [...] "The atmosphere hints at Harrison's fascination with Indian music and Hindu philosophy at the time, having a distinct, Eastern-flavored, droning undercurrent." [...] Following the intro to [...] "I Feel Fine" [...] in 1964, [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] is a rare example of the Beatles' use of feedback on a recording and suggests the influence of Jimi Hendrix. Womack credits this guitar part to Harrison, who played his Epiphone Casino using [...] "the instrument's Bigsby [...] bar in searing, full vibrato force". Harrison later rued the prominence of the brass accompaniment, saying: [...] "To this day I am still annoyed that I let them mess it up with those damn trumpets. Basically, the song's quite good <b>but,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> messed up with those trumpets." ...|$|E

I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|Renewal was {{uncertain}} {{until after the}} finale aired. In April, actor Enrico Colantoni, who plays Keith, stated regarding renewal, Unofficially, everyone at CBS and Warner Bros is saying, [...] "Yeah, no worries!" [...] <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> those are always famous last words. And then last year they told us two days after we wrapped, and they {{got a lot of}} criticism over that. So I know they're not gonna make that mistake again. They're gonna wait until May. Colantoni also expressed optimism towards the show's future on The CW, believing {{that it would be a}} chance for the show to get more exposure. On May 15, before the official press release was announced, it was believed that The CW had ordered 13 episodes of Veronica Mars. Later, it was revealed that the series had been renewed for a 22-episode season, but that the season could be shortened if ratings were poor.|$|E

Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit {{in response to the}} incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television.
