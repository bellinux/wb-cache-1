5|$|The United States was the <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> {{at these}} championships with four medals. Todd Lodwick and Bill Demong each won two medals with two golds for Lodwick (10km {{individual}} normal hill, 10km mass start), {{and a gold}} (10km individual large hill) and a bronze (10km individual normal hill) for Demong.

Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event.

25|$|Post-war {{parliamentary}} elections could finally {{be held in}} May 1946. In the election campaign Beel voiced the political resistance from the religious and liberal parties against the economic planning and socialism favoured by Prime Minister Schermerhorn and his political supporters. Unlike the British elections {{of the previous year}} where the Labour Party gained a decisive victory, in the Netherlands the 'Socialist breakthrough' which had been expected did not materialise in these first post-war elections. The Catholic People's Party) was the <b>big</b> <b>winner,</b> though no party had an overall majority. Queen Wilhelmina requested Beel to form a new cabinet. He became Prime Minister of a 'red-Roman coalition', which he called the 'New Truce', since it was the first cabinet in Dutch history of socialists and Roman Catholics. This Beel-cabinet set the course for the political and economic development of the post war Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|On 20 February 2010, {{the cabinet}} fell when the PvdA refused {{to prolong the}} {{involvement}} of the Dutch Army in Uruzgan, Afghanistan. Snap elections were held on 9 June 2010, with devastating results for the previously largest party, the CDA, which lost about half of its seats, resulting in 21 seats.

The <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> of the 2010 elections was Geert Wilders, whose right wing PVV, the ideological successor to the LPF, more than doubled its number of seats. Negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government, led by VVD (a first) in coalition with CDA, which was sworn in on 14 October 2010. This unprecedented minority government was supported by PVV, but proved ultimately to be unstable, when on 21 April 2012, Wilders, leader of PVV, unexpectedly 'torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks' on new austerity measures, paving the way for early elections.|$|E

500|$|Eric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend {{also had}} {{positive}} {{thoughts on the}} initial episodes, saying, [...] "It’s smart, entertaining, and has moments so shocking that you’ll have to repress screams. Suffice it to say, Marvel and Netflix have another <b>big</b> <b>winner</b> on their respective plates," [...] while also praising the acting. Speaking {{of the first two}} episodes, Mark Hughes of Forbes added additional praise, saying, [...] "Quite simply, in Daredevil Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made. It is in the same top-tier category of true superhero origin films along with Batman Begins, Iron Man, and [...]" [...] Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks, they [...] "would’ve been hailed as one of Marvel’s best films to date." [...] Mike Hale at the New York Times was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace [...] "leisurely", but [...] "a pleasant change from the norm", and called Cox's performance [...] "divided", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil. Hale was positive about the cast overall, and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes, Daredevil is [...] "eminently watchable", but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics.|$|E
