In time, the turnpike business had become unprofitable and the companies were dissolved by 1852, causing the roads to revert to public control. The Seneca Road Company dissolved in 1852. The old, southern path of the Seneca Turnpike is now Franklin Street and Old Seneca Turnpike from Auburn to Marcellus, NY175 between Marcellus and Onondaga Hill, and NY173 from there east to Chittenango.|$|E
5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E

25|$|Elk or wapiti (Cervus canadensis) are {{the most}} {{abundant}} large mammal found in Yellowstone; paleontological evidence confirms their continuous presence for at least 1,000 years. Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872, when market hunting of all large grazing animals was rampant. Not until after 1886, when the United States Army {{was called in to}} protect the park and wildlife slaughter was brought under control, did the large animals increase in number. In recent years, however, Yellowstone's elk population has plummeted. The Northern Herd, the only herd that winters in the park, has declined from nearly 20,000 animals in 1994 to less than 4,000 in 2013. Ecologists have linked this decline to a declining population of cutthroat trout in Yellowstone Lake, caused by invasive lake trout. With less fish to eat, grizzly bears <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> more elk calves, causing a steep decline in elk numbers.|$|E

25|$|A {{possible}} {{scenario for}} the progression from a fully functional cecum {{to the current}} human appendix was put forth by Charles Darwin. He suggested that the appendix was used for digesting leaves as primates. It may be a vestigial organ of ancient humans that has degraded to nearly nothing of its original purpose, or evolved {{to take on a}} new purpose over the course of evolution. The very long cecum of some herbivorous animals, such as found in the horse or the koala, appears to support this theory. The koala's cecum enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to break down cellulose. Human ancestors may have also relied upon this system when they lived on a diet rich in foliage. As people <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> more easily digested foods, they may have become less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy. As the cecum became less necessary for digestion, mutations that were previously deleterious (and would have hindered evolutionary progress) were no longer important, so the mutations survived. It is suggested that these alleles became more frequent and the cecum continued to shrink. After millions of years, the once-necessary cecum degraded to be the appendix of modern humans.|$|E

500|$|The {{citizens}} of Leningrad {{were subjected to}} heavy bombardment and a siege that would last 872 days and starve {{more than a million}} people to death, of whom approximately 400,000 were children below the age of 14. The German-Finnish blockade cut off access to food, fuel and raw materials, and rations reached a low, for the non-working population, of four ounces (five thin slices) of bread and a little watery soup per day. Starving Soviet civilians <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> their domestic animals, along with hair tonic and Vaseline.

With a trimmed lead of only 25 seconds at the summit of Conisbrough Castle, Schweizer was caught by world road race champion Lizzie Armitstead and Canadian rider Leah Kirchmann with around 36km to go. The trio now joined forced and forged their lead out to over a one minute with 15km remaining in the race. As the route headed north, back towards Doncaster, the trio encountered a strong headwind – handing the initiative back to the chasing peloton – led by [...] and Alé Cipollini. With 10km to go the lead stood at 45 seconds, but the trio were caught with less than 5km to go, resulting in Wild opening the bunch sprint with 150m to go, taking the win by a bike length from Garner.|$|E

2500|$|According to Yusupov's account, Yusupov invited Rasputin to {{his home}} shortly after midnight, and ushered him into the basement.

Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress.

[...] Taking a revolver from Dmitry Pavlovich, Yusupov returned to the basement and, referring to a crucifix that was in the room, told Rasputin that he'd [...] "better look at the crucifix and say a prayer," [...] then shot him once in the chest.

Suddenly, Rasputin leapt up and attacked Yusupov, who - with some effort - freed himself and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed, and made it into the palace's courtyard before being shot by Purishkevich and collapsing into a snowbank.
