They extended their lead to 14–0 early in the second quarter when Drake blocked a Rams punt that was returned 15-yards by Dillon Lee for a touchdown, and then to 17–0 at halftime when Cade Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal late in the quarter.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} flourishing in the 1930s, with Gibraltar {{producing}} many locally born players. However, the Second World War meant a cut <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> with many cricket fields {{giving way to}} the military, one even being converted into an airfield.|$|E

5000|$|Blount is {{considered}} one of the best cornerbacks to have ever played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL.

25|$|Many Dallas players {{described}} this game {{as the most}} devastating loss of the 1966–1970 period. Having lost this game and the 1966 title game in the waning seconds of each game, Landry was subject to criticism that {{he was unable to}} win the Big One, a stigma that persisted until Dallas won its first NFL title in the 1971 season. In the three seasons following 1967, the Cowboys suffered two upsets in the playoffs to the Cleveland Browns, then lost Super Bowl V to the Baltimore Colts 13–16 on a last-second field goal. Schramm considered this game to be turning point to Dallas becoming America's Team {{because of the way the}} Cowboys battled <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
25|$|England {{started the}} way they had {{finished}} on day 1 – with fast wickets for few runs. Strauss was eventually bowled out on his second ball of the day for his previous day's total of 161. After that, two quick wickets meant that England were on 378 with only one wicket left. Onions and Anderson started slowly but gathered confidence with a partnership of 47 until Anderson was caught by Hussey ending England's innings on 425 all-out. The Australians had just under an hour before lunch and James Anderson claimed two wickets with the crucial wicket of Ricky Ponting. A 93 run partnership seemed to have the Australians <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> but 6 wickets for 53 runs put England into a very strong position going into day 3 with Hauritz and Siddle on 3* each.|$|E
25|$|BYU {{opened the}} final quarter of play by punting. After exchanging three-and-outs with BYU, Washington, who had backup quarterback Cyler Miles and Callier at running <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> rather than Price and Sankey, who exited due to a rib injury and hand injury respectively, moved down the field in 9 plays totaling 39 yards, {{entering}} field goal range, and scoring when Travis Coons made a 45-yard field goal to put the Huskies on top by 15 with 7:53 to play. BYU turned the ball over on their next two possessions, {{the first time on}} downs, the second due to an interception (between the two, WASH punted), allowing WASH to nearly run out the clock {{at the end of the}} game, relinquishing the ball on downs back to BYU with 44 seconds left. The Cougars failed to score at the end of the game, and ultimately, Washington won 31–16.|$|E

25|$|Besieged Maryland {{head coach}} Joe Krivak, with a 17–25 record, led his Terps (5–5) to a sold-out Scott Stadium in Charlottesville for their final regular season game. George Welsh's eighth-ranked Virginia (8–1) had spent three weeks atop the AP poll at number-one until a loss against Georgia Tech. At halftime, Maryland trailed 21–7. Then {{freshman}} reserve running back Mark Mason put the Terps <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with a 59-yard touchdown breakaway, {{and a team}} best run for the year.

25|$|Cleveland won {{its third}} preseason {{game in a}} row over the Detroit Lions at the Rubber Bowl in Akron, Ohio. Graham threw a {{touchdown}} pass to Jones on the team's second offensive play after receiving the opening kickoff, {{the first of three}} touchdowns in the first quarter.

25|$|On {{the first}} play from scrimmage, the Steelers {{got a taste of}} what lay in store as Pats quarterback Drew Bledsoe {{completed}} a 53-yard pass to Terry Glenn that set up Curtis Martin's 2-yard touchdown run. Pittsburgh was quickly forced to punt, and New England took just four plays to score again, the last a 34-yard touchdown on a screen pass from Bledsoe to fullback Keith Byars, giving the team a 14-0 lead just over seven minutes into the first quarter. Then on {{the first play}} of the second quarter, Martin burst {{through a hole in the}} right line, dodged a tackle attempt by Carnell Lake, and raced 78 yards for a touchdown, the second longest scoring run in NFL postseason history. Near the end of the half, Steelers defensive back Willie Williams intercepted a pass from Bledsoe to give his team a chance to get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> But Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs on the Pats 24-yard line and the score remained 21-0 going into halftime.|$|E
25|$|Castleford {{where the}} winner would reach the final. 3,000 people turned up to first see Thompson score a penalty after 15 minutes, but then Nigere Tariu slid over {{to put the}} Islanders ahead. Just before the break however, Tait charged through three players to put Scotland <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> In the second half the Cook Islands, with several NRL players in their ranks, showed their {{strength}} as Sonny Shepherd scored a controversial try as Scottish players complained about the grounding. From a play the ball Shepherd went over again and in the 73rd minute Tariu scored a converted try. The Bravehearts did get a late consolation, skipper Tait going over for Scotland's last try before Islander Ali Davys sealed Scotland's fate with a drop-goal. The match finished Scotland 10–21 Cook Islands. In the final the Cook Islands beat Ireland 22–6 in Bury to win the tournament and secure {{a place in the}} next World Cup. Despite losing this final match the Scotland team and supporters thought that they had done very well considering how young the team was and how well their performances had been against Russia and the USA.|$|E
25|$|The Raiders {{hosted the}} Chiefs at Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum on November 30. The game began with both teams exchanging field goals {{to tie the}} game at 3. The Raiders lined up to kick another field goal, but instead elected to run a fake field goal, which was fumbled and {{recovered}} by Chiefs CB Maurice Leggett and returned for a touchdown. The Chiefs led the game 10–3 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Raiders tied the game at 10 with a touchdown by RB Justin Fargas. With the Chiefs backed up to their own 9 following a punt, QB Tyler Thigpen led the Chiefs's offense down the field and capped the drive with a hand-off to RB Larry Johnson for a 2-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next possession, Justin Fargas fumbled the football which eventually set up a Chiefs field goal. The Raiders attempted to get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with a field goal by K Sebastian Janikowski, but the Chiefs held possession and ran out the clock {{for the remainder of the}} game.

5000|$|Lynn {{is known}} for advocating the infamous [...] "Ground and Pound" [...] technique.

25|$|Sherrard's {{touchdown}} {{made the}} score 21-10 going into halftime, {{and it turned}} out to be the final score of the day for the offenses of both teams. Washington advanced inside the 49ers 15-yard three times in the second half, but failed to score on all of them. On their second possession of the half, they advanced 66 yards to the 49ers 7-yard line before defensive back Johnnie Jackson picked off a third down pass intended for Monk in the end zone. Early in the fourth quarter, Monk caught three passes for 63 yards on a drive to the San Francisco 15, only to see Rypien get hit as he threw a pass, which floated right into the hands of cornerback Darryl Pollard. Linebacker Monte Coleman quickly gave the Redskins another chance to get <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> intercepting a pass from Montana and returning it 18 yards to the 49ers 19-yard line with 10:28 left in regulation. Faced with fourth down and 5 from the 14, Rypien threw the ball to receiver Gary Clark in the end zone. Defensive back Eric Davis seemed to make contact with Clark before the ball arrived, but no flag was thrown and the pass fell incomplete, causing a turnover on downs. In the closing minutes of the game, 49ers linebacker Charles Haley deflected a pass from Rypien into the arms of 295 pound defensive tackle Michael Carter, who rumbled 61 yards to the end zone to make the final score 28-10.|$|E
500|$|The Jets were enraged by {{the outcome}} of the game, for reasons {{unrelated}} to the television problems, of which they were initially unaware. Feeling that Hudson's disqualification was unjustified (his replacement, D'Amato, was beaten for the winning touchdown), assistant coach Walt Michaels chased after the officials, and he and team doctor James Nicholas banged on the door of their dressing room, complaining bitterly. Ewbank mentioned the officiating in his postgame press conference. When told of Michaels' actions, the head coach ordered, [...] "Get him out of there, it can only cost him money."

500|$|The game {{continues}} the difficulty progression {{from the end}} of its predecessor. The Lost Levels introduces irritants including poison mushrooms, level warps that set the player farther <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> and wind gusts that redirect the player's course mid-air. The poison mushroom, in particular, works as an anti-mushroom, shrinking or killing the player-character. Some of the game's levels require [...] "split-second" [...] precision and others require the player to jump on invisible blocks. There were also some graphical changes from its predecessor, though their soundtracks are identical. After each boss fight, Toad tells Mario that [...] "our princess is in another castle". The main game has 32 levels across eight worlds and five bonus worlds. A hidden World 9 is accessible if the player does not use a warp zone. Bonus worlds A through D are accessible when the player plays through the game eight times, for a total of 52 levels.|$|E
