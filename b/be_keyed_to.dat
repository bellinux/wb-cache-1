40|$|Abstract. Magnetic {{abrasive}} finishing (MAF) is a processing technology using magnetic {{abrasive grain}} (MAG) under magnetic field to finish surface of workpiece. The magnetic fields used in MAF include permanent magnetic field and electromagnetic field. Two conditions {{must be taken}} into consideration in the finishing surface of workpiece. One is the sufficient cutting force; the other is the relative moving speed between MAG and workpiece. The principle of step-motor rotating magnetic field is used to produce rotating magnetic field (RMF) in this paper. RMF brings MAG to rotate and keeps workpiece immovable. Meanwhile, the coins vibrate within a definite angle range and reciprocate in axial direction so as to process the outer cylindrical surfaces. Yoke iron is made of two halves so that the coins for rotating magnetic field will <b>be</b> <b>keyed</b> <b>to</b> some section of heavy crankshaft, thus realizing cylindrical surface finishing on the heavy crankshaft. MAG are of importance to MAF. Six performance indexes related to MAG are suggested by studying on process parameters...|$|E

In Battambang province, soils associated with limestone have been identified with distinctive properties for non -rice crops. These soils were characterised in Banan district through soil surveying, soil chemical analysis and crop production trials. Alkaline soils on the pediments and gently sloping plains surrounding limestone hills have low crop productivity on account of iron deficiency and alkalinity related constraints. It is proposed that these dark clay soils developed on limestone and related parent rocks be assigned to a calcareous phase of the Kompong Siem Soil group to distinguish them from related soils developed on basalt. The Kompong Siem calcareous phase is a very dark grey coloured soil with {{a high proportion of}} carbonate nodules. When it occurs on sites suitable for wetland rice, its color and texture should lead to identification as the Kompong Siem Soil group in the Cambodia Agronomic Soil Classification.

This article reassesses some critical evidence that is new or {{could have been}} neglected by the Committee. In particular, the putative role of calcium channel blocking agents (CCBs) is reexamined. Additional evidence is culled from articles not cited by the Committee, together with added reference to recent trials. Safety, side-effects and tolerability are issues that are evaluated. Mortality data are reviewed {{with the aid of}} a meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled trials on long acting CCBs. The advice of the committee may need to be reconsidered in view of recent evidence on the tolerability and benefits in hypertension of newer, longer-acting, second-generation CCBs. Of the older agents, verapamil has been shown to be the best with regard to safety and efficacy. Especially in the elderly, angina is often associated with hypertension, with evidence showing dihydropyridine CCBs and beta-adrenergic blocking agents to be similarly effective.

40|$|What {{has become}} known as the Freiburg School or the Ordo-liberal School was founded in the 1930 s at the University of Freiburg in Germany by {{economist}} Walter Eucken (1891 - 1950) and two jurists, Franz B 6 hm (1895 - 1977) and Hans Gro-Doerth (1894 - 1944). Freiburg University's "Fakult 4 t f Rechts- und Staatswissenschaften" that included law as well as economics provided a conducive framework for the combination of legal and economic perspectives that is characteristic of the Freiburg School and of the Ordo-liberal tradition. As B 6 hm later said in retrospect, the founders of the school were united in their common concern for the question of the constitutional foundations of a free economy and society. In the first volume (B 6 hm 1937) of their jointly edited publication series Ordnung der Wirtschaft, the three editors included a co-authored programmatic introduction, entitled "Our Task" (B 6 hm, Eucken and Gro-Doerth 1989), in which they emphasized their opposition to the, then still influential, heritage of Gustav von Schmoller's Historical School, and to the unprincipled relativism that, in their view, this heritage had brought about in German jurisprudence and political economy. By contrast, they stated as their guiding principle that the "treatment of all practical politico-legal and politico-economic questions must <b>be</b> <b>keyed</b> <b>to</b> the idea of the economic constitution" (ibid. : 23), a task for which, they said, the collaboration of law and economics "is clearly essential" (ibid. : 25) ...|$|E

All of the topics selected are appropriate as enrichment material for a first-year geometry course. They can <b>be</b> <b>keyed</b> <b>to</b> any geometry text. Many of the chapters are suitable for use in other high school mathematics courses as well. The first chapter deals with the origins of geometry in ancient Egypt and Babylonia. History also answers such questions as why there are 360 degrees in a circle, which is the subject of chapter two. The booklet also contains biographies of famous mathematicians. Complete chapters are devoted to the lives and contributions of Thales, Pythagoras, and Archimedes. The Pythagorean society in general and the derivation of formulas that generate Pythagorean triples in particular are also included as topics. Finally, three chapters have been dedicated to geometric constructions. Euclid's "collapsible compass" geometry is followed by two chapters on the geometry of the fixed-compass and its rich history. An extensive list of exercises for students follows each chapter. Topics introduced are developed with sufficient depth so that problems can be solved in authentically historical settings. In solving problems as Thales, Pythagoras, Euclid, or Archimedes would have, students will more thoroughly understand their methods and should achieve a deeper appreciation of their accomplishments. It is also my hope that students will gain in their understanding of "today's mathematics" through analyzing older and alternative approaches...|$|E
40|$|Cotton (Gossypium, Malvaceae) {{has been}} spun, woven and dyed since prehistoric times. Four cotton species are {{economically}} important; these are Gossypium arboreum (tree cotton), G. barbadense (American pima cotton), G. herbaceum (levant cotton) and G. hirsutum (American upland cotton). Previous {{research has been}} conducted examining the pollen grains of the Malvaceae and there is a key that differentiates the four economically important species of Gossypium by their pollen grains. However, the cotton pollen found in boll weevils, Anthonomus grandis Boheman, and other insect pests cannot <b>be</b> <b>keyed</b> <b>to</b> the species using the published key. The objective of this research was to determine if the pollen grains of these four species could be differentiated and develop a key that works for cotton pollen found in insect pests. Flowers of the four taxa were collected from USDA greenhouses and fields and dried. Both unacetolysed and acetolysed pollen grains were examined with light and scanning electron microscopy. The length and width of 300 pollen grains and 100 processes (spines) of each taxon were measured. There were no size differences between the acetolysed and the unacetolysed grains. Gossypium barbadense and G. hirsutum represent the largest grains (mean 106. 7 and 94. 9 mm, respectively) and the longest processes (mean 17. 7 and 15. 2 mm, respectively). Differentiation of these taxa can be useful in the determination of the origin of insect pests that attack cotton when different cotton species are grown within a region. However, additional research is needed on the varieties and cultivars of cotton...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{the use of}} eye {{tracking}} systems has been introduced in the field of cartography and GIS to support the evaluation of the quality of maps towards the user. The quantitative eye movement metrics are related to for example the duration or the number of the fixations which are subsequently (statistically) compared to detect significant differences in map designs or between different user groups. Hence, besides these standard eye movement metrics, other - more spatial - measurements and visual interpretations of the data are more suitable to investigate how users process, store and retrieve information from a (dynamic and/or) interactive map. This information is crucial to get insights in how users construct their cognitive map: e. g. is there a general search pattern on a map and which elements influence this search pattern, how do users orient a map, what is the influence of for example a pan operation. These insights are in turn crucial to be able to construct more effective maps towards the user, since the visualisation of the information on the map can <b>be</b> <b>keyed</b> <b>to</b> the user his cognitive processes. The study focuses on a qualitative and visual approach of the eye movement data resulting from a user study in which 14 participants were tested while working on 20 different dynamic and interactive demo-maps. Since maps are essentially spatial objects, the analysis of these eye movement data is directed towards the locations of the fixations, the visual representation of the scanpaths, clustering and aggregation of the scanpaths. The results from this study show interesting patterns in the search strategies of users on dynamic and interactive maps...|$|E
40|$|Neither race nor class {{alone can}} predict {{educational}} achievement. However, in America, disparities in funding for education {{may be an}} impediment to educational opportunity for disadvantaged youth. At {{the crux of the}} Nation 2 ̆ 7 s achievement gap among minority children is the question of the how states should allocate federal education funds, and how local school districts should use those monies. Educators have long recognized that the socioeconomic circumstances of many public school students present great educational challenges. Since 1965, Congress has authorized the use of federal funds by local school districts to remedy the achievement gap. Part I of this Article discusses the background and history of Title I, and reviews the debates surrounding the statute 2 ̆ 7 s enactment. The Section ends by arguing that problems with the statute 2 ̆ 7 s contorted history and weak initial implementation have contributed greatly to ineffective enforcement and inequitable funding outcomes. Part II discusses the appropriate role for federal government in local school funding. It describes federal funding for education as cooperative federalism, and argues that the federalist assertion that education is solely a local issue is mistaken by analyzing the characteristics and types of programs and funding historically and currently available for state and local education programs. Part II concludes by defining the role that federal government should play in eradicating improper funding allocations {{at the state and local}} level. Comparability is the most critical issue to examine if funding inequities are to be eradicated. Part III argues that there should be changes in both the ideology and the legislative schemes that encompass Title I.

40|$|It {{is hard to}} find {{consensus}} on questions of statutory interpretation. Debates rage on about the appropriate goals of interpretation and the best means of achieving those ends. Yet there is widespread agreement, even among traditional combatants on the statutory interpretation field, when it comes to so-called “common-law statutes. ” Textualists concede that text is not controlling; originalists admit that judicial construction of common-law statutes need not <b>be</b> <b>keyed</b> <b>to</b> the specific intent of the enacting Congress; and staunch defenders of strict statutory stare decisis allow frequent departures from precedent. So what are common-law statutes? It is easy enough to name a few, and courts and commentators often do. The list always begins with the Sherman Act, and typically includes Section 1983, the Taft-Hartley Act, and statutory provisions on securities fraud. In the realm of intellectual property, scholars have argued that many of the major enactments make the cut. What is missing is any clear conception of what defines this special category, uniting common-law statutes and distinguishing them from the rest. The relevant case law and commentary reveal two features that are thought to qualify statutes like the Sherman Act for special treatment: Such statutes are written in broad terms and build on a tradition of common-lawmaking. In this Chapter, I argue that neither of the proposed distinctions is persuasive, as the relevant features are shared by many other statutes that do not appear on the privileged list. Any differences are in degree, not in kind. Of course, it is hardly uncommon for the law to mistake points on a continuum for separate categories, and the “common-law” label may serve as an easy — if mildly inaccurate — shorthand for the group of statutes that actively embrace lawmaking by courts. I hope to show, however, that the label is not so benign. Instead, the continuing fiction that there is a categorical difference between common-law statutes and “normal” statutes like, say, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, works to obscure the difficult line-drawing problems that interpreters otherwise would have to confront. If statutes like the Sherman Act and Title VII coexist on a scale of statutory vagueness, {{it is a mistake to}} suggest that questions of interpretive methodology switch on and off in an automatic fashion depending on whether the statute at hand is a common-law statute. An additional problem with the “common-law” label is that it diverts attention away from significant questions concerning delegations of lawmaking power to the judiciary. How should the legal system identify such delegations? When are they a good idea, and when should Congress rely on agencies instead? The notion that delegations to courts can be identified, and justified, simply by drawing an analogy to the Sherman Act conceals those issues from view. But once the label is peeled back, it becomes clear that our current treatment of common-law statutes raises more questions than it answers about delegations to courts...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The major {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{guidelines}} for making and using transparencies for the improvement of teaching home economics on the secondary level. Another is to show how to use transparencies creatively in teaching. This study will try to help fill a gap in the knowledge of the development of transparencies in home economics. Preliminary information for this study was obtained through letters sent to companies which commercially prepare transparencies, a review of information in the field, and a questionnaire. It was found that there were very few companies interested in the development of transparencies in home economics. The questionnaire was sent to 100 selected Oregon home economics teachers. This questionnaire was returned by 82 of the teachers, but only 76 responses were returned in time to be included in this study. Opinions concerning areas of home economics in which transparencies are needed, choices of lesson planning material to accompany transparencies and preferences concerning transparencies (subject area depth, form of transparencies and sources of transparencies) were asked in the questionnaire. The concepts of values, goals and standards; careers in home economics; building relationships; decision-making; discipline of children; emotional development; safety in child play areas; physical development; babysitting; consumer education and work simplification were selected most frequently as topics from which transparencies should be made. The teachers selected (in order of preference) suggested learning experiences, suggestions for use, suggestions for use in class discussion, teacher read scripts and student read scripts as the type of lesson planning material that they would like to see accompany the transparencies. In the section of the questionnaire concerning the preferences of the transparencies, the results were as follows. Forty-eight of the teachers said that they would prefer a more concentrated study of fewer subjects while 23 stated that they would prefer single concept transparencies, covering many subjects. Fifty-two teachers responded in favor of transparencies which could be made in the audio-visual department of their school, while 21 stated that they would prefer those that were commercially made. The teachers overwhelmingly replied that they wished transparencies to be made from a combination of many resources. There were only two teachers who suggested that the transparencies <b>be</b> <b>keyed</b> <b>to</b> one published book. The results of the preliminary information were used in the development of two sets of transparencies [...] one in the area of child development and the other in the area of family life. Each of the sets was developed using a different basic form for the teaching materials. This was done to show the versatility of this audio-visual material as well as to make the transparencies more meaningful and useful in the classroom. The set on the topic of children's play was accompanied by learning experiences while the set on building relationships was written in script form. The transparencies were designed so that they could be easily teacher made. In the second part of this study guidelines have been developed for the use, selection and development of transparencies in home economics education. These guidelines have been established in order to give teachers a basis for using, selecting and developing transparencies...|$|E
40|$|Formal {{developments}} of normative theories typically {{claim that the}} guidance they give is universal: for any agent, and any way the world could be, {{there is a way}} she is permitted (according to that theory) to act. Yet when we consider an agent facing an open, indeterminate future, cases are possible in which what is permitpted depends on what she actually does. These situations follow {{the letter of the law}} while seeming to violate its spirit. A famous example, discussed by Gibbard and Harper (1978), comes from Somerset Maugham: while in Damascus, you learn that Death is coming to collect your soul. Your one option is to flee to Aleppo. But you are confident that Death never misses her quarry: if you flee to Aleppo, Death will be there. But if you stay in Damascus, Death will be there too. If Death is going to Damascus, you should go to Aleppo, and if Death is going to Aleppo, you should go to Damascus. So for any way the world could be, there is a way you should act. Yet there is a clear sense in which there is nothing you can do: since Death's destination depends on yours, no act is such that you ought to have done it, *given that you do it*. The norms of rationality in cases of this structure [...] -and cases with the opposite structure, where available acts deontically validate themselves [...] -are the subject of much recent work in ethics, decision theory, and the metaphysics of persons. I show how a model theory for the natural language modals Ought and May can incorporate these notions of deontic validation and self-defeat. Because May tracks the concept of permissibility brought out by act-dependent cases, its inferential properties reflect the language-*independent* intuitions we have about choiceworthiness, in cases like Death in Damascus. This theorizing makes contact with natural language in the form of my solutions to two infamous puzzles about deontic modal language, free choice permission (Kamp 1973) and Ross's puzzle (Ross 1941). Free choice permission is the apparent validity of the classically *invalid* inference from May([phi] or [psi]) to both May[phi] and May[psi], and Ross's paradox is the apparent *in*-validity of the classically valid inference from Ought[phi] to Ought([phi] or [psi]). The first step to a unified solution to these puzzles is precisely to leverage the notion of permissibility corresponding to deontic self-validation. The second component is a generalization of classical logic. On my account, the interpretation of a disjunction depends on which of its atomic disjuncts are true at the actual state [...] -where the 'actual state' can <b>be</b> <b>keyed</b> <b>to</b> the *future*-actual state an agent chooses when she acts. While classical consequence is preserved for sentences without modals, this analysis sets up a match between the act one brings about and the contents of statements describing that act's deontic status: for example, in futures where the agent chooses to [phi], it is [phi] that she has permission to do. This allows the stronger-than-classical conclusions of free choice permission to follow, and blocks the inference in Ross's puzzle. It also predicts the positive entailment properties of disjunction under Ought, while preserving the inviolability of the role classical disjunction plays in our reasoning. This intuitively appealing combination has, in previous work, proved difficult to achieve...|$|E
