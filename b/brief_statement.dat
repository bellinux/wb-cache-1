5|$|A senator {{could make}} a <b>brief</b> <b>statement,</b> discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|Cope's {{relations}} with Marsh {{turned into a}} competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull {{at the end of}} the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's <b>brief</b> <b>statement</b> where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.|$|E

500|$|Sources {{disagree}} as to {{the exact}} origins of the Manipuri pony, although all agree that it was derived from ancient stock. One source gives the ancestors of the pony as Tibetan ponies brought into India over a thousand years ago, while another states their origins to be a cross between the Mongolian Wild Horse and the Arabian, brought to India by invading Tartar tribes, who also brought the equestrian game of polo. Manipuri ponies have been bred for centuries in the Manipur area of northeast India. The first written mention of the breed dates to a <b>brief</b> <b>statement</b> in the 1584 Manipur Royal Chronicle. By the early 1600s, the breed was mentioned frequently in Manipur literature. They were often used as cavalry horses, and were ridden by Meitei warriors. Manipuri ponies played a major part in the cavalry commanded by Garib Newaz, whose horsemen terrorized upper Burma throughout the early 1700s and in 1738 were used during his Sack of Sagaing. Between 1859 and 1916, Manipuri ponies were extremely desired by the British for playing polo, and there were further infusions of Arabian blood in the 19th century, as British administrators and military officers sought to upgrade their polo ponies. The height of polo horses was initially restricted to , based on the average height of the Manipuri, and although this restriction was later relaxed to [...] and then removed altogether, demand for Manipuris was so high that the area was drained of them. At one point during this period, the export of ponies from Manipur was banned to allow the breed time to increase in number to a viable level. Manipuris were also used to transport British troops into Burma throughout World War II.|$|E
