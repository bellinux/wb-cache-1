5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Vives {{waking up and}} seeing two women in the <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> He remembers being seduced by them when he was drunk the night before. Realizing this, he packs his {{belongings}} and leaves the house. He is seen driving a car until it runs out fuel which forces him to travel by foot where he eventually arrives at a town. In another house, a woman (played by Fabi√°n) wakes up recalling the events of her abusive husband (played by Zamora). She enters a church and says a prayer. Later, Vives is seen hanging out with two men at an outdoor bar when he spots the woman whom he immediately becomes smitten with. Afterwards, he {{and the two men}} are fishing on a boat when Vives sees the woman again. He begins having illusions of him and the woman having a happy life together which drives him insane in his room. That night, the woman finds her husband making love to another woman in a car. Upon discovering this, she leaves the house. At the same time, the town is holding a festival where Vives is celebrating with the townsfolk. The video concludes with him and the woman seeing each other once more and they decide to go out together.|$|E

I loathed the thoughts of <b>bedding</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and used a thousand pretenses of illness and humour to prevent his touching me, fearing nothing more than to be <b>with</b> child by <b>him,</b> which to be sure would have prevented, or at least delayed, my going over to England.|$|R

Family lore relates that he received a new golf club as a present, being shown the correct grip by his father, then taking the club to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that night, with his hands holding the club properly. McIlroy joined Holywood Golf Club and became the youngest member at the club. A video on golf technique produced by champion Nick Faldo was his early favourite.|$|E

500|$|Aubrey {{announced}} plans for faster and cheaper movies, none of which would have a budget above $1 million, {{but many of these}} inexpensive films bombed with critics and audiences. [...] One notable success was the Richard Roundtree film Shaft, which cost $1 million and grossed around $12 million at the box office. Agent Sue Mengers said he was a very tough dealmaker. [...] "I'd rather go to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> than negotiate with him." [...] Upon assuming his MGM post, Aubrey almost immediately canceled production on two Julie Andrews pictures, She Loves Me and Say It With Music, the late 1960s fad for musicals having ended. He also clashed with David Lean, whose production of Ryan's Daughter was running overbudget, in early 1970, attempting to cancel or at least scale down the film; but Lean held too much sway for Aubrey's actions to have any effect.|$|E

500|$|In the pilot, Monica is dumped almost {{immediately}} after sleeping with her new date Paul {{on the night of}} their first date. Monica is tricked into <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> after Paul lies to her about his sex life, falsely alleging that he has not slept with anyone {{in the two years since}} his wife left him. At first, NBC executives worried that audiences would react to Monica's role unfavorably, thus they decided to survey the studio audience and ask them whether or not they thought that having Monica sleep with someone on their first date made her character too promiscuous. Don Ohlmeyer, then-president of NBC's west coast division, was particularly adamant about his stance against Monica's role in the pilot, which he considered [...] "casual sex", and created a [...] "stacked" [...] questionnaire asking audience members if they thought Monica was a whore. Kauffman recalled Ohlmeyer specifically expressing that Monica deserved to be dumped, a statement by which the writer was greatly offended, dismissing Ohlmeyer as a misogynist. Ultimately, the results returned in favor of Monica; audiences liked the character nonetheless, and the episode aired unchanged.|$|E

He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together.

500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} themes in How the Garc√≠a Girls Lost Their Accents is that of the fragmented concept of the self. The fragmentation of one's personal identity is a serious issue suffered by all four Garc√≠a girls throughout the course of the novel. Their immigration has left them as multiple beings, torn between their Dominican and American identities. As a college student, Yolanda encounters a boy named Rudy Elmenhurst, who is relentless in his attempts to pressure her into <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> [...] When he can bear frustration no longer, Rudy lashes out and ends their relationship, leaving Yolanda devastated and hoping for his return. The inner turmoil evoked in Yolanda by this traumatic episode is evident through her realization of [...] "what a cold lonely life awaited [...] in this country. [...] would never find someone who would understand [...] peculiar mix of Catholicism and agnosticism, Hispanic and American styles". Julie Barak, of Mesa State College, has described this passage as a poignant and elegant reprisal of the recurrent sense of being divided selves and speaking divided languages found throughout the majority of the text.|$|E
500|$|No one {{doubted that}} Lim, Tan, and Hoe {{had killed the}} children. [...] Their defence was based on convincing the judges that medically, the accused were not in total control of {{themselves}} during the crimes. [...] The bulk of the trial was therefore a battle between expert witnesses called by both sides. [...] Dr Wong Yip Chong, a senior psychiatrist in private practice, believed that Lim was mentally ill {{at the time of}} the crimes. [...] Claiming to be [...] "judging by the big picture, and not fussing over contradictions", he said that Lim's voracious sexual appetite and deluded belief in Kali were characteristics of a mild manic depression. [...] The doctor also said that only an unsound mind would dump the bodies close to his home when his plan was to distract the police. [...] In rebuttal, the prosecution's expert witness, Dr Chee Kuan Tsee, a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital, said that Lim was [...] "purposeful in his pursuits, patient in his planning and persuasive in his performance for personal power and pleasure". [...] In Dr Chee's opinion, Lim had indulged in sex because through his role as a [...] medium he obtained a supply of women who were willing to go to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Furthermore, his belief in Kali was religious in nature, not delusional. [...] Lim's use of religion for personal benefit indicated full self-control. [...] Lastly, Lim had consulted doctors and freely taken sedatives to alleviate his insomnia, a condition which, according to Dr Chee, sufferers from manic depression fail to recognise.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton‚ÄìBabinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1993, it was {{revealed}} that Jackson had children sleep over in his <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> at his Neverland ranch, a fact which came under much media scrutiny when child sexual abuse allegations were brought against him. Jackson became firm friends with Jordan Chandler and his family after a meeting in May 1992, as he was a fan of Jackson. Their friendship became so close that the National Enquirer ran a featured story with the title [...] "Michael's New Adopted Family", which implied that Jackson had [...] "stolen" [...] the boy from his estranged father, Evan Chandler, a dentist, who was admittedly jealous over Jackson's influence on his son. According to celebrity biographer, J. Randy Taraborrelli, Chandler asked, [...] "Look, are you having sex with my son?" [...] and after Jackson denied doing so, Chandler's opinion of Jackson changed. [...] Jackson invited Jordan, his stepsister and his mother to visit Neverland on the weekends and they would also take trips to Las Vegas and Florida. These weekend trips began to interfere with Jordan's scheduled visits with his father, with Jordan preferring to visit Neverland. In May 1993, when Jackson and Jordan stayed with Chandler, he urged Jackson {{to spend more time with}} his son at his house and even suggested that Jackson build an addition onto the house so that Jackson could stay there. After the zoning department told Chandler it could not be done, he suggested that Jackson just build him a new home. That same month, Jordan and June flew with Jackson to Monaco for the World Music Awards. According to June's lawyer, Michael Freeman, [...] "Evan began to get jealous of the involvement and felt left out." [...] Upon their return, Chandler was pleased with a five-day visit from Jackson, during which Jackson slept in a room with Jordan and his stepbrother. Chandler claimed this was when his suspicions of sexual misconduct by Jackson began, although he admitted that Jackson and Jordan always had their clothes on when he saw them in bed together and has never claimed to have witnessed any sexual misconduct between the two.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{version of}} strip-tease became popular in England {{at the time of}} the Restoration. A strip tease was {{incorporated}} into the Restoration comedy The Rover, written by Aphra Behn in 1677. The stripper is a man; an English country gentleman who sensually undresses and goes to bed in a love scene. (However, the scene is played for laughs; the prostitute he thinks is going to <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> robs him, and he ends up having to crawl out of the sewer.) The concept of strip-tease was also widely known, as can be seen in the reference to it in Thomas Otway's comedy The Soldier's Fortune (1681), where a character says: [...] "Be sure they be lewd, drunken, stripping whores".|$|E

[...] "Guillaera" [...] (Attitude), a duet with Gran Omar, {{explains}} what type of man she does and does not desire. Another collaboration with Gran Omar, [...] "Matando" [...] ("Killing"), follows. The song explores dancing in a club. It, in a minor key, features the synthetic instrumentation of techno music. [...] "Muchos Quieren Tumbarme" [...] (""), alludes to a boxing match with the phrase [...] "many want to knock me down", and cites female empowerment as a prominent theme in the song. In addition to this, she degrades the thought of women's power being underestimated. She speaks directly to men requesting that they not be cowards. She then argues that women are actively struggling for equality among their male peers, later asserting that [...] "women are coming strong". [...] "Reggae Respect" [...] musically returns to the early styles of [...] "old school reggaet√≥n". [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] ("I Want To Dance") incorporates the Liquid riddim, a musical riddim produced by the [...] "Jamaican cross-over guru" [...] Jeremy Harding.

2500|$|After {{escaping}} the musketeers, Don Quixote and Sancho ride {{to a nearby}} inn. Once again, Don Quixote imagines the inn is a castle, although Sancho is not quite convinced. Don Quixote is given a bed in a former hayloft, and Sancho sleeps on the rug next to the bed; they share the loft with a muleteer. When night comes, Don Quixote imagines the servant girl at the inn, Helen, to be a beautiful princess, and makes her sit on his <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> scaring her. Seeing what is happening, the muleteer attacks Don Quixote, breaking the fragile bed and leading to a large and chaotic fight in which Don Quixote and Sancho are once again badly hurt. Don Quixote's explanation for everything is that they fought with an enchanted Moor. He also believes that he can cure their wounds with a mixture he calls [...] "the balm of Firearbras", which only makes them sick. Don Quixote and Sancho decide to leave the inn, but Quixote, following {{the example of the}} fictional knights, leaves without paying. Sancho, however, remains and ends up wrapped in a blanket and tossed up in the air (blanketed) by several mischievous guests at the inn, something that is often mentioned over the rest of the novel. After his release, he and Don Quixote continue their travels.|$|E

[...] " [...] In similar terms, Brent D. Taylor has stated that [...] "Elvis's closest female relationships were usually with young girls of around 13 or 14, ending as they reached late teens. He didn't have sex with these young girls, but had pajama parties, pillow fights and indulged in 'girl talk', just as he did with Gladys." [...] "As a perpetual youth", Elvis was [...] "attracted to young women", and [...] "Elvis felt comfortable with these adolescent girls" [...] because he [...] "was so insecure ... That‚Äôs why he needed younger girls." [...] Elvis biographer Alanna Nash also confirms that the singer had a predilection for young adolescent girls. The author says that Presley was overly attached to his mother and could not relate normally to mature women; presumably, Presley sought out very young girls because he felt threatened by women who were older.|$|E
