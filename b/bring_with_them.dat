Attractive landscaping and planting design sometimes compete with scientific interests— with science now often taking second place. Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and exemplary environmental management.|$|E

Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years, dashing Elinor's hopes of a future with him. Mrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London, where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He greets Marianne uncomfortably and barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they soon learn he is engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey. Marianne becomes inconsolable.|$|E
5|$|An unnamed narrator, while gazing {{upon his}} pet cat, begins to reminisce about {{a law in}} the town of Ulthar which forbids the killing of cats and relates the story of how this law came to be. The tale begins with the {{introduction}} of an old cotter and his wife who delight in trapping and violently killing any cats who venture onto their property. The people of the town are too afraid of the couple to speak against these acts, so they instead focus their efforts on keeping their felines from approaching the cotter's house. One night a caravan of travelers from a distant land arrives and passes through the village. They <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> an orphan named Menes who, having lost his family to a plague, has only a small, black kitten to keep him company. After being unable to find his kitten on the third day of his stay, Menes hears the stories of the old cotter and his wife, and decides to take action.|$|E

25|$|As for the armies, each of {{the local}} chieftains could call upon a militia which often {{accompanied}} them on their journeys around the kingdom. The bulk of the Kandyan army consisted of local peasant conscripts – irregulars pressed into service {{in times of war}} – who tended to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> around twenty days' worth of supplies and functioned in discrete units often out of contact with each other. One {{of the reasons for the}} Kandyan's inability to hold the land they captured was poor logistical support, as many soldiers had to return to base to replenish their supplies once they ran out.|$|E

25|$|In 1851 Bishop Edward Field {{describes}} Battle Harbour as {{probably the}} oldest, {{as well as}} the largest settlement on the Labrador coast. The men who came and stayed there were generally from the Island of Newfoundland that used to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> servants from Dorset. Some of the first permanent residents were fishermen, carpenters and coopers from Poole, Dorset, Fogo Island and New World Island. As the community grew, there became an increasing need for supplies and merchants took full advantage of that where in some cases local residents paid as much as 100% beyond the regular cash price for goods. The exclusive monopoly was not challenged until 1918, when Battle Harbour's first co-operative was set up, through the initiative of Dr. Wilfred Grenfell.|$|E
25|$|Punulu (a {{house for}} menstruating women): {{this house is}} {{on the outside of}} the village. It is {{constructed}} by women and is of lower quality than the other village buildings. Women having their period are considered to be unclean and have to leave their family house to live during five days in this house. They use kitchen equipment only to be used here. They <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> their youngest children. This house is a gathering place for women during the evening. This hut is also thought to have some sort of reproductive symbolism due to the fact that the hut can be easily seen by the men who are working the fields who know that only women who are on their period, and thus not pregnant, can be there.|$|E
25|$|Word of Connacht's deeds reach Llancarfan, {{and he is}} {{summoned to}} meet Emperor Leitrim, who wishes him to join the fight against Moagim Reborn. On the way, he saves the life of Damas, captain of the Emperor's Royal Guard, and the two become friends. In Llancarfan, Leitrim asks Connacht to teach the men how to defeat the Myrkridia, and Connacht agrees, much {{to the consternation of}} Leitrim's advisor, the archmage Mjarin, who takes an instant dislike to him. The {{training}} is conducted under the watch of Myrdred, a young Avatara. After several months, the soldiers are tasked with finding and killing a Myrkridian Pack-Mage. They do so, finding a book in the Pack-Mage's den revealing Moagim is planning to launch an attack on Llancarfan. However, the book also notes the location of his camp, and Connacht launches a preemptive strike. However, the army walk into a trap; Moagim has enlisted the aid of Bahl'al, who unleashes an army of undead, and the Trow, ancient giants nearly unstoppable in combat, who also <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> their Oghre slaves.|$|E

25|$|The ordinary, familiar, {{everyday}} {{things and}} occurrences we have, constitute occasions {{for the experience}} of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed {{in the majority of}} these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.|$|E
25|$|The {{final blow}} {{may have come}} when the {{favorable}} agricultural conditions during the Holocene climatic optimum, which lasted from 7000 to 3200 B.C., quite suddenly changed, resulting in the arid Sub-Boreal phase, which created the worst and longest drought in Europe {{since the end of}} the last Ice Age. The large Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements, which relied entirely on subsistence agriculture for support, would have faced very nasty Dust Bowl conditions, making it impossible to continue their way of life. It is theorized that the combination of this drought and the existence of neighboring nomadic pastoralist tribes led to the complete collapse of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, and the abandonment of their settlements, as members of the culture left behind the plow to take up the saddle of a nomad, as pastoralists are better equipped to eke out a living in an arid environment. The results were that by 2750 B.C. the Proto-Indo-European culture completely dominated the area. The primitive trade network of the Cucuteni-Trypillia society that had been slowly growing more complex was thus abruptly ended, along with the culture that supported it. Or, rather, it was supplanted by another more advanced trade network as the Proto-Indo-Europeans moved in to take the land, and to <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> an entirely new society with division of labor, a ruling and religious elite, social stratification, and, in a word, civilization.|$|E

500|$|Aids for the {{travellers}} {{to carry}} their supplies varied; some had brought dogs, horses, mules, or oxen, whereas others {{had to rely on}} carrying their equipment on their backs or on sleds pulled by hand.

500|$|Autumn {{weather in}} Minnesota {{is marked by}} the rapid {{decrease}} of severe thunderstorms, dramatic cooling, and eventually the possibility of blizzards. With summer-time heat still prevalent in the southern U.S. and colder air quickly taking hold in Canada, Minnesota can be affected by wide temperature swings in short periods of time. [...] Because of this, the jet stream, which tends to weaken during the summer months, begins to re-strengthen. [...] This leads to quicker changes in weather patterns and increasingly strong storm systems. [...] As autumn moves on, these storm systems <b>bring</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> progressively colder air, eventually changing the rain over snow, generally starting in October {{in the northern part}} of the state and November in the south.
