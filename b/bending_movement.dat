40|$|Human spine is {{a complex}} {{structure}} which provides support, protects the spinal cord and allows movements. According to the European Commission study, lower back pain is the most frequent type of pain in the EU. Understanding of human spine biomechanical behaviour is crucial {{in order to develop}} new human spine rehabilitation and diagnostics methods The purpose of this Master thesis was to investigate the influence of intervertebral discs degeneration on specific spine <b>bending</b> <b>movements.</b> A three-dimensional finite element models of intervertebral disc and T 12 –S 1 human spine segment were created and validated. The human spine segment model was used to evaluate the influence of intervertebral disc degeneration on intervertebral discs stresses and reaction moments caused by lateral <b>bending</b> <b>movements.</b> The results revealed that stresses induced by lateral <b>bending</b> <b>movements</b> in healthy intervertebral discs are low, but they significantly increase in the nucleus pulposus of degenerated intervertebral disc. Experimental research of human spine lateral bending indicated that lower spine is insufficiently stimulated by simple lateral <b>bending</b> <b>movements</b> and it is supposed that special spine training equipment could be used to achieve better quality of lumbar spine stimulation...|$|R

This study addresses the role of tectum in integrating eye, body orientation and locomotor movements as in steering and goal directed behavior. Electrical stimuli were applied to different areas within the optic tectum in head-restrained semi-intact lampreys (n= 40). The motion of the eyes and body were recorded simultaneously (video-taped). Brief pulse trains ( 0. 5 s) lateral <b>bending</b> <b>movements</b> of the body (orientation movements) were added, and with even longer stimuli locomotor movements were initiated. Depending on the tectal area stimulated, four characteristic response patterns were observed. In a lateral area conjugate horizontal eye movements combined with lateral <b>bending</b> <b>movements</b> {{of the body and}} locomotor movements were elicited, depending on stimulus duration. The amplitude of the eye <b>movement</b> and <b>bending</b> <b>movements</b> was site specific within this region. In a rostro-medial area, bilateral downward vertical eye movements occurred.

40|$|The bony trabeculae in the {{superior}} articular {{processes of the}} lumbar vertebrae form a series of overlapping pointed arches that correspond to the lines of stress produced during rotation.

The alternate <b>bending</b> <b>movements</b> of {{the superior}} articular processes arise partly from the laterally directed pressure of the corresponding inferior process, and partly from the medially directed pull of the firm 'transverse strengthening ligaments' of the joint capsule...|$|R

40|$|If {{a tunnel}} crosses a {{geological}} fault {{which is considered}} to be active, the possibility of a displacement in the fault must be accounted for in the tunnel design. When the tunnel is embedded in soil, the assessment of the effect of the fault movement is not easy to assess. As a guide to analysis, a series of correctly scaled model experiments in a centrifuge is undertaken. The deflections and stresses induced in a tunnel crossing a fault caused by: (a) Fault displacement; and (b) differential earthquake motions across the fault are quantified by a series of centrifuge tests on a finite length model tunnel. The centrifuge results are used to calibrate a one‐dimensional finite element model of the tunnel for soil‐tunnel interaction effects. The numerical model is then used to predict the response of an essentially infinite length tunnel for design purposes. <b>Bending</b> <b>movements,</b> displacements and shears are displayed.

40|$|A new {{fluorescent}} macrocyclic structure (L 1) bearing two naphthalene {{units at}} both ends of a cyclic polyaminic chain containing two phenanthroline units was investigated with potentiometric and fluorescence (steady-state and time-resolved) techniques. The fluorescence emission spectra show the simultaneous presence of three bands: a short wavelength emission band (naphthalene monomer), a middle emission band (phenanthroline emission), and a long-wavelength band. All three bands were found to be dependent on the protonation state of the macrocyclic unit (including the polyaminic and phenanthroline structures). The existence of the long-wavelength emission band is discussed and is shown to imply that a <b>bending</b> <b>movement</b> involving the two phenanthroline units leads to excimer formation. This is determined by comparison with the excimer emission formed by intermolecular association of 1, 10 -phenanthroline. With ligand L 1, excimer formation occurs only at pH values above 4. At very acidic pH values, the protonation of the polyamine bridges is extensive leading to a rigidity of the system that precludes the <b>bending</b> <b>movement.</b> The interaction with metal cations Zn(II) and Cu(II) was also investigated. Excimer formation is, in these situations, increased with Zn(II) and decreased with Cu(II). The long-emission band is shown to present a different wavelength maximum, depending on the metal, which can be considered as a characteristic to validate the use of ligand L 1 as a sensor for a given metal.

We also describe the spatial and temporal patterns of longitudinal muscle activity during different head-waving movements in a freely moving animal. The body-wall muscles are arranged as a network of longitudinal, circular and left- and right-handed helical muscle fascicles. Each fascicle consists of a few to several hundred muscle fibres enclosed in a connective tissue sheath. The sheath also connects muscle fascicles of different orientations at the points where they cross, forming a tightly connected network. In addition, a series of large longitudinal muscle fascicles, including the lateral columellar muscles, lies against the inside wall of the dorsal hemicylinder of the animal.
