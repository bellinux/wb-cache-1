25|$|In the 18th century, {{the term}} {{took on a}} {{canonical}} sense, unrelated to this architectural style. <b>Basilicas</b> in this canonical sense are divided into major ("greater") and minor <b>basilicas.</b> Today only four, all in the Diocese of Rome, are classified as major basilicas: the major <b>basilicas</b> of St John Lateran, St Peter, St Paul outside the Walls, and St Mary Major. The other canonical <b>basilicas</b> are minor <b>basilicas.</b>|$|R

5|$|The College of Cardinals {{originated}} {{from the college}} of the main clergy {{of the city of}} Rome. The title of cardinal initially concerned only the priests of the 28 parochial churches of the Eternal City (tituli), who were required to assist the pope in the liturgical service in the four Basilicas of Rome (Vatican <b>Basilica,</b> Liberian <b>Basilica,</b> <b>Basilica</b> of St. Paul Outside the Walls and San Lorenzo fuori le Mura). Later (probably in the 8th century) the term was extended to the bishops of the seven dioceses bordering the diocese of Rome: Ostia, Porto, Albano, Palestrina, Silva Candida (1079 replaced by Segni), Gabii-Lavicum (whose name later changed to Tusculum, and later to Frascati) and Velletri (after 1060 replaced by Sabina). These bishops (cardinal-bishops) performed the liturgical service in the Lateran <b>Basilica.</b> Finally, the deacons serving in the papal household or heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city (and later attached to the churches called deaconries), also became the cardinals (cardinal-deacons).|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} raised {{to the status of}} a minor <b>basilica</b> by Pope Leo XIII on June 24, 1890. Upon its {{completion}} the following year, on August 16, 1891, the <b>Basílica</b> Menor de San Sebastián was consecrated by Bernardino Nozaleda y Villa OP, the 25th Archbishop of Manila.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's <b>Basilica.</b> This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also {{a monument to the}} great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee {{the beginning}} or completion of St Mark's <b>Basilica,</b> his rule covered a longer period of its construction than the other two Doges who oversaw the project.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, Justinian also {{tore down}} the aging Church of the Holy Apostles and rebuilt it on a grander scale between 536 and 550. The {{original}} building was a cruciform <b>basilica</b> {{with a central}} domed mausoleum. Justinian's replacement was apparently likewise cruciform but with a central dome and four flanking domes. The central dome over the crossing had pendentives and windows in its base, while the four domes over {{the arms of the}} cross had pendentives but no windows. The domes appear to have been radically altered between 944 and 985 by the addition of windowed drums beneath all five domes and by raising the central dome higher than the others. The second most important church in the city after the Hagia Sophia, it fell into disrepair after the Latin occupation of Constantinople between 1204 and 1261 and it was razed to the ground by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1461 to build his Fatih Mosque on the site. Justinian's <b>Basilica</b> of St. John at Ephesus and Venice's St Mark's <b>Basilica</b> are derivative of Holy Apostles. More loosely, the Cathedral of St. Front and the <b>Basilica</b> of Saint Anthony of Padua are also derived from this church.|$|E

50|$|While {{architecture}} historian Stanford Anderson {{considers the}} ruins to be characteristic for {{the architecture of}} modern Bulgaria at the time, Bulgarian archaeologist Krastyu Miyatev believes it to be radically different from Bulgaria's other preserved <b>basilicas</b> of the same period. Architecture historian Stefan Stamov likens the Belovo <b>Basilica's</b> plan to that of Mediterranean <b>basilicas</b> and presents the opinion that it was influenced by construction techniques from Asia Minor. The construction materials are, however, typical for the Bulgarian lands.|$|R

It lasted from 2004 until November 2006, and was finished in time for a celebration honoring the 200th anniversary of the groundbreaking. By the time the restoration was completed, the <b>Basilica</b> had been repaired and restored to its more original appearance.|$|E

5|$|Mistra {{was ruled}} from Constantinople after 1262, then was the suzerain of the Despotate of the Morea from 1348 to 1460. In Mistra, {{there are several}} <b>basilica</b> plan churches with domed {{galleries}} that create a five-domed cross-in-square over a ground-level <b>basilica</b> plan. The Aphentiko at Brontochion Monastery was built c. 1310–22 and the later church of the Pantanassa Monastery (1428) is of the same type. The Aphentiko may have been originally planned as a cross-in-square church, but has a blend of longitudinal and central plan components, with an interior divided into nave and aisles like a <b>basilica.</b> The barrel-vaulted nave and cross arms have a dome at their crossing, and the corner bays of the galleries are also domed to form a quincunx pattern. A remodeling of the Metropolis church in Mistra created an additional example. The Pantanassa incorporates Western elements in that domes in its colonnaded porch are hidden externally, and its domes have ribs of rectangular section {{similar to those of}} Salerno, Ravello, and Palermo.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Basilica</b> of Saint Mary was {{constructed}} between 1907 and 1915 on {{land that was}} formerly a farm, then a zoological garden. Archbishop John Ireland supervised the planning of the church, originally named the Pro-Cathedral of Minneapolis, along with the Cathedral of St. Paul in Saint Paul. He chose architect Emmanuel Masqueray, who was trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The first Mass was held on May 31, 1914. Church leaders desired to build the finest altar in America, handcrafted of the finest marble they could afford. It was elevated {{to the rank of}} <b>basilica</b> and became the first <b>basilica</b> in the United States in 1926. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as one of the area's finest examples of Beaux-Arts architecture.|$|E
