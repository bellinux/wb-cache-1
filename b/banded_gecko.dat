5000|$|Leopard geckos {{were first}} {{described}} as a species by zoologist Edward Blyth in 1854 as Eublepharis macularius.

[...] The specific name macularius derives from the Latin word macula meaning [...] "spot" [...] or [...] "blemish", referring to the animal's natural spotted markings. Leopard geckos are related to many different geckos, such as the African fat-tailed <b>gecko</b> and the <b>banded</b> <b>geckos.</b> There are four other species within the Genus Eublepharis, leopard gecko, one of which was previously included as a subspecies of leopard gecko:In addition, there are five subspecies of leopard gecko.|$|R
