40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reconsider the {{relationships}} between place and space-the relationships have been an important and many discussed theme after the "Spatial Turn" in sociology and geography-through Theodor W. Adorno 2 ̆ 7 s essay `Valery Proust Museum 2 ̆ 7 in Prisemen: Kulturkritik und Gesellshaft. The problem which Paul Valery and Marcel Proust are concerned with is related to the proper place for artwork. ln ` Le probleme des musees 2 ̆ 7,Valery criticizes museum,for it separates artwork from its 2 ̆ 7 maternal architecture 2 ̆ 7 (leur mere Architecture) which is the artwork 2 ̆ 7 s original context. In contrast,Proust in A la recherche dutemps perdu: Du cote de chez Swann regards museum as proper place for artwork because its separation from secular world and `maternal architecture 2 ̆ 7 represents the mental and creative activity of artist. In their discussion about museum and artwork,the similarities between modern city and museum are made clear. Valery 2 ̆ 7 s description of artworks in museum has many similarities with the description of individuals in modern city which are analyzed by Georg Simmel in `Die Grogstate und die Geistesleben 2 ̆ 7 (the Metropo!is and Mental Life). Adorno points out that the problem of museum which Valery and Proust discuss holds true for the problem which contemporary culture and tradition commonly confronts,and there is an important another element withinthe relationships between artwork and its proper place: person and its gaze. While Valery 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint</b> is the one of artist,Proust 2 ̆ 7 s is the one of consumer,audience,flacnuer. Valery 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint</b> is nostalgic,which seeks to lost things which cannot be restored to live,and Proust 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint</b> is so subjectivist that devaluates the object which is gazed,for the most important thing is the subjective experience and memory of consumer. The discussions of museum by Valery,Proust and Adorno shed light on the paradoxical relationships of subject which gaze,object which is gazed,"aura" and their context,and have great significance to questions surrounding contemporary regional culture and tradition,especially which are the objects of heritage industry...|$|R

This study is grounded in a Black women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint,</b> and places Black women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences at the center of analysis. In answer to the question 2 ̆ 2 How do we know the world?, 2 ̆ 2 the standpoint suggests that Black women know the world as survivors and not as victims, as mothers, and as 2 ̆ 2 other mothers. 2 ̆ 2 In answer to the question 2 ̆ 2 What is the nature of reality?, 2 ̆ 2 Black women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint</b> embraces a reality that is defined by complexity and contradiction, by an acknowledgment that racism is a constant that must not become an excuse for giving in or giving up: that reality is self, internally defined. In answer to the question 2 ̆ 2 How do Black women gain knowledge about the world?, 2 ̆ 2 the standpoint suggests that knowledge is gained through real life experience, by paying attention to the past and to the present, to the margins and to the center, to the pieces and to the whole, and by listening and responding to our own and each other 2 ̆ 7 s authentic voices (Collins, 1990).

40|$|Whether or not {{the judge}} in a {{criminal}} trial is required to charge the jury on a lesser included offense is of utmost importance to a criminal defendant, his counsel and the court. Failure to instruct on lesser included offenses when required {{will result in a}} new trial for defendant. From the attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint,</b> failure to request such a charge may reveal inadequate representation of his client. The courts have a stake in insuring that required lesser included offenses are addressed at the trial level because failure to do so results in renewed litigation and further expense to both the state and the defendant. The determinative factor for charging on a lesser included offense is the presence of evidence offered at trial from which a jury could find that such a crime of a lesser degree was committed. Where a state presents evidence tending to show the crime charged and where neither party presents conflicting evidence on any of the elements, a court is not required to instruct on the lesser offense. The North Carolina Supreme Court addressed the sufficiency of conflicting evidence relating to use or threatened use of a dangerous weapon in an armed robbery charge.

The terms of these leasing arrangements {{play a vital role}} in determining how resources are allocated on these farms. Imperfections in leasing systems may reduce returns to landlords and tenants and restrict the total amount of product available to society. Under many leases in use, the farm plan which maximizes returns to the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s resources may not be the optimum farm plan from the tenant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint,</b> and vice versa. While the conditions of resource efficiency are not attained on many owner-operated farms, the leasing arrangement, ideally, should not contribute further to inefficiences in resource use. Within an owner-operated farm, then, an optimum allocation of the owner 2 ̆ 7 s resources is reached when these resources are organized in a manner to maximize his profits. The problem is more difficult on rented farms, however, because specialized resources are separately furnished by the landlord and tenant. Resource efficiency on rented farms is achieved only when the combined resources of the landlord and tenant are organized into a farm plan which maximizes profits to their combined resources. An efficient lease should permit and encourage the adoption of this single farm plan by the landlord and tenant. In other words, an efficient lease is one which allows the same farm plan to be most profitable for both the landlord and the tenant; this plan should also be the one which is optimum for the farm as a whole, without regard to resource ownership. In any case where the lease leads to a plan which is most profitable for one party but not for the other, imperfections exist in the lease...|$|R
40|$|Domestic {{abuse is}} the number one cause of injury to women in the United States. Women and their {{children}} flee everyday to shelters to escape the abuse. Once inside the shelters, material resources are rendered so that the women can continue to lead lives outside the shelter and different therapies are employed so that the women can better understand the abuse and their options once leaving. A type of therapy used in other therapeutic forums, such as patients sexually abused as children, is dream analysis. This type of therapy has allowed formerly traumatized victims a safe space to uncover hidden traumas, acknowledge them and begin to write new scripts for their lives. The theoretical view behind this paper is that dream analysis could be a feminist tool of empowerment for women participating in domestic abuse therapy. As a researcher, I performed research at The Spring, Tampa Florida 2 ̆ 7 s only domestic abuse shelter for women and their children. During the research, I observed multiple domestic violence group therapy sessions, interviewed the facilitator of this group, and held personal interviews with five different women over a three month period. During these interviews, the women discussed in detail their lives, the abuse they sustained and their dreams surrounding the abuse. The women were asked to give interpretations of the meanings of their dreams, which are incorporated in the paper. Throughout the interviews, it was of vital importance that the battered women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoints</b> were privileged and that they remained the experts of their own experiences. During this process, two points became clear: forgotten traumas resurfaced during dreamtime and the women understood they were 2 ̆ 2 too good 2 ̆ 2 for the abuse and should leave.

By giving voice to women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences and placing this voice in a historical context of differential racialization, as well as within both Critical Race Feminism (CRF) and Reproductive Justice (RJ) frameworks, this dissertation asks: How does the narrator construct the importance of her identity in her abortion and reproductive health services experiences?; Does the narrator link previous reproductive health services issues, such as sex education or cost of birth control, to her abortion experiences?; Does the narrator link her abortion experience to larger social structures and power issues?; How does the narrator construct her experience of abortion? What emotional elements does she present in her construction of the narrative?; How does the narrator construct her experience of deciding to have an abortion?; How does the narrator construct the role of her social support system in her abortion experience?; and How does the narrator reflect on her abortion experience? This dissertation argues that while women experience and construct abortion in very different ways, common experiential themes emerge. While women do not all construct or reflect upon their abortion experiences in the same way, narrative themes emerge that fade in and out of focus based on a woman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint</b> and the various aspects and intersections of her identity. In light of the emergent themes, this dissertation suggests enhanced opportunities for the sharing of women 2 ̆ 7 s abortion experiences, as well as more academic and activist work to examine and raise public awareness about issues of power and privilege in the abortion process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the many}} unique {{features}} of biological databases is that the mere existence of a ground data item {{is not always a}} precondition for a query response. It may be argued that from a biologist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint,</b> queries are not always best posed using a structured language. By this we mean that approximate and flexible responses to natural language like queries are well suited for this domain. This is partly due to biologists 2 ̆ 7 tendency to seek simpler interfaces and partly {{due to the fact that}} questions in biology involve high level concepts that are open to interpretations computed using sophisticated tools. In such highly interpretive environments, rigidly structured databases do not always perform well. In this paper, our goal is to propose a semantic correspondence plug-in to aid natural language query processing over arbitrary biological database schema with an aim to providing cooperative responses to queries tailored to users 2 ̆ 7 interpretations. Results Natural language interfaces for databases are generally effective when they are tuned to the underlying database schema and its semantics. Therefore, changes in database schema become impossible to support, or a substantial reorganization cost must be absorbed to reflect any change. We leverage developments in natural language parsing, rule languages and ontologies, and data integration technologies to assemble a prototype query processor that is able to transform a natural language query into a semantically equivalent structured query over the database. We allow knowledge rules and their frequent modifications as part of the underlying database schema. The approach we adopt in our plug-in overcomes some of the serious limitations of many contemporary natural language interfaces, including support for schema modifications and independence from underlying database schema. Conclusions The plug-in introduced in this paper is generic and facilitates connecting user selected natural language interfaces to arbitrary databases using a semantic description of the intended application. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with a practical example...|$|R
40|$|Provides {{insights}} into the aspects of Australian communities that support children and those that fail them. It examines {{the ways in which}} communities can be strengthened from the standpoint of children. The report documents how excessive use of alcohol, aggressive drivers and the threat of violence make children feel unsafe in their communities. It also highlights the importance of strong, caring relationships. Executive summary   What do children in Australia value about their communities? How are communities supporting children? How are communities failing them – and why? Over the past fifteen years, governments at Commonwealth, state and local levels have been concerned with strengthening communities as part of a policy shift towards "local solutions to local problems" and to place-based initiatives. This policy shift was heavily influenced by ideas of social capital. Children are often assumed to benefit from "strong communities", yet we know very little about children‟s views on what makes a strong, supportive community. Indeed, we know very little about children‟s places and roles within Australian communities. If policies and initiatives are to be inclusive of children – as this report argues they should – it is crucial that we understand children‟s views and experiences of their communities. The research project explores in depth what children in middle childhood think about their communities, how children experience "community‟ on a daily basis, and what vision they have for their communities. This report presents the findings of participatory, rights-based research with 108 children aged between eight and twelve years across six sites in eastern Australia. The findings provide important {{insights into}} communities from a child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint.</b> This research also demonstrates children‟s capacity to engage in detailed discussion and deliberation about "what works" - and "what is broken" – within their community. Additionally, it demonstrates the important insights children can provide into how to fix that which is broken...|$|R
40|$|This short Essay draws three {{lessons for}} {{evidence}} scholars from Stephen Yeazell 2 ̆ 7 s justly celebrated work in civil procedure. The first lesson {{is to take}} history seriously but to be realistic about what it can tell us: to use history to gain perspective, not to recover lost wisdom. The second lesson is to take rulemaking seriously: {{to think about the}} processes through which evidence rules are formulated and reformed. The third lesson, and the most important, is to take lawyers seriously, not just as the agents through which procedure is implemented but as drivers and obstructers of reform. This last lesson is an especially critical one for evidence scholars, because the complexity and opacity of evidence law has meant that lawyers are generally the only ones in a position to improve it. Lawyers 2 ̆ 7 interests, though, diverge in important ways from society 2 ̆ 7 s interests. In particular, lawyers tend to view uncritically, and sometimes even to celebrate, the extraordinary degree to which our system of adjudication, and evidence law in particular, makes a party 2 ̆ 7 s prospects in litigation hinge on the skills of the party 2 ̆ 7 s lawyer. That feature of evidence rules and of our procedural system more broadly usually passes unnoticed, in large part because lawyers find it not only unobjectionable but deeply attractive. But from society 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint,</b> procedural rules work best-all things being equal-when they make the outcome of litigation turn on the merits of the case, not on the relative skills of the lawyers involved: on who is right and who is wrong and on what justice demands. We ask too rarely whether our procedural rules, including our rules of evidence, place too large a premium on lawyerly skill, and whether the culture of the legal profession, and its attachment to a certain heroic image of the trial lawyer, has warped the way that lawyers have struck that balance...|$|R

Domestic bidders earn significantly positive average announcement period abnormal returns, while U. <b>S.</b> <b>bidder</b> returns are indistinguishable from zero. Measures of pre- and post-acquisition abnormal accounting performance are also consistent with a superior domestic bidder performance. Domestic bidder announcement returns are, on average, greatest for offers involving stock payment and for the bidders with the smallest equity size relative to the target. Neither direct foreign investment controls, horizontal product market relationships, nor acquisition propensities explain why domestic bidders outperform their U. S. competitors...|$|R

Based on former research, the author conducted both univariate and multivariate tests on possible predictors. Direct evidence proves that U.

And when the U. <b>S.</b> <b>bidders</b> expend into china within cored industry after WTO or with initial exposure, synergy {{play a role}} in creating optimistic expectations on the stock market, whereas focused takeover itself could not give the market strong enough signal...|$|R
40|$|In {{this review}} of Sex Stories-A Review Of Sex And Reason by Richard A. Posner, Professor Chon explores the {{implications}} of Posner’s exuberant faith in bioeconomic reasoning, unalloyed {{by any of the}} late modernist or postmodernist challenges to the nature and limits of science and its transformative potential. In doing so, Professor Chon attempts three things. First, she discusses some of his sociobiological assertions in order to demonstrate that evolutionary biology consists of a much richer and more contradictory set of assertions than Posner would have us believe. Even within the empiricist framework, therefore, Posner leaves out many stories that could produce a less biased picture of human sexual behavior. Second, she examines these sociobiological 2 ̆ 2 facts 2 ̆ 2 about sex for what they tell us about reason. The stories that Posner tells about human sexual behavior fit into a typology of scientific narrative-one that depends upon the elucidation of an irreducible core of scientific 2 ̆ 2 fact. 2 ̆ 2 Human sociobiology, however, is a field so free of fact constraints that a sociobiological 2 ̆ 2 fact 2 ̆ 2 tells us more about the scientist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint</b> than it does about the human social behavior that person is purporting to describe. Posner 2 ̆ 7 s reliance upon sociobiology to distance him from constructivist accounts of human sexuality is, therefore, misplaced. Finally, she analyzes how Posner 2 ̆ 7 s scientific method defines and delimits the concept of 2 ̆ 2 objectivity 2 ̆ 2 in an unnecessarily constricting fashion. Although he employs the methods of a comparativist (comparing different cultures, different historical epochs, and even different disciplines), he is tied to a view of objectivity that fundamentally denies the possibility of a comparative perspective. Posner’s standpoint is that of a putatively detached, uninterested, scientific observer-a standpoint that disables him from appreciating, much less acknowledging, the different perspectives possible even within his native discipline of law and economics. Professor Chon demonstrates that this is evident, for example, in his responses to various review essays already published...|$|R

In this article, the geological process of the Subrrerged Forest was discussed from author 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint</b> with reviewing, the geological papers ever published on the problem. From hemical composition of the Submerged Wood, it was proved that there was no the great difference of composition between the Submerged Wood and the present wood and only slight coalification of the Submerged Wood being in the early first biochemical stage of peat formation could be find. The absolute age determination of the piece of the Submerged Wood by the radio acctivity measurement of ^ C was carried out with result of 1960 ^+_- 70 B. P. years,as the earthenware of late Jyomonian period was excavated on the bottom of peat layer at the Submerged Forest. The Submerged Forest eseems to have been formed at comparatively recen geological age. Various opinions were presented on the formation of the Submerged Forest, such as the subsidence of the ground by block movement, change of the sea level, marine transgression, development of coastal sand dune, coast erosion and relative subsidence of the ground to the sea level. The author 2 ̆ 7 s conclcsicn is as follows. During the middle and the late Jyomonian period the primeval forest of Cryptomeria japonica grew thickly on the fan of the Katagai River, During the latest Jyomonian period and Yayoian period, by growing of the coastal sand dune and the relative subsidence of the ground (or the raise of the sea level), the region of the primeval forest tumed into the region of the back marsh of the coastal sand dune and the peat layer was formed and so the region was covered with mud and sand from the river and particularly by river flooding of the river. Then, the coastal sand dune migrated into inner land and at last disappeared by the coast erosion until the Submerged Forest exposed on the present shore line. 著者は富山県魚津埋没林の埋没材を用いて石炭化行程に関する若干の詰完を行って来た。本報では地質学的にどのようにして魚津埋没林が生成したかについての過去の多くの研究を比較し，更に著者の得た結果を加えて論説した...|$|R
40|$|The Graphical User Interface (GUI)  {{although}} {{developed in}} research laboratories {{in the late}} 1970 s  is still the dominant interaction paradigm in Information Visualization. We propose a new interaction paradigm called Blended Interaction. It combines ideas of Embodied Cognition, Multimodal Interaction, Reality-Based Interaction & Ubiquitous Computing. This is intended to stress that a single increase in the reality aspect of the interaction cannot go far enough. The particular challenge  and from the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>standpoint,</b> the key advantage  lies in a meaningful marriage between the tested real-world options and the digital world. As a minimum this marriage must exist on the levels of the interaction, communication, {{of the way we}} solve problems with conventional tools (workflows), and of the design of the space or the architecture of buildings and places. The digital world often offers entirely new possibilities and takes the form of interactive devices of various shapes but also of intelligent everyday objects (e. g. the 2 ̆ 7 Internet of things 2 ̆ 7). In our view, interaction concepts can indeed offer a new quality of interaction, but only when the design of the interaction includes all these domains {{at the same time and}} with equal weighting. We test the suitability of our ideas of Blended Interaction concepts by using specific application examples that are being worked on as part of current research projects. Our experiences show that this new interaction paradigm has also great potential for interacting with visualization. For example, we have developed multi-touch scatter plots & facet maps for tangible user interfaces supporting the searching & browsing in Digital Libraries. We have embedded different visualizations into a Zoomable Object-oriented Information Landscape (ZOIL), which supports our vision of using visualizations on different displays of different size at the same time. We have developed specific kind of search tokens that supports collaborative search activities. For example, we try to address the following research questions: * How can future interactive InfoVis tools look like, especially in the light of the idea Blended Interaction? * How can future interactive InfoVis tools benefit from Multi-Displays & Multimodal environments used by Multiple Users? * What are the specific design requirements for multi-touch visualizations? * How can we support the collaborative use visualization tools...|$|R
