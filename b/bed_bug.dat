5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{has started}} {{spending}} more time with Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) because Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) keeps trying to rope Jim into having an affair. During the night at the hotel, Cathy asks to hang out for a while in Jim's room under the pretext that the heat in her room is malfunctioning. She repeatedly makes seductive signals, making Jim uncomfortable, so he calls Dwight saying he has bed bugs. Dwight arrives and forces Cathy off Jim's bed so he can lure out the bed bugs with his nearly naked body. This fails to sufficiently disgust Cathy, who merely steps into the bathroom to take a shower until Dwight leaves. Cathy gets out of the shower wearing only a bath robe. After ordering some desserts from room service and asking Jim to touch her legs, he finally comes out saying that he is happily married, and {{does not want to be}} with her. Cathy gets defensive and insists that she did not have any romantic intentions whatsoever, so Jim relents, but Cathy immediately resumes her seductive technique. After Jim goes to the bathroom, he comes out to find her in only her underwear under his blanket. Fed up, he demands that she leave and lets Dwight, armed with spray chemicals, into the room. Jim claims to see a <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> near Cathy, making her flee from Dwight's spraying. However, because of the chemicals, Dwight suggests Jim sleep in Cathy's room. Jim instead spends the night with Dwight in his room, eating Cathy's desserts and watching TV, while a drunken Nellie is outside, trying unsuccessfully to get in.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the mid-20th century, bed bugs {{were very}} common. According {{to a report}} by the UK Ministry of Health, in 1933, all the houses in many areas had some degree of <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> infestation. The {{increase}} in <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> populations in the early 20th century has been attributed to the advent of electric heating, which allowed bed bugs to thrive year-round instead of only in warm weather.|$|E
50|$|Although {{occasionally}} applied {{as a safe}} indoor pesticide {{treatment for}} other insects, boric acid is ineffectual against <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> because <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> do not groom.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> {{have made an}} astounding {{comeback}} all across the United States. Bed bugs are small blood-feeding insects that invade human habitats, specifically homes, and thrive in places where people sleep. Since <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> were nearly absent for 40 years in the US, very little was known about their biology and current level of pesticide tolerance. In 2010 the news media focused great attention on <b>bed</b> <b>bugs,</b> which increased the public’s familiarity with this pest. However, educational needs for dealing with <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> are still overwhelming, and include outreach to cooperative extension educators, Master Gardeners, pest control professionals, facilities managers, social workers, medical professionals, travelers, college students and their families, landlords, tenants of rented properties, and just about everyone else. The people most vulnerable to <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> are those in multiple unit buildings, the elderly (often living alone), and those living in assisted or group homes. Elderly, disabled and disadvantaged individuals who have fewer resources and sometimes lack the capacity to recognize or deal with <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> are more commonly living with <b>bed</b> <b>bugs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bed bugs (Cimex spp.) are wingless, hematophagous {{arthropods}} causing bites, which generates {{wide range}} of skin reaction and may be misdiagnosed with more serious disease as dermatitis herpetiformis, bullous pemphigoid or erythema multiforme. Differential diagnosis could be a challenge especially in western countries where <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> were forgotten since the Second World War. There {{are only a few}} reports of serious anaphylaxis after <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> exposition and the evidences about the role of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> as vectors to some infectious diseases are not conclusive, but bites could be a source of physical ailments and psychological distress. We present a case of 24 year old female patient who had been bitten by <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> and primarily diagnosed with erythema multiforme. After releasing from hospitalization because of successful treatment patient developed another eruption of skin lesions, this time more characteristic to <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> bites during one day. The new diagnosis of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> bites was confirmed with proving the presence of these arthropods in her rented apartment...|$|R
25|$|One recent {{theory about}} <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> reappearance in the US {{is that they}} never truly disappeared, but may {{have been forced to}} {{alternative}} hosts. Consistent with this is the finding that <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> DNA shows no evidence of an evolutionary bottleneck. Furthermore, investigators have found high populations of bed bugs at poultry facilities in Arkansas. Poultry workers at these facilities may be spreading bed bugs, unknowingly carrying them to their places of residence and elsewhere after leaving work.|$|E

25|$|Because {{infestation}} {{of human}} habitats {{has been on}} the increase in developed countries, <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> bites and related conditions have been on the rise as well, since the 1980s–1990s. The exact causes of this resurgence remain unclear; it is variously ascribed to greater foreign travel, more frequent exchange of second-hand furnishings among homes, a greater focus on control of other pests resulting in neglect of <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> countermeasures, and increasing resistance to pesticides. Bed bugs have been known human parasites for thousands of years.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a {{resurgence}} of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> in all facets of our society. Bed bugs have even been found in schools, causing unnecessary exclusion of students and unfounded hysteria. School nurses are again called upon to be front-line sources of information to quell the hysteria and confusion related to this unsavory condition. By arming themselves with the best evidence regarding proper identification of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> and their bites and information about integrated prevention measures to control transmission of infestations, school nurses can contribute to the control and management of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> and aid in the overall battle against this “new and improved ” invasion of the <b>bed</b> <b>bugs...</b>|$|R
25|$|The exact {{causes of}} this {{resurgence}} remain unclear; it is variously ascribed to greater foreign travel, increased immigration from {{the developing world}} to the developed world, more frequent exchange of second-hand furnishings among homes, a greater focus on control of other pests, resulting in neglect of <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> countermeasures, and increasing resistance to pesticides. Declines in household cockroach populations that have resulted {{from the use of}} insecticides effective against this major <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> predator have aided the bed bugs' resurgence, as have bans on DDT and other potent pesticides.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bed</b> <b>bug</b> bites or cimicosis {{may lead}} to a range of skin manifestations from no visible effects to {{prominent}} blisters. Effects include skin rashes, psychological effects, and allergic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Bed bugs {{can also}} be {{detected}} by their characteristic smell of rotting raspberries. <b>Bed</b> <b>bug</b> detection dogs are trained to pinpoint infestations, with a possible accuracy rate between 11% and 83%. Homemade detectors have been developed.|$|E
50|$|A {{traditional}} Balkan {{method of}} trapping <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> is to spread bean leaves in infested areas. The trichomes (microscopic hooked hairs) on the leaves trap the bugs by piercing the tarsi joints of the <b>bed</b> <b>bug's</b> arthropod legs. As a bug struggles to get free, it impales itself further on the bean leaf's trichomes. The <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> and leaves then can be collected and destroyed. Researchers are examining ways to reproduce this capability with artificial materials.|$|R
50|$|Though {{commonly}} used, {{the pesticide}} approach often requires multiple visits {{and may not}} always be effective due to pesticide resistance and dispersal of the <b>bed</b> <b>bugs.</b> According to a 2005 survey, only 6.1% of companies claim to be able to eliminate <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> in a single visit, while 62.6% claim to be able to control a problem in 2-3 visits. Insecticide application may cause dispersal of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> to neighbouring areas of a structure, spreading the infestation.|$|R
50|$|Detection {{dogs are}} often {{specially}} trained by handlers {{to identify the}} scent of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs.</b> With the increased focus on green pest management and integrated pest management, {{as well as the}} increase in global travel and shared living accommodations, <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> have become more prevalent. Detecting <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> is a complicated process because insects have the ability to hide almost anywhere. Detection dogs help solve this problem because of their size, speed, and sense of smell. From eggs to adults, detection dogs use their unique ability to smell in parts per trillion in order to track <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> in every phase of their life cycle. They can find bugs in places humans cannot such as wall voids, crevices, and furniture gaps. Dogs are also a safer alternative to pesticide use. If detection dogs can find out exactly where <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> are located, they can minimize the area that needs to be sprayed.|$|R
25|$|C. lectularius only feeds {{every five}} to seven days, which {{suggests}} {{that it does not}} spend the majority of its life searching for a host. When a <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host. If it successfully feeds, it returns to its shelter. If it does not feed, it continues to search for a host. After searching—regardless of whether or not it has eaten—the <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> returns to the shelter to aggregate before the photophase (period of light during a day-night cycle). Reis argues that two reasons explain why C. lectularius would return to its shelter and aggregate after feeding. One is to find a mate and the other is to find shelter to avoid getting smashed after eating.|$|E
25|$|Plants {{traditionally}} used as <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> repellents include {{black cohosh}} (Actaea racemosa), Pseudarthria hookeri, and Laggera alata (Chinese yángmáo cǎo | 羊毛草), though {{information about their}} effectiveness is lacking. Eucalyptus saligna oil was reported by some Zairean researchers to kill bed bugs, among other insects.|$|E
25|$|The name <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> {{derives from}} the {{preferred}} habitat of Cimex lectularius: warm houses and especially near or inside beds and bedding or other sleep areas. Bed bugs are mainly active at night, but are not exclusively nocturnal. They usually feed on their hosts without being noticed.|$|E
40|$|Bed bugs {{cases have}} been at {{alarming}} rate in most foreign countries compared to Southeast Asia, especially in Malaysia. Lack of morphological understanding and ways to control among the society and professionals have become factors of their resurgence. An online survey was conducted among Pest Control Operators (PCO) from different pest control companies in nine states of Malaysia to investigate the commonly used technique in treating <b>bed</b> <b>bugs.</b> The forms were distributed via online to all pest control companies but only 48 of them have responded. Other preferences such astype of premises, number of cases, number of successful treatment and resistance in <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> after residual treatment were {{also included in the}} questionnaires. It was found that most Pest Control companies preferred chemical and spray method for treatment (66. 7 %) especially in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor which also had the highest infestation of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> in their premises such as hotels, motels and residential houses. Most companies prefer RM 500 - 1000 as charging cost per treatment site. Although professionals hardly find resistance <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> in their treatment cases (75 %), the number of complete eradication per site has been very low (41. 7 %). Therefore, improvements in treating <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> should be investigated in details to prevent widespread of <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> throughout Malaysia...|$|R
2500|$|... no truly {{effective}} pesticides were available. Pesticides {{that have}} historically been found effective include pyrethroids, dichlorvos, and malathion. Resistance to pesticides has increased significantly over time, and harm to health from their use is of concern. The carbamate insecticide propoxur is highly toxic to <b>bed</b> <b>bugs,</b> but it has potential toxicity to children exposed to it, and the US Environmental Protection Agency {{has been reluctant to}} approve it for indoor use. Boric acid, occasionally applied as a safe indoor insecticide, is not effective against <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> because they do not groom. The fungus Beauveria bassiana is being researched [...] for its ability to control <b>bed</b> <b>bugs.</b> As <b>bed</b> <b>bugs</b> continue to adapt pesticide resistance, researchers have examined the insect's genome to see how its adaptations develop and to look for potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited in its growth and development phases.|$|R

25|$|The fall in <b>bed</b> <b>bug</b> populations {{after the}} 1930s in the {{developed}} world is believed partly due to the use of DDT to kill cockroaches. The invention of the vacuum cleaner and simplification of furniture design may have also played a role. Others believe it might simply be the cyclical nature of the organism.|$|E
