60|$|Again {{and again}} Barbara Harding plunged {{the sword of}} the brown man into the still heart, until she knew <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> of a doubt that her enemy was forevermore {{powerless}} to injure her. Then she sank, exhausted and trembling, upon the dirt floor beside the corpse.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is serious. It {{strikes at}} an {{innocent}} life. Innocent beyond suspicion! Innocent <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure!</b> Hear me prove it; observe how simple a fact can brush {{out of existence}} this witless lie. Listen. My friends, that lad was never {{out of my sight}} yesterday evening at any time!" ...|$|E
60|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the players sat up and knew <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> that big hands were out. Though their {{features}} showed nothing, each man was beginning unconsciously to tense. Each man strove to appear his natural self, and each natural self was different. Hal Campbell affected his customary cautiousness.|$|E
60|$|After thus hesitating {{several moments}} he {{understood}} <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> {{that he was}} alone--that nothing save his own conscience prevented him from carrying into effect his plan of revenge.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{young men}} will make no reply to my questions," [...] Brant answered, unblushingly, {{although}} {{he must have}} known <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that we understood full well he was lying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep {{out of the}} channel," [...] he said emphatically. [...] "We know <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> {{that the}} enemy is astern of us, {{and there is no}} tellin' when he may come--" ...|$|R
60|$|Joan Randle rode on and on, {{through the}} canon, out at {{its head and}} over a pass into another canon, and never did she let it be {{possible}} for Kells to see her eyes until she knew <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> of a doubt that they hid the strength and spirit and secret of her soul.|$|E
60|$|In {{addition}} to the locks {{on the side and}} rear doors, were stout bars, and after having assured myself that the bolts were shot, I put the timbers securely in place; then examined carefully the fastenings of every shutter until having satisfied myself <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> that none could enter from the outside save by battering down the barriers.|$|E
60|$|Further examination, further inquiry, further reflection, {{confirmed}} this judgment, and established <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> {{the fact that}} the Verb was the storm-center. This discovery made plain the right and wise course to pursue in order to acquire certainty and exactness in understanding the statements which the newspaper was daily endeavoring to convey to me: I must catch a Verb and tame it. I must find out its ways, I must spot its eccentricities, I must penetrate its disguises, I must intelligently foresee and forecast at least the commoner of the dodges it was likely to try upon a stranger in given circumstances, I must get in on its main shifts and head them off, I must learn its game and play the limit.|$|E
60|$|Thus it {{was settled}} <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that the Avenger and her crew {{should become a}} portion of Commodore Barney's flotilla, and I really felt better in mind after the {{question}} had been definitely decided.|$|R
60|$|He {{was only}} sixteen years of age--two months older than I; but {{within an hour}} after we knew <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that Peter Sitz was a prisoner, {{it seemed as if}} the lad had grown to be a man.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{thought you}} might know {{somewhat}} concerning him," [...] I added stupidly, for by the surprise, and even the fear, exhibited by this man I might have known <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that he was all ignorant of what had occurred.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Crewe's {{answer was}} {{characteristically}} terse and businesslike. The overwhelming compliment of {{a request from}} such gentlemen must be treated {{in the nature of}} a command--and yet he had hesitated for several weeks, during which period he had cast about for another more worthy of the honour. Then followed a somewhat technical and (to the lay mind) obscure recapitulation of the iniquities the Northeastern was committing, which proved <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> that Mr. Crewe knew what he was talking about; such phrases as [...] "rolling stock," [...] "milking the road"--an imposing array of facts and figures. Mr. Crewe made it plain that {{he was a man who}} [...] "did things." [...] And if it were the will of Heaven that he became governor, certain material benefits would as inevitably ensue as the day follows the night. The list of the material benefits, for which there was a crying need, bore a strong resemblance to a summary of the worthy measures upon which Mr. Crewe had spent so much time and labour in the last Legislature.|$|E
60|$|Think {{a moment}} what must, <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure,</b> {{be the real}} {{permanent}} sub-bases, or lack of them. Books profoundly considered show a great nation more than anything else--more than laws or manners. (This is, of course, probably the deep-down meaning of that well-buried but ever-vital platitude, Let me sing the people's songs, and I don't care who makes their laws.) Books too reflect humanity en masse, and surely show them splendidly, or the reverse, and prove or celebrate their prevalent traits (these last the main things.) Homer grew out of and has held the ages, and holds to-day, by the universal admiration for personal prowess, courage, rankness, amour propre, leadership, inherent in the whole human race. Shakspere concentrates the brilliancy of the centuries of feudalism on the proud personalities they produced, and paints the amorous passion. The books of the Bible stand for the final superiority of devout emotions over the rest, and of religious adoration, and ultimate absolute justice, more powerful than haughtiest kings or millionaires or majorities.|$|E
5000|$|The dissenting justices {{contended that}} the law was punitive and imposed severe deprivations of liberty. Justice Stevens' dissenting opinion said, [...] "It is also clear <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> that these unique {{consequences}} of conviction of a sex offense are punitive. They share three characteristics, which in the aggregate are not present in any civil sanction. The sanctions (1) constitute a severe deprivation of the offender's liberty, (2) are imposed on everyone who is convicted of a relevant criminal offense, and (3) are imposed only on those criminals. Unlike any of the cases that the Court has cited, a criminal conviction under these statutes provides both a sufficient and {{a necessary condition for}} the sanction".|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely {{you would}} never think of leaving the cabin in daylight, when you know <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that the savages are {{watching}} it?" [...] my mother said in alarm, and Kenton turned away as if realizing the truth of her words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God you are come! I was {{beginning}} to believe you had been made prisoners, and I would be left {{to get out of}} here unaided, which meant <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that I would speedily find myself in the clutches of the Britishers." ...|$|R
60|$|Had we {{remained}} in the canoe, as we should have done, then <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> we had been captives with him, and the flat-boats, not having been delayed by the battle, might at this time be too far down stream for their occupants to render any aid.|$|R
50|$|Curiously enough, his exact {{language}} {{upon this}} interesting point cannot be now determined <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure,</b> because every {{copy of the}} first printed edition prepared by Wimphelin de Schelestadt, Strassbourg 1514, has perished, and in the MS. in possession of the Cordelier Fathers at Lyon the critical passage reads differently from that in the second edition, by the Lutheran, Johannes Secerius, Hagenau 1530. In the Secerius text, now printed in the Lyon edition of the Fathers, and in Migne, the words are, 26:26, “Hoc est corpus meum. Id est, in sacramento” (“This is my body. That is, in the sacrament,” or the sacramental sign as distinct from the res sacramenti, or the substance represented). Matt. 26:28, Transferens spiritualiter corpus in panem, vinum in sanguinem (“Transferring spiritually body into bread, wine into blood”). In the MS. the first passage reads: “Id est, vere in sacramento subsistens” (“That is, truly subsisting in the sacrament”); {{and in the second}} the word “spiritualiter“ is omitted. The Roman Catholics now generally admit the correctness of the printed text, and that the MS. has been tampered with, but insist that Druthmar is not opposed to the Catholic doctrine on the Eucharist.|$|E
50|$|That the {{defendants}} in combination controlled {{the market and}} {{had the ability to}} and did drive competitors from the business of manufacturing knitted fabric slip covers is abundantly clear from the record. That {{the defendants}} in combination fixed and maintained prices is likewise crystal clear. That the defendants in combination and cross-licensing created a situation in the industry which, particularly by agreement for joint action respecting the patents, effectively hindered newcomers in the field, is also established <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> of doubt. That the harassing suits against competitors, previously discussed in some detail, were designed as and were actually only harassing suits is clear from an examination of the correspondence between the parties and the Court feels that such conclusion in inescapable from an objective analysis of the documents. All of these actions taken in concert constitute a clear violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the Government has established to the satisfaction of the Court that the combination and conspiracy above referred to represents an unreasonable restraint of trade and commerce among the several states of the United States in the manufacture and sale of ready-made furniture slip covers, is unlawful, and in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Further, the Government, in the opinion of the Court, has effectively demonstrated that the defendants combined and conspired not only to restrain trade unreasonably but also to monopolize trade and commerce among the several states of the United States in the manufacture and sale of ready-made furniture slip covers, in direct violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The Court also feels that by documentary proof the Government has established that the defendants have used patent rights unlawfully in instituting, effectuating and maintaining the aforesaid combination and conspiracy which likewise constitutes a clear violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.|$|E
40|$|The {{extending}} {{of international}} recognition {{to a new}} government or a new state is a political function which belongs exclusively to the political departments of government. It follows that whenever the question of recognition or not is really involved in litigation the court should inform itself, as to the course pursued by the appropriate political department and decide accordingly. This much, if it ever needed to be settled, may now be regarded as settled <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure...</b>|$|E
60|$|Most {{likely it}} was a party of hunters, who had not really come out for mischief, but seeing an {{opportunity}} to take the life of a white man seized upon it. If they had been on the warpath, then <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> our cabin would have been attacked.|$|R
60|$|However great {{his need}} of {{coming up with}} the British, Elias Macomber knew too much to trust himself in a canoe on the open bay while the wind held as it did, and we knew <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that if he had not already gained the fleet, he was hiding on shore somewhere.|$|R
60|$|Of {{what did}} we talk? I can't really tell; but you might put {{yourself}} in our places, and say if you would not naturally speak of those most dear when you knew <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that {{within a few hours}} at the most you would be standing face to face with death.|$|R
40|$|It is <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure</b> that American {{prosecutors}} have ple-nary charging discretion in criminal cases; prosecutors with admissible proof {{beyond a reasonable}} doubt may nevertheless decline to seek a conviction. Such declinations are sometimes rooted in legitimate law enforcement rationales, such as the absence of sufficient enforcement resources. A prosecutor, however, might decline a meritorious prosecution simply because he or she disagrees with the applicable law or its application in the particular case. This prerogative to engage in what this Article terms “prosecutorial nullification” has been under-theorized, but raises a number of profound questions: Is prosecutorial nullification a subspecies of legitimate prosecutorial discretion, or should it be considered an extra-legal departure from established rules? What is the conceptual relation-ship of prosecutorial nullification to jury nullification and other like actions of discretion-wielding criminal justice actors? Do the unique institutional role and function of the American prosecutor provide a sufficient rationale for the power to frustrate legislative judgment and undermine (or promote) societal values and norms? This Article seeks to sharpen the definition of “prosecutorial nullification,” contextualize it within the broader conversation about discretion in the criminal process, and offer a nuanced account of its relationship with prosecutorial authority, legiti-macy, and the rule of law...|$|E
40|$|The lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s task in this {{symposium}} {{is simple}} and unhappy. He need not speculate {{about the effects of}} the Social Security Act on life, on business, on government. He need not concern himself about the probabilities of expected benefits or suggested evils. 2 ̆ 2 Those thrilling jobs have been assigned exclusively to other contributors. Moreover, constitutional dogma teaches that, in his professional capacity of advising on constitutionality, the lawyer, as the judge, need not even persuade himself of the wisdom or folly, the desirability or undesirability, of the legislation-not even that the legislation is perhaps a little more wise than foolish or a little more foolish than wise. It is sufficient if the legislative determination has some reasonable support. The work of the Committee on Economic Security, the legislative hearings and the remainder of this symposium establish that support-and <b>beyond</b> <b>peradventure.</b> So the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s job is simple: 2 ̆ 2 to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged 2 ̆ 2 and, 2 ̆ 2 uninfluenced by predilection for or against the policy disclosed in the legislation, 2 ̆ 2 see 2 ̆ 2 whether the latter squares with the former. 2 ̆...|$|E
60|$|For Jerry {{had learned}} partings, and <b>beyond</b> all <b>peradventure</b> {{this was a}} parting, though little he dreamed that he would again meet Michael across the years and across the world, in a fabled valley of far California, where they would live out their days in the hearts and arms of the beloved gods.|$|R
60|$|But that I knew <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> it was useless, I {{would have}} said all {{in my power to}} keep him with us; but his mind was fixed, and, to tell the truth, I could not well blame him for doing as I would have done, {{regardless}} of any duty I might owe to General Herkimer.|$|R
60|$|We knew <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> {{that the}} Indians {{secreted}} in the thicket round about us were keeping sharp {{watch over the}} cabin, on the alert for a movement of such a kind, {{and there was not}} a single chance in a hundred that one of us could even show his head out of either window or door without being shot down.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{believe in}} going to Cambridge when I get there, and not before," [...] Job Lord said surlily; but I could detect a tone of anxiety such as he had never shown before, which {{was not to be}} {{wondered}} at, for Hiram acted and spoke like a man who knows <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> that matters will go exactly as he has arranged.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{we found}} the weapons in fit {{condition}} for immediate use, and paddled ashore in a hurry, finding Josiah and Dody waiting for us. They also had heard that Elias was in the village, and we knew <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure,</b> {{even if we had}} not been certain before, that the cur had slipped away from those who should have guarded him with their lives.|$|R
60|$|Sergeant Corney flatly {{refused to}} tell the story, insisting that I was the better able to do so, and, in the {{presence}} of Colonel Gansevoort and all his principal officers, I related the events of that day when an able soldier and a brave man was forced by the prating of cowards to lead his soldiers where he knew, almost <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure,</b> he had no hope of winning a victory.|$|R
60|$|During {{the assault}} {{not one of}} the {{garrison}} had been taken prisoner, and certain it was that the besiegers had not left the vicinity of the fort for such length of time as would be sufficient to enable them to procure captives elsewhere, therefore did we know <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> who the victims would be, but why only two were to suffer was something at which we could not even so much as guess.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately for us, the Britishers did {{not appear}} to think it {{necessary}} to move up the river swiftly, knowing full well that all the towns above were at their mercy whenever they arrived; but the fleet hove to off the ruins of the fortification while some of the officers landed to ascertain the amount of damage done. It was this last which gave us the opportunity of which we stood so sorely in need, otherwise we were taken prisoners <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{had been}} quick to miss the shouts and cheers. And I had been just as quick to see, or to imagine, a subtle change in Sally Langdon's face. We had not {{traveled}} a mile before the tension relaxed about her lips, the downcast eyelids lifted, and I saw, <b>beyond</b> any <b>peradventure</b> of doubt, a lighter spirit. Then I relaxed myself, for I had keyed up every nerve to make myself strong for this undertaking. I lay back with closed eyes, weary, aching, in more pain than I wanted them to discover. And I thought and thought.|$|R
60|$|When we had run {{past the}} village, however, {{and there was}} no longer any {{possibility}} Jerry and I would attempt to go ashore, Darius humbly asked us to come aft, and once there he explained in a friendly way why we, who had virtually bound ourselves to serve under Commodore Barney, should report to him before attending to pleasure or personal matters. He also made it plain that at this time, when we knew <b>beyond</b> a <b>peradventure</b> the enemy was about to make an attack, it was absolutely necessary every American who had agreed to aid in the defense, should be ready for duty at a moment's notice.|$|R
