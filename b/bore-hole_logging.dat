40|$|Methods and {{techniques}} of reconnaissance traditionally used in hydrogeology {{have been tested}} and modified {{for use in the}} characterization of landfill undergrounds. The development work includes hydraulic and geophysical methods in drilling holes as well as methods of laboratory soil and well-core analysis. A portable <b>bore-hole</b> <b>logging</b> apparatus has been completed by a hydrocontrol, a drilling hole seismic proke and by a temperature probe which can be used likewise in the aeration zone and in the water-saturated zone. The performance of the enlarged <b>bore-hole</b> <b>logging</b> apparatus has been demonstrated on several test sites including the landfills in Eulenberg and in Schoeneiche.

30|$|The {{well and}} <b>bore-hole</b> <b>logs</b> for Sakri taluka {{suggest that the}} upper layer {{consists}} of highly fractured basalt, {{a thin layer of}} soil/murum and highly weathered basalt, less fractured basalt, and compact basalt, but very thin layer of soil present in many of the sites is not reflected in the values obtained from VES. There are more dug wells present in this taluka. The water table is encountered at the depth of 10 – 12  m for dug wells and bore wells are rare because of the kind of lithology that does not support groundwater. However, few bore wells show the presence of water table at 100 – 120  m.|$|R
30|$|The general {{lithology}} in Shirpur taluka {{is predominantly}} composed of alluvium. The <b>bore-hole</b> <b>log</b> shows upper layer of {{black cotton soil}} followed by sandy alluvium with clay lenses. Earlier, the water table was found at 27 – 30  m with sufficient water. Later on with time, the depth of water table increased. At present, it is tapped at 60 – 76  m. The quantity of water is about 5000  L/h. It is observed that in Shindkheda, the groundwater was not available in sufficient quantity as {{compared to that of}} Shirpur. However, after incidents of Killari earthquake (September 1993), the situation has changed. Now, the Shindkheda taluka has a better quantity of water than Shirpur.|$|R
40|$|The geomorphological {{features}} of the Lower Mekong Plain and their relationships with floods, as well asthe subsurface geology and the major depositional processes in the area, are discussed. From theinterpretation of aerial photos and field reconnaissance, the Lower Mekong Plain in Cambodia ischaracterized as a floodplain with natural levees and back marshes. These geomorphological featuresinfluence {{the extent of the}} extensive inundation that occurs during every rainy (wet) season. An extremeflood in 2000 confirmed the close relationship between micro-landforms and the flooding. A preliminarystudy of <b>bore-hole</b> <b>logs</b> in the area of Phnom Penh was also carried out. Base rocks are shallower in thewestern part, whereas thick (> 130 m) Quaternary deposits occur in the eastern part, suggesting the presenceof a structural basin...|$|R
40|$|A {{mapping of}} shear-wave {{velocity}} {{for all of}} Japan is performed using “Japan Engineering Geomorpho-logic Classification Map (JEGM) ” which has been developed as a GIS-based ground condition map. At first, we calculate the average shear-wave velocity in the upper 30 m (AVS 30), which is a simple and useful predictor for estimating site amplification factors of peak ground velocity (PGV), for approximately 2, 000 sites where shear-wave velocity has been measured in all over Japan. Geomorphologic units for all <b>bore-holes</b> <b>logging</b> data are interpreted using land-classification maps that are the base paper maps for the JEGM. Next, we examine the correlation between not only geomorphologic units but also geographical information derived from the JEGM and the AVS 30 values. The AVS 30 s show some dependency with elevations, slope angles, and distances from mountains or hills. In order to develop the estimating model of the AVS 30, multi-variate regression analysis is conducted using these geomorphologic indices. Then, we can achieve to create an AVS 30 map with relatively high accuracy for all of Japan using the JEGM.

40|$|The Paraná-Etendeka Large Igneous Province (LIP) at the {{conjugate}} plate {{margins of}} South America and Africa is investigated with GOCE gradients. The LIP is associated to Gondwana breakup, and is asymmetric {{between the two}} margins. The study intends to investigate how the lithosphere is affected by continental breakup and what caused the asymmetry, considering that successive spreading is symmetric. The gradients at satellite and surface height are modelled with other geophysical data as seismic profiling, seismic tomography and <b>bore-hole</b> <b>logs.</b> Densities and velocities are modelled with a petrologic model. The residual gravity gradients, reduced of crustal thickness variations and sediments, are continuously high along the Angola and Namibia margin. Inversion shows the high {{is due to a}} density increase about 6 km thick with the top at about 23 km depth, placing it above the Moho. It is probable that the densification be due to magmatic intrusions, increasing the volume of the LIP at the African side, which remained trapped in the crust and produced only small volumes of surface basalts. This is true also for the margin of Angola, which in literature is claimed to be void of magmatism along its margin...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{deposits}} {{in the central}} areas of Weichselian Scandinavian Ice Sheet (SIS) is im-portant for understanding behaviour of the ice sheet. This study provides new information on the deposits in the previously poorly known glaciofluvial Isoniemi complex in Haukipu-das, Finland, located in {{the central part of}} SIS. The deposits are studied using ground pen-etrating radar (GPR) to delineate the depositional and glaciotectonic environments and events that have occurred in the area. The results are interpreted using the principles of ra-dar stratigraphy and correlated with an earlier sedimentological study from the area. <b>Bore-hole</b> <b>logs</b> of old boreholes made for ground water and aggregate investigations are used as an aid in the interpretation alongside the previously obtained sedimentological data. GPR data show 10 radar facies separated by seven radar surfaces. The sequence of events inter-preted from GPR data and earlier sedimentological study include: 1) deposition of the gla-ciofluvial sediments, 2) deposition of till and the first stage of deformation by an advancing glacier, 3) retreat of the glacier, and cutting and infilling of the proglacial channels, 4) progla-cial deformation forming the Runteli ridge, 5) glacioisostatic uplift close to the water level, 6) possible forming of the rip current channels and 7) reworking of the earlier sediments by wave and sea-ice action...|$|R
40|$|Water {{has always}} {{influenced}} {{where and how}} people have lived. In southern Britain during the Bronze Age, {{the transition to a}} more settled life-style would have affected how a community accessed water. It is mooted that these changes led to new ways of thinking and this study will consider both the functional and symbolic treatment of water in the context of contemporary communities. In a landscape in which field boundaries became more prominent, the watery 'edge' created by rivers, streams and marsh can be shown to have strongly influenced the behaviour and inhabitation patterns of the community. By the end of the Bronze Age the evidence suggests that water had become a significant conceptual and 'spiritual' element in people's lives. The new evidence from the study area, i. e. the adjoining coastal zone and downland block of West Sussex and East Hampshire, focuses on these issues. In particular, a contextual study investigates the deposition patterns of metalwork and the role and place of 'burnt mounds' in Bronze Age society is considered. A study of the <b>bore-hole</b> <b>logs</b> and hydrology of the region demonstrates how later post-Medieval abstraction has significantly lowered the water table. An assessment is made of how this may have impacted on the riparian environment of the study area and reduced the riverine flow in the modern era. This new approach has proved important to the contextualisation of the Bronze Age landscape. From about 800 cal. BC southern Britain underwent a landscape transformation and re-organisation. These changes occurred alongside an initial increase in metalwork deposition practice followed by an abrupt curtailment of this behaviour. Was climate change involving increased precipitation rates, a factor or component of the changes seen in the archaeological record for the 9 th and s" centuries BC? A critique of the evidence is undertaken. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of shallow aquifer or water bearing formations in Idoa Village of Edo State, Nigeria was investigated {{for over a}} decade by using electrical resistivity method, employing Schlumberger array of vertical electrical sounding (VES). The attention of the Government of Edo State is now focus on Idoa area because of acute water shortage engulfing the village area thus making life unbearable for the inhabitants. This research studies of many years will serve as a working guide to a competent bore-hole driller that may be given the contract. Fifteen (15) fairly distributed VES were conducted in the area and its environs to justify the geophysical investigation operation of collecting apparent resistivity data. Interpretation of data was done initially by curve matching which provided computer iterative model results. The results obtained were then interpreted using <b>bore-hole</b> driller <b>log</b> as a control to determine various unconfined aquifers in the study area. The detected unconfined aquifer will provide adequate groundwater to the bore-hole at perceptible rate, sufficient enough for the inhabitants of the area. The unconfined aquifers are probably sandstone with clay intercalation. The resistivity values for the aquifers detected varied from 30 ohm-m to 8, 500 ohm-m while depths below sea level to probable aquifer level varied from 14 m to 50 m. Its thickness varied from about 7. 0 m t...|$|R
40|$|The Bluebell field {{produces}} {{from the}} Tertiary lower Green River and Wasatch Formations of the Uinta Basin, Utah. The productive interval consists {{of thousands of}} feet of interbedded fractured clastic and carbonate beds deposited in a fluvial-dominated deltaic lacustrine environment, sandstones deposited in fluvial-dominated deltas; and carbonates and some interbedded sandstones of the lower Wasatch transition deposited in mud flats. Bluebell project personnel are studying ways to improve completion techniques used {{in the field to}} increase primary production in both new wells and recompletions. The study includes detailed petrographic examination of the different lithologic reservoir types in both the outcrop and core. Outcrop, core, and geophysical logs are being used to identify and map important depositional cycles. Petrographic detail will be used to improve log calculation methods which are currently highly questionable due to varying water chemistry and clay content in the Green River and Wasatch Formations. Field mapping of fractures and their relationship to basin tectonics helps predict the orientation of open fractures in the subsurface. The project includes acquiring <b>bore-hole</b> imaging <b>logs</b> from new wells in the Bluebell field thereby obtaining detailed subsurface fracture data previously not available. Reservoir simulation models are being constructed to improve the understanding of pressure and fluid flow within the reservoir. A detailed database of well completion histories has been compiled and will be studied to determine which were the most and the least effective methods used in the past...|$|R
40|$|Open {{fractures}} are {{of interest}} in many areas such as ground water contamination, haz-ardous waste disposal, oil and gas recovery, and geothermal energy extraction. In borehole geophysics and engineering, fractures are usually located by acoustic <b>bore-hole</b> televiewer <b>logging,</b> however, {{not all of the}} observed fractures are permeable. The caliper log, on the other hand, provides the information about the change of borehole diameter, but increasing diameter does not prove the existence of open fractures. Nor can the combination of these two methods-televiewer logs and caliper logs-provide direct information about open fractures. However, tube waves, generated by P- and/or S-waves in hydrophone vertical seismic profiling (VSP) or cross-well seismic profiling section can detect open fractures intersecting the borehole. A new technique is developed to determine the orientation of open fractures using the normalized ratios of an S-wave-generated tube wave to a P-wave-generated tube wave. The fracture orientations determined by this method represent the average over the fracture planes for large radii, generally on the order of a meter. Numerical tests show that, given a good experiment design, a set of two independent measurements of these ratios with polarization information, or a set of three independent measurements without polarization information, provides a unique solution. The developed technique is stable in the presence of noise. This technique is applied to hydrophone VSP data from the Kent Cliffs test well in southeastern New York state. The orientations of the three major fractures which generate primary tube waves in the seismic profiling sections are obtained. The results agree well with the orientations measured from the borehole televiewer images in general. Any discrepancy may be attributed to the difference between the sampling size of this method and the borehole televiewer, to the deviation of rays from the straight line...|$|R
