Yet, victims of corrective rape are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E

Before he arrives to take her away, however, Mama finds and confiscates the money Jason has {{previously}} paid Number 18, and correctly guesses that he does not intend to bring her back.

25|$|The {{view that}} {{sexuality}} is victimization teaches girls {{to be careful}} of <b>being</b> <b>sexually</b> victimized and taken advantage of. Educators who hold this perspective encourage sexual education, but focus on teaching girls how to say no, teaching them of the risks of being victims and educate them about risks and diseases of <b>being</b> <b>sexually</b> active. This perspective teaches adolescents that boys are predators and that girls are victims of sexual victimization. Researchers state that this perspective does not address the existence of desire within girls, does not address the societal variables that influence sexual violence and teaches girls to view sex as dangerous only before marriage. In reality, sexual violence can be very prevalent within marriages too.|$|E

25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how <b>being</b> <b>sexually</b> active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
25|$|Since 2007, Harriet Harman {{has been}} Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, the UK's current {{opposition}} party.

However, Gordon Brown {{announced that he}} would not have a Deputy Prime Minister, much to the consternation of feminists, particularly with suggestions that privately Brown considered Jack Straw to be de facto deputy prime minister and thus bypassing Harman. With Harman's cabinet post of Leader of the House of Commons, Brown allowed her to chair Prime Minister's Questions when {{he was out of the}} country. Harman also held the post Minister for Women and Equality. In April 2012 after <b>being</b> <b>sexually</b> harassed on London public transport English journalist Laura Bates founded the Everyday Sexism Project, a website which documents everyday examples of sexism experienced by contributors from around the world.
