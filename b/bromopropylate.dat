Acaricides were at one time an effective method in regulating the transmission of V. jacobsoni in honey bees, but the buildup of residues in acaricide-resistant strains have decreased the effectiveness of mite control in honey bees. Among those acaricides used are acrinathrin, amitraz, <b>bromopropylate,</b> chlordimeform, coumaphos, flumethrin, and fluvalinate. Fluvalinate {{is the most effective}} acaricide.|$|E
40|$|HONEY AS BIO-INDICATOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTION FROM DETERMINATION OF HEAVY METALS Honey is a food {{produced}} by honeybees from the nectar of flowers. Bees are selective {{in how they}} use nectariferous species, for which honey is named according to its floral origin. The quality of honey depends on factors such as: a) pollen pattern present in nectariferous species that allows identifying floral sources and distinguishing between mono- and polifloral honey, of which the former has a higher value in international market given that contains 50 % or more of one type of pollen in the solid residue; b) presence of acaricides (toxic agents such as fluvalinate, amitraz, <b>bromopropylates</b> and other), used to fight the Varroa jacobsoni, a disease that is widely disseminated in Chilean hives; c) chemical compounds that provide nutritional properties such as different types of sugars and proteins; d) flavonoids that provide them with antioxidant and antibiotic properties, compounds that could become a potential marker {{of different types of}} honeys; e) presence of hydroxymethylfurfural, heavy metals (cadmium, lead, mercury, copper and other) and antibiotics. The Botany Group of the Faculty of Agronomy at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile got interested in heavy metals, as residues in honeys, as they had not been studied in depth as contaminants of apiarian products in spite of their potential danger to human health. When this project was submitted to FONDECYT, the data that related vegetable species to the presence of heavy metals in honeys was scarce, for which it was necessary to study sources of heavy metal contamination in hives, especially within an international market that is more and more demanding of residue-free products. The general objective of the project was to study relationships between the geographical and botanical origin of Chilean honeys and the presence of heavy metals, in order to establish forecasts of potentially contaminated zones in areas of hives and of produced honeys. For this purpose, different methodologies were evaluated for quantification of heavy metals in honeys. These methodologies translated into the elaboration of a Standard for heavy metal content through an Inductively Coupled Plasma methodology (Mejias and Montenegro, 2007). In order to achieve the specific objective, four study sites were established; two of them near copper mine tailings (La Cocinera mine in the 4 th Region and El Salado mine in the 5 th Region) and near Cajón del Maipo (Metropolitan Region) and Volcan Llaima volcano (9 th Region) The main hypothesis was based on the fact that, given that honey inherits characteristics from the plants it is originated from, and most heavy metals come from water, air and soil, the presence of these metals in honeys should be related to their geographical and botanical origin. Results obtained during the 3 years of the study show that, although the presence of heavy metals in agricultural soils is directly related to their distance to mine tailings, translocation of these metals to vegetable tissues and to honey is very restricted. In view of this, honey {{could be used as a}} bioindicator of environmental contamination in the zone of origin, taking into account its geographical origin. The complementary hypothesis was that if heavy metal content in Chilean honeys were under the European and American standards, they could be exported with a higher added value thus allowing optimizing competitiveness of the apiarian field in the international market, thus levelling the national standard to regulations of destination countries. Heavy metal concentrations found in all analyzed honeys in the different study sites were under the international maximum limits (for those that are regulated). This would allow Chilean honey to be known worldwide as a clean product in terms of heavy metal content. Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|R
40|$|A New Rearing Technique of Phytophagous Mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari : Tetranychida) and its Application in the Study of the Efficacy of some Acaricides on Potato [Solanum tuberosum L.). A 5 cm {{diameter}} leaf disc {{of potato}} or another host plant (or four on 2. 5 cm diameter) {{was used in}} a Petri dish of 9 cm diameter for the rearing technique. This leaf disc, pierced in its centre, slides along a rustproof pin and floats on a 1 mm thick lamina of demineralized fresh water. Water is a "strong barrier" which confines the tetranychid mites on the leaf disc, even if this one does not corne from a host plant (tetranychid mites deprived of food). This rearing technique {{was used as a}} bioassay to test the effectiveness of acaricides (pyrimiphos-methyl, <b>bromopropylate,</b> fenpropathrin, dienochlor) on the developmental stages of Tetranychus urticae. The ovicidal activity against the eggs of one, three, seven days old (the eggs incubation duration being 8. 1 ± 0. 15 days) was also studied. The results obtained show that <b>bromopropylate,</b> fenpropathrin and dienochlor have an ovicidal activity against the eggs of the different ages, but dienochlor has the highest efficiency (90 % mortality). Pyrimiphos-methyl is only active against the seven-day old eggs and <b>bromopropylate</b> has a high efficiency only on the one-day old eggs. Concerning the other developmental stages such as chrysalis (protochrysalis, deu-tochrysalis, teleiochrysalis) and mobile stages (larva, protonymph, deutonymph and adult female), pyrimiphos-methyl has de highest efficiency (90 % mortality); dienochlor also, except mobile stages. <b>Bromopropylate</b> has no activity against the chrysalis and mobile stages and fenpropathrin has a remarkable repulsive effect...|$|E

40|$|A novel, simple, {{and rapid}} single-drop microextraction (SOME) {{procedure}} combined with GC has been developed, validated, and {{applied for the}} determination of multiclass pesticide residues in honey samples. The SDME was optimized using a Plackett-Burman screening design considering all parameters that may influence an SOME procedure and a consequent central composite design to control the parameters that were found to significantly influence the pesticide determination. The developed analytical method required minimal volumes of organic solvents and exhibited good analytical characteristics with enrichment factors ranging from 3 for alpha-endosulfan to 10 for lindane, procymidone, and captan and method quantification limits ranging from 0. 03 mu g/kg for phosalone to 10. 6 mu g/kg for diazinon. The relative recoveries obtained ranged from 70. 8 % for captan to 120 % for fenarimol, and the precision (RSD) ranged from 3 to 15 %. The proposed SDME procedure followed by GC with an electron capture detector for quantification and GC/MS for identification was applied with success {{to the analysis of}} 17 honey samples. Monitoring results indicated a low level of honey contamination by diazinon, chlorpyrifosethyl, procymidone, <b>bromopropylate,</b> and endosulfan (alpha-, beta-, and endosulfan sulfate) residues that were far below the maximum residue limit values specified by the European Union for endosulfan (10 mu g/kg) and <b>bromopropylate</b> (100 mu g/kg) in honey samples...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of some pesticide residues in must and wine samples was developed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography – electron capture detection (GC/ECD). The procedure only needs dilution as sample pre-treatment and is therefore simple, fast and solvent-free. Eight fungicides (vinclozolin, procymidone, iprodione, penconazole, fenarimol, folpet, nuarimol and hexaconazole), one insecticide (chlorpyriphos) and two acaricides (<b>bromopropylate</b> and tetradifon) can be quantified. Good linearity was observed for all the compounds in the range 5 – 100 µg/L. The reproducibility of the measurements was found acceptable (with RSD’s below 20 %).

Peropal (azocyclotin 25 % WP) and Transact (abamectin 1. 8 % EC), {{in addition to}} Kelthane, Tedion and Neoron were used in site 3. Based on the percentage of web formation on date bunches all treatments, except Ekatin, reduced mite infestations significantly below that of the untreated check by the 7 th, 27 th and 21 st days after treatment (DAT) in sites 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Kelthane and Neoron significantly reduced mite infestation in the 3 sites after the second week from application and continued until the termination of the experiment. The effect of Microthiol Special was excellent until 35 DAT in site 1, when it gradually declined {{up to the end}} of the trial. Top Cop`s action was clear from week 3, however, it declined from the 5 th week in site 1.

40|$|Worldwide {{increase}} of pesticides uses in agriculture {{has been growing}} over the past decades but their long-term fate and effects on environment and ecosystem are poorly understood. Here, we present a retro-observation approach based on lake sediment record to monitor micropollutants and to evaluate the long term impact of pesticides treatments on a vineyard catchment in Savoie (France). In this study, we combined sedimentological and geochemical analyses to reconstruct {{the recent history of}} wine practices. The sediment sequence chronology, based on short-live radionuclides (210 Pb/ 137 Cs), provides a well constrain continuous age-depth relationship covering to the last century. Over this period, we reconstruct the succession of fungicides, insecticides and herbicides in relation to the appearance of new chemical substances and the banning of old ones. The first use of fungicide began {{at the end of the}} 19 th century with the Bordeaux mixture (Cu). After the World War II, we observed an intensification of fungicides treatment against mildew, powdery mildew, Botrytis fungi and black rot with specific molecules succession. Insecticides used in vineyard treatment against tetranychid and eriophyid mites were observed since 1940 with a main increase in 1970. Dicofol, <b>Bromopropylate,</b> Bifenthrin succeed to DDT banning in 1972, but a secondary source of DDT appeared at the early of 90 's. The first herbicides use was observed between 1960 and 1970 with the presence of Triazine metabolite (pre-emergence herbicide) and high value of AMPA (Glyphosate metabolite, Roundup®), used as post-emergence herbicide, were found since 1990. Two sedimentation rate increases in 1973 and 1994 could be directly assigned to wine practices. In early 70 's, heavy farm machinery associated to the first application of pre-emergence herbicide, induced a first {{increase of}} soil erosion. In early 90 's, post-emergence herbicide (Roundup®) treatment had a stronger impact on soil erosion with a huge contaminated sediment export. This latter, associated with high AMPA flux, is synchronous to the re-emergence of banned pesticides with the new source of DDT and its aerobic metabolites (DDE) probably stocked in vineyard soil. Over the last years, the decrease of pesticides concentration may be probably related to French and European policies against micropollutant substances in agricultur...|$|E
