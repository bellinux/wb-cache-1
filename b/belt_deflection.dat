40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a small belt-type skin-friction gage to measure wall shear-stress coefficients in wind-tunnel testing are described, summarizing the report of Vakili and Wu (1982). The sensor employs a flexible belt of variable surface characteristics; this belt, wrapped tightly around two cylinders mounted on frictionless flexures, is equipped with strain gages to estimate the deflection of the belt by the flow. An alternative approach uses IR illumination, optical fibers, and a photosensitive transistor, permitting direct measurement of the <b>belt</b> <b>deflection.</b> Drawings, diagrams, and graphs of sample data are provided...|$|E
40|$|The {{enhancement}} of load assumptions for {{the calculation of}} bulk material handling equipment {{is one of the}} research projects currently undertaken by the University of Magdeburg and the University of Newcastle. This research topic also includes the detailed analysis of the conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>deflection</b> under realistic load conditions. The aim of the project, described in this article, was to develop a Finite Element simulation model for the deflection analysis of a belt conveyor using load data for the bulk material calculated by a coupled Discrete Element simulation. As the first step, static load conditions for fixed belt lengths were analysed in the research work. The paper will explain the FEM procedures for the modelling of the belt behaviour and the working principle of a coupled FEM-DEM analysis as well as the verification of the FEM results via experimental tests...|$|E
40|$|The bulk {{material}} on a belt conveyor deforms itself {{due to the}} run through idler stations. The deformation results in energy losses which are summarised in the bulk solid flexure resistance. The right understanding {{of the interaction between}} {{bulk material}} and idler stations is important for the prediction of this resistance and the idler loads. For the calculation of the bulk material behaviour on the belt the classical analytical approach by Krause and Hettler was extended by Wheeler with a Finite Difference model to consider the <b>belt</b> <b>deflection.</b> DEM simulation and experimental measurements of the <b>belt</b> <b>deflection</b> were used by Ilic to predict the bulk material behaviour. This paper will use coupled FEM-DEM simulations for a pure numerical analysis of the interaction between bulk material, belt and idler. In this approach a simplified FEM model for a fabric belt is combined with a calibrated DEM model for cohesionless grit The model and the results of the coupled simulation will be presented. The paper will highlight the influence of belt velocity, belt pre-tension and idler distance on the behaviour of the bulk material as well as how this approach can be used to determine the bulk solid flexure resistance. Further, the new results are compared with the findings of previous works and experimental data.

40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} {{high-rise}} building {{is more often}} dictated by its serviceability rather than strength. Structural Engineers are always striving to overcome challenge of controlling lateral deflection and storey drifts as well as self weight of structure imposed on foundation. One {{of the most effective}} techniques is the use of outrigger and belt truss system in Composite structures that can astutely solve the above two issues in High-rise constructions. This paper investigates deflection control by effective utilisation of belt truss and outrigger system on a 60 -storey composite building subjected to wind loads. A three dimensional Finite Element Analysis is performed with one, two and three outrigger levels. The reductions in lateral deflection are 34 %, 42 % and 51 % respectively as compared to a model without any outrigger system. There is an appreciable decline in the storey drifts with the introduction of these stiffer arrangements.

40|$|Artículo de publicaciónDuring the Late Jurassic–Early Oligocene interval, {{widespread}} hydrothermal copper mineralization events {{occurred in}} association with the geological evolution of the southern segment of the central Andes, giving rise to four NS-trending metallogenic belts of eastward-decreasing age: Late Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, Late Paleocene–Early Eocene, and Late Eocene–Early Oligocene. The Antofagasta– Calama Lineament (ACL) consists of an important dextral strike-slip NE-trending fault system. Deformation along the ACL system is evidenced by a right-lateral displacement of the Late Paleocene–Early Eocene metallogenic belts. Furthermore, clockwise rotation of the Early Cretaceous Mantos Blancos copper deposit and the Late Paleocene Lomas Bayas porphyry copper occurred. In the Late Eocene–Early Oligocene metallogenic <b>belt,</b> a sigmoidal <b>deflection</b> and a clockwise rotation is observed in the ACL. The ACL is thought to have controlled the emplacement of Early Oligocene porphyry copper deposits (34 – 37 Ma; Toki, Genoveva, Quetena, and Opache), whereas it deflected the Late Eocene porphyry copper belt (41 – 44 Ma; Esperanza, Telégrafo, Centinela, and Polo Sur ore deposits). These observations suggest that right-lateral displacement of the ACL was active during the Early Oligocene. We propose that the described structural features need to be considered in future exploration programs within this extensively gravel-covered region of northern Chile...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of numerical analysis and simulation methods is a {{main part of}} the design process of today's bulk solids handling facilities. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is mainly used for static and dynamic structural analysis when designing and optimising components. Meanwhile the Discrete Element Method (DEM) is used to simulate and optimise the transport and material flow processes. The advantage of these two methods of proven by the rapidly growing interest in the use of these techniques in both industry and research. The Finite Element Method is a very useful tool to analyse the deformation behaviour of components. The main disadvantage of this technique is that all the load assumptions that accrue from the interaction of the components and the bulk material can not be found easily so some simplifications are needed. This is the point where the Discrete Element Method becomes useful. It provides the opportunity to calculate the contact forces between the bulk material and components of the bulk handling equipment that is being simulated. The main disadvantage of this method is that the components can only be represented by rigid walls. The coupling of these two methods can help to overcome the disadvantages occurring from the use of the individual methods. This paper will explain the theoretical background of the coupling of the two methods and how they can be used for analysing conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>deflection.</b> It will introduce the use of ANSYS TM Classic to cover the Finite Element Method and the use of PFC 3 D for the Discrete Element section...|$|E
