There are many fungicides labeled for control of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, including benzimidazoles, carboxamides, nitriles, dicarboxamides, and demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). Some common fungicides used include chlorothalonil (nitrile), propiconazole (DMI), <b>boscalid</b> (carboxamide), thiophanate-methyl (benzamidazole), and iprodione (dicarboxamide). Preventative fungicide programs should be implemented when conditions are favorable for disease development (i.e., in the Spring when nighttime temperatures reach 50 F).

5000|$|As {{sclerotia}} are {{a survival}} {{structure in the}} life cycle for the pathogen, {{it is important to}} reduce and eliminate sclerotia in the soil. One effective way to reduce sclerotia is sclerotia germination stimulants. These germination stimulants can reduce sclerotia by 90%. One {{way to do this is}} using diallyl disulfide (DADS). This chemical is what triggers sclerotia to germinate. Upon using DADS in the soil, no Allium crops can be grown in that soil for a year to keep the treatment effective. If there are allium crops growing they will be able to complete their lifecycle and keep sclerotia in the soil. Therefore, DADS is applied artificially in the field with no Allium species, which in turn has sclerotia germinate and unable to find a host and die rather than lay dormant in the soil. This can also be done by applying a garlic extract or the use of certain petroleum-based products. Dipping seed garlic in water at [...] is effective, but higher temperatures may kill the cloves. It is also important to use fungicides with the chemical DADS. There are three fungicides that are registered for white rot. They are: Tebuconazole, Fludioxonil and <b>Boscalid</b> with Tebuconazole being the most effective. [...] All of these fungicides need to be applied right at planting, as later fungicide applications are not effective to control disease. It is also important to note that once an infection is found there are no chemical controls to stop or reduce disease during that season.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{environmental}} fate of the fungicide <b>boscalid</b> in a sandy soil. <b>Boscalid</b> was applied in spring 2010 / 11 to a cropland site in western Germany. Three years after second application 65 undisturbed soil samples were taken. <b>Boscalid</b> was extracted using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). <b>Boscalid</b> contents in the plough horizon ranged between 0. 12 and 0. 53 with a field mean of 0. 20 ± 0. 09 μg kg− 1. These contents were considerably lower compared to calculation using literature DT 50 values, whereby a concentration of 16. 89 μg kg− 1 was expected assuming a literature DT 50 value of 345 days. Therefore, the measured field <b>boscalid</b> concentration only yields 1. 2 % of the expected value. To test whether the unknown extraction efficiency, losses from spray drift and interception can explain the mismatch between calculated and measured concentrations all these uncertainties were taken into account into calculations, but field concentrations and DT 50 were still lower as expected. Leaching to deeper horizons was also studied but could not explain the discrepancy either. Moreover, a short-term incubation experiment using 14 C labelled <b>boscalid</b> revealed also shorter DT 50 values of 297 – 337 compared to the 345 days taken from literature. However, this DT 50 value is still considerably larger compared to the 104 – 224 days that were calculated based on the field experiment.

The first application was carried out at 30 days after transplant and the following at every 15 days. The evaluations were: weight loss, titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids (SS), SS/TA relation, pH, ascorbic acid content, texture, total soluble sugars (TSS), activity of pectin methyl esterase (PME) and polygalacturonase (PG). The SS content, responsible for fruit flavor, varied accordingly to the treatment, being highest for GA 4 + 7 + benzylaminopurine and lowest for the control.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Succinate {{dehydrogenase}} inhibitors (SDHIs), {{interfering with}} fungal respiration, {{are considered to}} be fungicides at medium to high risk of resistance. <b>Boscalid</b> was the first molecule belonging to the SDHIs that was introduced for the control of Botryotinia fuckeliana. A range of different target-site mutations leading to <b>boscalid</b> resistance have been found in field populations of the fungus. The different types of mutation confer different cross-resistance profiles towards novel SDHIs, such as the recently introduced fungicide fluopyram. This study combines the determination of cross-resistance profiles and the setting-up of methods for fast molecular detection of the mutations. RESULTS: By means of in vitro tests, a range of SdhB mutations were characterised for resistance levels towards <b>boscalid</b> and fluopyram. SdhB mutations conferring P 225 L and P 225 F substitutions conferred high resistance to <b>boscalid</b> and high or moderate resistance to fluopyram respectively. Mutants carrying the N 230 I replacement were moderately resistant to both SDHIs. Substitutions at position H 272 responsible for a high level of resistance to <b>boscalid</b> conferred sensitivity (H 272 R), hypersensitivity (H 272 Y) or moderate resistance (H 272 V) to fluopyram. Allele-specific (AS) PCR was developed and used for genotyping 135 B. fuckeliana isolates. The assay confirmed the strict association between resistance profiles and allelic variants of the SdhB gene. Real-time AS-PCR proved to be sensitive and specific for quantitative detection of different SDHI-resistant genotypes. CONCLUSION: Fluopyram-resistant mutants are currently rarely detected in the field sprayedwith <b>boscalid,</b> but thismay change with intensive exposureof the fungalpopulation tofluopyram. PCRassays/methodsdeveloped inthe study provide tools for fast monitoring of field populations and observing possible changes in population composition following fluopyram introduction, useful for the setting-up of appropriate preventivemeasures...|$|E
40|$|Resistance of Alternaria alternata to <b>boscalid,</b> {{the first}} succinate {{dehydrogenase}} inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide labeled on pistachio, {{has become a}} common occurrence in California pistachio orchards and affects the performance of this fungicide. In this study, we established the baseline sensitivities of A. alternata to the new SDHIs fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad and assessed their cross resistance patterns with <b>boscalid.</b> Examination of the effective fungicide concentration that inhibits mycelial growth to 50 % relative to the control (EC 50) for 50 baseline isolates revealed that the majority were sensitive to <b>boscalid,</b> penthiopyrad, fluopyram, and fluxapyroxad. Analysis of EC 50 values for <b>boscalid</b> for 117 A. alternata isolates originating from boscalid-exposed orchards showed that 44, 3, 1, and 69 isolates had sensitive, reduced sensitivity, moderately resistant, and highly resistant <b>boscalid</b> phenotypes, respectively. Molecular investigation of the occurrence of known SDH mutations showed that, among the 69 isolates highly resistant to <b>boscalid,</b> 44, 2, 14, and 1 isolates possessed the mutations leading to the H 277 Y, H 277 R, H 134 R, and H 133 R amino acid substitutions in AaSDHB, AaSDHB, AaSDHC, and AaSDHD subunits, respectively. Some SDHB or SDHC mutants displayed highly sensitive, sensitive, or reduced sensitivity phenotypes toward penthiopyrad or fluxapyroxad, whereas other had low, moderate, or high levels of resistance to these fungicides. In contrast, all the SDHB mutants were sensitive to fluopyram, while 10, 5, and 1 SDHC mutants had sensitive, reduced sensitivity, and moderately resistant fluopyram phenotypes, respectively. The SDHD mutant had reduced sensitivity to fluopyram and penthiopyrad but was highly resistant to fluxapyroxad. The discrepancies of cross-resistance patterns between SDHIs suggest that their binding sites in complex II may differ slightly and that additional mechanisms of resistance to these compounds are likely involved. Ultimately, {{the findings of this}} study should lead to the rational and sustained deployment of new SDHIs in Alternaria late blight spray programs...|$|E

The European Directive 2009 / 128 /CE and CE 1107 / 2009 application have drastically reduced the number of chemicals {{that can be used in}} agriculture, including the benzimidazolic compounds that had shown the best results in preventing S. cardinale canker. It is therefore urgent to find alternative fungicides to replace the banned compounds. The purpose of the present work was to assess some fungicides through in vitro tests and pre- and post-inoculation sprayings on Cupressus sempervirens, for the control of S. cardinale. The active ingredients <b>boscalid,</b> fosetyl-aluminium, triadimenol and azoxystrobin were compared with thiophanate-methyl as reference. The effectiveness of thiophanate-methyl in reducing canker development was confirmed especially when it was applied to trees before they were inoculated with S. cardinale. Azoxystrobin was as effective as thiophanate-methyl in the pre-inoculation trials. <b>boscalid</b> prevented conidial germination and mycelial growth of S. cardinale in vitro and appeared a promising contact fungicide for the prevention of cypress canker. Azoxystrobin and <b>boscalid</b> are listed in a less hazardous class than thiophanate-methyl, and has less risk for the environment and for users. </p...|$|E
40|$|Copper is {{the only}} {{fungicide}} registered to control avocado rots in orchards. There are concerns {{about the impact of}} copper on the environment because it does not readily degrade. In order to reduce copper use on avocado orchards new formulations of copper with more available copper per gram active ingredient, new chemistries, and biological products were tested in a series of laboratory tests and postharvest. Four copper formulations (Kocide 2000, Kocide 3000, Cuprofix Disperss, Champ DP) and dithianon, boscalid/pyraclostrobin and <b>boscalid</b> were tested on poison plates for inhibition of spore germination and mycelial growth of, and sp., the most common pathogens causing postharvest rots of avocados in New Zealand. Those fungicides with lowest EC 50 values (effective concentration at which 50 % spore germination was inhibited) were dithianon, boscalid/pyraclostrobin and all copper formulations, in order of effectiveness. The fungicide with the lowest EC 50 value for mycelial inhibition was boscalid/pyraclostrobin.

40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and selective method of pyraclostrobin, <b>boscalid,</b> tebufenpyrad and prohexadione-calcium determination under their combined presence in water sample, using {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} was developed. On the base of mentioned active ingredients (combined fungicide Bellis, insecto-acaricide Masai and plant growth regulator Regalis) pesticides {{may be used in}} one vegetation season for fruit trees protection. Method of co-determination of these substances is based on the preparation of water samples for extraction, extraction of pyraclostrobin, <b>boscalid,</b> tebufenpyrad and prohexadione-calcium, concentrating of extract of substances mixtures and chromatographic determination with ultraviolet detection. A distinctive feature of this method is changing of ratio of components of mobile phase (mixture of acetonitrile and 0, 1 % aqueous solution of phosphoric acid) in the process of chromatographic analysis, which allowed to clearly visualize test substances in case of their joint presence in one sample.

40|$|Sclerotinia {{stem and}} crown rot of alfalfa {{can be a}} {{significant}} disease in California’s Central Valley in wet and/or foggy winters. Previous studies have failed to demonstrate significant control with cultural and weed control measures. Planting in September has numerous advantages in terms of stand establishment, seedling survival, and subsequent yields compared to the more traditional planting times of November through February. However, in years conducive to Sclerotinia crown and stem rot, growers feel the advantages of early seeding are negated by stand loss due to this disease. No fungicides are currently registered for controlling this disease in California. Because moisture and humidity favor disease, one management strategy has been to minimize canopy by burning back plant and weed growth with paraquat (Gramoxone Max). Two trials {{in the winter of}} 2004 / 2005 evaluated unregistered fungicides in addition to cultural and weed control measures. The fungicides Pristine (<b>boscalid</b> + pyraclostrobin) and Endura (<b>boscalid)</b> reduced disease ratings and increased yields in the first cutting compared to untreated controls, early mowing, and paraquat application...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{control of}} gray mold of {{strawberry}} caused by Botrytis cinerea Pers. {{is essential to}} prevent pre- and postharvest fruit decay; however, resistance to multiple chemical classes of fungicides including APs (cyprodinil), DCs (iprodione), MBCs (thiophanate-methyl), PPs (fludioxonil), QoIs (pyraclostrobin), SBIs (fenhexamid), or SDHIs (<b>boscalid)</b> is a well-known and well-described phenomenon in B. cinerea from strawberry fields in Florida, Germany, North Carolina, and South Carolina. As part of a resistance-monitoring program conducted during 2012 and 2013, a total of 1, 890 B. cinerea isolates where collected from 10 states in the eastern USA. The isolates were analyzed for fungicide resistance using a mycelial growth assay. The overall resistance frequencies in 2012 for thiophanate-methyl, pyraclostrobin, <b>boscalid,</b> cyprodinil, fenhexamid, iprodione, and fludioxonil were 76, 42, 29, 27, 25, 3, and 1 %, respectively. Frequencies in 2013 were 85, 59, 5, 17, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. Isolates were resistant to either one (23 %), two (18 %), three (19 %), four (14 %), five (3 %) or six (0. 1 %) chemical classes of fungicides in 2012. In 2013 this distribution was 24 %, 29 %, 26 %, 8 %, 2 %, 0. 3 %, respectively, and also 0. 3 % (6 isolates) were resistant to all classes of fungicides. Resistance to thiophanate-methyl, iprodione, <b>boscalid,</b> pyraclostrobin and fenhexamid was based on target gene mutations in β-tubulin, bos 1, sdhB, cytb, and erg 27, respectively. Isolates were MDR 1 or MDR 1 h dependent on sensitivity to fludioxonil and variations in transcription factor mrr 1. Expression of ABC transporter atrB was highest in MDR 1 h isolates. The discovery of B. cinerea isolates resistant to all registered site-specific fungicides for gray mold control represents an unprecedented milestone of resistance development in B. cinerea that signals a failure of current anti-resistance management strategies.

This study investigated the efficacy of cold plasma treatment for the degradation of pesticides (<b>boscalid</b> and Imidacloprid) on blueberries in tandem with the need to retain critical quality attributes of a fresh high value berry product post treatment. An in-package high voltage dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor was employed for this study. The degradation efficacy of pesticides after 80 kV and 5 min of cold plasma treatment were found to be 80. 18 % for <b>boscalid</b> and 75. 62 % for Imidacloprid. Total phenol and flavonoid contents of blueberries increased significantly for 1 min treated samples for all applied voltages. However, plasma treatment significantly decreased the ascorbic acid at longer plasma doses. There was no significant effect on physical parameters such as color while acceptable changes were observed in blueberry firmness. This study demonstrates effective chemical decontamination of blueberries whilst maintaining critical nutritional and physical quality parameters, offering an alternative process for quality retention of processing sensitive high value berry products...|$|E
40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a phytopathogenic ascomycete {{responsible}} for grey mould on many crops. Respiration inhibitors play an increasing {{role in the}} control of this disease. Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs, including carboxamides) inhibit the fungal respiration by blocking the ubiquinonebinding site of the mitochondrial complex II. Old SDHIs (i. e. carboxin), essentially active against Basidiomycetes were replaced in the 2000 s by {{a new generation of}} SDHIs with a broader spectrum including Ascomycetes. <b>Boscalid</b> is the only representative of this new generation in France up to now. A few years after its market introduction, field mutants of B. cinerea, resistant to <b>boscalid</b> were isolated in France and Germany. At least six different phenotypes, named CarR 1 to CarR 6, have been pinpointed by characterizing their resistance pattern towards 20 SDHIs. CarR 1 to R 4 phenotypes exhibit low to medium level of resistance, whereas CarR 5 and R 6 show high level of resistance to different SDHIs, including <b>boscalid.</b> CarR 1 and CarR 2 strains are currently the most frequent strains detected in German and French vineyards. The resistance mechanism was investigated for the different phenotypes by searching for putative alterations in the SDH proteins, which could be {{responsible for}} the observed resistance. Our findings show point mutations in the sdhB gene lead to a specific amino acid change in SdhB for each phenotype. Isogenic mutants have been generated through a gene replacement strategy to confirm the role of these mutations in the various SDHI resistance phenotypes. We have shown that each mutation of the sdhB gene confers resistance to at least one SDHI. Isogenic mutants show similar resistance factors compared to field mutants carrying the same mutation. SDH enzyme activity and inhibition by different SDHIs were measured in these mutants. Our results provide evidence for differential SDH inhibition profiles according to the tested mutations, correlating with the mutants’ resistance pattern. SDH enzyme affinity to different SDHIs will be measured in these mutants...|$|E
40|$|A novel, {{high-resolution}} melting (HRM) {{analysis was}} developed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with resistance to fenhexamid (hydroxyanilides) and <b>boscalid</b> (succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors) in Botrytis cinerea isolates. Thirty-six single-spore isolates arising from 13 phenotypes were selected and tested for fungicide sensitivity. Germ tube elongation assays showed two distinct sensitivity levels for each fungicide. Sequencing revealed that resistance to fenhexamid was due to a nucleotide change in the erg 27 gene, resulting in an amino acid replacement of phenylalanine (F) with serine (S) or valine (V) at position 412 of the protein, whereas in isolates resistant to <b>boscalid,</b> a nucleotide change in the sdhB gene resulted in the replacement of histidine (H) with arginine (R) or tyrosine (Y) at position 272 of the respective protein. In each case, melting curve analysis generated three distinct profiles corresponding {{to the presence of}} each nucleotide in the targeted areas. HRM analysis successfully detected and differentiated the substitutions associated with resistance to both fungicides. In vitro bioassays, direct sequencing and high-resolution melting analysis showed a 100 % correlation with detection of resistance. The results demonstrate the utility of HRM analysis as a potential molecular tool for routine detection of fungicide resistance using known polymorphic genes of B. cinerea populations...|$|E
