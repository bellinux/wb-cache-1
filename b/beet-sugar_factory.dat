50|$|California {{became a}} U.S. state in 1850 and, in the 1860s, {{most of the}} Colonia's lands were sold off to {{businessmen}} from the East Coast who were primarily interested in prospecting for oil. In 1873, Ventura County was formed from the southeastern section of Santa Barbara County. Hueneme was founded in 1874 by Thomas R. Bard. The Colonia Oil Company sold a lot of land to the newly formed Colonia Land Improvement Company, in 1897, for a townsite around a factory being built, two miles northeast of Hueneme, to produce sugar from sugar beets. In 1898, Oxnard was founded around what was originally named the Colonia <b>Beet-Sugar</b> <b>Factory</b> and began to grow.|$|E

By 1895 the area was 3300 acre, in 1899 there were 5000 acre in cultivation, and by 1900 some 7500 acre. The productivity also increased, from 5.3 tons of sugar beets per acre in 1891 to 6.7 tons in 1893, and to 9.7 tons in 1895. Sugar content, measured {{as a percentage of}} the beet weight, increased from 11.0 in 1891 to 13.9 in 1897. During the Panic of 1896, the Lehi factory was responsible for $200,000 in payments to farmers, as well as $85,000 in wages. A U.S. Department of Agriculture report said [...] "there is no one in Lehi desiring employment during the growing season", and an 1898 report to the U.S. President from the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture said that the [...] "sugar-beet lands of Utah were very much enhanced in value... the location of a <b>beet-sugar</b> <b>factory</b> in a district causes a healthy rise in rents and values of lands." [...] Nearly 30 businesses were founded in Lehi between 1890 and 1896, which was significant due to the national economic depression that disproportionately affected Utah.|$|E

5000|$|According to archival sources, a Jewish {{community}} {{appeared in}} Rzhyschiv {{at the end}} of the 18th century. From 1802 onwards, the town was the centre of a Hasidic dynasty. According to the census of 1847, Rzhyschiv’s Jewish community numbered 1,543 people. By 1852 there was a synagogue in Rzhyshchiv. The Jewish area of the town was located behind the market. In his description of Kiev Guberniya, historian L. Pokhilevich writes: “At the beginning of the 20th century, Rzhyschiv occupied a prominent place among the trade centres of Kiev Guberniya, trading particularly in grain sent along the Dnieper River to Lithuania.” In 1858, a large <b>beet-sugar</b> <b>factory</b> owned by Berdichev banker Halperin was built in Rzhyschiv. According to the census of 1897, Rzhyshchev’s population numbered 11,629 inhabitants, of which 6,008 were Jewish. In 1910, there is evidence of a Jewish school in the town. Rzhyschiv’s Jewish community was not only large but also rich, as confirmed by the list of Kiev Oblast’s Jewish merchants and manufacturers compiled by Kiev City Duma in 1907. It features 150 surnames belonging to inhabitants of Rzhyschiv, 47 of which owned real estate to the value of 1,000 roubles and more, including the Lishchinsky family (brothers Herman Yoskovich and Mendel Yoskovich, Mendel Gershko’s son) that owned real estate amounting to 8,200 roubles; Podraysky Vigdor Nisonov (real estate valued at 5,000 roubles); the Polissky manufacturing family (Gersh Aron Avrum Polissky’s real estate was valued at 4,200 roubles); Skidelsky El Duvid Yankelev (4,000 roubles); and manufacturer Movsha Leybovich Gohbarg (2,700 roubles).|$|E
40|$|In this {{experimental}} study {{the characterization of}} 2 industrial wastewaters, coming from an ice cream production industry (IW 1) and a <b>beet-sugar</b> <b>factory</b> (IW 2), {{with respect to their}} readily biodegradable fraction and denitrification potential, has been performed. To this end physical-chemical and biological characterization methods, both anoxic and aerobic, were used. Moreover a pilot scale SBR fed with municipal wastewater was started to verify the effect of the gradual addition of the concentrated organic wastewaters during the anoxic phase. The SBR was initially fed only with a primary municipal wastewater, then the organic load was increased by adding to the feed, during the anoxic phase, a small amount of the IW 1 (second period). Once the initial conditions were restored the load was again raised using the second industrial wastewater (IW 2) (third period). With those additions the nitrogen removal efficiency increased from 26...|$|E
40|$|<b>Beet-sugar</b> <b>factory</b> - is a large, well-equipped {{with modern}} technology, {{the company that}} {{operates}} in a continuous circuit. In the technological structure of a sugar factory there are three production divisions: beet processing department, juice purification house and grocery department. In the grocery department of a sugar factory dangerous and harmful factors may encounter while using equipment such as vacuum devices, centrifuges, and crystallizer tank, massecuite distributor, driers and classifiers sugar. The working area of the service of machinery may appear dangerous or harmful factors, which are divided into the following groups: physical, chemical, biological and physiological. To maintain microclimate parameters can be applied general ventilation, in which {{the replacement of the}} warm air to the cold going around the room volume. Heating in the grocery department in the production season is not carried out, since it is sufficient to heat generated by the equipment. In the grocery department uses natural and artificial lighting. In the sugar factory used the following measures to protect against vibration: perform detailed assembly, eliminate defects and looseness of individual parts; way to isolate the transmission of vibrations from the machine to the foundation apply vibration isolators. Widespread use of electrical installations in a sugar factory creates the risk of electric shock to persons. Causes of electrical shocks are often disadvantages of construction and installation of the equipment, its operation is wrong. During drying and transportation of sugar produced by static electricity. To remove the static electricity equipment grounded; also used the increase in humidity; air ionization. To reduce the consumption of fresh industrial water from reservoirs provides for the establishment of the system of working circuits cleaning and maximum reuse of industrial water. Thus, safety and environmental compliance in the grocery department of the sugar beet plant depends on many factors, and needs careful monitoring of these processes...|$|E

Some time later, he was elected president of the same party. During the holding of congresses of the workers working in rural and urban areas, the prince served as a delegate of the zemstvos of the governorate of Poltava.
