40|$|During {{economic}} transition, firms must dramatically {{reduce their}} financial {{dependence on the}} state and begin to borrow from nonstate capital sources. This paper draws on institutional and resource dependence theories to examine this fundamental transformation of firm capital structure during China’s transition. I propose that managers borrowed from external sources even when internal funds were available because retained earnings were considered state assets. Firms used retained earnings to signal financial health but borrowed externally to reduce dependence on the state. Uncertainty during transformation produced interfirm imitation of <b>borrowing</b> <b>strategies,</b> particularly imitation of local and high status others. I argue that the dynamics of market development shaped firm <b>borrowing</b> <b>strategies</b> and that these strategies are best viewed as trajectories over time.

The proposed scheme is simulated in order to investigate its efficiency within a specific area of a large city in Saudi Arabia.

In a F/TDMA-based model, road traffic prediction models {{are used to}} characterise the movement of hot spots, such as traffic jams, and subsequently to predict the teletraffic load offered to the wireless network. A dynamic upper bound on the capacity required to achieve a specified Quality of Service level in the cells is computed. Restricting borrowing to neighbouring cells to avoid excessive re-allocation of capacity, optimal capacity borrowing strategies based on traffic movement and traffic density are given. These strategies can be characterised by a straightforward rule of thumb: borrow capacity from the cell on the steeper side of the traffic peak, that makes our strategy easily implementable. Results of a dynamic simulation under realistic load indicate a significant reduction of call blocking probabilities under our optimal capacity <b>borrowing</b> <b>strategy.</b> A possible extension to CDMA-based systems is briefly indicated...|$|E

A series of characterizations were performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis, SERS, and electrochemical techniques. The results confirmed the core-shell structure and the uniform and pinhole-free nature of the Pd shell, ensuring the properties of Pd without possible interference from Au. Consistent with theoretical prediction, the core-shell setting borrows high SERS activity from the Au core through the long-range electromagnetic enhancement {{in addition to the}} enhancement from the Pd shell itself. Moreover, their SERS activity can be optimized by the tunable shell thickness and core size.

The objective of our agent-based modeling is to explore 'optimal ' marketing strategies on given specific markets. Competing companies will thrive by choosing their customers, narrowing their focus, and dominating their markets. We will uncover which type of companies provide good value propositions for customers from their activities.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of the {{deterioration}} of the Turkish public sector balances {{in the latter half of}} the 1980 's and the evolution of the economic crisis with the aid of a computable general equilibrium model. The theoretical basis of the model utilized in the paper rests upon the Walrasian and the Structuralist/Keynesian macro foundations. The model recognizes 15 production sectors, 3 socio-economic income groups and a central government; and simulates the production, income distribution, consumption, capital accumulation and foreign trade processes of the national economy within a simultaneous system of algebraic equations. The distinguishing feature of the model is that, it accommodates monopolistic mark-up pricing rules in the industrial sectors, and endogenously solves for capacity utilization and unemployment level through Keynesian mechanisms of effective final demand. The model investigates the evolution of the crisis under three main headings: (i) {{the role of}} the financial crisis and the unprecedented deficit in the public sector balances; (ii) the roles of the foreign <b>borrowing</b> <b>strategy</b> of the state and the short term foreign capital inflows on balance of payments and the foreign exchange rate; and (iii) {{the role of the}} political-economic relations of income distribution and inflationary processes emanating from real wage increases and non-competitive pricing behavior in the industrial sectors. The general equilibrium results of the model underscore the importance of intra-class relations of income distribution and conflict in the evolution of price movements in the Turkish economy; and suggest that the sources of the crisis lie in the historical role of the administrative interventions of the state towards protection of the capitalist and rural incomes, which would otherwise be squeezed out in favor of wage-labor in the late- 1980 's.
