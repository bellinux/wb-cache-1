40|$|An active {{noise control}} {{subassembly}} for reducing noise caused by a source (such as an aircraft engine) independent of the subassembly. A noise radiating panel is <b>bendably</b> vibratable to generate a panel noise canceling at least {{a portion of the}} source noise. A piezoceramic actuator plate is connected to the panel. A front plate is spaced apart from the panel and the first plate, is positioned generally between the source noise and the panel, and has a sound exit port. A first pair of spaced-apart side walls each generally abut the panel and the front plate so as to generally enclose a front cavity to define a resonator...|$|E
