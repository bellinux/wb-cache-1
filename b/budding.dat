5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the <b>budding</b> of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} <b>budding,</b> intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular <b>budding,</b> a new polyp {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E

The diversion of sugars away from axillary <b>buds</b> decreases <b>bud</b> release even where hormones are at levels generally considered conducive to <b>bud</b> release. This impact of sugars on <b>bud</b> outgrowth may be mediated by specific sugar and hormonal signalling pathways...|$|R
40|$|Unilateral {{interruption}} of the chorda-lingual nerve {{led to a}} loss of most epithelial axons and to the deterioration of fungiform taste <b>buds</b> in the anterior portion of the tongue of albino rats, mongolian gerbils, and golden hamsters. By three weeks after surgery the following percentages of fungiform taste <b>buds</b> had completely disappeared: 71 % in gerbils, 28 % in rats, and 26 % in hamsters. Residual taste <b>buds</b> were classified into two groups: atrophic taste <b>buds</b> and taste <b>bud</b> remnants. Atrophic taste <b>buds</b> were smaller than normal and typically had no visible taste pore, although they retained the characteristic oval shape of a taste <b>bud</b> and numerous elongated cells. Taste <b>bud</b> remnants were non-oval fragments of taste <b>buds</b> with few elongated cells. Specific markers for elongated taste cells (monoclonal antibodies to keratin 19) confirmed that atrophic taste <b>buds,</b> as well as some taste <b>bud</b> remnants, had elongated taste cells. By 180 days after chorda-lingual nerve transection, 44 % of rat fungiform taste <b>buds</b> had disappeared; morphometric analysis of the 311 residual taste <b>buds</b> established that 241 atrophic taste <b>buds</b> and 69 taste <b>bud</b> remnants were, respectively, 50 % and 75 % smaller than the average volume of 480 normal taste <b>buds.</b> The aggregate loss of gustatory tissue, calculated from the shrinkage of residual taste <b>buds</b> and the volume lost by the outright disappearance of many taste <b>buds,</b> was 88 % for gerbils, 72 % for rats, and 65 % for hamsters. Evaluation in gerbils of the co-occurrence of taste <b>buds</b> and axons suggests residual taste <b>buds</b> were neurotrophically supported. Every gerbil fungiform papilla that lacked axons lacked a taste <b>bud.</b> Every fungiform papillae that had a residual taste <b>bud</b> had axons; axons were absent from 22 % of empty fungiform papillae. Diminished numbers of gustatory neurotrophic axons could account for both the loss of fungiform taste <b>buds</b> and the reduced volume of residual taste <b>buds.</b> © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

50|$|In {{many plants}} scales do not form over the <b>bud,</b> and the <b>bud</b> is then called a naked <b>bud.</b> The minute {{underdeveloped}} leaves in such <b>buds</b> are often excessively hairy.

5|$|Unlike in {{multicellular}} organisms, {{increases in}} cell size (cell growth) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in unicellular organisms. Bacteria grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission, {{a form of}} asexual reproduction. Under optimal conditions, bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly, and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9.8minutes. In cell division, two identical clone daughter cells are produced. Some bacteria, while still reproducing asexually, form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells. Examples include fruiting body formation by Myxobacteria and aerial hyphae formation by Streptomyces, or <b>budding.</b> <b>Budding</b> involves a cell forming a protrusion that breaks away and produces a daughter cell.|$|E

40|$|Several hundred taste <b>buds</b> {{develop and}} mature in the trench {{walls of the}} rat's vallate papilla during the first 3 months after birth. The {{objective}} of this investigation of taste <b>bud</b> development was to determine: (i) whether the vallate papilla has local growth zones where new taste <b>buds</b> form, (ii) whether new taste <b>buds</b> arise by the division of mature taste <b>buds,</b> (iii) how many days are required for a new taste <b>bud</b> to mature, and (iv) whether a taste pore forms as the taste <b>bud</b> reaches a critical volume. Camera lucida drawings were made of more than 4000 iron hematoxylin-stained, serially sectioned, vallate taste <b>buds.</b> The relative abundance of immature taste <b>buds</b> declined exponentially with age, from 18 % of the mature taste <b>buds</b> at day 15 to 2 % at day 90. At days 21, 33 and 45 most of the immature taste <b>buds</b> (those lacking a taste pore) were located in growth zones at the anterior and posterior extremes of the vaUate trench. A mean of 10. 5 days was required for the maturation of each cohort of immature taste <b>buds</b> present at days 15, 21, 33 and 45.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{axillary}} <b>bud</b> age {{on the development}} and potential for growth of the <b>bud</b> into a shoot was studied in roses. Age of the <b>buds</b> occupying a similar position on the plant varied from 'subtending leaf just unfolded' up to 1 year later. With increasing age of the axillary <b>bud</b> its dry mass, dry-matter percentage and number of leaves, including leaf primordia, increased. The apical meristem of the axillary <b>bud</b> remained vegetative as long as subjected to apical dominance, even for 1 year. The potential for growth of <b>buds</b> was studied either by pruning the parent shoot above the <b>bud,</b> by grafting the <b>bud</b> or by culturing the <b>bud</b> in vitro. When the correlative inhibition (i. e. domination of the apical region over the axillary <b>buds)</b> was released, additional leaves and eventually a flower formed. The number of additional leaves decreased with increasing <b>bud</b> age and became more or less constant for axillary <b>buds</b> of shoots beyond the harvestable stage, while {{the total number of}} leaves preceding the flower increased. An increase in <b>bud</b> age was reflected in a greater number of scales, including transitional leaves, and in a greater number of non-elongated internodes of the subsequent shoot. Time until <b>bud</b> break slightly decreased with increasing <b>bud</b> age; it was long, relatively, for 1 year old <b>buds,</b> when they sprouted attached to the parent shoot. Shoot length, mass and leaf area were not clearly affected by the age of the <b>bud</b> that developed into the shoot. With increasing <b>bud</b> age the number of pith cells in the subsequent shoot increased, indicating a greater potential diameter of the shoot. However, final diameter was dependent on the assimilate supply after <b>bud</b> break. Axillary <b>buds</b> obviously need a certain developmental stage to be able to break. When released from correlative inhibition at an earlier stage, increased leaf initiation occurs before <b>bud</b> break<br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} at which flower <b>buds</b> are injured depends mainly on their stage of development. <b>Buds</b> are most hardy when fully DORMANT.

Temperatures before freezes affect flower <b>bud</b> hardiness. <b>Buds</b> are hardier if exposed to cold temperatures for 2 to 3 days before a freeze.

40|$|For three Asiatic hybrid lily cultivars (‘Bright Beauty’, ‘Fashion’, ‘Orlito’) the {{potential}} postharvest performance of floral <b>buds</b> {{in terms of}} growth, anthesis and longevity was studied in relation to tepal carbohydrate status.

Detachment of <b>buds</b> increased failure of opening in small <b>buds,</b> whereas in the largest <b>buds</b> tepal size at anthesis and longevity were improved. In lily inflorescences, postharvest translocation of substrate from the basal to the upper <b>buds</b> takes place. Five <b>bud</b> classes have been characterised, comparing the postharvest performance of attached and detached <b>buds.</b> Classes were based on differences in tepal growth rate, absolute growth and {{the potential}} to reach anthesis.
