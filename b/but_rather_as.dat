5|$|Initially, {{loitering}} munitions {{were not}} {{referred to as}} such <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> suicide UAVs or loitering missiles. Different sources point at different projects as originating the weapon category. The early 1980s initial Israeli Delilah variants or the failed US AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow program are mentioned by some sources. Alternatively, the late 1980s IAI Harpy which was widely exported is considered by some as the first loitering munition system.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as these keeps were being built by the {{extremely}} wealthy, much smaller, keep-like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as keeps <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> a form of fortified house.|$|E

5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they can communicate with these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E
5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> a result of its own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven.|$|E

5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{were further}} damaged by a schism between the Catholic West and Orthodox East {{that led to}} the Byzantine Greeks being labeled as heretics in the West. Throughout the later centuries of the Byzantine Empire and {{particularly}} following the coronation of Charlemagne (reigned as king of the Franks 768–814) in Rome in 800, the Byzantines were not considered by Western Europeans as heirs of the Roman Empire, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> part of an Eastern kingdom made up of Greek peoples.|$|E

A total of 258 athletes from 16 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 16 events across 9 disciplines. Women also took part in these Games, {{although}} the only events {{they were allowed to}} compete in were the figure skating ladies' singles and pairs. When the Games were held, they were not recognized as the Winter Olympics <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> a winter sports week festival. It was not until 1926 that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially recognized them as the first Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Then {{there is}} the {{deliberate}} citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors. For instance, at a minimum, five of the History's sixteen citations of Dexippus {{are considered to be}} fake, and Dexippus appears to be mentioned, not as a principal source of information, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> a contradictory author to be contrasted against information sourced from Herodian or the Enmannsche Kaisergeschichte. In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad had a {{distinctive}} Syrian iconography, which is {{clear in the}} seals of the kings that gave prominence to the Syrian gods. Egyptian influence was minimal and limited to the ankh, which cannot be interpreted as an emulation of Egyptian rituals <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> merely {{a substitute for the}} cup held by the deity elsewhere. Yamhad had a special pattern of trim called the Yamhad style, which was favored in Mari during the reign of king Zimri-Lim, whose queen Shibtu was the daughter of Yarim-Lim I.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the story}} of Duke Karl Alexander and Joseph Süß Oppenheimer {{constituted}} a relatively obscure episode in German history, it {{became the subject of}} a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of more than a century; the earliest of these having been Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger's novel titled Jud Süß (1925) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew. As a Jew, Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed, pride, and ambition. With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora, Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism. He was particularly {{struck by the fact that}} Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so, opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety.|$|E

5|$|Columbus is a {{historic}} statue in Providence, Rhode Island, United States on Elmwood Avenue in Columbus Square. Columbus is a bronze cast of a sterling silver statue which was created by Rhode Island's Gorham Manufacturing Company for the 1892 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The original silver statue was not meant for permanent exhibition, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> {{a demonstration of the}} skills of the Gorham Company, and was later melted down. The bronze cast was dedicated November 8, 1893 as a gift from the Elmwood Association to the City of Providence. It stands upon a granite base {{at the center of a}} grassy triangle at the intersection of Reservoir Avenue and Elmwood Avenue. The statue features Christopher Columbus, was created in 1893 by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Husayn, however, who {{had been}} {{entrusted}} with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al-Shari, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense. This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. In the words of the Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the middle}} of the 13th century, the area of Vidin had been {{autonomous}} under ineffective Bulgarian overlordship, and was ruled successively by Yakov Svetoslav (died 1276), Shishman (died between 1308 and 1313), and then Michael Shishman. Shishman and his son received the high courtly title of despotēs from their cousin Theodore Svetoslav and the latter was referred to in a contemporary Venetian source as a Despot of Bulgaria and Lord of Vidin. With the death of the Serbian king Stefan Milutin, Michael Shishman was able to follow a more active policy in the Bulgarian capital Tarnovo. He soon became a leading noble {{in the internal affairs of}} the country and, on the childless death of young George Terter II in 1323, Michael Shishman was elected emperor of Bulgaria by the nobility. According to some historians he was chosen because he was a descendant of the Asen dynasty and interpret his ascenсion to the throne not as the beginning of a new dynasty <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>as</b> a continuation of the House of Asen. His half-brother, Belaur, succeeded him as despot of Vidin.|$|E
