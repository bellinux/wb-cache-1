30|$|In second scenario, in real scenario, five nodes are jammed {{out of six}} nodes.

(That is, the number of correctly detected jammed nodes/the number of correctly detected jammed nodes + the number of nodes that are detected as not jammed <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> actually jammed). In this scenario, the FDR is computed as 0.4 (that is, 2 /(2 + 3)= 0.2).
