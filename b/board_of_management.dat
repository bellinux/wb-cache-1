40|$|Commercial {{models have}} been applied to most aspects <b>of</b> Not-for-profit <b>management</b> and operation. There are very good reasons why this might be {{advantageous}} to the Not-for-profit sector generally and to funders and <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> particularly. Such reasons include {{the fact that the}} commercial sector has developed far more mature governance models than the Not-for-profit sector, that advisors to the sector are far more adept at providing solutions based around these commercial models and that <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> {{are more likely to be}} able to quantify their achievements using such measures. However, the use of such models can cause a divergence to develop between the purpose or mission of individual organisations and the methods used to assess the extent to which these organisations have been successful in their operations. Mission centricity is acknowledged by most organisations as being the driving force behind activities and efforts undertaken during a reporting period. Annual reports, web sites and other marketing collateral routinely refer to the mission of the organisation and seek to reinforce to wide readerships that the organisation exists primarily for a social purpose. However, <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> do not always make decisions or develop plans based on a mission centric perspective. This paper will introduce mission centricity and discuss models and experiences that will serve as tools for <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> and executives in their work. Placing commercial governance models in the context of mission, the paper will discuss ways in which traditional models of corporate governance can be enhanced by mission centric methodologies and how <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management,</b> executives and advisors can reshape their thinking in this critical area <b>of</b> <b>management</b> to the benefit of the community at large...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores women’s {{contribution}} to governance through {{a study of}} two housing associations in Wales. Whilst housing policy has developed to enhance the role of housing associations, governance and accountability, women are still underrepresented in senior and executive management roles, and are underrepresented at the strategic decision making structures, <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> The aims <b>of</b> the research were to: uncover the organisational typology and culture; the governance structures and prevailing <b>board</b> cultures <b>of</b> the housing associations; explore the motivations <b>of</b> <b>board</b> members’ participation and uncover the power relationships on the <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> in relation to female participation and empowerment. The research used an in-depth case study format with interviews with key informants from the housing sector and Welsh Government; exploratory interviews with the executive teams and board members; discourse analysis of corporate documentation and direct observation <b>of</b> <b>board</b> meetings. The research process developed a unique theoretical framework which was wide ranging, to explore the research aims of governance; organisational typology and culture; empowerment; participation and power dynamics. The research found that whilst housing associations are not inherently sexist, the governance structures, typologies, organisational cultures, routes to participation and power dynamics operated at board level inhibit female participation on <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> Housing associations failed to consider the lack of gender and wider diversity on their <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> Housing associations have failed to address the situations where dominant members on <b>boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> hold onto their power, and influence {{the majority of the}} decisions made, to the possible detriment of the tenants. Governance and recruitment arrangements are based on a need to preserve the strategic and policy focus on finance, risk, legal and governance issues, and as it is mainly men who are involved in these professions, it is ultimately their views which direct the organisations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose <b>of</b> the research: <b>Board</b> members <b>of</b> an aged care {{organisation}} {{were concerned}} with establishing a process whereby the Board could gauge its own performance {{in relation to the}} governance of the organisation. The paper outlines the process adopted by the Board and provides a summary of the outcomes of the process. Methodology: Action research (first cycle) involving the development of a self administered questionnaire. Findings: While adopting sound governance principles, <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Management</b> in the Aged Care sector need not converge towards or diverge from private sector corporate governance standards and can design an evaluation process that maintains their cultural identity and yet conforms to sound governance principles. Implications for theory: There remain fundamental differences between for-profit and non-profit organisations requiring them to take a stakeholder as opposed to shareholder approach to key issues of governance. Implications for practice: Not for profit <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Management</b> in the Aged Care sector are able, with facilitation, to achieve continual improvement in the governance <b>of</b> the <b>Board</b> by the development of rigorous criteria established by the Board itself as to what the Board considers to constitute responsible governance. Value of the paper: The paper is of significance to academics researching corporate governance in the not for profit sector, to members <b>of</b> <b>Boards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Management</b> and to consultants that practice in the area <b>of</b> governance for <b>Boards...</b>|$|R
