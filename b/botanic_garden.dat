5|$|The first {{botanical garden}} in the United States, Bartram's Garden, was founded in 1730 near Philadelphia, {{and in the same}} year, the Linnaean <b>Botanic</b> <b>Garden</b> at Philadelphia itself. President George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, all {{experienced}} farmers, shared the dream of a national <b>botanic</b> <b>garden</b> for the collection, preservation and study of plants {{from around the world to}} contribute to the welfare of the American people paving the way for establishing the US <b>Botanic</b> <b>Garden,</b> right outside the nation's Capitol in Washington DC in 1820. In 1859, the Missouri Botanical Garden was founded at St Louis; it is now one of the world’s leading gardens specializing in tropical plants. This was one of several popular American gardens, including Longwood Gardens (1798), Arnold Arboretum (1872), New York Botanical Garden (1891), Huntington Botanical Gardens (1906), Brooklyn <b>Botanic</b> <b>Garden</b> (1910), International Peace Garden (1932), and Fairchild Tropical <b>Botanic</b> <b>Garden</b> (1938).|$|E

He became secretary of the school Natural History Society, won an essay prize from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and spent much of his time at the <b>Botanic</b> <b>Garden.</b> Stearn also gained horticultural experience by working as a gardener's boy during his school holidays, to supplement the family income.|$|E

5|$|A {{botanical garden}} or <b>botanic</b> <b>garden</b> is a garden {{dedicated}} to the collection, cultivation and display {{of a wide range}} of plants labelled with their botanical names.

Visitor services at a botanical garden might include tours, educational displays, art exhibitions, book rooms, open-air theatrical and musical performances, and other entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Both Gray and Torrey {{were elected}} to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in December 1841. Gray never {{returned}} to teach a course at Michigan. In 1833 Dr.Joshua Fisher, a resident of Beverly, Massachusetts, and a Harvard University alumnus, bequeathed $20,000 to Harvard to endow a chair in natural history. The university allowed the proceeds to accumulate until it could fund a full year's salary for a professor. Because of this and a few problems in finding a suitable professor, this chair was not filled until it was formally offered to Gray on March26, 1842. The offer was $1,000/year salary, teaching duties limited to only botany, and being superintendent of Harvard's <b>botanic</b> <b>garden.</b> While the salary was low, the teaching limitation, rare for the time, allowed him {{plenty of time to}} do research and work in the <b>botanic</b> <b>garden.</b> After an exchange of letters, Gray accepted this appointment as Fisher Professor of Natural History at Harvard. The formal appointment was made April30, 1842. Gray arrived at Harvard on July22, 1842, and began his duties in September. He did not have to teach in the fall of 1842, but began in spring 1843, the first classes he had taught in nine years. Early in his years at Harvard, Gray had to borrow money from his father. Soon he was able to repay his father and help his family because he supplemented his income by giving lectures outside of Harvard, including at the Lowell Institute. Gray was considered a weak lecturer, but because of his expert knowledge, he was highly regarded by his peers. His skills were better suited to teaching advanced rather than introductory classes. He also gained renown for his textbooks and high quality illustrations. Gray moved into {{what became known as the}} Asa Gray House in the <b>Botanic</b> <b>Garden</b> in the summer of 1844. It had been built in 1810 for William Dandridge Peck and later occupied by Thomas Nuttall. As the demands of teaching, collecting, selling specimens, taking care of the herbarium, and writing books increased and he himself was not a good illustrator, Gray found it necessary to hire a botanical illustratorIsaac Sprague, who illustrated much of Gray's works for decades to come.|$|E

5|$|While {{working at}} the {{bookshop}} he made many friends amongst the Cambridge botanists and participated in their activities, including botanical excursions. In addition to Professor Seward, those influencing him included the morphologist Agnes Arber, Humphrey Gilbert-Carter the first scientific director of the <b>Botanic</b> <b>Garden,</b> John Gilmour then curator of the university herbarium and later director of the Garden (1951–1973), the horticulturalist E. A. Bowles (1865–1954), who became his patron, Harry Godwin, then a research fellow and later professor and Tom Tutin who was working with Seward at that time. Seward gave him full research facilities in the herbarium. He continued his research, visiting the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in 1930, {{at the age of}} 19, and also spent two weeks at the herbarium of the Musée National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, {{with the aid of a}} £15 grant from the Royal Society to study Epimedium. Also in 1930, the Fifth International Botanical Congress was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend this.

5|$|A fast-growing and {{attractive}} plant, Banksia speciosa grows readily {{in a sunny}} location in dry climates on well-drained soil, but does poorly in areas of humid summer climate, such as Australia's east coast.

A specimen flowered in a greenhouse in the Royal <b>Botanic</b> <b>Garden</b> Edinburgh in 1830. Banksia speciosa is an important cut flower crop.
