2500|$|In June 1938, the French Admiralty's {{choice was}} {{conditioned}} by France's limited shipyard space that could accommodate very large ship construction. The [...] #4 graving dock in the Brest Navy Yards {{was intended to}} be ready for building a new battleship in January 1939, when the Richelieu would have floated out, as all other large shipyards were in use. On the new , in the Penhoët Shipbuilding Yards in Saint-Nazaire, Jean Bart was under construction and expected to be floated out in late 1939-early 1940. In the same yard, on the #1 slipway where [...] and Strasbourg had been laid down, [...] was to be built from November 1938 till 1941. Consequently, it was not reasonable to keep the Salou dock empty for six or more months, waiting to start building a Project B design that needed at least a year to prepare definitive drawings after it had been ordered. Therefore, the Project A design was chosen for the Salou <b>building</b> <b>dock.</b> The Caquot dock could then be used for the second.|$|E

The largest construction planned on the yard was two [...] tankers, but this order was later cancelled. From the 1960s until 1977, the yard only constructed oil tankers (no larger than [...] ) as well as bulk carriers. The first RO-RO ship was built in 1979, and the first container ship in 1980. In December 1992, the yard completed the world's first 300,000 DWT double-hull tanker. In January 1996 they delivered its first Post-Panamax container ship.

5000|$|In three {{separate}} acts dated 6 February 1942, 26 May 1943, and 17 December 1943, Congress provided the {{authority for the}} construction of LSTs along with a host of other auxiliaries, destroyer escorts, and assorted landing craft. The enormous building program quickly gathered momentum. Such a high priority was assigned to the construction of LSTs that the previously laid keel of an aircraft carrier was hastily removed to make room for several LSTs to be built in her place. The keel of the first LST was laid down on 10 June 1942 at Newport News, Va., and the first standardized LSTs were floated out of their <b>building</b> <b>dock</b> in October. Twenty-three were in commission by the end of 1942.|$|E

5000|$|In earlier times, {{the event}} {{recognized}} as the keel laying was the initial placement of the central timber making up the backbone of a vessel, called the keel.

Modern ships are now largely built in a series of pre-fabricated, complete hull sections rather than being built around a single keel. The event {{recognized as the}} keel laying is the first joining of modular components, or the lowering of the first module into place in the <b>building</b> <b>dock.</b> It is now often called [...] "keel authentication", and is the ceremonial beginning of the ship's life, although modules may have been started months before that stage of construction.|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of interlogs, <b>building</b> <b>docking</b> models is a time {{intensive}} task, involving generation of a large pool of docking decoys followed by refinement and screening to identify near native docking solutions. This limits the researcher interested in <b>building</b> <b>docking</b> methods with the choice of benchmarking {{only a limited number}} of protein complexes. We have created a repository called dockYard ([URL] that allows modelers interested in protein-protein interaction to access large volume of information on protein dimers and their interlogs, and also download decoys for their work if they are interested in building modeling methods. dockYard currently offers four categories of docking decoys derived from: Bound (native dimer co-crystallized), Unbound (individual subunits are crystallized, as well as the target dimer), Variants (match the previous two categories in at least one subunit with 100 % sequence identity), and Interlogs (match the previous categories in at least one subunit with >= 90 % or >= 50 % sequence identity). The web service offers options for full or selective download based on search parameters. Our portal also serves as a repository to modelers who may want to share their decoy sets with the community...|$|R
