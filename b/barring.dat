5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} (Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema) is {{a species of}} bird in the cotinga family, Cotingidae.

It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The purple-throated cotinga is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies. It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism. Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers and a white belly with some black <b>barring</b> on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black <b>barring</b> on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male has a powerful voice.|$|E
5|$|The sexes are similar, {{although}} the male averages {{slightly larger than}} the female and has two prominent spurs on the legs, whereas the female is virtually unspurred.
