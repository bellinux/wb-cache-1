50|$|Chaperone/usher fimbriae {{have many}} roles, in many stages of {{pathogenicity}} in several species. The most well understood are roles in adhesion, innate immune evasion and localisation. Adhesion is {{facilitated by the}} lectin domain {{at the tip of}} chaperone/usher fimbriae, this domain of FimH is well understood. FimH is the first subunit of the type I pilus in species such as UPEC and binds to D-mannosylated residues in the bladder, allowing pathogen adhesion and colonisation. Immune evasion is also facilitated by the tip adhesin, for example the binding of Decay accelerating factor (DAF) by gamma3 clade fimbriae inhibit effective complement activation. Localisation could be performed by sequential expression of different chaperone/usher systems. Most species of pathogenic bacteria express more than one type of chaperone/usher system, for example in Pseudomonas aeruginosa there are five different systems. UPEC expresses both the type 1 fimbriae and the P-pilus (pap) which it expresses sequentially possibly to facilitate migration from the <b>bladder</b> (<b>type</b> I fimbriae) to the kidney (pap).This importance in pathogenicity makes the chaperone/usher system an attractive target for novel drug therapies. By targeting pathogenicity instead of the organism (in the case of conventional antibiotics) the strong selective pressure for evolution of resistance is removed. In the case of UPEC there have been some success in pilicidal (stopping pilus formation) clinical trials and the development of an effective vaccine in mice and cynomolgus monkeys based on FimCH complex.|$|E
40|$|Typical air {{bearings}} {{float on}} air films {{of only a}} few thousandths of an inch and so will only operate above very smooth, even surfaces. For the mechanical simulation of space, the small drag of the <b>bladder</b> <b>type</b> air pads is much more than can be coped with, and the practicality of large floor areas being machined for precision air bearings is nonexistent. To enable operation above surfaces that undulate slightly or feature cracks and discontinuities, an ABLP has been developed. It consists of a rigid pad beneath which an inflatable bladder is mounted. The bladder is inflated with air which then escapes through passages into a cavity {{in the center of the}} bladder to produce the lifting energy. As the air escapes about the perimeter of the bladder, a certain degree of balance and equilibrium is imparted to the pad as it is able to move a limited weight across slightly uneven surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} hypercholesterolemic diet on the collagen composition of urinary bladder wall. Materials and methods: Forty-five female 4 -week-old Wistar rats were divided into three groups: 1) control group fed a normal diet (ND); 2) model of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) group fed a ND; and 3) group fed a HCD (1. 25 % cholesterol). Total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and body weight were assessed at baseline. Four weeks later, group 2 underwent a surgical procedure resulting in a partial BOO, while groups 1 and 3 underwent a sham similar surgical procedure. Six weeks later, all animals had their bladders removed; serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels and body weights were measured. Morphological and morphometric analysis was performed by Picrosirius staining and collagen types I and III were identified by immunofluorescence. Statistical analysis was completed and significance was considered when p< 0. 05. Results: Rats fed an HCD exhibited {{a significant increase in}} LDL cholesterol levels (p< 0. 001) and body weight (p= 0. 017), when compared to the groups fed a ND during the ten-week study period. Moreover, the HCD induced morphological alterations of the bladder wall collagen, regarding thin collagen fibers and the amounts of type III collagen when compared to the control group (p= 0. 002 and p= 0. 016, respectively), resembling the process promoted in the BOO model.

Seventeen patients had right hemiplegia, 18 had left hemiplegia, and five had posterior circulation stroke with brainstem/cerebellar features. <b>Bladder</b> <b>type</b> was correlated with age, side, and site of lesion. Results: The mean age was 46. 80 &#x 00 B 1; 16. 65 years (range: 18 - 80 years). Thirty-six patients had arterial stroke and four had cortical venous thrombosis. UDS was performed after a mean of 28. 32 &#x 00 B 1; 10. 27 days (range: 8 - 53 days) after the stroke. All but one patient had neurogenic bladder dysfunction, with 36 patients (90 &#x 0025;) having overactive detrusor (OD) and three having underactive/areflexic detrusor.

Therefore, in this cross-sectional study we examine which determinants of {{upper and lower}} urinary tract outcomes are associated with relevant urodynamic findings. All patients visiting our specialized outpatient clinic for adults with spinal dysraphism during a 26 -month period underwent evaluation of the lower urinary tract by (video) urodynamic study. High end filling pressure (40 cm H 2 O or greater), poor compliance (less than 10 ml/cm H 2 O) and high detrusor leak point pressure (40 cm H 2 O or greater) were classified as relevant findings and together called unsafe bladder. Multivariable analysis was performed to reveal determinants of unsafe <b>bladder</b> (<b>type</b> of spinal dysraphism, being wheelchair bound, hydrocephalus, urological symptoms and renal dilatation) and diagnostic accuracy was calculated for the significant determinants. Of the 134 patients evaluated (median age 31. 5 years) 120 underwent complete urodynamic study and were included in this study.

40|$|Background: The optimal bladder {{management}} method should preserve renal function and {{minimize the risk}} of urinary tract complications. The present study is conducted to assess the overall incidence of urinary tract infections (UTI) and other urological complications in spinal cord injury patients (SCI), and to compare the incidence of these complications with different bladder management subgroups. Materials and Methods: 545 patients (386 males and 159 females) of traumatic spinal cord injury with the mean age of 35. 4 &# 177; 16. 2 years (range, 18 - 73 years) were included in the study. The data regarding demography, <b>bladder</b> <b>type,</b> method of bladder management, and urological complications, were recorded. Bladder {{management method}}s included indwelling catheterization in 224 cases, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) in 180 cases, condom drainage in 45 cases, suprapubic cystostomy in 24 cases, reflex voiding in 32 cases, and normal voiding in 40 cases. We assessed the incidence of UTI and bacteriuria as the number of episodes per hundred person-days, and other urological complications as percentages. Results: The overall incidence of bacteriuria was 1. 70 / hundred person-days. The overall incidenceof urinary tract infection was 0. 64 / hundered person-days. The incidence of UTI per 100 person-days was 2. 68 for indwelling catheterization, 0. 34 for CIC, 0. 34 for condom drainage, 0. 56 for suprapubic cystostomy, 0. 34 for reflex voiding, and 0. 32 for normal voiding. Other urological complications recorded were urethral stricture (n= 66, 12. 1 &#x 0025;), urethritis (n= 78, 14. 3 &#x 0025;), periurethral abscess (n= 45, 8. 2 &#x 0025;), epididymorchitis (n= 44, 8. 07 &#x 0025;), urethral false passage (n= 22, 4. 03 &#x 0025;), urethral fistula (n= 11, 2 &#x 0025;), lithiasis (n= 23, 4. 2 &#x 0025;), hematuria (n= 44, 8. 07 &#x 0025;), stress incontinence (n= 60, 11 &#x 0025;), and pyelonephritis (n= 6, 1. 1 &#x 0025;). Clean intermittent catheterization was associated with lower incidence of urological complications, in comparison to indwelling catheterization. Conclusions: Urinary tract complications largely appeared to be confined to the lower urinary tract. The incidence of UTI and other urological complications is lower in patients on CIC in comparison to the patients on indwelling catheterizations. Encouraging CIC; early recognition and treatment of the UTI and urological complications; and a regular follow up is necessary to reduce the medical morbidity...|$|E

We recently developed a novel transgenic cystitis model (URO-OVA mice) that mimics certain {{key aspects of}} IC/PBS pathophysiology. This paper aimed to determine whether URO-OVA cystitis model was responsive to intravesical dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and if so identify the mechanisms of DMSO action. URO-OVA mice developed acute cystitis upon adoptive transfer of OVA-specific OT-I splenocytes. Compared to PBS-treated bladders, the bladders treated with 50 % DMSO exhibited markedly reduced bladder histopathology and expression of various inflammatory factor mRNAs. Intravesical DMSO treatment also effectively inhibited bladder inflammation in a spontaneous chronic cystitis model (URO-OVA/OT-I mice).

40|$|Type I {{collagen}} {{forms the}} main constituent of the extracellular matrix in visceral organs. We reported here that cyclophosphamide (CYP) -induced cystitis significantly increased {{the production of}} type I collagen in the inflamed bladder leading to increases in the bladder weight and {{the thickness of the}} bladder wall. The endogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) in the urinary <b>bladder</b> regulated <b>type</b> I collagen expression because the neutralizing NGF antibody attenuated cystitis-induced type I collagen up-regulation in the inflamed bladder. Neutralizing NGF antibody also subsequently reversed cystitis-induced increases in bladder weight. Further studies on the intermediate signaling pathways mediating NGF-induced type I collagen expression in the inflamed bladder during cystitis revealed that Akt, JNK, and ERK 1 / 2 activities were increased in the inflamed bladder, whereas p 38 MAPK remained unchanged. Suppression of endogenous NGF level with neutralizing NGF antibody significantly blocked the increased activity of Akt, JNK, and ERK 1 / 2 in the inflamed bladder during cystitis.

40|$|The role of ultrasonographic {{examination}} of the bladder has been retrospectively evaluated in 12 patients with hemorrhagic cystitis occurring after BMT. Three sonographic patterns of bladder abnormalities have been observed: type 1, circumscribed thickening of the wall protruding into the lumen (4 patients); type 2, diffuse thickening of the wall (3 patients); type 3, intraluminal lobulated bulky mass reducing the capacity (5 patients). Sonographic follow-up showed a progressive trend of <b>bladder</b> abnormalities: <b>type</b> 3 lesions were always preceded by type 1 or type 2 abnormalities. In 10 of 12 patients the cystoscopic findings proved {{the correlation between the}} sonographic aspects and the progressive stages of bladder wall damage. Patients were treated initially by hyperhydration and blood products transfusions in order to stop hematuria. The median duration of bleeding was significantly longer (p < 0. 01) in patients showing type 3 lesions (90 days) than in the combined groups with types 1 or 2 lesions (14 days). All 5 patients with type 3 abnormalities failed treatment and required endoscopic removal of clots; hemorrhagic cystitis was the major cause of death in 3 patients in this group.

40|$|Strains of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) encode {{filamentous}} adhesive organelles called type 1 pili {{that promote}} bacterial colonization and {{invasion of the}} <b>bladder</b> epithelium. <b>Type</b> 1 pilus-mediated interactions with host receptors, including α 3 β 1 integrin, trigger localized actin rearrangements that lead to internalization of adherent bacteria via a zipper-like mechanism. Here we report that type 1 pilus-mediated bacterial invasion of bladder cells also requires input from host microtubules and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC 6), a cytosolic enzyme that, by deacetylating α-tubulin, can alter the stability of microtubules along with the recruitment and directional trafficking of the kinesin- 1 motor complex. We found that disruption of microtubules by nocodazole or vinblastine treatment, as well as microtubule stabilization by taxol, inhibited host cell invasion by UPEC, as did silencing of HDAC 6 expression or pharmacological inhibition of HDAC 6 activity. Invasion did not require two alternate HDAC 6 substrates, Hsp 90 and cortactin, but was dependent upon the kinesin- 1 light chain KLC 2 and an upstream activator of HDAC 6, aurora A kinase. These results indicate that HDAC 6 and microtubules act as vital regulatory elements during the invasion process, possibly via indirect effects on kinesin- 1 and associated cargos...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy and early stages of autonomic <b>bladder</b> dysfunction in <b>type</b> 2 diabetic women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 137 diabetic women with minimal coexisting confounders of voiding dysfunction followed at a diabetes clinic were subject to the following evaluations: current perception threshold (CPT) tests on myelinated and unmyelinated nerves at the big toe for peroneal nerve and middle finger for median nerve, uroflowmetry, post-void residual urine volume, and overactive bladder (OAB) symptom score questionnaire. Patients presenting with voiding difficulty also underwent urodynamic studies and intravesical CPT tests. RESULTS: Based on the OAB symptom score and urodynamic studies, 19 % of diabetic women had the OAB syndrome while 24. 8 % had unrecognized urodynamic bladder dysfunction (UBD). The OAB group had a significantly greater mean 5 Hz CPT test value at the big toe by comparison to those without OAB. When compared to diabetic women without UBD, those with UBD showed greater mean 5 Hz CPT test values at the middle finger and big toe. The diabetic women categorized as C-fiber hyposensitivity at the middle finger or big toe by using CPT test also had higher odds ratios of UBD. Among diabetic women with UBD, the 5 Hz CPT test values at the big toe and middle finger {{were significantly associated with}} intravesical 5 Hz CPT test values. CONCLUSIONS: Using electrophysiological evidence, our study revealed that hyposensitivity of unmyelinated C fiber afferents at the distal extremities is an indicator of early stages diabetic <b>bladder</b> dysfunction in <b>type</b> 2 diabetic women. The C fiber dysfunction at the distal extremities seems concurrent with vesical C-fiber neuropathy and may be a sentinel for developing early diabetic bladder dysfunction among female patients...|$|R

However, resection margins were positive due to the novel finding of a satellite lesion on histopathological assessment. Salvage cystectomy was subsequently performed and the patient had an uncomplicated post-operative recovery. DISCUSSIONThis case highlights the importance of achieving negative soft tissue and bladder margins on initial resection of UA, as the consequences of incomplete resection can place significant additional morbidity on the patient. CONCLUSIONWe aim to highlight the possibility of satellite lesions within the bladder in UA and suggest that further studies looking at this phenomenon are required to establish its incidence and overall impact on management of UA...|$|R
40|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} (UI) is any involuntary leakage of urine. It is {{a common}} and distressing problem, which may have {{a profound impact on}} quality of life. Urinary incontinence almost always results from an underlying treatable medical condition. There is also a related condition for defecation known as fecal incontinence. Physiology of continence Continence and micturition involve a balance between urethral closure and detrusor muscle activity. Urethral pressure normally exceeds bladder pressure, resulting in urine remaining in the bladder. The proximal urethra and bladder are both within the pelvis. Intraabdominal pressure increases (from coughing and sneezing) are transmitted to both urethra and bladder equally, leaving the pressure differential unchanged, resulting in continence. Normal voiding is the result of changes in both of these pressure factors:urethral pressure falls and <b>bladder</b> pressure rises. <b>Types</b> Stress incontinence Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is essentially due to pelvic floor muscle weakness. It i...|$|R

Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been tightly dentified as the major etiologic agent of neoplasia of cutaneous and mucosal epithelia. Among the 100 or more types of HPV that have been discovered, approximately 35 of them {{are associated}} with cancer. In cattle, bovine papillomavirus (BPV) is the etiologic agent of neoplasia of upper gastrointestinal tract and urinary <b>bladder.</b> Eight <b>types</b> of BPV have been identified. They are related to cutaneous fibropapillomas and, squamous papillomas of the skin and esophagus and carcinomas (BPVs 1, 2 and 4). Infection by papillomavirus requires epidermal or mucosal epithelial cells. Initial infection occurs in basal cells and the access to these cells occurs through micro-abrasions caused by various forms of physical trauma. The correlation of BPV and cancer has been evaluated {{not only because of}} the economic repercussions of virus infection, but also because the system is an attractive experimental model to study HPV infection and carcinogenesis. In studies performed in bovines, our group showed that despite the description of papillomavirus as epitheliotropic, its genetic material was found in several different types of tissues (reproductive tract, embryonic tissues, gametes and blood) in a same animal and also in the peripheral blood of its offspring. We suggest that blood could act as a pathway for papillomavirus dissemination to other tissues and body fluids, in special for reproductive trac...|$|R
40|$|We studied domains in {{the human}} bladder that acted as receptors for Escherichia coli P, S, type 1, type 1 C, and O 75 X fimbriae or adhesin and domains {{in the human}} kidneys that were receptors for E. coli type 1 C fimbriae. Binding sites in frozen tissue {{sections}} were localized by direct staining with fluorochrome-labeled recombinant strains and by indirect immunofluorescence with the purified adhesins. In the bladder, the P and S fimbriae showed closely similar binding to the epithelial and muscular layers, and the S fimbriae also bound to the connective tissue elements. Type 1 fimbriae bound to vascular walls and to muscle cells, whereas the O 75 X adhesin bound avidly to connective tissue elements {{and to some extent}} to epithelial and muscle cells of the <b>bladder.</b> The <b>type</b> 1 C fimbriae bound to distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney and to vascular endothelial cells in both the kidney and bladder. The binding of all adhesin types was inhibited by specific receptor analogs or Fab fragments. The results reveal a possible mechanism by which the type 1 C fimbriae may help invasion of E. coli in the kidneys but do not support a pathogenetic role for type 1 fimbriae. Similar tissue specificity of P and S fimbriae in the human urinary tract indicates that the presence of binding sites on uroepithelia does not fully explain the virulence properties of P fimbriae in human urinary tract infections...|$|R
3000|$|To find a {{relationship}} between clinical and sonographic appearance of hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in pediatric hematooncology patients. Clinical and sonographic findings of 31 children (M:F =  18 : 13; mean age, 12.7  years) with HC in pediatric hematooncology patients were reviewed. For each patient, the onset of HC after transplantation, use of bladder-toxic agent, presence of BK viruria, and duration of disease were reviewed. Sonographic findings including bladder wall thickness (BWT), the <b>type</b> of <b>bladder</b> wall thickening (nodular vs. diffuse), occurrence of hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis were reviewed. We analyzed sonographic appearance and clinical manifestations of HC. HC occurred within 4  months after HSCT/BMT. 27 patients (87.0  %) were positive for BK viruria and 24 patients (77.4  %) took bladder-toxic agents. On sonography, nodular <b>type</b> <b>bladder</b> wall thickening was more frequent (54.8  %), and BWT was thicker in this group (p =  0.003). There was {{a positive correlation between}} the BWT on initial sonography and duration of cystitis (r [...]...|$|R
