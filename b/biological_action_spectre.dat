40|$|A {{recently}} described peptide hormone, endothelin, is {{a potent}} vasoconstrictor, but {{it is unclear whether}} endothelin has other <b>biological</b> <b>actions.</b> These experiments extend the range of <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> of endothelin to stimulation of mitogenesis. Endothelin at low concentrations (0. 1 - 10 nM) induced mitogenesis by quiescent rat glomerular mesangial cells in culture. Mitogenesis induced by endothelin was accompanied by activation of phospholipase C with increased inositol phosphate turnover and increments of intracellular [Ca 2 +]. Endothelin also activated Na+/H+ exchange, causing cytosolic alkalinization, and enhanced transcription of the c-fos protooncogene, additional biochemical signals closely linked to proliferation. In addition to being a vasoconstrictor, endothelin thus also functions as a mitogen, presumably through activation of phospholipase C...|$|R

40|$|Mycotoxins are ubiquitous, mold-produced toxins that {{contaminate}} a {{wide variety}} of foods and feeds. Ingestion of mycotoxins cause a range of toxic responses, from acute toxicity to long-term or chronic health disorders. Some mycotoxins have caused outbreaks of hu-man toxicoses, and at least one mycotoxin, aflatoxin B 1, is a presumed human hepatocarcinogen. As part of a comprehensive effort to curtail the ad-verse health effects posed by mycotox-ins, substantial research has been con-ducted to determine the mechanism of action of mycotoxins in animals.

The reduction of metronidazole is pH dependent in acid medium and four electrons are involved in the complete reduction to the hydroxylamine derivative. In aprotic medium the reduction of the metronidazole occurs in two steps, the first involving one electron to form the nitro radical and the second step involving three more electrons until the formation of the hydroxylamine derivative.

40|$|The insulin-like {{growth factors}} (IGFs) have {{been implicated in}} the {{autocrine}} and/or paracrine growth {{of a number of}} tumor types, including lung tumors.

In particular, IGFBP- 2 is frequently produced by human tumor cells, suggesting that this protein may be an important determinant of IGF action in tumors.

40|$|Many drug {{molecules}} exert their <b>biological</b> <b>action</b> on intracellular molecular targets {{present on}} or inside various cellular organelles. Consequently, {{it has become}} more evident that the efficiency and efficacy of drug action is dependent largely on how well an unaided drug molecule is able to reach its intracellular target. We hypothesized that the <b>biological</b> <b>action</b> of such drug molecules might be improved by specific delivery to the appropriate sub-cellular site by a pharmaceutical carrier designed for the purpose. To test our hypothesis, we used paclitaxel, a molecule that has recently been shown to have pro-apoptotic biological targets on the mitochondria but has a quantitative structure–activity relationship-predicted cytosolic accumulation and no affinity for mitochondria.

40|$|To {{correctly}} perceive <b>biological</b> <b>actions,</b> {{the movement}} pattern {{generated in the}} course of the action has to be linked to the configuration of the actor. Recently, we showed that in humans, motion and configuration cues are processed separately in occipito-temporal cortex, and that both cues are integrated in the extrastriate (EBA) and fusiform (FBA) body areas (Jastorff and Orban, 2009). Using the same factorial design as in our human study, we performed fMRI experiments in awake monkeys to compare biological motion processing in the two species. Point-light displays of monkeys engaged in various actions were presented in a 2 × 2 factorial design. One factor manipulated the configuration of the stimuli, the other, the kinematics. As in humans, the two factors were anatomically segregated in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) rostral to the MT/V 5 complex, with the effect of configuration significant along the lower bank and that of kinematics significant in the fundus and the upper bank of the STS. Moreover, voxels showing a significant interaction between the two factors were mainly confined to body-selective patches within the STS, mimicking our human findings. Importantly, this study reports for the first time differential activation for <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> presented as point-light displays in the monkey. Moreover, our results suggest that the processing mechanisms of <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> are remarkably similar in humans and macaque monkeys, and provide the basis for linking existing and future single-cell physiology in the monkey with human functional imaging. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{for this}} paper was to review human studies of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) concentrations and of O-DMA producers compared with nonproducers {{in the context of}} results from in vitro studies. O-DMA is an intestinal bacterial metabolite of daidzein, an isoflavone compound observed to have phytoestrogenic properties. Not all individuals harbor bacteria capable of metabolizing daidzein to O-DMA, and individuals can be classified as O-DMA producers and nonproducers. O-DMA is less structurally similar to 17 β-estradiol than its parent compound, daidzein; thus, it may exhibit different <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> than daidzein. Evidence from in vitro studies suggests that O-DMA has several cancer-related <b>biological</b> <b>actions.</b> However, results from human metabolic studies and observational studies of disease risk suggest that these actions may not be physiologically relevant in vivo due to the amount and form (primarily glucuronide) of circulating O-DMA. Apart from circulating O-DMA concentrations, the underlying bacteria may have a distinct physiological role. Urinary excretion of O-DMA in humans is a marker of harboring intestinal bacteria capable of C-ring cleavage. Bacterial C-ring cleavage reactions are relevant to other phytochemicals that may exert <b>biological</b> <b>actions</b> in vivo that are stronger than the actions of O-DMA; thus, the role of the phenotype may extend beyond daidzein metabolism. There are a limited number of studies that have evaluated disease risk factors in relation to being an O-DMA producer, with mixed results. Further research evaluating disease risk in relation to the O-DMA–producer phenotype from the perspective of intestinal microbial composition is recommended...|$|R
