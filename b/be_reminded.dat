5|$|In the 1990s, after Waterloo {{station was}} chosen as the British {{terminus}} for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuepée, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to the British Prime Minister requesting that the station be renamed because he said it was upsetting for the French to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> of Napoleon's defeat when they arrived in London by Eurostar. There is a name counterpart in Paris: the Gare d'Austerlitz is named after the Battle of Austerlitz, one of Napoleon's greatest victories (over the Russians and Austrians).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ava {{is asked}} to be the grand marshal to a New Year's Day parade. This makes her boyfriend, Kevin, feel like he can't live up to her lifestyle. He then starts {{thinking}} she may be ashamed of him, especially after he isn't invited to sit with her during the parade. Eventually, Kevin confronts Ava on this and she reveals that if she messes up their relationship she doesn't wanted to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> of it while Googling her name. He assures her that their relationship won't end badly and the two go to the parade.|$|E
5|$|Philipp's mother, {{who never}} married, was the eighth child of {{relatively}} poor parents. Her father {{made a living}} as a driver and as a laborer in the construction business. The financial situation was always tight, and taught everyone in the family discipline and to work hard to survive. To support the family, Alma worked as an accountant and clerk. Philipp's father paid a monthly alimony of 35 Reichsmark (RM) until 1933. Initially he had to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> by his mother of his obligations. Philipp was baptized on 29 July 1917, taking the name Johannes Fritz, and was confirmed in 1931.|$|E

25|$|Although {{these four}} {{processes}} are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function.

25|$|Despite these improvements, Garcia's {{physical}} and mental condition continued to decline throughout 1993 and 1994. Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. By the beginning of 1995, his playing ability had suffered {{to the point where}} he would often turn down the volume of his guitar, a problem exacerbated by carpal tunnel syndrome and the ongoing loss of feeling in his extremities from diabetes. On the band's final tours, he frequently had to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> of what song he was performing.|$|E
25|$|Magnétophone are an {{electronic}} / art rock band originating from Birmingham UK, composed of Matt Saunders (born 1972) and John Hanson (born 1973).

He drops clues, gradually leading her to the truth, but she seems to block out anything that will cause recognition. He finally tells the truth straight out. She gets angry and calls him a liar. Because she does not believe in an afterlife, she finds it impossible that he could be her dead husband.|$|E

25|$|In 1959, Shirley {{moved to}} New York City and quickly married {{magazine}} photographer Hans Lownds; Shirley was his third wife. Lownds persuaded her {{to change her}} name to Sara because his first wife named Shirley had left him {{and he did not}} want to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> of his previous marriage. Sara and Hans lived in a five-story house on 60th Street in Manhattan, between Second and Third Avenues. Sara had a modeling career and appeared in Harper's Bazaar as the 'lovely luscious Sara Lownds'—then became pregnant. Their daughter Maria was born October 21, 1961. Within a year of the birth, the marriage began to fail.|$|E
25|$|When the 1970 Roman Missal allowed laypeople {{to receive}} both species {{of bread and}} wine, it insisted that priests should use the {{occasion}} to teach the faithful the Catholic doctrine on the form of Communion, as affirmed by the Council of Trent: they were first to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> that they receive the whole Christ when they participate in the sacrament even under one kind alone, and thus are not then deprived of any grace necessary for salvation. The circumstances in which this was permitted were initially very restricted, but were gradually extended. Regular distribution of Communion under both kinds requires {{the permission of the}} bishop, but bishops in some countries have given blanket permission for the administration of Communion in this way.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E

25|$|Conall's Constantinian shield, {{and this}} motto, {{have been the}} main O’Donnell arms in various forms, through the centuries. The motto also appears {{prominently}} placed as a motto on a ribbon unfurled with a passion cross to its left, beneath a window over the Scala Regia, adjacent to Bernini's equestrian statue of Emperor Constantine, in the Vatican. Emperors and other monarchs, having paid respects to the Pope, descended the Scala Regia, and would observe the light shining down through the window, with the motto, reminiscent of Constantine's vision, and <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> to follow the Cross. They would thence turn right into the atrium of St. Peter's Basilica, ostensibly so inspired. In an earlier version (before Bernini's renovations in the mid-17th century), something similar may have resonated with and been observed by Prince Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell following his visit to Pope Paul V (at the Palazzo Quirinale) in Rome, just prior to his death in 1608. It would certainly have resonated with and been observed by Cardinal Patrick O'Donnell.|$|E
25|$|In March 2000, {{the band}} {{completed}} their debut lp I Guess Sometimes I Need to <b>Be</b> <b>Reminded</b> of How Much You Love Me, which was subsequently released by 4AD (where they remain signed today) to great critical acclaim in some quarters. The BBC {{used one of}} the tracks from this album, 'So Much As Hold My Hand', on their World Service as the theme music for links between programmes and news bulletins. Their work since this LP has included collaborations with Kim Deal and Kelley Deal, King Creosote, James Yorkston, The Mountain Goats and Sonic Boom. In 2004, Magnétophone's track 'Kel's Vintage Thought', co-written with The Breeders' Kelley Deal, was voted by listeners of BBC 6 Music as the Rebel Playlist winner on the Steve Lamacq show. Their second lp, The Man Who Ate The Man, was released in 2005 and was voted best avant-post rock lp of 2005 by Piccadilly Records. Shortly after its release, in late 2005, Magnétophone recorded a session for BBC Radio 1's Blue Room show at the Maida Vale Studios, and for BBC Radio 1's Rob da Bank show, both broadcast in November 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{allowed the}} commissioners to lease the tolls for periods {{of up to}} seven years, and the first lease was granted to Charles Chaplin, one of the commissioners who held ten shares, in January 1770. He agreed to pay a rent of 4 per cent per year to the other shareholders, and to {{contribute}} a maximum of £500 per year towards maintenance costs. If more than £500 was needed, the commissioners were to supply any additional amounts. Although Chaplin had an option to renew the lease after 7 years, {{he did not do}} so, and no other takers could be found. The commissioners then negotiated with Chaplin, and revised terms were agreed. In return for a 99-year lease, he would fund all repairs, pay the salaries of the officers of the canal, and pay 5 per cent interest to the subscribers. Clearly, the 99-year lease was not authorised by the enabling Act, but nobody challenged its legality for over 50 years. Chaplin was not thorough in carrying out his side of the bargain and had to <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> that he had not been paying the interest in 1782 and again in 1788.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the Reformation, baptism was often {{conducted}} in private as a celebration of the birth of children. The rite was considered necessary for salvation, and so midwives often baptized children to avoid the risk that the child would die unbaptized. Strasbourg reformer Martin Bucer made it a part of the worship service so that parishioners could <b>be</b> <b>reminded</b> of their own baptism, which was to be the sign of their incorporation into the church. The parents of children were to bring their children to the font following the sermon, and were admonished to catechize their children, a process which was intended to begin around age ten. Catechesis was considered to be entailed in baptism itself, and weekly catechetical services were instituted for this purpose. Zwingli understood baptism to be a sign of membership in a community rather than a ritual which conferred salvation on individuals. He, or possibly Oecolampadius, can be credited with first articulating this line of thought, later called covenant theology, which became the Reformed sacramental theology. During the Reformation, Anabaptists opposed the practice of infant baptism, arguing that only those who had made a profession of faith should be administered the rite. This was based on a theology of decisional regeneration, the teaching that only those who had made a decision for Christ could be saved. Against this, the Reformed believed that justification is only by grace, rather than based on any human decision.|$|E
