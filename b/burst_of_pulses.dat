The fluid is fired from glands on the sides of their head. The spitting spiders Scytodes can spit a venomous and sticky fluid that traps its victims and also poisons them. The bombardier beetle is unusual by using a violent exothermic chemical reaction to launch a boiling noxious chemical spray in a rapid <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> from special glands in its abdomen, accompanied with a popping sound. The Anthia (oogpister beetle) will fire formic acid at attackers, probably extracting the formic acid from the ants that it eats. The devil-rider stick insects (Anisomorpha) can fire terpenes from glands on the metathorax that can cause an intense burning irritation of the eyes and mouth of potential predators. Wood ants will spray acid at attackers. A type of planthopper of Madagascar is able to flick small balls of honeydew, this attracts day geckos that feed on the honeydew and whose presence may deter predators from approaching the sap-sucking insect. Termites of the North American termite subfamily Nasutitermitinae can project a sticky fluid from a nozzle on their heads.

A pulse burst laser system was designed and constructed with the ability to produce a burst of short duration (10 nsec) pulses over a ~ 150 microsecond period with inter-pulse timing as low as 1 microsecond (1 MHz).

40|$|Abstract—Bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (BISAR) is {{an active}} imaging system for which the {{transmitting}} and the receiving antennas are located on separate platforms. During its motion, the transmitting antenna emits towards the ground a <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> at a frequency called Pulses Repetition Frequency. Every pulse affects {{an area of the}} ground after a propagation time proportional to the distance transmitter-scene. The bistatic receiving antenna receives a signal from the ground after a propagation time proportional to the distance scene-receiver. A communication link between the transmitter and the receiver is necessary to measure the phase of the received signal with respect to that of the transmitted signal. This paper presents, initially, the modeling of a moving polarimetric radar working in bistatic configuration. We propose to write the received signal as a function of time for the general case where the transmitter, the target and the receiver are moving. As BISAR and MONOSAR (Monostatic Synthetic Aperture Radar) geometry differ substantially, the BISAR temporal requirements are examined in detail. The radiolink is completely modeled. The companion paper is devoted to the development of two processing methods for bistatic radar imaging. Simulation and experimentation will be presented. 40 BenKassem, Saillard, and Khenchaf 1...|$|E
40|$|Nanosecond {{dielectric}} barrier discharge (NS-DBD) plasma actuators {{is relatively}} new means of flow control. It has several advantages compared to more conventional means of flow control, such as small size, low weight, fast response time and controllability. It has been demonstrated {{to be able to}} promote transition of boundary layers and to postpone flow separation on aerodynamic surfaces. This makes the NS-DBD actuator a promising technology for many applications in aerospace and wind energy industries. This thesis presents a study of NS-DBD actuator effects by numerical simulations. For the purposes of simulations of fluid-dynamic effects of the actuation, complex plasma dynamic processes are modeled by their thermal effects. This is possible due to a large separation of scales between plasmadynamic, thermodynamic and fluid dynamic phenomena. The resulting model is embedded into the compressible computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using Navier- Stokes equations. This model is then used in numerical simulations in two model flows: a laminar boundary and a free shear layer. These model flows are relevant for promotion of laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition and laminar leading edge separation elimination. For the laminar boundary case, the effect of a burst of discharges on a flat plate boundary layer is studied. The shape, wavelength and propagation speed of the disturbance introduced into the boundary layer by actuation are compared to experimental results and found to be in agreement. This indicates that the thermal model is adequate at predicting phenomenological effects of the actuation in this case. POD analysis of the CFD flow fields is employed to identify the dominating modes of the disturbance. The dominating mode is found to be the same as the least stable mode predicted by linear stability theory. A compression wave, however, is not found to play an important role, and the <b>burst</b> <b>of</b> <b>pulses</b> is found to produce the same effects as the long pulse with the same total energy. For the free shear layer case, the model of the actuator is placed on a centerline in the beginning of a free shear layer. As a result of constant frequency actuation, early formation of vortices and shear layer breakdown are observed. Each actuation event produces a convective disturbance in the flow field. Dynamics of the disturbances are analyzed and growth rates are found to be in agreement with the predictions of linear stability theory. A parametric study is carried out to study scalability of the actuator effects to change of actuation frequency and energy per pulse. A saturation effect with the increase of actuation frequency is observed. For both studied cases, the effect of NS-DBD actuation is excitation of natural instability modes, which then evolve according to the stability properties of the flow. Aerodynamic...|$|E

The outstanding advantage of the technique is that there is no need for specialized instruments or surveys.

It is a small effort with a potentially huge pay-off because finding rapidly pulsating objects would be of enormous interest.
