Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. According to a letter he wrote in 1897, he flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's most {{important}} patrons were the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall, Cheshire.

The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E
