40|$|ABSTRACT DeKalb XL chicks {{were given}} a <b>beak</b> <b>trim</b> at 6 d of age (6 DP) with a 2. 8 -mm gauge and a <b>beak</b> <b>trim</b> at 11 wk (11 WB) with a block cut {{approximately}} 2 mm anterior to the nasal openings. Corticosterone (CS) levels of the 6 DP treatment were (P ≤ 0. 01) elevated above non-trimmed CS levels at 2 h posttrim; and BW and feed consumption (FC) of the 6 DP were depressed until 8 wk of age. At 11 wk of age, CS of the 11 WB treatment was (P ≤ 0. 02) elevated above controls at 1, 2, 8, and 5 wk posttrim. The 11 WB treatment resulted in a decrease in FC {{and a reduction in}} BW at 12, 14, and 16 wk of age, whereas there were no differences among treatments in livability during the pullet phase.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted with}} 120 <b>beak</b> <b>trimmed</b> 46 weeks old layers (Shika Brown Strain) to investigate the effect of varying lysine levels on late behaviour of the hens in deep litter system. Laying Hens were randomly allocated to 5 experimental diets containing varying lysine levels (0, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 %) each replicated 3 times. Behavioural observations were obtained using focal continuous sampling and instantaneous scan sampling methods, timed for 15 minute before feeding the hens and after feeding, respectively. The result indicated that both normal and stereotype behaviours increased significantly with increasing lysine level in the diet (58. 01 + 2. 91 %; p < 0. 01) and (18. 60 + 1. 32 %; p< 0. 001) respectively. It was therefore concluded that including 0. 4 % level of lysine in the diet of laying hens during the late laying period may affect the behaviour of the hens either positively or negatively {{during the dry season}} period in northern guinea savannah. Farmers in Nigeria could therefore control undesirable behaviours such as egg destruction and feather pecking through nutritional and other management factors for optimum flock performance...|$|R

Twenty ISA Brown commercial laying hens (Gallus domesticus) that were 18 wk old and not <b>beak</b> <b>trimmed,</b> were accommodated in a pen (4 × 6 m) at 19 ± 2 °C on a light-dark cycle of 10 L: 14 D.

Behavioral analyses were conducted on 5 birds for 5 d. Time spent on each behavior, log survivor analysis of events and inter-event intervals, bout analysis, diurnal pattern in events and bouts, occurrence of behavior in different segments and the corridor of the pen, and sequence analysis were performed to gain insights into the temporal and sequential structures of behavior. Hens spent 97 % of the day on nest use, preening, drinking, feeding, still, walking, perching, and resting; 43 % on commodity-dependent behavior; and 57 % not on commodity-oriented behaviors.

25|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns.

40|$|Hens (70 weeks-of-age) {{with short}} (10 - 11 mm), long (13 - 15 mm) and divided upper beaks (1 - 3 mm {{difference}} in beak length between {{the left and}} right sides of the upper beak) were selected from a flock of hens <b>beak</b> <b>trimmed</b> at hatching and re-trimmed at 14 weeks. Hens were switched from a mash diet to various whole grain diets at weekly intervals {{in order to determine the}} effect of beak length and condition on food intake, feeding behaviour and particle mix consumed from diets. Birds switched from a mash diet to a mixture of whole grain diets suffered a 22. 6 g/day drop (P< 0. 05) in food intake while, conversely, birds changed from a maize and wheat diet to a sorghum and wheat diet had a 28. 4 g/day increase (P< 0. 05) in food intake. For all diets, birds with short upper beaks consumed 7. 8 g/day less (P< 0. 05) than birds with long upper beaks with divided beak birds intermediate in food intake. Feeding rate of divided beak birds (4. 0 mg food/sec) was significantly (P< 0. 05) less than short beak birds (5. 3 mg food/sec) with long beak birds intermediate (5. 0 mg food/sec). Birds with a short upper beak made significantly (P< 0. 05) more pecks at the water nipple than divided beak birds.

40|$|Data {{from ten}} sources {{comprising}} 3, 851 flocks were modelled to identify variation {{in levels of}} mortality in laying hens. The predicted increase with age was curvilinear with significant variation between the seven breed categories. Mortality was higher in loose housing systems than in cages and variable within system, confirming previous reports. Cumulative mortality (CM) was higher in flocks with intact beaks (χ 2 = 6. 03; df 1; p = 0. 014) than in those with <b>trimmed</b> <b>beaks.</b> Most data were available for free-range systems (2, 823 flocks), where producer recorded CM at 60 - 80 weeks of age averaged 10 % but with a range from 0 % to 69. 3 %.

More research to understand the genetic x environment interaction and detailed records of the causes of mortality is required so that improved genotypes can be developed for different systems and different breeds can be better managed within systems...|$|R
40|$|To trim {{or not to}} <b>trim</b> <b>beaks?</b> It {{is always}} a good time to raise this {{difficult}} question. Indeed, since the release of the Brambell Committee report 1 on welfare in the UK in 1965, discussion on the welfare of beak-trimmed birds has continued unabated. The aim of this new book (with its 15 contributors) is not, of course, to close the debate but merely to consolidate the huge amount of scientific information available on methods welfare and alternatives to beak-trimming. In the Preface, it is stated that the book will be of interest to welfare groups, policy makers, scientists, industry leaders and students of poultry science who wish to acquaint themselves with the welfare issues associated with beak-trimming and the potential solutions for reducing the need to beak-trim poultry. This goal is achieved to the extent that most of the information (although sometimes rather concisely) is presented in the eight chapters of this 174 page book. The first chapter describes the methods and reasons for beak-trimming. Chapter 2 raises the ethical question of beak-trimming and gives some of {{the pros and cons of}} the arguments. Pain and nerve injuries induced by beak-trimming are presented in Chapters 3 – 5 and the production responses (improved liveability, plumage quality and feed efficiency during egg laying) of beak-trimmed birds are assessed in Chapter 6 with bird health and handling issues associated with beak-trimming in Chapter 7. The last chapter is devoted to alternatives to beak-trimming. It includes environmental enrichment methods; a consideration of the genetics of feather pecking and cannibalism; dietary recommendations to reduce cannibalism in chickens and laying hens; manipulation of light intensities and colour to modify behaviour; management of body weight; application of abrasive strips in the feed trough to blunt the tips of the beaks of laying hens and the use of fitted devices and stock wound spray in injured birds to prevent further pecking. Among all these alternatives, the genetic solution might well prove to be the most sustainable, efficacious and cost effective. Overall, however, throughout the book this reviewer had the feeling, rightly or wrongly, that it was mostly written by opponents of beak-trimming and that arguments of the defence were sometimes omitted. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|A {{range of}} options have been {{proposed}} as possible alternatives to <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where light control is possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as easily reduces antagonistic encounters and aggressive behaviour. Enrichment devices, introduced at an early age, such as simple objects hung in a habitat, can reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes reduces cannibalism. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse that leads to cloacal cannibalism.|$|E

Because the beak is a sensitive organ with many sensory receptors, <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> or debeaking is [...] "acutely painful" [...] to the birds it is performed on. It is nonetheless routinely done to intensively farmed bird species, because it helps reduce the damage the flocks inflict on themselves due to a number of stress-induced behaviours, including cannibalism, [...] and [...] A cauterizing blade or infrared beam is used to cut off about half of the upper beak and {{about a third of the}} lower beak. Pain and sensitivity can persist for weeks or months after the procedure, and neuromas can form along the cut edges. Food intake typically decreases for some period after the beak is trimmed. However, studies show that trimmed poultry's adrenal glands weigh less, and their plasma corticosterone levels are lower than those found in untrimmed poultry, indicating that they are less stressed overall. A similar but separate practice, usually performed by an avian veterinarian or an experienced birdkeeper, involves clipping, filing or sanding the beaks of captive birds for health purposes—in order to correct or temporarily alleviate overgrowths or deformities and better allow the bird to go about its normal feeding and preening activities. [...] "Coping" [...] is the name for this practice amongst raptor keepers.|$|E
2500|$|The beak is a complex, {{functional}} organ with {{an extensive}} nervous supply including nociceptors that sense pain and noxious stimuli.

2500|$|The {{costs of}} <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> relate {{primarily}} to welfare concerns. [...] These include acute stress, and acute, possibly chronic, pain following trimming.

[...] Most studies report reduced body weights and feed intake following <b>beak</b> <b>trimming,</b> however, by sexual maturity or peak egg production, growth rates are usually normal. [...] Weight losses were reduced in chicks that were beak trimmed by infrared compared with chicks trimmed by a hot-blade.|$|E
2500|$|Severe <b>beak</b> <b>trimming,</b> or <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> birds at {{an older}} age {{is thought to}} cause chronic pain. [...] Following <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> of older or adult hens, the nociceptors in the beak stump show {{abnormal}} patterns of neural discharge, which indicate acute pain. [...] Neuromas, tangled masses of swollen regenerating axon sprouts, {{are found in the}} healed stumps of birds beak trimmed at 5 weeks of age or older and in severely beak trimmed birds. [...] Neuromas have been associated with phantom pain in human amputees and have therefore been linked to chronic pain in beak trimmed birds. [...] If <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> is severe because of improper procedure or done in older birds, the neuromas will persist which suggests that beak trimmed older birds experience chronic pain, although this has been debated.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Beak</b> <b>trimming</b> is {{most common}} in {{egg-laying}} strains of chickens. [...] In some countries such as the United States, turkeys routinely have their beaks trimmed, however, in the UK, only 10% of turkeys are beak trimmed. [...] <b>Beak</b> <b>trimming</b> is a preventive measure to reduce damage caused by injurious pecking such as cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking, and thereby improve livability. [...] Commercial broiler chickens are not routinely beak trimmed as they reach slaughter weight at approximately 6 weeks of age, i.e. before injurious pecking usually begins.

[...] It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak. [...] Pecking force has been found to decrease after <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> in adult hens possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.|$|E
2500|$|Laying hens are {{routinely}} beak-trimmed at 1 day of age {{to reduce the}} damaging effects of aggression, feather pecking and cannibalism. [...] Scientific studies (see below) have shown that <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> is likely to cause both acute and chronic pain.|$|E
2500|$|Whether <b>beak</b> <b>{{trimming}}</b> causes pain is a {{hotly debated}} concern. [...] It {{is a complex}} issue as it may involve acute and/or chronic pain, and depends on the age it is performed, the method of trimming {{and the length of}} beak that is removed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> are mainly welfare advantages for birds kept in close confinement, {{some of which}} directly relate to increases (or reduced decreases) in production. [...] These include reduced feather pecking and cannibalism, better feather condition, less fearfulness and nervousness, less chronic stress, and decreased mortality.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, the aim {{has been}} to develop more {{permanent}} <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> (although repeat trimming may be required), using [...] electrically heated blades in a <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> machine, to provide a self-cauterizing cut. [...] There are currently (2012) four widely used methods of beak trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including scissors or secateurs), electrical (the Bio-beaker) and infrared. [...] The latter two methods usually remove {{only the tip of}} the beak and do not leave an open wound, therefore they may offer improvements in welfare. Other approaches {{such as the use of}} lasers, freeze drying and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in widespread use. [...] The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips. [...] The Bio-beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak, is the preferred method for trimming the beaks of turkeys. [...] The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) wrote regarding <b>beak</b> <b>trimming</b> of turkeys that cold cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less accurate. [...] It was considered that the hot cut was the most distressing procedure for turkeys.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Beak</b> <b>trimming</b> was {{developed}} at the Ohio Experiment Station in the 1930s. [...] The original technique was temporary, cutting approximately 6mm (1/4 inch) off the beak. It was thought that {{the tip of the}} beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a sharp knife, either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.|$|E
