5|$|Regardless of {{the verdict}} of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises to throw a ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
25|$|Triggered {{activity}} can occur {{due to the}} presence of afterdepolarisations. These are depolarising oscillations in the membrane voltage induced by preceding action potentials. These can occur before or after full repolarisation of the fiber and as such are termed either early (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarisations (DADs). All afterdepolarisations may not reach threshold potential, <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they can trigger another afterdepolarisation, and thus self-perpetuate.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus can be {{prevented}} through the highly effective tetanus vaccine, which is a tetanus toxin inactivated with formaldehyde to be immunogenic but not pathogenic. The vaccine can be formulated as simple or adsorbed tetanus vaccine, combined tetanus and killed polio vaccine, or the older (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) (DPT) vaccine. Side effects are rare, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> occur, include fever, pain (sometimes long lasting) at the injection site, unexplained crying in infants, and irritability in older children or adults.|$|E

25|$|Conservative Judaism {{is divided}} {{on the role of}} the Mussaf Amidah. More {{traditional}} Conservative congregations recite a prayer similar to the Mussaf prayer in Orthodox services, except they refer to Temple sacrifices only in the past tense and do not include a prayer for the restoration of the sacrifices. More liberal Conservative congregations omit references to the Temple sacrifices entirely. Reconstructionist and Reform congregations generally do not do the Mussaf Amidah at all, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they omit all references to Temple worship.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} there are 248 parts in a human body, and {{each one of these}} parts can render impure by contact, carrying, or being under the same roof when they have upon them flesh {{sufficient}} that they could heal if still connected to a living person. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have sufficient flesh upon them, these individual parts can render impure only by contact and carrying but cannot render impure by being under the same roof (although a mostly intact corpse does).|$|E
25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one knew who I was and what made me do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} that the view of them is echoed in the Midrash: [...] "If thy sons accept My Godhead [...] I shall be their God and bring them into the land; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not observe My covenant in regard either to circumcision or to the Sabbath, they shall not enter the land of promise" [...] (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi.).

2500|$|Thousands {{are counted}} separately, and the {{thousands}} count precedes {{the rest of}} the number (to the right, since Hebrew is read from right to left). [...] There are no special marks to signify that the “count” is starting over with thousands, which can theoretically lead to ambiguity, although a single quote mark is sometimes used after the letter. [...] When specifying years of the Hebrew calendar in the present millennium, writers usually omit the thousands (which is presently 5 [...] ), <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not this is accepted to mean 5 * 1000, with no ambiguity. The current Israeli coinage includes the thousands.|$|E

But when the next war comes, and European civilisation is wiped out, as it will be, and by no force more than that force, then do not let them lay blame on the old men.

2500|$|Reading [...] Rabbi Levi {{taught that}} blessed actions bless {{those who are}} {{responsible}} for them, and cursed actions curse those {{who are responsible for}} them.

You shall not have (possessions if there are) in your house diverse measures, a great and a small."
