25|$|George {{was buried}} in Passy Cemetery in Paris. In 1952, his mother died from cancer, and she was interred <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a grave marked by a Slavonic cross of stone on a marble tomb. (Section 9, near the {{intersection}} with the outer wall and Section 8.) The gold inscription reads, Fils et Epouse de S.A.I Grand Duc Michel de Russie.|$|E
25|$|Oswald {{was buried}} on November 25 in Shannon Rose Hill Memorial Burial Park in Fort Worth. Reporters who were present {{to report on}} the burial were asked by {{officials}} to act as pallbearers. A marker inscribed simply Oswald replaced the stolen original tombstone, which gave Oswald's full name, and birth and death dates. His mother was buried <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 1981.|$|E
500|$|A Free Rides opening intertitle {{denotes the}} film's setting as [...] "in the wide open spaces, where men are men and girls will be girls, the hills {{are full of}} romance and adventure". The film shows two women walking {{together}} alongside a road near their home. A wealthy male motorist in a right-hand-drive 1912 Haynes 50-60 Model Y Touring Car arrives and offers them a lift. After some hesitation, the women accept his offer and sit <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the front seat. The man then kisses and fondles them. Later, as he urinates behind a tree, the women voyeuristically watch him. When {{he is about to}} finish, the women quickly return to the car. After his return, the women urinate behind the tree while the man secretly watches them and becomes sexually aroused. The women return to the car and the man offers them a drink.|$|E
60|$|He {{lay in the}} bed and wondered, whilst {{his friend}} sat <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> lost <b>in</b> brooding. Each man was gone in his own thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|So saying, he {{sat down}} on a tressel which {{answered}} the purpose of a chair, and placing the lantern <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> proceeded <b>in</b> the most friendly tone: ...|$|R

500|$|Dunstan {{worked as}} a {{silversmith}} and in the scriptorium while he was living at Glastonbury. It is thought likely {{that he was the}} artist who drew the well-known image of Christ with a small kneeling monk <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the Glastonbury Classbook, [...] "one of {{the first of a series}} of outline drawings which were to become a special feature of Anglo-Saxon art of this period." [...] Dunstan became famous as a musician, illuminator, and metalworker. Lady [...] Æthelflaed, King [...] Æthelstan's niece, made Dunstan a trusted adviser and on her death she left a considerable fortune to him. He used this money later in life to foster and encourage a monastic revival in England. About the same time, his father Heorstan died and Dunstan inherited his fortune as well. He became a person of great influence, and on the death of King [...] Æthelstan in 940, the new King, Edmund, summoned him to his court at Cheddar and made him a minister.|$|E
500|$|In the Vishnudharmottara Purana, Kubera is {{described}} {{as the embodiment of}} both Artha ("wealth, prosperity, glory") and Arthashastras, the treatises related to it—and his iconography mirrors it. Kubera's complexion {{is described}} as that of lotus leaves. He rides a man—the state personified, adorned in golden clothes and ornaments, symbolizing his wealth. His left eye is yellow. He wears an armour and a necklace down to his large belly. The Vishnudharmottara Purana further describes his face to be inclined to the left, sporting a beard and mustache, and with two small tusks protruding from the ends of his mouth, representing his powers to punish and to bestow favours. His wife Riddhi, representing the journey of life, is seated on his left lap, with her left hand on the back of Kubera and the right holding a ratna-patra (jewel-pot). Kubera should be four-armed, holding a gada (mace: symbol of [...] dandaniti—administration of justice) and a shakti (power) in his left pair, and standards bearing a lion—representing Artha and a shibika (a club, the weapon of Kubera). The nidhi treasures Padma and Shankha stand <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> human form, with their heads emerging from a lotus and a conch respectively.|$|E
500|$|The {{physicians}} {{could not}} agree on a diagnosis. Radcliffe thought he had scarlet fever, while others thought it was smallpox. They administered [...] "cordial powders and cordial juleps". Gloucester was bled, to which Radcliffe strongly objected. He told his colleagues, [...] "you have destroyed him and you may finish him". He prescribed blistering, which was no more effective. In great pain, Gloucester passed the evening of 28 July [...] "in great sighings and dejections of spirits... towards morning, he complained very much of his blisters." [...] Anne, who had spent an entire day and night by her son's bedside, now became so distressed that she fainted. However, by midday on 29 July, Gloucester was breathing more easily and his headache had diminished, leading to hopes that he would recover. The improvement was fleeting, and that evening, he was [...] "taken with a convulsing sort of breathing, a defect in swallowing and a total deprivation of all sense". Prince William died close to 1 a.m. on 30 July 1700, with his parents <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> the end, the physicians decided {{the cause of death}} was [...] "a malignant fever". An autopsy revealed severe swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and an abnormal amount of fluid in the ventricles of his brain: [...] "four and a half ounces of a limpid humour were taken out." [...] A modern diagnosis is that Gloucester died of acute bacterial pharyngitis, with associated pneumonia. Had he lived, though, it is almost certain the prince would have succumbed to complications of his hydrocephalus.|$|E

60|$|As Myles {{struck and}} hacked at the pel {{assigned}} to him, Sir James Lee stood <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> watching <b>him</b> <b>in</b> grim silence. The lad {{did his best}} to show the knight all that he knew of upper cut, under cut, thrust, and back-hand stroke, but it did not seem to him that Sir James was very well satisfied with his skill.|$|R

2500|$|For his changed attitude, Cossiga {{received}} various criticisms {{by almost}} every party, {{with the exception}} of the Italian Social Movement, which stood <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> defense of the [...] "picconate". He will, amongst other things, be considered one of the first [...] "cleansers" [...] of MSI, who recognized it as a constitutional and democratic force.|$|E
2500|$|After retiring, King {{lived in}} Washington, D.C.. [...] He {{was active in}} his early post-retirement (serving as {{president}} of the Naval Historical Foundation from 1946 to 1949), but suffered a debilitating stroke in 1947, and subsequent ill-health ultimately forced him to stay in naval hospitals at Bethesda, Maryland, and at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. He {{died of a heart attack}} in Kittery on 25 June 1956. After lying in state at the National Cathedral in Washington, King was buried in the United States Naval Academy Cemetery at Annapolis, Maryland. His wife who survived him, was buried <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> 1969.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{man himself}} was more {{entertaining}} than the printed page. To sit <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the pavilion at Lords' {{or in the}} Old Stagers enclosure at Canterbury was to see cricket as it was played in the golden days". At Lords he was always to be seen on match days at the 'Knatchbull's corner [...] - {{the place of the}} Four-in-Hand Club – with his friends John Lorraine Baldwin, Sir Spencer Ponsonby Fane, Earl of Bessborough and Robert Grimston.` The famous old cricketer, with his hat drawn over his eyes, and his burly physique set a figure that always arrested attention.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} was returning, and Mr. Tupman was <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> He spoke <b>in</b> a low tone, and laughed. The little doctor thirsted for his life. He was exulting. He had triumphed.|$|R
60|$|He {{shuddered and}} wiped {{the sweat from his}} {{forehead}} with a handkerchief, but made no reply. They climbed another line of dunes and in the hollow beyond came upon several fallen soldiers, one of whom was moaning with pain. Maud ran to kneel <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> and <b>in</b> a twinkling had her hypodermic needle in his arm.|$|R
60|$|And {{these two}} women were nothing to him. Lydie herself was only a stepping-stone; the statuesque and headstrong girl made no appeal to the {{essentially}} masculine side of his nature, and he had little love left now for the beautiful passionate woman <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> whom <b>in</b> a moment of unreasoning impulse he had bound irrevocably to him.|$|R
2500|$|Boucher was {{an ardent}} Tory and opposed the {{revolution}} from the pulpit. For months, he preached {{with a pair}} of loaded pistols <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> a fiery farewell sermon at St. Barnabas in 1775, he declared to a hostile crowd of 200, that [...] "no power on earth should prevent him from praying and shouting God Save the King." [...] At the conclusion of the sermon, he seized the leader of the crowd, Osborn Sprigg of Northampton, Maryland, (uncle and adopted father of future Governor Samuel Sprigg) and with pistol in hand, they walked together to Boucher's horse. Both men were allowed to leave without harm. Boucher then fled to England.|$|E
2500|$|Rognvald {{thereafter}} {{returned to}} Norway, giving the northern isles {{to his brother}} Sigurd Eysteinsson. Sigurd had been the forecastleman on Harald's ship and after sailing back east the king [...] "gave Sigurd the title of earl". However, [...] the Heimskringla states specifically that Sigurd was the first Earl of Orkney. According to the Orkneyinga Saga, after Sigurd became earl he died in a curious fashion, following a battle with Máel Brigte of Moray. Sigurd's son Gurthorm ruled for a single winter after this and died childless. Rognvald's son Hallad then inherited the title. However, unable to constrain Danish raids on Orkney, he gave up the earldom and returned to Norway, which [...] "everyone thought was a huge joke." [...] Still, there is a tradition among the folk at Strath Halladale, Sutherland, which is named for Hallad, that he returned and was slain in battle {{at the beginning of}} the tenth century and was buried near the battle site in a circular trench ten or twelve feet wide. His sword, it is said, was placed <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the grave, and a stone was erected in the middle of the circle, part of which was still visible {{at the beginning of the}} eighteenth century. The site was near a little town called Dal Halladha, Halladha’s field.|$|E
2500|$|The {{details of}} the cases vary widely: In the 1444 Frankfurt cases and the 1499 Hanau case, the dogs were dead prior to be hanged, and in the late 1615 and 1661 cases in Frankfurt, the Jews (and dogs) were merely kept in this torture for half an hour, before being garroted from below. In the 1588 Bergen case, all three victims were left hanging till they were dead, ranging from 6 to 8 days after being hanged. In the Dortmund 1486 case, the dogs bit the Jew to death while hanging. In the 1611 Öttingen case, the Jew [...] "Jacob the Tall" [...] thought {{to blow up the}} [...] "Deutsche Ordenhaus" [...] with {{gunpowder}} after having burgled it. He was strung up between two dogs, and a large fire was made close to him, and he expired after half an hour under this torture. In the 1553 Württemberg case, the Jew chose to convert to Christianity after hanging like this for 24 hours; he was then given the mercy to be hanged in the ordinary manner, from the neck, and without the dogs <b>beside</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> the 1462 Halle case, the Jew Abraham also converted after 24 hours hanging upside down, and a priest went up on a ladder and baptised him. For two more days, Abraham was left hanging, while the priest argued with the city council that a true Christian should not be punished in this way. On the third day, Abraham was granted a reprieve, and was taken down, but died 20 days later in the local hospital having meanwhile suffered in extreme pain. In the 1637 case, where the Jew had murdered a Christian jeweller, the appeal to the empress was successful, and out of mercy, the Jew was condemned to be merely pinched with glowing pincers, have hot lead dripped into his wounds, and then be broken alive on the wheel.|$|E
50|$|Hotham {{died at the}} age of 57 and {{was buried}} at St Mary's Church, South Dalton where there is a large monument.

Supporting the four corners of the tomb are statues representing the cardinal virtues.|$|R
60|$|When she alighted at {{the lonely}} cross-roads snow {{had already begun}} to fall. But she spied the automobile, with its top raised, some {{distance}} down the lane, and in a moment she was <b>in</b> it, <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> wrapped <b>in</b> the coat she had now come to regard as her own. He buttoned down the curtains and took her in his arms.|$|R
60|$|But {{when he had}} gone, {{she turned}} with a sudden passionate {{outburst}} towards the Abbe Foucquet, her faithful companion through the past long, weary hours. She fell on her knees <b>beside</b> <b>him</b> and sobbed <b>in</b> an agony of grief.|$|R

50|$|Roezl {{was also}} {{the founder of the}} Czech botanical magazine, Flora, in 1880. There is a statue (depicting him holding an orchid with a Native American {{kneeling}} <b>beside</b> <b>him)</b> of Roezl <b>in</b> Prague, located on the southern end of Charles Square.|$|R
60|$|But {{river and}} dark woods and breeze {{overhead}} seemed to whisper to her--whisper, whisper, all the shrouded night aquiver with low, eager whispers. She shivered {{to find herself}} imagining the unimaginable--that she might throw off her stodgy office clothes, her dull cloth skirt and neat blouse, and go swimming <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> revel <b>in</b> giving herself up to the utter frankness of cool water laving her bare flesh.|$|R
60|$|Without a word more, Captain Bream {{laid his}} hand on the poor man's {{shoulder}} and pressed it. Gunter knew well what was meant. He went down on his knees. The captain kneeled <b>beside</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>in</b> a deep, intensely earnest voice, claimed forgiveness of the sin that had been confessed, and prayed that the sinner's soul might be there and then cleansed in the precious blood of Jesus.|$|R
