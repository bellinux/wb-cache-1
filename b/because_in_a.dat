5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is <b>because,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> predecessor, any two consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice for the states of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no Garden of Eden in Rule 90, a configuration with no predecessors. The Rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this configuration is not a Garden of Eden because it does have predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E

25|$|The {{structure}} of a switch is an odd number of layers of smaller, simpler subswitches.

25|$|A {{candidate}} rank function, {{compatible with}} the ordering, makes a poset into graded poset if and only if, whenever one has xnbsp&<nbsp&z with z of rank n+1, an element y of rank n can be found with xnbsp&≤nbsp&ynbsp&<nbsp&z. This condition is sufficient because if z is taken to be a cover of x, the only possible choice is ynbsp&=nbsp&x showing that the ranks of x and z differ by 1, and it is necessary <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> graded poset one can take for y any element of maximal rank with xnbsp&≤nbsp&ynbsp&<nbsp&z, which always exists and is covered by z.|$|E
25|$|Any {{two lines}} of text with {{the same number of}} {{characters}} in each line in a monospaced typeface should display as equal in width, while the same two lines in a proportional typeface may have radically different widths. This occurs <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> proportional font, glyph widths vary, such that wider glyphs (typically those for characters such as W, Q, Z, M, D, O, H, and U) use more space, and narrower glyphs (such as those for the characters i, t, l, and 1) use less space than the average.|$|E
25|$|People with {{a history}} of head and neck cancer are known to be at higher risk (about 25%) of {{developing}} a second cancer of the head, neck, or lung. This is mainly <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> significant proportion of these patients, the aerodigestive tract and lung epithelium have been exposed chronically to the carcinogenic effects of alcohol and tobacco. In this situation, a field change effect may occur, where the epithelial tissues start to become diffusely dysplastic with a reduced threshold for malignant change. This risk may be reduced by quitting alcohol and tobacco.|$|E

25|$|Here {{are some}} {{illustrations}} {{of the alternative}} accentuation: a word nykštỹs 3 is also commonly said nýkštis 1; zýlė 1 {{is also known as}} zylė̃ 3 in some dialects, but this form is used more narrowly and not shown here. Similarly, a word rýkštė 1 is also known as rykštė̃ 4; this is shown in the table. In a case of šálmas 3 – helmet, the variant šal̃mas 4 is also very common. The alternative forms are most usually present between the 1-3 and 2-4 accentuation patterns, same in the type of an accent. But there are also different cases, for example, rýkštė 1 and rykštė̃ 4. The fourth accentuation paradigm can be result of a shift of the third paradigm. The shift can happen following nivellation of the two accents, a loss of accentual contrast. In a case of nivellation of the start-firm and end-firm accents the distinction between the 3-4 and 1-2 loses its ground, <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> place of the stress the 1 with the 2, the 3 with the 4 acentuation groups differ only in a few cases.|$|E
25|$|Aware {{that there}} was a war in Sudan, Churchill {{determined}} to be part of it. He was not alone in this, <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time generally of peace, many British Army officers wanted experience of battle to further their careers. In Churchill's case, he did not see his career as lying with the army, but had already started writing about wars and wanted a new campaign to write about. He first attempted to obtain a transfer from his regiment stationed in India to the 21st Lancers, which was the unit taking part in the war. This was granted by the War Office, but rejected by the commander of the British force in Sudan, General Kitchener. Churchill next took leave to Britain, where he enlisted friends and family to lobby Kitchener to permit him to take part. This continued to be unsuccessful, even when the prime minister Lord Salisbury made an inquiry on his behalf. Eventually, however, he prevailed upon Sir Evelyn Wood, Adjutant General of the Horse Guards, who had authority over appointments to the regiment in England, and he received an attachment to the Lancers in place of an officer who had died, on 24 July 1898. On 5 August he was in Luxor and on 24 August the regiment set out from Atbara to attack the Mahdist forces.|$|E

Paolini revealed it in a newsletter at his official website, in which he said that it was added [...] "because I felt it suited the story, and also <b>because,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way, I still view Brisingr and Book Four as two halves of the same volume; the subtitle is merely the name of the first of these two sections." ...|$|E
500|$|In critiquing {{the rise}} of Internet-based computing, the {{philosophical}} {{question of whether or}} not a society can control technological progress was raised. At the online scientific magazine Edge, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity to read a book all the way through, and computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier rebuked the idea that technological progress is an [...] "autonomous process that will proceed in its chosen direction independently of us". Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian Lewis Mumford in his 1970 book The Pentagon of Power, in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society's free will were employed. Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that [...] "there is only one axis of choice" [...] which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption. Yet Carr had stated in The Big Switch that he believed an individual's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress. According to Carr, the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption. Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr's opinion <b>because</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail. As technological advances shape society, an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will [...] "always be lonely and in the end futile"; despite a few holdouts, technology will nevertheless shape economics which, in turn, will shape society.|$|E
