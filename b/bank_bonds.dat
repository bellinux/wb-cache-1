40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the cost}} and effectiveness of bank restructuring policies in 11 transition countries during 1991 - 98. It argues that country-specific banking sector features, the size of bad loans inherited from the centrally planned system, and weaknesses in the restructuring policies implemented were the main factors affecting the overall fiscal costs, with the latter two being more significant. The paper finds no significant relationship between the size of restructuring costs and overall improvement in banking sector performance for the sample countries as a whole.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{behavior}} of banks in financial markets which banks frequently use to obtain short-term as well as long-term financing is studied. In the first chapter we incorporate an interbank market for collateralized lending among banks into a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) framework to analyze the impact of variations in the expected value of the collateral on the interbank lending volume. We find that a central bank which decides to lower the haircut on eligible collateral in repurchase agreements is able to stimulate interbank markets. In the second chapter a microeconomic model of bank behavior on the interbank market is set up to analyze the impact of risk-taking behavior of interbank borrowing banks and uncertainty about their balance sheet quality on the lending behavior of interbank lending banks. It is found that the disruptions on the interbank market {{are the result of}} optimal behavior on the part of interbank lending banks in response to the uncertainty about the balance sheet quality of an interbank borrowing bank. In the third chapter we use monthly data on German <b>bank</b> <b>bond</b> spreads and regress it on bank-specific risk factors to assess the degree of market discipline in the German <b>bank</b> <b>bond</b> market. The regression results for the whole German <b>bank</b> <b>bond</b> market indicate that the bond spread does not show signs of market discipline.

5000|$|In the {{following}} decades, the French were often primarily {{blamed for the}} high payments imposed and Britain second though, due {{to the influence of}} the Heavenly Twins and the intrigues at Versailles rather than intent by her leaders. An exception was in Germany, where economic writer James Grabbe has stated that the common view in the 1930s was that Britain had desired to economically cripple Germany even as early as 1916, as expressed in this 1934 quote from German historian Oswald Spengler: [...] The war of 1914, however, was fought by England, not on France's behalf nor on Belgium's, but {{for the sake of the}} 'week-end,' to dispose of Germany, if possible, for good, as an economic rival. In 1916 there set in, side by side with the military war, a systematic economic war, to be carried on when the other came inevitably to an end [...] [...] [...] The Treaty of Versailles was not intended to create a state of peace but to organize the relation of forces in such a way that this aim could at any time be secured by fresh demands and measures. Hence the handing over of the colonies and the merchant fleet, the seizure of <b>bank</b> <b>bonds,</b> property, and patents in all countries, the severance of industrial areas like Upper Silesia and the Saar valley, the inauguration of the Republic—by which it was expected (and correctly) that industry would be undermined by the power assumed by trade unions—and finally the reparations, which England, at least, intended not as war indemnification but as a permanent burden on German industry until it should collapse.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the second}} half of the 1995-2007 'Celtic Tiger' period of growth, the {{international}} bond borrowings of the six main Irish banks—Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Life & Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Educational Building Society—grew from less than €16 billion in 2003 to approximately €100 billion (well over half of Ireland's GDP) by 2007. This growth in bond funding was quite exceptional relative to the aggregate euro area and the focus of the Central Bank and most external observers was on the apparently strong capital adequacy ratios of the banks or Pillar One of the Basel framework. For example, the 2007 International Monetary Fund Article IV Consultation—Staff Report on Ireland has a heading summarizing the position of the banking sector as [...] "Banks Have Large Exposures to Property, But Big Cushions Too.". However, this appears to have come at the expense of a lack of emphasis on the second pillar, which relates to the supervisory process. In particular, the Basel II guidelines contain an extensive section on the importance of dealing with [...] "credit concentration risk", i.e. banks having too much exposure to one source of risk. Inadequate and/or lax supervision of the Irish banking system had allowed excessive borrowing by the Irish Banks on the corporate and international money markets. By October 2009 it was German and French banks that were most exposed in the periphery of the eurozone, with more than 40 per cent of the foreign claims on Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain being French and German. In 2010 the Bank for International Settlements recorded between US$186.4 billion and $208.3 billion in total exposure to Ireland, with $57.8 billion in exposure to Irish banks. The German monetary financial institution sector was the largest investor in Irish <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> during the pre-crisis period and according to the Bundesbank's consolidated figures German banks had, by September 2008, the month of the bank guarantee, €135 billion invested in Ireland. These figures for the exposure of German banks to [...] "Irish" [...] banks, however, relate almost in their entirety to their exposure to their own large subsidiaries based in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre, for example Depfa, which reportedly had an external focus and external ownership.|$|E

The UK government started the nationalization process by injecting £37 billion in the nation’s three largest banks. The UK government would end up owning a majority share in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and over a 40% share in Lloyds and HBOS. In return for the bailout, the banks agreed to cancel dividend payments until the loans are repaid, have board members appointed by the Treasury, and limit executive pay. The European Central Bank attempted to revive credit market by weekly injections of unlimited euro funds at an interest rate of 3.75%. The ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, was also contemplating relaxing the collateral standards to make the funds more accessible to banks. Following its European partners, Italy pledged to intervene as necessary to prevent any bank failures in its country. Finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, said Italy would guarantee new <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> of up to 5 years until the end of 2009 and the Bank of Italy would provide €40 billion in treasury bills to banks to refinance inferior assets that can not be currently used as collateral. In coordination with other eurozone countries, the Dutch government announced that it would guarantee interbank lending up to €200 billion.

40|$|I {{assess how}} Basel III, Solvency II {{and the low}} {{interest}} rate environment will affect the financial connection between the bank and insurance sector by changing the funding patterns of banks {{as well as the}} investment strategies of life insurance companies. Especially for life insurance companies, the current low interest rate environment poses a key risk since declining returns on investments jeopardize the guaranteed return on life insurance contracts, a core component of traditional life insurance contracts in several European countries. I consider a contingent claim framework with a direct financial connection between banks and life insurers via <b>bank</b> <b>bonds.</b> The results indicate that life insurers' demand for <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> increases over the mid-term but ultimately declines in the long-run. Since life insurers are the largest purchasers of <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> in Europe, banks could lose one of their main funding sources. In addition, I show that shareholder value driven life insurers' appetite for risk increases when the gap between asset return and liability growth diminishes. To check the robustness of the findings, I calibrate a prolonged low interest rate scenario. The results show that the insurer's risk appetite is even higher when interest rates remain persistently low. A sensitivity analysis regarding industry-specific regulatory safety levels reveals that contagion between bank and life insurer is driven by the insurers' demand for <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> which itself depends on the regulatory safety level of banks...|$|E

The market does not develop very rapidly: bonds were issued on larger scale only since 2002, before the dale the market was nonexistent. Issues amounted to 2 bln PLN in 2002, 5, 3 bln PLN in 2003 and dropped to 700 mln PLN in 2004. In 2002 and 2003 the market was dominated by <b>bank</b> <b>bonds</b> which gained about 75 - 80 % of total capital. <b>Bank</b> <b>bonds</b> were popular during that period, because of exemption from capital gain tax. In 2004 the exemption ceased to exist, so banks debentures became less popular. Other corporate bonds issues were very small, they totaled to 200 - 400 mln PLN in 2002 - 2004. The reluctance to public bond market is hard to explain since costs of debentures are usually lower than bank loans. Also Polish law encourages companies to finance on public market.
