I was get along from the base conception to the design partial fragments of the machine and associate complex look of ultrasound. The function of the machine is relatively difficult and analysis of it is complicated in time. That is why I am introducing only evolution of design and ergonomy.

Is this shortage of honesty an accident or a <b>buit-in</b> feature of shareholder capitalism? This paper argues that in an economy hosting publicly traded companies where investors have only imperfect information about a firmâ€™s type and where a honest financial report may be wrong, at least some bad firms managers will provide false statements. Furthermore, in equilibrium some good firm managers may also resort to corrupt auditors which will issue a favorable report without carrying out any investigation. The frequency of dishonest managers is analysed in keeping with the precision of the report and the total number of firms.

40|$|Description Complete {{functions}} are given for model identification, estimation and diagnostic checking for AR and subset AR models. Two types of subset AR models are supported. One family of subset AR models, denoted by ARp, is formed by taking subet {{of the original}} AR coefficients and in the other, denoted by ARz, subsets of the partial autocorrelations are used. The main advantage of the ARp model is its applicability to very large order models. For the nonsubset, AR(p), case, the function given in this package outperforms the <b>buit-in</b> R function "ar " for exact mle when p is large. In addition to speed, another advantage of this package {{is that it is}} entirely written in the R language which makes it easier to port to other systems such as Mathematica or MatLab.
