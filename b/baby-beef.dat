40|$|In the Czech Republic, the {{fattening}} of {{beef cattle}} with high-grain diets is used {{the most frequently}} in so called <b>baby-beef</b> production (fattening to lower slaughter weights). This type of fattening was stud-ied by Chládek et al. (1998) and Chládek and Ingr (2001 a,b) in Holstein bulls slaughtered at live weight of 305 – 480 kg. Much less information {{is available on the}} use of high-grain diets at the fattening to higher slaughter weight. Most researchers reported higher average daily weight gain, higher carcass weight and higher intramuscular fat content, as compared with roughage-based diets (Mandell et al., 1998; Keane and Fallon, 2001). The carcass composition and slaughter traits are affected especially by the cattle breed, as docu-mented Bartoň et al. (2006) and Bartoň et al. (2007) ...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{fatty acid}} (FA) {{composition}} of muscle tissue of <b>baby-beef</b> cattle was researched {{with regard to}} its nutritional value. Twenty- six Simmental cattle of both sexes produced under the intensive conditions of housing and feeding were slaughtered {{at the age of}} one year and final weight of 489. 6 ± 46. 5 kg. The portion of muscle (m. longissimus dorsi) was taken for the chemical analysis {{at the level of the}} 8 th rib on cooled halves 24 h post mortem. Muscle fat content was determined by Foss-Let apparatus after extraction of lipids with tetrachloroethylene. The fatty acid composition was determined by gas liquid chromatography using in situ transesterification method and given as % of total weight of fatty acids. The average muscle fat content was 18. 96 g/kg (95 % CI 14. 09 - 23. 83). The average proportions of saturated FA (SFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in muscle tissue were 43. 03 (95 % CI 42. 19 - 43. 87), 43. 05 (95 % CI 40. 74 - 45. 36) and 13. 08 % (95 % CI 10. 96 - 15. 19), respectively. The indicators of nutritional quality of fats like ratios of PUFA to SFA (PUFA/SFA) and n- 6 PUFA to n- 3 PUFA (n- 6 /n- 3), as well as the atherogenicity index (AI) in muscle were 0. 31 (95 % CI 0. 25 - 0. 36), 13. 51 (95 % CI 12. 59 - 14. 43), and 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 58 - 0. 63), respectively. These results suggest a need for the improvement of nutritional value of <b>baby-beef</b> fats through the modifications of its FA composition, primarily through n- 3 PUFA enrichment...|$|E
40|$|Retention {{of young}} cattle and {{marketing}} older cattle from the range {{has been suggested}} {{as one of the}} profitable means of adjustment for the cow-calf operator. This {{study was to determine the}} impacts of the shift from cow-calf ranching operation to cow-calf-yearling operation on the feed energy budget of the ranch, cow herd size, beef production and market price of beef. Ten alternative livestock management options involving cow-calf-yearling operations were tested for these impacts, using two representative Utah size ranches (150 and 300 cow ranches). The extra feed needed to accomodate the increased number of yearlings and the decrease required in brood cow herd size were estimated. Changes in beef production in Utah, the Western eleven States, and the change on national price of beef were estimated from marketing projections of four types of beef. These projections were based on three levels of adoption for the management options by producers in each area. Under complete retention of home grown calves, the total amount of feed required to support the typical cow-calf operation was 93 % of the total feed needed for the cow~calf short yearling and 85 % of the total feed required for the cow-calf long-yearling operation. Only the production of long-yearlings resulted in a considerable decrease in brood cow carrying capacity (8 to 31 %) · Marketing <b>baby-beef</b> and grass-fed beef produced a substantial decrease in beef tonnage and a corresponding increase in beef price. Light-fed short-yearlings and heavy-fed beef (from both short and long yearlings) showed a considerable beef increase in Utah and the western region. Only the marketing of heavy-fed short-yearlings produced a positive change in the beef produced nationally and a slight decrease in beef price (0. 3 to 2 %) ...|$|E
