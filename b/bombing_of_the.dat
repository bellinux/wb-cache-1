5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), that in an emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Syrian government's Shayrat Airbase in 2017, The Daily Stormer {{was one of several}} alt-right outlets that criticized Trump. While Anglin alleged the president could be under control of a purportedly Jewish deep state, weev said in a video on the website that he retained faith in Trump from his past actions.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the author's {{participation}} in the Allied <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monastery at Monte Cassino during World War II, the novel is considered a masterpiece by literary critics. It has been compared favorably with the works of Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Walker Percy, and its themes of religion, recurrence, and church versus state have generated a significant body of scholarly research.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> focus <b>of</b> {{this article}} is to {{highlight}} <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> popular culture to become an agent of leftist populist politics in contemporary Serbia. The authors observe the hip-hop collective “The <b>Bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nineties”, whose music tackles topics from recent history, and who subvert <b>the</b> fashion style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s “Dizel” subculture, which is often connected to Serbian nationalism and war profiteering. The paper analyses <b>the</b> relationships “The <b>Bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nineties” create between their practices, class warfare and leftist discourses, aiming to show the potentials and threats those relationships introduce. Following Ernesto Laclau’s understanding of populism as a “hegemonic political articulation of demands”, we assume that “The <b>Bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nineties” could represent a solid populist political agent in that they attempt to reveal and draw attention to <b>the</b> “unfulfilled demands” <b>of</b> disempowered Serbian youth. On the other hand, <b>the</b> counter-intuitive merge <b>of</b> ideologies they operate, and <b>the</b> limited impact <b>of</b> their strategies on the official politics could be an obstacle to <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> their message...|$|R
50|$|During World War II, its {{predecessor}} unit, the 384th Bombardment Group was a VIII Bomber Command B-17 Flying Fortress unit in England. Assigned to RAF Grafton Underwood in early 1943, the group dropped the last Eighth Air Force <b>bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war on 25 April 1945.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> first <b>bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war {{dropped in}} <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} <b>of</b> Coventry were when five dropped on RAF Ansty on 25 June 1940. There were no casualties. This was {{two days before}} any civilians were killed near Coventry, when the Hillfield's area was bombed and 16 people lost their lives.|$|R
5|$|Lessing was spurred {{to write}} The Good Terrorist by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Harrods {{department}} store in London in 1983. She {{had been a}} member of the British Communist Party, but left after the 1956 Hungarian uprising. Some reviewers labelled the novel a satire, while Lessing called it humorous. The title is an oxymoron which highlights Alice's ambivalent nature.|$|E
5|$|Regarded as {{the first}} film noir in Tamil cinema, Andha Naal is set in World War II, during the <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian city of Madras by Japanese forces in 1943. The story of the blind men and an {{elephant}} is referenced in the narrative, when Sivanandam notes how each suspect's account of Rajan's death contradicts those of the others.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz was {{a period}} of {{sustained}} strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom by Germany during the Second World War. Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, sixteen British cities were hit by major aerial raids. Beginning on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. Overall, more than one million London houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz, and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London.|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> 1999 NATO <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia <b>the</b> airbase {{was heavily}} bombed for 25 days and {{sustained}} heavy damage.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> NATO <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, <b>the</b> Orthodox {{cemetery}} in Vitina and <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Dobreš {{were hit by}} missiles.|$|R
50|$|Bombs {{cause damage}} and {{eliminate}} all enemy shots within the effect area. Players {{can carry a}} maximum of seven at once; grabbing an eighth will only add points, although the bonus is significantly greater if the ship is carrying seven <b>bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same type and collects an eighth that is also identical.|$|R
5|$|The British, with no army in {{the field}} and behind in rearmament, was in no {{position}} to challenge French strategy, which had assumed the prominent role of the Western Alliance. Having little ability to oppose the French, the British strategy for military action {{came in the form of}} strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ruhr industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack {{release was}} released on LP and CD by Warner Bros. and featured only 12 tracks. Later re-releases by Rykodisc and EMI added nine additional tracks, including alternate instrumental end credits music. Rykodisc's version included the gunbarrel and opening sequence of the film {{as well as the}} jailbreak sequence, and the <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge.|$|E
5|$|This set {{operated}} {{for most}} of the inter-war period, being withdrawn in April 1938. It was replaced by a very similar set of coaches at this time, which was withdrawn in September 1939 after the outbreak of hostilities for use in troop trains. The carriages were replaced by the former Royal Train, built 1900–04, of the now-defunct South Eastern and Chatham Railway. These ornately decorated carriages were those destroyed in the 1941 <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London terminus.|$|E
2500|$|... "Soviet {{nuclear bombs}} are 25% more {{efficient}} than <b>the</b> Atomic <b>Bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probable adversary.

[...] (the first five letters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian alphabet, they are transliterated into Latin as A, B, V, G, D).|$|R
50|$|Eight LB-6s and all {{operational}} LB-7s {{were delivered}} to the 20th and 96th <b>Bomb</b> Squadrons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Bomb</b> Group at Langley Field, Virginia, and <b>the</b> 11th <b>Bomb</b> Squadron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7th <b>Bomb</b> Group at Rockwell Field, California, between January and September 1929. The nine remaining LB-6s {{were sent to the}} 23rd and 72nd Bomb Squadrons, attached to 5th Composite Group at Luke Field, Hawaii, between July and September 1929. In May 1930 three LB-6s were re-engined to become LB-7s and transferred to <b>the</b> 25th <b>Bomb</b> Squadron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 6th Composite Group based at France Field in the Panama Canal Zone, where they were all written off in 1931.|$|R
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{examples}} of political terrorism by Stoke Newington residents, none originally from the area, are Patrick Hayes, Jan Taylor and Muktar Said Ibrahim. The first two {{were convicted of}} two bombings and had substantial links to <b>the</b> huge lorry <b>bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990s. Both were arrested, firing at officers in Walford Road and later sentenced to thirty years imprisonment.|$|R
5|$|With the {{election}} of President Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and {{the announcement of the}} new American policy of Vietnamization in 1969, America's relations with Cambodia began to change. The goal of the U.S. was now to buy time for their South Vietnamese allies (and to cover their own withdrawal). On 11 May 1969 Sihanouk welcomed a return to full diplomatic relations with the U.S. On 18 March Nixon, already anticipating this development, ordered the <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cambodian sanctuaries by B-52s.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Indianapolis, Indiana, Vonnegut {{attended}} Cornell University, but dropped out in January 1943 and enlisted in the United States Army. As part of his training, he studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the University of Tennessee. He was then deployed to Europe to fight in World War II, and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge. He was interned in Dresden and survived the Allied <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city by taking refuge in a meat locker of the slaughterhouse where he was imprisoned. After the war, Vonnegut married Jane Marie Cox, {{with whom he had}} three children. He later adopted his sister's three sons, after she died of cancer and her husband died in a train accident.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} still believed that China had not intervened in Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the Chinese withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 Chinese troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off Chinese reinforcements. Confident that the UN air force could detect and disrupt any troop movements across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining Chinese and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E

50|$|During 23 August Luftflotte 4 flew {{approximately}} 1,600 sorties {{and dropped}} 1,000 tons <b>of</b> <b>bombs</b> on <b>the</b> city effectively destroying it, while three aircraft were lost. The extensive bombing caused numerous fires. In {{the first few}} hours <b>of</b> <b>bombing,</b> <b>the</b> headquarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's air defences were bombed. The city was quickly turned to rubble, although some factories survived and continued production whilst workers militia joined in the fighting.|$|R
5|$|In late 1944 several British {{air attacks}} damaged the U-boat bases in Bergen. During {{one of these}} attacks, a 'Tallboy' bomb went {{straight}} through the roof of pen 3, damaging it beyond repair and putting it out of action {{for the remainder of}} the war. The base was handed over to the Allies, along with the rest of occupied Norway, on 8 May 1945 when all German forces in Europe surrendered. As a result of the intensive <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city in late 1944 and 1945, the Bergen area was one of the worst damaged regions in the south of Norway at the conclusion of the war.|$|E
5|$|Navigating {{through the}} smoke slowed progress, and the mistaken use by the First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to {{identify}} their positions—the same colour strategic bombers used to mark targets—led to some <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadians and slower progress than planned. On 15 August, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade continued the offensive, but progress remained slow. The 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy against determined German resistance and several German counter-attacks, which prevented a breakthrough to Trun. The next day, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise against minor opposition from Waffen SS units and scattered pockets of German infantry, and by 17 August had secured the town.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1943, a {{contingent}} of 2,075 British troops, along with seven jeeps, six anti-tank guns and ten mortars, boarded their gliders in Tunisia and took off at 18:00, bound for Sicily. In the hours that preceded the landing, twelve Boeing B-17 and six Vickers Wellington equipped with radar jamming devices flew back and forth along the coast in the Siracusa-Licata sector; between 21:00 and 21:30, 55 Wellingtons of 205th Group carried out a diversionary <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> port and airport of Syracuse, causing a number of civilian and military casualties, including {{the commander of the}} Italian naval base, Commander Giuseppe Giannotti. 280 puppets dressed in paratrooper uniforms were launched north of the landing area, in order to deceive the Italian defense.|$|E
50|$|During World War II {{some parents}} {{suggested}} that Eton should {{be moved to}} a location safe from <b>the</b> <b>bombs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy. If London's poor could not move from London, said Elliott, the Etonians would not move from Eton. Later, in 1940, two bombs did actually fall on Eton, only just missing a library full of studying boys, but this only made him more determined to stand firm. Elliott never did move the school.|$|R
25|$|Sessions opposed <b>the</b> NATO <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, <b>the</b> NATO {{intervention}} in Libya, and arming the Syrian rebels. As Attorney General, he reportedly advised President Trump against increasing the U.S. {{military presence in}} Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, despite <b>the</b> <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> London, <b>the</b> College {{kept its}} doors open. Apart from the rabbinical studies and degree course, Chazzanut courses and teacher {{training}} programmes were now offered.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presidential Palace, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng and {{his field}} commanders had been {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} deploying units of the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF), to attack high-value South Vietnamese targets in support of North Vietnamese ground troops. Use of the Soviet MiG-17 fighter was considered, North Vietnamese pilots already had significant combat experience with the type. However, moving MiGs from their bases in North Vietnam was problematic; South Vietnamese defenses were falling much faster than anticipated, there was simply little time in which to deploy the MiGs in support of North Vietnamese units encircling Saigon. As the North Vietnamese had captured {{a large number of}} U.S.-made aircraft from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force at Pleiku and Da Nang Air Bases, it was decided to use captured aircraft instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was well-received in Serbia and abroad; {{it has since}} attained iconic status in Serbian popular culture. An allusion to it is made in Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground, in which war refugees are depicted marching towards Belgrade in similar fashion, following the German <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city in April 1941. Several authors have noted similarities between Jovanović's depiction of the migration and images of other upheavals in Serbian history. Historian Katarina Todić observes that there are striking similarities between the painting and photographs of the Royal Serbian Army's retreat to the Adriatic coast during World War I. Judah remarks that the composition resembles images of the exodus of Krajina Serbs following Croatia's Operation Storm in August 1995.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{became the}} District line of London Transport. From 23 October 1933 a Piccadilly line service {{replaced}} the Harrow to Uxbridge District shuttle. In 1923 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) {{had taken over}} the L railway's outer circle service from Earl's Court and by the Second World War this had been cut back to an electrified Earl's Court to Willesden Junction shuttle. Following <b>bombing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West London Line in 1940 the LMS and the Metropolitan line services to Addison Road were both suspended. After the war, to serve the Kensington exhibition halls a District line shuttle service started from Earl's Court to Addison Road, now renamed Kensington Olympia.|$|E
