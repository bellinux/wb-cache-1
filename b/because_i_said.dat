25|$|In a 2004 episode, TC watched an NBC ad for Days of Our Lives on his TV, {{and went}} on to praise the writers of Days of our Lives for coming up with such good storylines; Days, at that time, was under the helm of James E. Reilly, head writer of Passions. In the September 4, 2006, episode, Fox was sucked into a black hole; he then told Tabitha that {{it was the kind of}} black hole that one gets sucked into on the Sci Fi Channel, which was the channel on which Passions repeats aired in 2006. Tabitha then told him stick with NBC (Passions network). In an episode later in September 2006, Siren tried to get Miguel into bed by singing her Siren's song. Miguel told her that she should not {{audition}} for America's Got Talent, which airs on NBC. In another episode, Tabitha talked about The Biggest Loser season finale, which was also aired on NBC. A more recent episode featured characters watching a trailer for the 2007 Diane Keaton film <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> So (produced by Universal Studios, which, like NBC, is owned by General Electric).|$|E
500|$|Speaking to Australian {{radio station}} 2Day FM, Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the title for their next album: [...] "is much easier to pronounce." [...] Martin debunked speculation that they were {{taking a break from}} touring by saying, [...] "This three-year break idea only came about <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> at a gig in Australia that we might not be back there for three years. That’s probably true, but that’s just how a world tour works. No chance are we taking a three-year break.” ...|$|E
500|$|On her Christmas Day 2007 {{television}} show, Martha Stewart {{exhibited the}} nativity scene she made in pottery {{classes at the}} Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia while serving a 2005 sentence. She remarked, [...] "Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month, and I was only there for five months, I begged <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I was an expert potter—ceramicist actually—and could I please make the entire nativity scene." [...] She supplemented her nativity figurines on the show with tiny artificial palm trees imported from Germany.|$|E

6000|$|Now I hesitated, as what I had to {{tell her}} seemed so foolish, indeed so insane, while she waited patiently as though to give me time to shape my thoughts. Speaking at last <b>because</b> <b>I</b> must, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I only {{mentioned}} his name, <b>because,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{he was over}} with us the other day at Framley, {{and we were all}} talking about your affair." ...|$|R
500|$|In early March 2017, in an {{interview}} with Brie Larson, published by People magazine, Fonda stated, [...] "One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it's not right." [...] She said, [...] "I’ve been raped, I’ve been sexually abused as a child and I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t sleep with my boss." [...] She said, [...] "I always thought it was my fault; that I didn’t do or say the right thing. I know young girls who’ve been raped and didn’t even know it was rape. They think, ‘It must have been <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> ‘no’ the wrong way.’" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Keaton {{starred in}} both <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> So and Mama's Boy. In the romantic comedy <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> So, {{directed}} by Michael Lehmann, Keaton played a long-divorced {{mother of three}} daughters, determined to pair off her only single daughter, Milly, played by Mandy Moore. Also starring Stephen Collins and Gabriel Macht, the project opened to overwhelmingly negative reviews by critics, with Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe calling it [...] "a sloppily made bowl of reheated chick-flick cliches," [...] and was ranked among the worst-reviewed films of the year. The following year, Keaton received her first and only Golden Raspberry Award nomination to date, for the film. In Mama's Boy, director Tim Hamilton's feature film debut, Keaton starred {{as the mother of}} a self-absorbed 29-year-old (played by Jon Heder) whose world turns upside down when his widowed mother starts dating and considers booting him out of the house. Distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only, the independent comedy garnered largely negative reviews.|$|E
2500|$|The United States then {{fought a}} four-round veto duel with France, forcing it {{to back down}} and accept the {{selection}} of US-educated Kofi Annan {{to be the next}} Secretary-General. President Clinton was very impressed and told Clarke and Sheehan, [...] "Get me a crow, I should eat a crow, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> you would never pull it off." [...] In his memoirs, Clarke said that [...] "the entire operation had strengthened Albright's hand in the competition to be Secretary of State in the second Clinton administration." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{some of you}} {{may think}} this a strange sort of sermon, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> little or nothing about Jesus Christ and His {{redemption}} in it, but I say--No.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do I {{tell you}}? <b>I</b> tell you <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{do not wish}} you to marry Edward Cossey. <b>I</b> tell you <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wish /him/ {{to feel a little}} of what /I/ have to feel, and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> that he should /not/ marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} lives, {{and that he}} wrote it, Mr. Neville. I'll tell you God's truth about it as <b>I</b> believe it, <b>because</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>I</b> think you are {{entitled}} to know the truth." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hillary Clinton {{described}} the remarks as [...] "elitist, out of touch, and frankly patronizing." [...] Noting {{he had not}} chosen his words well, Obama subsequently explained his remarks, [...] "Lately {{there has been a}} little typical sort of political flare-up, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> something that everybody knows is true, which {{is that there are a}} whole bunch of folks in small towns in Pennsylvania, in towns right here in Indiana, in my hometown in Illinois, who are bitter." [...] Obama had addressed similar themes in a 2004 interview with Charlie Rose, and his strategists countered that Bill Clinton had made similar comments in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Jennings {{has written}} several books. Brainiac: Adventures in the Curious, Competitive, Compulsive World of Trivia Buffs details his {{experiences}} on Jeopardy! and his research into trivia culture conducted {{after the completion}} of his run. Ken Jennings's Trivia Almanac: 8,888 Questions in 365 Days, a hardcover book, is a compilation of trivia questions—with 3 categories and about 20 questions per day of the year. Maphead: Charting the Wide, Weird World of Geography Wonks explores the world of map and geography enthusiasts. [...] <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> so! is a humorous examination of 'The myths, tales & warnings every generation passes down to its kids'. He also has written five books for his children's series, Junior Genius Guides.|$|E
2500|$|However, his {{positive}} impact on television became a negative one for Broadway. Caesar fans preferred to stay home on Saturday nights to watch his show instead of seeing live plays. [...] "The Caesar show became such a Saturday-night must-see habit—the Saturday Night Live of its day," [...] states Nachman, that [...] "...Broadway producers begged NBC to switch the show to midweek." [...] Comedy star Carol Burnett, who later had her own hit TV show, remembers winning tickets to see My Fair Lady on Broadway: [...] "I gave the tickets to my roommate <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> Fair Lady's gonna be running for a hundred years, but Sid Caesar is live and I'll never see that again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have I not tried?" [...] he {{answered}} bitterly. [...] "Tell me, do I so easily relinquish my great desire? Why am <b>I</b> here? <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> {{to myself that}} I will not be denied. Adrienne shall be mine!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't think I {{want you}} to have it; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't," [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. Hatchard, making a {{preliminary}} movement to showing him downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "He went {{on talking}} like that," [...] {{continued}} the captain, hastily, [...] "and out of politeness and good feeling I agreed with him. What else could I do? Then—I didn’t take much notice of it <b>because,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{he was drinking}} whiskey—he—he sort of wondered why—why—" ...|$|R
2500|$|Keaton's only film of 2015 was Love the Coopers, an {{ensemble}} {{comedy about a}} troubled family getting together for Christmas, for which she reunited with <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>Said</b> So writer Jessie Nelson. Also starring John Goodman, Ed Helms, and Marisa Tomei, Keaton was attached for several years before the film went into production. Her cast was instrumental in financing and recruiting most other actors, which led her to an executive producer credit in the film. Upon its release, Love the Coopers received largely negative reviews from critics, who called it a [...] "bittersweet blend of holiday cheer," [...] and became a moderate commercial success at a worldwide total of US$41.1million against a budget of US$17million.|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversy}} {{emerged on}} May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted {{a clip of}} King at a Library of Congress reading event on the website NewsBusters. [...] King, talking to high-school students, had said: [...] "If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. [...] If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that." [...] The comment was described by the blog as [...] "another {{in a long line}} of liberal media members bashing the military," [...] and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006. [...] King responded later that day, saying, [...] "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise." [...] King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8, saying, [...] "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. [...] Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds." [...] King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a [...] "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even {{if it was}} {{it would}} make no matter. I don't mean {{to think of that}} now. I beg your pardon <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what I ought not to have said." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, <b>because,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> there lies, as wrapt up in a mantle, much of {{the glory}} of our gospel matters in this temple which Solomon builded; {{therefore}} I have made, as well as I could, by comparing spiritual things with spiritual, this book upon this subject.|$|R
6000|$|I stopped there, not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> all <b>I</b> had to say, {{but because}} Dick's face scared me--honest, it did. It had all gone white, {{like it does}} in the pulpit {{sometimes}} when he is tremendously in earnest, only ten times worse. But all he said was, ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Certainly, my dear,’ {{chimed in}} the delighted Mrs. Porter; ‘most undoubtedly! <b>Because,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> if Miss Caroline does play Fenella, it doesn’t follow, {{as a matter}} of course, that she should think she has a pretty foot;—and then—such puppies as these young men are—he had the impudence to say, that—’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} Egyptian, sadly, [...] "I see you are angry with me. Is it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I {{lived in a}} tree? Do forgive me for that dreadful lie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] {{the young}} man interrupted, [...] "only you mustn't think I'm a gas-bag just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{a word or two}} here before Gerry and Olive and you, old fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{your father}} {{intended}} {{to put you}} in business! Oh, Hugh, why are you so foolish and so proud? Do you suppose that anyone--that I--think any the worse of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> command you,' <b>said</b> the maiden, 'but because reason, common sense, manhood, and, in one word, {{regard for}} your own safety, give the same counsel.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with TheWrap, Freeman {{was asked if}} he considered himself atheist or agnostic. [...] He replied, [...] "It's a hard question <b>because</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> at the start, I think we invented God. So if I believe in God, and <b>I</b> do, it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think I'm God." [...] Freeman later said that his experience working on The Story of God with Morgan Freeman did not change his views on religion.|$|R
6000|$|But Pansy, {{responding}} {{again to}} the company rather than her guardian's counsel, and as if appealing to them, went on half poutingly: [...] "Yes! <b>I</b> runned away <b>because</b> they teased me! Because they didn't like you and said horrid things. Because they told awful, dreadful lies! <b>Because</b> they <b>said</b> <b>I</b> wasn't no orphan!--that my name wasn't Stannard, and that you'd made it all up. <b>Because</b> they <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was a liar--and YOU WAS MY FATHER!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't part at all," [...] he said, {{standing}} {{his ground}} {{with his back}} to the fire. [...] "I don't understand it, by heaven I don't. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> some stupid thing about Boulogne, all in joke--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] said Key hurriedly. [...] "We really saw nothing--it {{was all a}} fancy; and Uncle Dick {{was joking}} me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I thought I saw a woman's face," [...] he added with a forced laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, Mademoiselle; {{not long}} since. I loved then as dearly as I do now, but {{he let me}} walk home by myself three long leagues without {{speaking}} a word to me, and all <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that {{a man in a}} picture had fine whiskers." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{after that}} feast {{was over and}} done, Sir Tristram said: [...] "Lady, will you not of your {{courtesy}} {{tell me why you}} wear the weeds of sorrow in which you are clad? This I ask, not from idle humor, but <b>because,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>I</b> may haply be able to aid you in whatever trouble it is under which you lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They sure were," [...] I {{declared}} {{with great}} relief. [...] "And now to forget ourselves. I'm more than sorry I distressed Miss Sampson; more than sorry <b>because</b> what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> wasn't on the square. Blome, no doubt, {{has come to}} Linrock after Steele. His intention is to kill him. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that--let Miss Sampson think it all meant fatality to the Ranger. But, Sally, I don't believe that Blome can kill Steele any more than--than you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had to--Pold <b>said</b> he'd {{shoot me}} if I {{went back on}} him. Mr. Bird,"--Solly Jackson turned to the young Southerner,--"you know I ain't no bad man like Pold an' that sort." ...|$|R
