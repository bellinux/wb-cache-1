50|$|Figures {{provided}} by the International Institute for Strategic Studies from 2012 showed that Royal Air Force pilots achieve a relatively high number of <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> per year when compared with other major NATO allies such as France and Germany.

50|$|The Air Force {{projected}} that E and R models have lifetime <b>flying</b> <b>hour</b> limits of 36,000 and 39,000 hours, respectively. According to the Air Force, {{only a few}} KC-135s would reach these limits by 2040, when some aircraft would be about 80 years old. The Air Force estimated that their current fleet of KC-135s have between 12,000 and 14,000 <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> on them-only 33 percent of the lifetime <b>flying</b> <b>hour</b> limit.|$|R

50|$|The {{pilot who}} flew the {{aircraft}} was 35-year old Captain Basuki. According to a Sriwijaya Air spokesman, Basuki {{was a very}} experienced pilot with a total <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> of 10.000 hours. However, the NTSC refuted the claim, stating that he had only acquired a total <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> of 7,794 in which 6,238 hours of them were on the Boeing 737. The co-pilot was 34-year old First Officer Eri Radianto. According to Sriwijaya Air, Eri was also an experienced pilot with a total <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> of 5,000 in which 4.100 hours of them were on the type.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> (AFH) per pilot is, like {{almost every other}} aspect of the KPAF, very hard to {{estimate}}. Most sources on the subject abstain from giving hard numbers, {{but all of them}} estimate the average annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> per pilot as being 'low' to 'very low'. The number of annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> is of course very important in estimating the individual skill and experience of the pilots of an air force: more annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> suggests better trained pilots. Most estimates present a rather grim picture: AFH per pilot for the KPAF are said to be only 15 or 25 hours per pilot each year - comparable to the <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> of air forces in ex-Soviet countries in the early 1990s. In comparison, most NATO fighter pilots fly at least 150 hours a year. Ground training, both in classrooms, on instructional airframes or in a flight simulator can only substitute for 'the real thing' to a certain degree, and the low number of modern jet trainers in the KPAF arsenal points to a very modest amount of flying time for the formation of new pilots.|$|R

50|$|The {{stagnation}} of the Peruvian economy {{during the}} late 1980s and early 1990s forced cost reductions and the downsizing of the fleet size.Budget cuts in training meant Peruvian pilots had a low number of annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> (AFH) per pilot if compared to the 1970s. The number of annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> is of course very important in estimating the individual skill and experience of the pilots of an air force: more annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> suggests better trained pilots and general readiness.There are also {{a number of possible}} explanations for FAP`s low AFH: concern over the aging of equipment, scarcity of spare parts - especially for the older aircraft - difficulties with worn airframes and the scarcity of fuel are all contributing factors. It is very likely however that some 'elite' pilots and regiments such as those based in Talara AFB and La Joya AFB received considerably more <b>flying</b> <b>hours.</b> Especially since those regiments until today are equipped with modern aircraft and tasked with homeland defence.|$|R
