50|$|In May 1976 The Friends of the <b>Boundary</b> <b>Waters</b> {{was formed}} with Bud Heinselman as {{chairman}} {{in opposition to}} Representative James Oberstar’s {{bill that would have}} split the <b>Boundary</b> <b>Waters</b> Canoe Area Wilderness into two areas. The proposed bill would have kept 625,000 acre as wilderness, while 527,000 acre would have been declared a National Recreation Area that would remain open to motorized use, logging, and mining. The Friends of the <b>Boundary</b> <b>Waters</b> supported Representative Bruce Vento’s bill that kept all of the <b>Boundary</b> <b>Waters</b> as wilderness. This bill was a precursor to the <b>Boundary</b> <b>Waters</b> Canoe Area Wilderness Act which was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 21, 1978.

[...] According to the International <b>Boundary</b> <b>Water</b> Commission, the sewage discharge was due to a repair of a sewer pipe near Rio Alamar.

40|$|The Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) is an {{advisory}} body, established in 1969, that advises the United Nations (UN) {{system on the}} scientific aspects of marine environmental protection. At present GESAMP is jointly sponsored by nine UN organizations with responsibilities relating to the marine environment, and they utilize GESAMP as a mechanism for coordination and collaboration among them. GESAMP functions are to conduct and support marine environmental assessments, to undertake in-depth studies, analyses, and reviews of specific topics, and to identify emerging issues regarding {{the state of the}} marine environment. Studies and assessments are usually carried out by dedicated working groups, most of whose members are not sitting members of GESAMP but part of the broader GESAMP network. This presentation will describe and review the current role of GESAMP with particular reference to the UNEP/GEF TWAP (Trans boundary Waters Assessment Programme) Among the constraints to effective management of transboundary waters is the lack of a systematic and scientifically-robust methodology for assessing the changing conditions of the five different types of trans <b>boundary</b> <b>water</b> systems resulting from human and natural causes, which would allow the policy makers, Global Environment Facility and international organisations to set science-based priorities for financial resource allocation. Such a methodology also would facilitate identification and assessment of positive changes in the environmental and resources situations in the trans <b>boundary</b> <b>water</b> systems resulting from interventions by national authorities and international/regional communities. Such a global, comprehensive assessment has not yet been undertaken. However GESAMP is actively involved in the development of an improved, ecosystem-based methodology in Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) through pollutant indicators such as mercury and its compounds, POPs and other pollutants that cross trans <b>boundary</b> <b>water</b> systems. The efforts of the GESAMP initiative to this programme will be fully discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} water infiltration experiment through {{a block of}} fractured, moderately welded volcanic tuff was conducted at different boundary pressures. The block measured 47. 5 cm long {times} 54. 3 cm wide {times} 80. 6 cm high. The purpose of the experiment was: (a) to test an instrumentation scheme for a field test, and (b) to make flow measurements through a fractured network at different boundary pressures to understand mechanisms that affect fracture flow. The upper <b>boundary</b> <b>water</b> pressure was decreased in steps; each step lasted several weeks where the pressure was kept steady. Water inflow and outflow rates were measured for each boundary condition. Entrapped air was found to impede water movement. The gas phase in the fracture network was found to not be continuous; its pressure within the network was not known. The matric potential values could not be measured with tensiometers alone since a known gas pressure is required. Long-term input and output flow rates were equal. Outflow rate did not stabilize during the test period; it continued to decrease, even when the upper <b>boundary</b> <b>water</b> pressure was kept steady. No relation between boundary pressure and flow rate was established. Bacteria, which {{was found in the}} outflow, possibly caused variations in the behavior. Trapped air caused the outflow to periodically decrease or stop; however, outflow rates following the interruptions did not change long-term flow trends...|$|E
