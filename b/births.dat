"METHODS:Using data for singleton U. S.

Findings: three categories emerged from the analysis: preparing for <b>birth,</b> the novice <b>birthing</b> and processing the <b>birth.</b> These women shared a common core experience of seeing that they gave <b>birth</b> as ‘novices’. The basic social process running through their experience of <b>birth,</b> regardless of <b>birth</b> setting, was that, as novices, they were all ‘reacting to the unknown’.
