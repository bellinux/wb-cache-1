50|$|The {{plant was}} first {{introduced}} into the United States in 1854 when Japanese ports were opened for US trade. Captain William Roberts, who enjoyed botany, brought <b>back</b> only three <b>bulbs</b> of the red spider lily. The bulbs were then planted by his niece who found {{that they do not}} bloom until after the first good rain in the fall season. Plants have since become naturalized in North Carolina, Texas, and many other southern states of the US. Since the Japanese forms are sterile triploids, the introduced plants were also sterile and reproduce only by bulb division.|$|R
25|$|The {{halogen lamp}} reduces uneven {{evaporation}} of the filament and eliminates darkening {{of the envelope}} by filling the lamp with a halogen gas at low pressure, rather than an inert gas. The halogen cycle increases the lifetime of the bulb and prevents its darkening by redepositing tungsten {{from the inside of}} the <b>bulb</b> <b>back</b> onto the filament. The halogen lamp can operate its filament at a higher temperature than a standard gas filled lamp of similar power without loss of operating life. Such bulbs are much smaller than normal incandescent bulbs, and are widely used where intense illumination is needed in a limited space. Fiber-optic lamps for optical microscopy is one typical application.|$|R

40|$|SummaryOdor {{representations}} are initially {{formed in}} the olfactory bulb, which contains a topographic glomerular map of odor molecular features. The bulb transmits sensory information directly to piriform cortex, where it is encoded by distributed ensembles of pyramidal cells without spatial order. Intriguingly, piriform cortex pyramidal cells project <b>back</b> to the <b>bulb,</b> but {{the information contained in}} this feedback projection is unknown. Here, we use imaging in awake mice to directly monitor activity in the presynaptic boutons of cortical feedback fibers. We show that the cortex provides the bulb with a rich array of information for any individual odor and that cortical feedback is dependent on brain state. In contrast to the stereotyped, spatial arrangement of olfactory bulb glomeruli, cortical inputs tuned to different odors commingle and indiscriminately target individual glomerular channels. Thus, the cortex modulates early odor representations by broadcasting sensory information diffusely onto spatially ordered bulbar circuits...|$|R
40|$|SummaryOlfactory cortex {{pyramidal}} cells integrate {{sensory input}} from olfactory bulb mitral and tufted (M/T) cells and project axons <b>back</b> to the <b>bulb.</b> However, {{the impact of}} cortical feedback projections on olfactory bulb circuits is unclear. Here, we selectively express channelrhodopsin- 2 in olfactory cortex pyramidal cells and show that cortical feedback projections excite diverse populations of bulb interneurons. Activation of cortical fibers directly excites GABAergic granule cells, which in turn inhibit M/T cells. However, we show that cortical inputs preferentially target short axon cells that drive feedforward inhibition of granule cells. In vivo, activation of olfactory cortex that only weakly affects spontaneous M/T cell firing strongly gates odor-evoked M/T cell responses: cortical activity suppresses odor-evoked excitation and enhances odor-evoked inhibition. Together, {{these results indicate that}} although cortical projections have diverse actions on olfactory bulb microcircuits, the net effect of cortical feedback on M/T cells is an amplification of odor-evoked inhibition...|$|R

40|$|In {{a year-round}} {{monitoring}} program (1998), pesticide composition and toxic potency {{of the mix}} of pollutants present in rainwater were measured. The goal {{of the study was}} to relate atmospheric deposition of toxic potency and pesticide composition to each other and to sampling period and local agricultural activity. Rainwater was collected in 26 consecutive periods of 14 days in a background location (BACK) and in two locations representative for different agricultural practices, i. e. intensive greenhouse horticulture (HORT) and flower bulb culture (BULB). Samples were chemically analyzed for carbamate (CARB), organophosphate (OP) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides and metabolites. Esterase inhibiting potency of rainwater extracts was measured in a specially developed bio-assay with honeybee esterases and was expressed as an equivalent concentration of the model inhibitor dichlorvos. Estrogenic potency of the extracts was measured in the ER-CALUX reporter gene assay and was expressed as an equivalent concentration of estradiol. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) techniques proved to be valuable tools to analyze the numerous pesticide concentrations in relation to toxic potency, sampling location, and sampling season. Pesticide composition in rainwater depended much more on sampling season than on sampling location, but differences between SPRING and SUMMER were mainly attributed to local differences in agricultural practice. On average, the esterase inhibiting potency exceeded the maximum permissible concentration set for dichlorvos in The Netherlands, and was significantly higher in HORT than in <b>BACK</b> and <b>BULB.</b> Esterase inhibition correlated significantly with OP and GARB concentrations, as expected given the working mechanism of these insecticides. The estrogenic potency incidentally exceeded NOEC levels reported for aquatic organisms and was highest in SPRING. Although estrogenic potency of rainwater correlated with OC concentrations, the ER-CALUX responses could not be attributed to any particular pesticides. Besides, the contribution of non-analyzed xeno-estrogens as alkylphenol(-ethoxylates) and bisphenol-A to the estrogenic potency of rainwater could not be excluded. Further research should focus on the chemical identification of estrogenic compounds in rainwater. In addition, more attention should be given to the ecological consequences of atmospheric deposition of individual pesticides and of total toxic potencies that regularly exceed environmental criteria for Dutch surface waters and/or toxic threshold values for aquatic organisms.

40|$|Events in our {{external}} world are transformed into internal percepts and experiences. How can {{we begin to}} understand this transformation? It starts with the stimulation of peripheral sensory organs and ultimately requires the holistic synthesis of ensemble neural activity in the cortex. The cortex is composed of circuits connecting diverse types of neurons across various functional brain regions. In order to fully understand the cortical representation of an external stimulus, we must dissect out basic components of the circuit and characterize their stimulus response properties. We study neural circuits in primary olfactory (piriform) cortex of rodents using electrophysiological recordings in brain slices and in vivo. We examine the underlying synaptic mechanisms of odor representations, {{and how it can}} be modulated. First, we demonstrate an early developmental critical period for plasticity and structural changes in principal neurons of the olfactory cortex in response to sensory afferent activity. Next, we use in vivo recordings to demonstrate that synaptic inhibition is widely recruited by odor stimuli, whereas synaptic excitation is more selective in principal neurons. We show that the recruitment of both local interneurons as well as intracortical excitatory connections serve to shape odor-evoked synaptic activity. Synchronous beta (15 - 30 Hz) oscillations between the olfactory cortex and bulb are thought to be important for odor discrimination. We find that odor-evoked synaptic currents in principle cells of olfactory cortex are couple to beta frequency oscillations in the local field potential. A time window between oscillatory synaptic excitation and inhibition restricts the spike timing of odor-evoked spikes. Beta frequency oscillations have been shown to require a centrifugal feedback loop from olfactory cortex <b>back</b> to the <b>bulb.</b> We use an optogenetic approach to reveal that cortical feedback projections provide inhibition onto mitral cells in the olfactory bulb via activation of granule cells. This work establishes a framework to understand basic components of odor representations in olfactory cortex, and a role for cortico-bulbar feedback loop. In combination with work done in the visual, auditory, somatosensory and gustatory cortices, this study contributes to a more complete understanding of sensory information processing by cortical circuit...|$|R
