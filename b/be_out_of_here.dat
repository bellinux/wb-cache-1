5000|$|Vince Lombardi {{lead the}} Green Bay Packers as both {{head coach and}} general manager during the 1960s, where his efforts led the team to three {{straight}} and five total National Football League championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two Super Bowls following the 1966 and 1967 NFL seasons. Lombardi {{is considered by many}} to be one of the best and most successful coaches in Professional Football history. In 1960, even though color barrier still existed in the NFL, as the Redskins at that time still refused to play black players, Jack Vainisi, the Scouting Director for the Packers, and Lombardi were determined [...] "to ignore the prejudices then prevalent in most NFL front offices in their search for the most talented players." [...] Lombardi explained his views by saying that he [...] "... viewed his players as neither black nor white, but Packer green". Among professional football head coaches, Lombardi's view on discrimination was not de rigueur in the midst of the civil rights movement. An interracial relationship between one of the Packer rookies and a young woman was brought to the attention of Lombardi by Packer veterans in his first training camp in Green Bay. The next day at training camp, Lombardi, who had a zero tolerance policy towards racism, responded by warning his team that if any player exhibited prejudice, in any manner, then that player would be thrown off the team. Lombardi, who was vehemently opposed to Jim Crow discrimination, let it be known to all Green Bay establishments that if they did not accommodate his black players equally as well as his white players, then that business would be off-limits to the entire team. Before the start of the 1960 regular season, he instituted a policy that the Packers would only lodge in places that accepted all his players. In the all-white Oneida Golf and Riding Country club in Green Bay, of which Lombardi was a member, Lombardi demanded that he should be allowed to choose a Native American caddy, even if white caddies were available. Lombardi's view on racial matters was a result of his religious faith and the prejudice he had experienced as an Italian-American. While Lombardi was known to treat his players roughly in practices and during games, he insisted on unconditional respect for gay players and front office staff.
