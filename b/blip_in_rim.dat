30|$|From our results, a high titer of ~[*] 300  mg/L {{culture of}} {{secreted}} <b>BLIP</b> was achieved <b>in</b> P. pastoris. The recombinant BLIP {{was found to}} be highly pure (>[*] 90 %) in the culture medium and could be easily recovered by clarifying the culture medium by centrifugation. Compared with other approaches that utilize E. coli and B. subtilis expression system, giving several milligrams per L culture of BLIP (Albeck and Schreiber 1999; Petrosino et al. 1999; Reyonlds et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2004; Hu et al. 2016), our approach using Pichia for producing secretory BLIP showed a remarkable enhancement in the production yield of pure <b>BLIP.</b> <b>In</b> addition, secretory <b>BLIP</b> can be recovered directly from the culture supernatant, facilitating the downstream process for obtaining BLIP. Furthermore, since P. pastoris is favorable for fermentative growth due to capability to grow at high cell density (Olsen et al. 1996), the current system can be scale-up by fermentation to meet greater demands. The efficient production system of secretory BLIP using P. pastoris will be able to provide a promising supply of pure <b>BLIP</b> <b>in</b> large quantity, undoubtedly facilitating the study of BLIP and also the application of <b>BLIP</b> <b>in</b> pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology.|$|R

To meet the demands for considerable amount of highly pure BLIP, this study aimed at developing an efficient expression system in eukaryotic Pichia pastoris (a methylotrophic yeast) for production of BLIP. With methanol induction, recombinant <b>BLIP</b> was overexpressed <b>in</b> P. pastoris X- 33 and secreted into the culture medium. A high yield of ~[*] 300  mg/L culture secretory BLIP recovered from the culture supernatant without purification was found to be >[*] 90 % purity. The recombinant BLIP was fully active and showed an inhibition constant (Ki) for TEM- 1 β-lactamase (0.55 [*]±[*] 0.07  nM) comparable to that of the native S. clavuligerus-expressed BLIP (0.5  nM). Yeast-produced <b>BLIP</b> <b>in</b> combination with ampicillin effectively inhibited the growth of β-lactamase-producing Gram-positive Bacillus. Our approach of expressing secretory <b>BLIP</b> <b>in</b> P. pastoris gave 71 - to 1200 -fold more BLIP with high purity than the other conventional methods, allowing efficient production of large amount of highly pure BLIP, which merits fundamental science studies, drug development and biotechnological applications.|$|R

40|$|We use the {{hydrodynamic}} {{representation of}} the Gross -Pitaevskii/Nonlinear Schroedinger equation in order to analyze the dynamics of macroscopic tunneling process. We observe a tendency to a wave breaking and shock formation {{during the early stages}} of the tunneling process. A <b>blip</b> <b>in</b> the density distribution appears in the outskirts of the barrier and under proper conditions it may transform into a bright soliton. Our approach, based on the theory of shock formation in solutions of Burgers equation, allows us to find the parameters of the ejected blip (or soliton if formed) including the velocity of its propagation. The <b>blip</b> <b>in</b> the density is formed regardless of the value and sign of the nonlinearity parameter. However a soliton may be formed only if this parameter is negative (attraction) and large enough. A criterion is proposed. An ejection of a soliton is also observed numerically. We demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, controlled formation of soliton through tunneling. The mass of the ejected soliton is controlled by the initial state.
