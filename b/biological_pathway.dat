With the advent of high-throughput functional genomic techniques, {{it is now possible}} to infer <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> and pathway organization in a systematic way by integrating disparate biological information. Results: Here, we propose a novel integrated approach that uses network topology to predict <b>biological</b> <b>pathways.</b> We integrated four types of biological evidence (protein–protein interaction, genetic interaction, domain–domain interaction and semantic similarity of Gene Ontology terms) to generate a functionally associated network. This network was then used to develop a new pathway finding algorithm to predict <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> in yeast. Our approach discovered 195 <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> and 31 functionally redundant pathway pairs in yeast. By comparing our identified pathways to three public pathway databases (KEGG, BioCyc and Reactome), we observed that our approach achieves a maximum positive predictive value of 12. 8 % and improves on other predictive approaches. This study allows us to reconstruct <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> and delineates cellular machinery in a systematic view.

40|$|Abstract Background Biological systems {{process the}} genetic {{information}} and environmental signals through pathways. How {{to map the}} pathways systematically and efficiently from high-throughput genomic and proteomic data is a challenging open problem. Previous methods design different heuristics but do not describe explicitly the behaviours of the information flow. Results In this study, we propose new concepts of dissipation, saturation and direction to decipher the information flow behaviours in the pathways and thereby infer the <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> from a given source to its target. This model takes into account explicitly the common features of the information transmission and provides a general framework to model the <b>biological</b> <b>pathways.</b> It can incorporate different types of bio-molecular interactions to infer the signal transduction pathways and interpret the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associations. The model is formulated as a linear programming problem and thus is solved efficiently. Experiments on the real data of yeast indicate that the reproduced pathways are highly consistent with the current knowledge. Conclusions Our model explicitly treats the <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> as information flows with dissipation, saturation and direction. The effective applications suggest that the three new concepts may be valid to describe the organization rules of <b>biological</b> <b>pathways.</b> The deduced linear programming should be a promising tool to infer the various <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> from the high-throughput data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Systems {{biology is}} an {{emerging}} multi-disciplinary {{field in which}} the behaviour of complex biological systems is studied by considering the interaction of all cellular and molecular constituents rather than using a "traditional" reductionist approach where constituents are studied individually.

To support systems biology, a large number of <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> are being derived for many different organisms, and these are stored in various databases. There is a lack of and need for algorithms for analysis of <b>biological</b> <b>pathways.</b> Here, a thesis is proposed where three related methods are developed for semantic analysis of <b>biological</b> <b>pathways</b> utilising the Gene Ontology. It is believed that the methods will be useful to biologists in order to assess the biological plausibility of derived pathways, compare different pathways for semantic similarities, and to derive hypothetical pathways that are semantically similar to documented <b>biological</b> <b>pathways.</b> To our knowledge, all methods are novel, and will therefore extend the bioinformatics toolbox that biologists can use to make new biological discoveries...|$|R
