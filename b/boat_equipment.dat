It emerged that DUKW amphibious vehicles could not enter the river, so the assault had to be carried out with powered storm boats, until 260 Fd Co had bulldozed ramps in the river bank. 553rd and 204th Fd Companies began work on the bridge after an approach had been bulldozed under intense machine gun and mortar fire.

The original site was near Rees, but this had not been cleared by morning and on 24 March all that could be done was some work on the approaches and to send an officer's patrol across to reconnoitre the proposed exits. Next morning it was decided to move the bridge to a site downstream near Honnopel. Work started at 09.30 on 25 March, shielded by a smokescreen, and the bridge opened for traffic at midnight.

40|$|International audienceThe {{exclusive}} use of renewable energies is today an essential nautical concern. Nowadays, the onboard energy generation comes mainly from diesel oil, {{which is in}} user mind the simplest way. Our objective {{is to develop a}} self-adaptive management system of the onboard energy in order to change the user mind. We introduce models for energy production, storage and consumption that fit with the yachting environment, which is mobile and not as predictable as the home automation case. These models are combined within a configurable simulator. This simulator can handle user’s <b>boat</b> <b>equipment,</b> reproduce sailing conditions and so help to validate the models and to study different management strategies. This first step is necessary to develop a smart system able to manage sailing energy in order to answer the main issue: assuring safety and optimizing comfort according to user demands...|$|E
