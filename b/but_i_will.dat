25|$|Shakespeare {{had several}} of his male {{characters}} address female characters as goddesses, including Demetrius to Helena in A Midsummer Night's Dream ("O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!"), Berowne to Rosaline in Love's Labour's Lost ("A woman I forswore; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee"), and Bertram to Diana in All's Well That Ends Well. Pisanio also compares Imogen to a goddess to describe her composure under duress in Cymbeline.|$|E
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E

I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to do in my entire life.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{had picked}} a fight shrewdly, as the busmen had no allies amongst the other unions. Ernest Bevin or Arthur Deakin {{would not have}} allowed such a strike, but Cousins felt {{compelled}} to support it, and Opposition leader Hugh Gaitskell criticised the government in a speech at Glasgow. Gaitskell moved a motion of censure over Macleod's treatment of the strike. Macleod had recently demanded more debates on industrial relations but in his Commons speech of 8 May now criticised the opposition for demanding one. He moved the house to laugh at Gaitskell by quoting the line of “Mr Marx, of whom I am a devoted follower – Groucho, not Karl” “Sir, I never forget a face, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> make an exception for yours”. He {{then moved on to}} a blistering attack on Gaitskell, including the declaration that “I cannot conceal the scorn and contempt for the part that the Leader of the Opposition has played in this.” He was discreetly congratulated afterwards by the Labour frontbencher Alf Robens. Roy Jenkins describes his attack on Gaitskell as “high order jugular debating”, accusing Gaitskell of weak leadership in appeasing the militants of his own party and attacking him for refusing to endorse the findings of the arbitration tribunal.|$|E
500|$|... y friends, {{will you}} not agree that any society which begins to be {{doubtful}} of itself; {{in which one}} man looks at another and says: [...] "He may be a traitor," [...] in which that spirit has disappeared which says: [...] "I will not accept that, I will not believe that—I will demand proof. I will not say of my brother {{that he may be}} a traitor," [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> say, [...] "Produce what you have. I will judge it fairly, and if he is, he shall pay the penalties; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not take it on rumor. I will not take it on hearsay. I will remember that what has brought us up from savagery is a loyalty to truth, and truth cannot emerge unless it is subjected to the utmost scrutiny"—will you not agree that a society which has lost sight of that, cannot survive? ...|$|E

500|$|Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee {{was arrested}} in Portland, Oregon. He {{had been accused of}} {{treating}} Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee admitted it was true. [...] "I fixed Sharkey up to look {{as if he had been}} fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair." ...|$|E

500|$|Richard Cantillon {{amassed a}} great fortune from his speculation, buying Mississippi Company shares early {{and selling them}} at {{inflated}} prices. Cantillon's financial success and growing influence caused friction in his relationship with John Law, and sometime thereafter Law threatened to imprison Cantillon if the latter did not leave France within twenty-four hours. Cantillon replied: [...] "I shall not go away; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> make your system succeed." [...] To that end, in 1718 Law, Cantillon, and wealthy speculator Joseph Gage formed a private company centred on financing further speculation in North American real estate.|$|E
500|$|For {{the rest}} of the film, Chris Corbould, the special effects and {{miniature}} effects supervisor, returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, [...] "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go". Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.|$|E
500|$|At dawn on {{the morning}} of 6 November 1914, in cold, foggy and bleak weather, Lody was fetched from his cell by the Assistant Provost-Marshal, Lord Athlumney.

[...] A small {{procession}} formed up for the short journey to the rifle range, comprising Lody and his armed escort, the Tower's Chaplain and the eight-man firing squad. John Fraser, one of the Yeoman Warders, witnessed it and later described it: ...|$|E

[...] On 30 June, Del Piero wrote an open letter to the Juventus fans thanking them for almost two decades of support, stating, [...] "Above all what remains is the fans, you who are Juventus. That jersey that I loved and will always love, that I desired and respected... From {{tomorrow}} I will no longer be a Juventus player, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> always be one of you.

[...] Commenting on hiring Banksy to create the titles, Jean joked, [...] "This {{is what you get}} when you outsource." [...] Although conceding to the fact that The Simpsons is largely animated in South Korea, Jean went on to state that the scenes shown in titles are [...] "very fanciful, far-fetched.

500|$|They {{arrived in}} Palermo on 20 July, and Murphy was sidelined by illness for a week. Allied {{capture of the}} transit port of Messina was crucial to taking Sicily from the Axis. En route there, Company B was {{assigned}} to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of}} the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello. The Axis began their evacuation of Messina on 27 July. Although the 3rd Infantry Division's 7th Infantry Regiment secured the port on 17 August, the Axis had already completed their evacuation hours before. During the fighting in Sicily, Murphy became realistic about military duty: [...] "I have seen war as it actually is, and I do not like it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> go on fighting." ...|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{was soon}} closely engaged with the French, {{breaking}} through the enemy line and closing with Aigle. As with the other French ships in the fleet, Aigle's rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on Bellerophon and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied [...] "It {{is too late to}} take them off. I see my situation, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> die like a man".|$|E
500|$|The common starling's {{gift for}} mimicry {{has long been}} recognised. In the medieval Welsh Mabinogion, Branwen tamed a common starling, [...] "taught it words", and sent it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brothers, Bran and Manawydan, who then sailed from Wales to Ireland to rescue her. Pliny the Elder claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole {{sentences}} in Latin and Greek, and in Henry IV, William Shakespeare had Hotspur declare [...] "The king forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> find him when he is asleep, and in his ear I'll holler 'Mortimer!'
