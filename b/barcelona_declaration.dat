40|$|Purpose - This paper {{sets out}} to discuss the commonalities {{that can be found}} in {{learning}} outcomes (LOs) for education for sustainable development {{in the context of the}} Tbilisi and <b>Barcelona</b> <b>declarations.</b> The commonalities include systemic or holistic thinking, the integration of different perspectives, skills such as critical thinking, change agent abilities and communication, and finally different attitudes and values. Design/methodology/approach - An analysis of LOs that are proposed in the Tbilisi and <b>Barcelona</b> <b>declarations</b> is conducted, showing specific issues for the commonalities presented. Examples of LOs from Instituto TecnolÃ³gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) in Mexico, as well as various associations from the USA is shown. A brief discussion is done on the means to achieve these LOs and learning evaluation. Findings - In the example sets of LOs shown, the commonalities presented in the paper's first section appear in the LOs proposed by the institutions. Based on current knowledge and perception, sustainability is properly addressed in the examples. Practical implications - The paper can be used to foster a wider discussion and analysis of LOs for sustainability education, also further work on teachers' capacity building for sustainability, as well as the assessment needed for future professionals in higher education institutions. Originality/value - The paper presents the onset of discussing and comparing commonalities among higher education institutions regarding sustainability LOs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} EU-Turkey Relations {{in the context}} of the Barcelona Process (BP), from the launch of the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Declaration</b> of 1995 up to 2002, and {{examines}} to what extent the BP is effective in the framework of the Ell's Mediterranean Policy as it concerns Turkey. After making a brief introduction to the subject, in Chapter I it gives infonnation about the historical background of the BP by stressing the importance of the Mediterranean basin and the European CommunitylUnion's approach to the Mediterranean from 1960 s until today. Chapter II examines Turkey in the framework of the Mediterranean Policy by giving the evolution of EU-Turkey relations since the Cold War. Chapter III analyses the objectives of the EU in the BP as they concern Turkey, first by comparing European, American and Turkish perceptions of security and cooperation in the Mediterranean in the post-Cold War period, then by explaining the structure of the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Declaration</b> and Turkey's position in this structure. Chapter IV examines whether the EU reached its objectives mentioned in the previous chapter. It mainly argues that due to some problems, the EU could not reach its aims laid down in the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Declaration.</b> Chapter V analyses Turkish perceptions of Mediterranean security and cooperation in the Barcelona Process by emphasising that Turkey is not enthusiastic toward the Euro-Mediterranean Process. Chapter VI examines the BP in detail from the point of view of Turkish foreign policies. Chapter VII analyses the EU's policy towards Turkey and Turkey's policy towards the EU in the Process. It also argues that, although the Helsinki Summit in December 1999 provided a turning point in EU-Turkey relations by recognising Turkey as a candidate for accession, this could not help the BP to become an effective process for Turkey. This thesis ends with a Conclusion, explaining why the BP is an ineffective project for both Turkey and the EU and giving some suggestions and recommendations towards making it an effective and sustainable multilateral process.

40|$|The Mediterranean {{policy of}} the European Union (EU) is in crisis. Ever more experts stress the {{importance}} of a interrelation of the three –economic, political and social– pillars of the <b>Barcelona</b> <b>Declaration.</b> Thus far, these three baskets have always been treated separately. This paper analyzes the relationship and causality among these three pillars and the strategy the EU is pursuing toward the so-called Non-Community Mediterranean Countries (NCMC). Based on a synthesis of the concepts of “perpetual peace” from Kant and of the “security community” from K. W.
