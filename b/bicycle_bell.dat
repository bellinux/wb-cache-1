60|$|Presently I became {{certain that}} my {{instincts}} had not deceived me, for I heard the quick {{sound of a}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>bell.</b> This was odd, for surely no one would ring {{for me to get}} out of the way. Then there was another tinkle, a little nearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd half a mind then {{to throw}} the stuff away, or drink it myself; it seemed a piece of bally nonsense, giving good ale to a four-year-old pony; but the moment the beggar smelt the bowl he reached out his head, and lapped it up as though he'd been a Christian; and I jumped into the cart and started off, amid cheers. We got up the hill pretty steady. Then the liquor began to work into his head. I've taken home a drunken man more than once and there's pleasanter jobs than that. I've seen a drunken woman, and they're worse. But a drunken Welsh pony I never want to have {{anything}} more to do with so long as I live. Having four legs he managed to hold himself up; but as to guiding himself, he couldn't; and as for letting me do it, he wouldn't. First we were one side of the road, and then we were the other. When we were not either side, we were crossways in the middle. I heard a <b>bicycle</b> <b>bell</b> behind me, but I dared not turn my head. All I could do was to shout to the fellow to keep where he was.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>bicycle</b> <b>bell</b> is a percussive {{signaling}} instrument {{mounted on}} a bicycle for warning pedestrians and other cyclists. The bell is a required piece of equipment in some jurisdictions. They are usually mounted on the handlebars and thumb activated. The <b>bicycle</b> <b>bell</b> was invented by John Richard Dedicoat, and patents for bicycle bells {{appear as early as}} 1877. [...] The most common bells are actuated by a thumb-operated lever that is geared to rapidly rotate two loosely slung metal discs inside the bell housing. Said discs repeatedly rattle and strike the bell to produce a sound not unlike that of an electric bell. Simpler types also exist, with a spring-mounted external clapper that produces a [...] "ding-ding" [...] sound when the clapper is pulled with a finger and released.|$|E
50|$|He was {{particularly}} appreciated for the revolutionary innovation of incorporating {{the sounds of}} non-orchestral instruments {{like that of a}} jaw harp or a harmonica, everyday noises (like the tick-tock of a clock, the ring of a <b>bicycle</b> <b>bell</b> or the ticking sound of typewriters in Rome 11:00) in a musical score, with the purpose to underline some particular film scenes.|$|E
50|$|The Ffilharmonious Jug Band was an Anglo-American Jug band {{group in}} England {{in the late}} 1960s. Members were American Jeff Wilson (Guitar, Slide whistle, Washtub bass, Jug, Kazoo, Mandolin, and vocals), American Jim Johnson (Banjo, Guitar, Dobro, percussion, Kazoo, Hand trumpet, Harp, Phonofiddle, Jug, Washtub bass, and vocals), Briton Doug Kyle (Guitar, Harp, Kazoo, Jug, Banjo, and vocals), and Canadian, Pete Ballan (Washboard, spoons, Kazoo, Souzazoo, Door bell, <b>Bicycle</b> <b>bell,</b> cymbals, Sanding blocks, and vocals).|$|E
50|$|In mixed martial arts, an {{air horn}} is {{commonly}} used to signal {{the end of a}} round as opposed to the bell used in boxing and professional wrestling. For outdoor activities like hiking, hunting, cross-country skiing, canoeing, fishing, an air horn can be handy to frighten away unwanted or aggressive wildlife, signalling for help and to announce one's location. Bicyclists occasionally use this type of horn, since it yields a louder warning sound than traditional <b>bicycle</b> <b>bells</b> or bulb reed horns.|$|R
5000|$|Klapheck's {{subjects}} {{through the}} years have included (in order of introduction) typewriters, sewing machines, water taps and showers, telephones, irons, shoes, keys, saws, car tires, <b>bicycle</b> <b>bells</b> and clocks. Influenced by Duchamp, Man Ray, and Max Ernst, Klapheck's [...] "ironic treatment of everyday mechanics" [...] prefigures Pop art in its magnification of the trivial. Between 1992 and 2002, he has painted friends, colleagues, and celebrities from the international art scene. He became {{a professor at the}} Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1979.|$|R
50|$|In Pet Sounds, Wilson {{conceived}} of experimental arrangements which combine conventional rock set-ups with various exotic instruments, producing new sounds {{with a rich}} texture reminiscent of symphonic works layered underneath meticulous vocal harmonics. Many of those instruments were alien to rock music, including glockenspiel, ukulele, accordion, Electro-Theremin, bongos, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, trombone, Coca-Cola bottles, and other odd sounds such as barking dogs, trains, and <b>bicycle</b> <b>bells.</b> This kind of selection was stylistically appropriated {{from a wide variety}} of cultures, with some relating it to exotica and its associated producers Martin Denny, Les Baxter, and Esquivel.|$|R
5000|$|A {{technical}} flaw {{suggests that}} it would be almost impossible to shoot different men of different heights in the heart with a fixed <b>bicycle</b> <b>bell.</b> This can be countered by the assumption that although not stated, all men were of similar heights; the assailant adjusted the bell and practiced shooting before actually attempting, or that the bell was fixed {{to the front of the}} bicycle with a gauge to determine the height of the victim.|$|E
50|$|Byomkesh {{jumped on}} the assailant and thus his sting {{operation}} was successful in nabbing the culprit who {{was none other than}} Prafulla Roy. But before the police arrived, he was successful in committing suicide by eating a poisoned betel leaf. His only regret before dying was that he had not taken Byomkesh more seriously and had thus fallen prey to the trap Byomkesh had set for him. Byomkesh was awarded by the Metropolitan Police and received a check for two thousand rupees from Mr Mitra. However, he did have to relinquish the <b>bicycle</b> <b>bell</b> which had a spring action mechanism for shooting the gramophone pins while masking the noise with the ringing of the bell.|$|E
5000|$|... "High Hopes" [...] is the {{eleventh}} and final track from the 1994 Pink Floyd album The Division Bell, composed by David Gilmour with lyrics by Gilmour and Polly Samson. Its lyrics {{speak of the}} things one may have gained and lost in life, written from Gilmour's autobiographic perspective. Gilmour {{has said that the}} song is more about his early days, and leaving his hometown behind, than about the seeds of division supposedly planted in Pink Floyd's early days. Douglas Adams, a friend of Gilmour, chose the album title from one verse in this song. Live versions are featured on Pulse, Remember That Night and Live in Gdańsk. On Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, a somewhat shortened version of the song segues into Syd Barrett's [...] "Bike". The segue is accomplished by cutting from the church bell at the end of [...] "High Hopes" [...] to a new <b>bicycle</b> <b>bell</b> sound effect before [...] "Bike" [...] begins. A 7-inch vinyl version of the single was released on a transparent record.|$|E
50|$|The {{song was}} written by Mercury and was {{inspired}} by watching the 18th stage of the 1978 Tour de France passing Montreux where the band were recording Jazz in the Mountain Studios. It starts with a chorus unaccompanied by instruments. The chorus is followed by two verses connected with a bridge, both followed by a chorus. Around {{the middle of the}} song there is a solo played with numerous <b>bicycle</b> <b>bells.</b> The song has an unusual chord progression with numerous modulations, a change of metre (from 4/4 to 6/8) in the bridge, and multitracked vocal and guitar harmonies.|$|R
25|$|Wilson {{conceived}} of experimental arrangements that combined conventional rock set-ups with various exotic instruments, producing new sounds {{with a rich}} texture reminiscent of symphonic works layered underneath meticulous vocal harmonics. In total, the number of unique instruments used for each track average to about a dozen. Many of those instruments were alien to rock music, including glockenspiel, ukulele, accordion, Electro-Theremin, bongos, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, trombone, Coca-Cola bottles, and other odd sounds such as barking dogs, trains, and <b>bicycle</b> <b>bells.</b> This kind of selection was stylistically appropriated {{from a wide variety}} of cultures, with some relating it to exotica and its associated producers Martin Denny, Les Baxter, and Esquivel.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966, the Beach Boys {{formally}} {{established their}} use of unconventional instruments and elaborate layers of vocal harmonies on their album Pet Sounds. It is considered Brian's most concise demonstration of his production and songwriting expertise. With songs such as [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice" [...] and [...] "Sloop John B", the album's innovative soundscape incorporates elements of jazz, classical, pop, exotica, and the avant-garde. The instrumentation combines found sounds such as <b>bicycle</b> <b>bells</b> and dog whistles with classically inspired orchestrations and the usual rock set-up of drums and guitars; among others, silverware, accordions, plucked piano strings, barking dogs, and plastic water jugs. For the basic rhythmic feel for [...] "God Only Knows", harpsichord, piano with slapback echo, sleigh bells, and strings spilled into each other to create a rich blanket of sound.|$|R
