25|$|George W. Bush {{had become}} {{increasingly}} unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around 30 percent. In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, but Bush {{did not make}} a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav. Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed {{in an interview that he}} voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> office.|$|E

500|$|In April 2013, <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> {{attendance}} {{at a news}} conference, where she said the recently built George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum was not a monument for her husband but instead {{a representation of the}} White House and the struggles of America during his tenure. She also mentioned not having trouble donating clothes to the library, admitting that she probably would have never worn them again in the first place. That month it was announced that she would serve as a keynote speaker for the 2013 Global Business Travel Association Convention in August. At the convention, she stressed the importance of child literacy, continuing her advocating of an issue that she had become associated with since her tenure as First Lady. In early August 2013, she reported that her husband was in stable condition after having a stent implanted in his heart, calling it [...] "terrific" [...] that it was caught in time, and stressed the importance of regular check ups with doctors. In September, she appeared at a fundraiser for the organization Solutions for Change.|$|E

2500|$|President <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> office January 2001-January 2009, {{a complex}} and {{challenging}} economic and budgetary time. In addition to two recessions (2001 and the Great Recession of 2007-2009), the U.S. faced a housing bubble and bust, two wars, {{and the rise of}} Asian competitors, mainly China, which entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1925 season, veteran Detroit {{sports writer}} Sam Greene was {{ebullient}} in his praise for Tavener's defensive performance:"The midget from Fort Worth proceeded to show Detroit fans the flashiest work at shortstop they had seen since Donie <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his prime. [...] He cut off base hit after base hit, going now far to his right side and now to his left. [...] When occasion demanded, he roamed into left field for fly balls that previously had gone for base hits. [...] While Tavener was a light hitter, his defensive skill more than off-set his weakness on attack. Detroit [...] [...] [...] needed someone to discourage the offense of the opposition. [...] Tavener did that as few young infielders have ever done it." ...|$|E

Bricken wrote: [...] "You already {{understand that this}} is a Training Category G, Pay Group None, Reserve Section MM proposition." [...] As an obligated Reservist, <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Training Category [...] "fA", which required a minimum of 48 periods of inactive duty training, and 15 days of active duty training, and was required to remain in that Training Category. Training Category [...] "G" [...] offered no training at all. According to Air Force regulations (AFM 35-3, paragraph 14-6), being in [...] "Training Category A" [...] meant that [...] "If a member...will be unable to further train with his unit because of an impending change of residence,...he is required to sign a statement that he has been counseled." [...] That counseling included notifying Bush of his obligation to find a new unit with which he could fulfill his training obligations.|$|E
2500|$|This {{alliance}} between the U.S. and Brazil generated some negative reactions. While <b>Bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> São Paulo {{as part of the}} 2007 Latin American tour, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, from Buenos Aires, dismissed the ethanol plan as [...] "a crazy thing" [...] and accused the U.S. of trying [...] "to substitute the production of foodstuffs for animals and human beings with the production of foodstuffs for vehicles, to sustain the American way of life." [...] Chavez' complaints were quickly followed by then Cuban President Fidel Castro, who wrote that [...] "you will see how many people among the hungry masses of our planet will no longer consume corn." [...] "Or even worse," [...] he continued, [...] "by offering financing to poor countries to produce ethanol from corn or any other kind of food, no tree will be left to defend humanity from climate change."' Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua's President, and one of the preferential recipients of Brazil technical aid, said that [...] "we reject the gibberish of those who applaud Bush's totally absurd proposal, which attacks the food security rights of Latin Americans and Africans, who are major corn consumers", however, he voiced support for sugar cane based ethanol during Lula's visit to Nicaragua.|$|E

6000|$|THE 22nd July was a grand {{trial of}} temper to our little party. The {{position}} of Bir Abbas exactly {{resembles that of}} Al-Hamra, except that the bulge of the hill-girt Fiumara is at this place about two miles wide. There are the usual stone-forts and palm-leaved hovels for the troopers, stationed here to hold the place and to escort travellers, with a coffee-shed, and a hut or two, called a bazar, but no village. Our encamping ground was a bed of loose sand, with which the violent Samum filled the air; not a tree or a <b>bush</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> sight; a species of hardy locust and swarms of flies were the only remnants of animal life: the scene was a caricature of Sind. Although we were now some hundred feet, {{to judge by the}} water-shed, above the level of the sea, the mid-day sun scorched even through the tent; our frail tenement was more than once blown down, and the heat of the sand made the work of repitching it painful. Again my companions, after breakfasting, hurried to the coffee-house, and returned one after the other with dispiriting reports. Then they either quarrelled desperately about nothing, or they threw themselves on their rugs, pretending to sleep in very sulkiness. The lady Maryam soundly rated her surly son for refusing to fill her chibuk for the twelfth time that morning, with the usual religious phrases, [...] "Allah direct thee into the right way, O my son!"-meaning {{that he was going to}} the bad, and [...] "O my calamity, thy mother is a lone woman, O Allah!"-equivalent to the ...|$|E
