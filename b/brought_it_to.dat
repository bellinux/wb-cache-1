5|$|Gaveston's {{body was}} simply left behind {{at the site}} of his execution. One chronicle tells of how four shoemakers <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Warwick, who refused to accept it, and ordered them to take it back outside his jurisdiction. Eventually, a group of Dominican friars <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Oxford. A proper burial could not be {{arranged}} while Gaveston was still excommunicate, and it was not until 2 January 1315, after the King had secured a papal absolution for his favourite, that he could have his body buried in an elaborate ceremony at the Dominican foundation of King's Langley Priory; the tomb is now lost. In 1823, a cross with inscription was erected at Blacklow Hill by local squire, Bertie Greathead, at the place believed to be the location of Gaveston's execution.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was brought to Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence. After his death it was {{probably}} bought by Piero Strozzi, an Italian military leader, for Catherine de' Medici. Catherine <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> France {{as part of her}} dowry, and from the Bourbon royal library it came to rest in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. The manuscript was bound in 1602.|$|E

5|$|Dreyer {{shot and}} edited {{the film in}} France and then <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Berlin where it was post-synchronized in both German and French. Dreyer did the audio work at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound {{equipment}} available {{to him at the}} time. Most of the actors did not dub their own voices. The only voices of the actors that are their own in the film are of Schmitz and Gunzburg. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were fake and were done by professional imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film's score and worked with Dreyer to develop the music.|$|E
5|$|During the film's pre-production, Schliessler was {{inspired}} by British-American photojournalist Tim Hetherington's war photography book Infidel, which details a single U.S. platoon assigned to an outpost in the Korengal Valley {{during the war in}} Afghanistan. The book's images became a guide to creating the overall look of the film after Schliessler had shown them to Berg, as well as the art and costume departments. Prior to filming, Schleissler and Berg shot test footage with the digital cameras and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> digital colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld at post-production facility Company 3 for color grading.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's victory {{earned it}} the 1999 BCS {{national}} championship {{and brought the}} Seminoles' season to an end with an undefeated 120 record. By beginning the season at No.1 and ending {{it in the same}} position, Florida State became the first college football team to stay ranked No.1 for every week of the season after being ranked No. 1 in the preseason poll. Virginia Tech's loss <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a final record of 111, but the Hokies still completed their first 11-win season in school history. The 75total points scored in the 2000 Sugar Bowl were a Sugar Bowl record at that point in the game's history.|$|E

The win ensured Georgia Tech's first {{outright}} conference championship since 1990, and {{as a reward for}} winning the conference, Georgia Tech received a spot in the 2010 Orange Bowl, a Bowl Championship Series game. In that game, the Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the Yellow Jackets, 24–14. Clemson also was selected to participate in a postseason bowl game. The Music City Bowl, played in Nashville, Tennessee, selected the Tigers to play against the Kentucky Wildcats. In that game, the Tigers defeated the Wildcats, 21–13.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned {{of the dangers of}} asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as they were allowed to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, screenwriter Chris Gerolmo {{discovered}} {{an article that}} excerpted a chapter from the book Inside Hoover's F.B.I., which chronicled the FBI's investigation into the murders of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner. While writing a draft script, Gerolmo <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Frederick Zollo, who had produced Gerolmo's first screenplay Miles from Home (1988). Zollo helped Gerolmo develop the original draft before they sold it to Orion Pictures. The studio then began its search for a director to helm the project. Filmmakers Miloš Forman and John Schlesinger were among those considered to helm the project.|$|E

5|$|Leonard's Bakery is a Portuguese bakery in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{known for}} popularizing the malasada. The fried pastry, {{slightly}} crispier and chewier than a doughnut {{and with no}} hole, {{is known as a}} cuisine of Hawaii. Though Portuguese immigrants brought the malasada to Hawaii {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, Leonard's opened in 1952 and <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a wider audience. Leonard's is a household name in Hawaii and is well known in the continental United States and internationally. A franchise location opened in Japan in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Producer Nancy Tenenbaum {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the short film. After she sent a copy of the original film to several people of interest, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh replied that he was interested and that he wanted to direct a remake. He <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the attention of Universal Studios who initially declined but subsequently optioned {{the rights to the}} film in 1995. Soderbergh took on the project but then dropped it when he got involved with Out of Sight.|$|E

5|$|A {{cluster of}} {{thunderstorms}} developed over Florida in late May. A shortwave trough <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, enhancing convection around a developing center of circulation. The low pressure area, which formed on May31, {{developed into a}} subtropical depression on June1. Operationally, it {{was treated as a}} frontal low, but post-analysis suggested it remained separate throughout its lifetime, and was classified as an unnamed subtropical storm. It reached subtropical storm strength six hours later as it moved rapidly parallel to the East Coast of the United States. The convection continued to wrap around the center, and despite unfavorable conditions from an approaching cold front it continued to intensify. Late on June1, it reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h) while off the coast of North Carolina. The storm turned to the east, and transitioned extratropical late on June2 southeast of Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter, the remnants of the storm merged with a cold front.|$|E
5|$|An {{ill-defined}} tropical wave {{entered the}} eastern Pacific on August1 and steadily organized to attain tropical depression intensity eight days later. Within {{an environment of}} light shear, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Flossie at 0000UTC on August9 and continued to organize to attain Category1 hurricane intensity by 1200UTC the following day as an eye became apparent on satellite. Continuing westward and crossing into the central Pacific basin, the system began a period of rapid intensification that <b>brought</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> its peak intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 949mb (hPa; 28.03inHg) at 0000UTC on September12, while positioned roughly 980mi (1575km) east-southeast of the Big Island. Increased wind shear the next day caused Flossie to begin a slow weakening trend thereafter; at 1200UTC on September14, the system weakened to a Category2 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on September15, the cyclone was barely a Category1 hurricane. Six hours later, it weakened to a tropical storm as the low-level center became exposed on satellite. Flossie weakened to a tropical depression early on September16 and dissipated by 1800UTC.|$|E
5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva.

The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E
