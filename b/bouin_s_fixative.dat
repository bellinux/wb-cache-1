40|$|Background: By {{the respect}} of some {{difficulties}} that were produced by high population we must have some information about methods that can control population. Materials and methods: In this investigation the effects of Achillea millefolium L. extract on spermatogenesis in adult Balb/ C mice were studied. The alcoholic (ethanolic) exract of flowers was prepared. The lethal (LD 50) and sublethal dose was determined 1. 7 g/kg/bw and 1. 2 g/kg/bw respectively and it was injected to the 28 - 32 g mice for 5 days. Inspite of experimental group we used intact and sham (received only vehicle) groups. The mice were sacrificed under light ether anesthesia {{two weeks after the}} last dose. Blood samples were taken. The testes and epididymis wer excised, weighed and fixed in <b>Bouin</b> <b>s</b> <b>fixative.</b> The tissues were prepared for histological experiments. Results: In this investigation no difference significant in body weight or in testis weight, volume and diameter was seen. Microscopic studies of testis showed a significant reduction in primary spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoa but no changes in seminiferous tubules diameter, Sertoli and Leydig cells were seen (P< 0. 05). Histological examination of seminiferous tubules revealed a general dearrangement and severe reducation in the number of germinal cells. Apoptosis was seen in seminiferous tubules. Many immature spermatids were visualized in the lumem of the ductus epididymides of treated animals. This was accompained by a concomitant reduction in the levels of the LH and testosterone. Conclusion: The results of this work suggest that the extract of this plant may have a temporary antifertile activity in adult male animals...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{the improvement in}} lung function after prenatal hormone exposure coincided with changes in lung morphometry or in collagen and elastin content. Fetal lambs received a single intramuscular injection of betamethasone (0. 5 mg/kg) plus L-thyroxine (T- 4) (15 mu g/kg) or vehicle control 48 h before delivery at 121, 128, or 135 d gestational age (d 121, d 128, d 135, term = 150 d). T- 4 was administered in conjunction with betamethasone {{in an attempt to}} enhance the maturational response. The right-upper lobes were instillation fixed at 30 cm H 2 O by Karnovsky 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fixative</b> after a 40 -min period of mechanical ventilation. A number of significant changes occurred between d 121 and d 135 in control animals: alveolar airspace volume increased by 270...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} methylparathion (MPT), a potent insecticide, on the {{reproductive}} {{system of the}} male frog Hoplobaprachus rugulosus was investigated. Male frogs aged 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 months old were exposed to 20 ppm of MPT for 60 days. At {{the end of the}} experiment, animals were sacrificed. Plasma samples were collected and kept at- 200 C until undergoing a testosterone radioimmunoassay. Testes were fixed in <b>Bouin,</b> <b>s</b> solution for histological study. Plasma testosterone levels decreased 10. 50 %, 15. 94 %, 17. 68 %, 29. 05 %, 19. 18 % and 27. 12 % in frogs autopsied at the ages of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months, respectively. Microscopy studies showed that MPT directly injured leydig cells and affected their cell structure. The histological alterations of leydig cells in all exposed frogs included hydropic swelling, pyknotic nuclei, karyolysis, nuclear membrane disruption and vacuolated interstitial tissue. The gonadosomatic index percentage (GSI%) showed a correlation with the plasma testosterone levels in the frog at the ages of 10, 12 and 14 months old. It is concluded that the effect of MPT on the reproductiv...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{morphology}} of the olfactory sensilla on the antennae of {{the mosquito}} Aedesaegypti (L.) has been described, however {{little is known}} about the fate of odour molecules once they have been adsorbed onto the surfaces of sensilla. A stimulus-conducting system of pores, pore kettles, and pore tubules has been described for the sensillatrichodea (olfactory hairs) of several insects but not mosquitoes. Scanning electron microscopy was used to identify the s. trichodea of Ae. aegypti and to attempt visualization of their pore openings. Chemical fixation, cryopreparation, freeze drying, and negative staining, with high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), were used to locate putative stimulus-conductingstructures associated with the pores. TEM sections using Dalton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fixative</b> or freeze drying showed pores and pore tubules, whereas pore tubules were poorly preserved in cryoprepared sections. The putative stimulus-conductingstructures were clearly demonstrated by negative staining of whole sensilla which was quick and easy. The current hypothesis of olfactory stimulus conduction is extended to include Ae. aegypti...|$|R
40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} is a non-invasive and non-destructive {{tool that}} has been widely applied in Agricultural and Bio-system Engineering field. It provides a unique 2 ̆ 2 fingerprint 2 ̆ 2 to different chemical, and structural, information at molecular level. Acquisition of Raman spectrum requires a relatively short collecting time and minimum sample preparation, which makes Raman spectroscopy an attractive method for characterizing biological samples. Since retina is the most exposed part of the central nervous system, irregular protein transformation, or accumulation caused by diseases, {{can be found at}} an early time in this area. Because of this reason, Raman spectroscopy is often utilized to analyze samples from specific layers in retina to detect certain diseases, such as glaucoma, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, and Prion related diseases at early stages. In order to have a better preservation of tissue architecture and longer storage time, collected retina samples are commonly first fixed by chemical fixative. Typical fixatives include: Modified Davidson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fixative,</b> <b>Bouin</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fixative,</b> Ethanol fixative or conventional Formalin fixative. After fixation, samples are then embedded with paraffin to allow for fine sectioning. Every fixating protocol has different ingredients, and there is no universal fixative that is ideal for all the tissue types. Since fixation introduces chemical modification to the tissue samples, {{it is important to understand}} what changes it may cause to the Raman spectroscopic characterization of the tissue samples. For best result, four fixation methods are studied and analyzed in this research. The purpose is to identify a mathematical methodology which can be used to remove the background noise produced by each chemical fixative, and to determine how each fixative alters the collected Raman spectra, and in which regions alternation appears. Although this sounds theoretically promising, the actual cellular structure is more complex. An alternative approach to study the effect caused by fixation is to investigate, with the disease present, if chemical fixation has any impact on the diagnosing result. And if it does, whether this impact can be minimized to improve the accuracy of diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the method}} of Brooke and Goldman (1949), the author was able to fix, mount and stain small helminths and {{parasitic}} protozoa of fish in polyvinyl alcohol-fixative smears. However, because there was much granular material in the PVA-Schaudin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> mixture, AFA <b>fixative</b> was substituted for the Schaudin 2 ̆ 7 s. The PVA went into solution readily using this fixative. The solution was accomplished by adding 5 grams Elvanol # 71 - 301 to 62 ml. of water, heating to 950 C. until dissolved and adding 5 ml. of acetic acid, 1 - 1 / 2 ml. of glycerine, 10 ml. of formaldehyde, and 30 ml. of 95 percent alcohol...|$|R
