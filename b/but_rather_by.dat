5|$|Throughout {{production}} stages, {{the album}} was not referred to as Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994 - 2000, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> its alternative title; From Heavy Metal to Centenary Medal. It is unknown when the band decided on the final title of the album.|$|E
5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state that young people would remain in secondary school, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|The fourth copy, {{owned by}} Salisbury Cathedral, was first given in 1215 to its predecessor, Old Sarum Cathedral. Rediscovered by the cathedral in 1812, it has {{remained}} in Salisbury throughout its history, except when being taken off-site for restoration work. It is possibly the best preserved of the four, although small pin holes {{can be seen in}} the parchment from where it was once pinned up. The handwriting on this version is different from that of the other three, suggesting that it was not written by a royal scribe <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> a member of the cathedral staff, who then had it exemplified by the royal court.|$|E

5|$|The music, however, was {{not written}} by Fordham, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> several composers, {{including}} Paul Perry (a member of The Worthless Peons), Scrubs composer Jan Stevens, and Tony Award-winner Doug Besterman, {{each of whom}} helped write and arrange several songs. But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and Robert Lopez, the writers of hit Broadway musical Avenue Q. Marx and Lopez's involvement came {{at the suggestion of}} Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if {{it would be possible to}} get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode. Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of musical genre suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in the same room.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> collecting intensity data from every {{point of the}} CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E

25|$|Supply {{and demand}} for any given currency, and thus its value, are not {{influenced}} by any single element, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> several. These elements generally fall into three categories: economic factors, political conditions and market psychology.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the {{curricula}} for Chinese and English were revised. The two subjects {{were no longer}} graded along the normal distribution curve <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> criteria referencing (with {{the exception of the}} highest grade, the 5*). Numerical levels are used instead of the traditional letter grades.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to this album, tie-in albums were also released; a collector's edition, a country edition, and an inspirational edition. These other albums contained music that was not featured in the movie <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> inspired <b>by</b> the Biblical story of Exodus.|$|R

25|$|A study {{conducted}} in mice found that ketamine's antidepressant activity is {{not caused by}} ketamine inhibiting the NMDA receptor, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>by</b> sustained indirect/downstream activation of another type of ionotropic glutamate receptor, the AMPA receptor, by a metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine; as of 2017 it is unknown {{if this is the}} case in humans. Arketamine is also an indirect/downstream AMPA receptor activator.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to other controlled radical polymerizations (for example ATRP), a RAFT polymerization does not achieve controlled evolution of molecular weight and low polydispersity by reducing bi-radical termination events (although in some systems, these events {{may indeed be}} reduced somewhat, as outlined above), <b>but</b> <b>rather,</b> <b>by</b> ensuring that most polymer chains start growing at approximately {{the same time and}} experience equal growth during polymerization.|$|E
