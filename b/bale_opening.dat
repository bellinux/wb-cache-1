40|$|The {{prevalence}} of byssinosis and of chronic bronchitis was studied in a questionnaire investigation among workers in <b>bale</b> <b>opening</b> areas, carding rooms, and spinning rooms in five Swedish cotton mills. Airborne dust and Gram-negative bacteria was measured. Nineteen per {{cent of the}} interviewed workers reported symptoms of light byssinosis (grade 1 / 2). The {{prevalence of}} symptoms {{was not related to}} the duration of employment, and cases of byssinosis were found among people who had worked in cotton mills for only a few years. A significantly higher proportion of male than female workers reported symptoms. No difference in the extent of byssinosis was found between smokers and non-smokers, but the prevalence was significantly higher among those workers who had ceased smoking. The prevalence of byssinosis was related to the number of airborne viable Gram-negative bacteria {{as well as to the}} dust level in the different mills...|$|E
50|$|After {{retiring}} as a player, Barron {{became a}} goalkeeping coach, working at Coventry City, Queens Park Rangers and West Bromwich Albion. He {{then moved to}} Aston Villa, before joining Middlesbrough in 2001. Barron {{was sent to the}} stands during Middlesbrough's away League Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur on 26 September 2007, after protesting about Gareth <b>Bale's</b> <b>opening</b> goal. In November 2007 he left Boro to become goalkeeping coach at Newcastle United.Barron left Newcastle United in December 2010 following the departure of manager Chris Hughton. As of 2015 Barron is the Head Coach of the Las Vegas Mobsters a U.S soccer team in the Premier Development League's Western Conference.|$|R
60|$|Here, in the snug {{shelter of}} a little bay, two of the other boats were found, with their prows already on the beach, and their crews {{actively}} employed in landing their goods, <b>opening</b> <b>bales</b> that had received damage from the water, and preparing the encampment; while ever and anon they paused a moment, to watch the various boats as they flew before the gale, {{and one by one}} doubled the friendly promontory.|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} {{incandescence}} came a sound, the first sound that had reached us from without since {{we left the}} earth, a hissing and rustling, the stormy trailing of the aerial garment of the advancing day. And {{with the coming of}} the sound and the light the sphere lurched, and blinded and dazzled we staggered helplessly against each other. It lurched again, and the hissing grew louder. I had shut my eyes perforce, I was making clumsy efforts to cover my head with my blanket, and this second lurch sent me helplessly off my feet. I fell against the <b>bale,</b> and <b>opening</b> my eyes had a momentary glimpse of the air just outside our glass. It was running--it was boiling--like snow into which a white-hot rod is thrust. What had been solid air had suddenly at the touch of the sun become a paste, a mud, a slushy liquefaction, that hissed and bubbled into gas.|$|R
25|$|On 3 March 2013, Bale scored against Arsenal in a North London derby that Tottenham won 2–1. On 7 March, Tottenham faced Inter Milan in the Europa League, with <b>Bale</b> {{scoring the}} <b>opening</b> goal and Tottenham winning 3–0. Bale's run of good {{form in the}} early months of 2013 saw him win Premier League Player of the Month for February as well as the BBC's Goal of the Month in both January and February for his strikes against Norwich City and West Ham United respectively. On 4 April, Bale injured his right ankle in the first leg of the Europa League quarter final against Basel. On his return from injury, Bale scored a goal and {{assisted}} Clint Dempsey as Tottenham beat Manchester City at White Hart Lane.|$|R
50|$|On April 25, 1885, James Sinclair {{the factor}} {{of the post}} having been forewarned by Father Mélasyppe Paquette O.M.I. of {{approaching}} rebels immediately gave the order to submerge into the lake all the lead balls and shot. He loaded four York boats with 246 barrels of powder and 200 rifles along with a large quantity of stock and sent the boats that night towards Île-à-la-Crosse. The next morning on April 26 he loaded {{the rest of his}} men and their families along with the missionary and his companions on another boat. As they were ready to leave the shore 25 Cree from Loon Lake stopped them. Sinclair was taken prisoner but the others were let go to continue on their way. From Sinclair they demanded food saying they were starving but their demands did not stop there. They started breaking boxes, <b>opening</b> <b>bales,</b> slashing open bags of sugar and flour with their knives taking whatever pleased them and destroying the rest. While the post was being looted Sinclair managed to slip away from his guards and fled by canoe with two Métis men from Fort Carlton. Sinclair was able to rejoin the boats and while they camped {{on the side of the}} river his wife gave birth to a healthy girl who was baptised immediately by Father Paquette.|$|R
40|$|DE 19923108 A UPAB: 20010213 NOVELTY - Waste is {{comminuted}} {{and subjected}} to water flotation, separating sinks and floats. In addition, a suspended fraction is drawn off, including floating material. Any water-soluble and/or suspended components of the suspended fraction are dispersed or dissolved in a pulper, from which a floats fraction is withdrawn. A second suspension fraction is withdrawn from the pulper over a screen. A second sinks fraction is withdrawn from the pulper. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred Features: Matting, floating materials from flotation, are drawn off from an upper region of the flotation tank. They are comminuted {{and sent to the}} pulper with the first suspension fraction. Comminution is dry, no water being added, and a shredder or crusher being employed. To largely remove or suspend the water soluble and/or suspended components in the pulper, one or more washing stages are effected. Each washing stage is carried out by drawing off each suspension in the pulper over the sieve, making up with additional water and renewed, brief mechanical energy input. Pretreatment of waste includes mechanical isolation of solids by breaking up pressed components, <b>opening</b> <b>baling</b> straps and removing any transport constraints, before comminution. Materials capable of causing blockage are removed before comminution. Following addition of water to the waste for flotation or pulping, temperature is raised to 70 deg. C- 90 deg. C for sanitation. Floats and/or the first and/or the second sinks are washed after separation. From floats, one or more plastic fractions are separated, by density-based separation or by selective dissolution. Plastic fractions are prepared for re-use or incineration by shredding, drying and/or granulation. The second suspension fraction is fed to an aerobic reactor. USE - To treat mixed industrial wastes in a flotation-based recovery process. ADVANTAGE - Nearly all components may be put to valuable uses. Comminution stages prepare organic components for aerobic reaction...|$|R
