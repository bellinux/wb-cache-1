500|$|The episode {{ends with}} Morrow's villainous {{intentions}} revealed {{and several of}} the main cast apparently disappearing. <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> that this was planned out as part of the season's storyline, and was something that the writers thought was a [...] "fairly compelling" [...] cliffhanger that would hopefully give audiences a reason to return to the series, which was scheduled to have three weeks off after this episode to avoid the 2016 United States presidential election and the Thanksgiving holiday.|$|E

500|$|Fernando Alonso's {{victory at}} the Singapore Grand Prix was his first Formula One win since rejoining the Renault team, after driving for McLaren in 2007. After {{qualifying}} in 15th and making an early pit stop, Alonso had managed to jump {{to the front of}} the race when his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. crashed. Left with no opportunity to pit, the frontrunners had to delay their stops until the damage was cleared, allowing the heavily fuelled Alonso to move to the front once they did so. Though Alonso questioned whether his Renault team could match the pace of Ferrari and McLaren at Fuji, he said [...] "We must remain focussed and try to repeat our level of performance from Singapore to fight at the front." [...] Renault's technical director Bob <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> that the team's improvement from the start of the season was encouraging, but [...] "we recognise that we're not going to overhaul McLaren and Ferrari this season". <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> that the objective for the last races was to win more Grands Prix and, importantly, secure fourth position in the Constructors' Championship from Toyota.|$|E
500|$|On {{taking the}} role of Jigsaw, <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> - [...] "I did Saw because I {{thought it was a}} {{fascinating}} location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise and {{it was clear to me}} that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Colorado Supreme Court intervened, and Bell {{stated that}} if the court didn't see things his way, then he would simply ignore their ruling.

500|$|Absent more screen {{time for}} the Karofsky storyline, <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> that the episode [...] "felt more like a PSA" [...] as it [...] "plugged {{everything}} from The Trevor Project to Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation". Flandez stated that [...] "this incredibly monumentous message of hope became sullied with unexpected product placements: Edible Arrangements, Peanut Butter & Co., even Sex and the City 3." [...] Sullivan was unsure whether the God Squad's plan to bring [...] "an Edible Arrangement to Karofsky" [...] was a [...] "poorly timed joke or product placement", but deemed it [...] "regrettable either way".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} to mixed reviews. Describing Echo & the Bunnymen's {{change from the}} more rock sound of their previous albums to the lighter sound of Ocean Rain, music journalist Max <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> in his 1984 review for The Times newspaper, [...] "This time vocalist Ian McCulloch has tempered his metaphysical songs with a romantic sweetness and the band's melodies are more to the fore. Acoustic guitars, brushes and sparingly used keyboards all add to the album's optimistic warmth {{and there is a}} consistency of atmosphere in songs like 'Seven Seas' and 'Silver', the current single, which justifies the departure." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bell Pottinger founder Lord <b>Bell</b> was <b>said</b> to have [...] "left his own {{firm with}} key staff members, in {{apparent}} disgust over the plan"; Bell confirmed in July 2017 that the Oakbay actions {{had been a}} factor in his August 2016 departure.|$|R

500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E

The Hope/Steffy rivalry follows {{in the tradition}} of the animosity between Taylor and Hope's mother Brooke, who fight over Ridge in a love triangle that spans three decades. The show's head writer Bradley <b>Bell</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Hope's presence at Forrester Creations, as well as in Brooke and Ridge's home, sparks an intense competition between Hope and her step-sister Steffy as well as creates new conflict between long-time rivals Brooke and Taylor as each woman is determined to protect her own daughter." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} Veronica Mars, actress Kristen Bell had voiced interest in appearing on Heroes {{because she was a}} fan.

Herrera and Wolbers threatened to sign a new record deal without Bell, prompting him to form a new version of Fear Factory without them. In some interviews, Wolbers <b>said</b> <b>Bell</b> had made [...] "growing unacceptable demands", which were declined. He said, [...] "Ray and I wanted what was best for the business and what he [...] was trying to change wasn't really good for the business. It was only bad for the business, so that's why he went into that whole phase of hijacking the name and trying to run with it." ...|$|R

500|$|In 2008, Bell {{announced}} that he had quit as producer of Last of the Summer Wine. Citing differences with the BBC and his dislike of their indifference towards the series, <b>Bell</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I have now decided I will not do it again. I have had enough of the BBC's attitude." [...] The announcement came following rumours initiated by Bell that the network would not commission another series of episodes following the 30th series and their indecision regarding a possible one-off special.

In 2011, Bell played in two games with the Southern Jaguars football team.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Finn tells Rachel he's sending her to New York instead of marrying her both {{surprised}} and impressed reviewers. Strecker called {{it one of}} her [...] "favorite non-singing scenes of the year, possibly the series", and VanDerWerff put it even more strongly: [...] "It's {{one of the best}} things I've seen on TV this year". Both Monteith and Michele were praised for their acting: Slezak said it was their [...] "best work", VanDerWerff said they [...] "kill" [...] the scene, and <b>Bell</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "some of Cory Monteith's finest acting". Rachel's arrival in New York brought comparisons to Mary Tyler Moore from Bell and Strecker; as the latter put it, [...] "she's going to make it after all".|$|E
