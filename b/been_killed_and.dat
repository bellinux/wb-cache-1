5|$|In South Asia, it is {{advisable}} {{to take the}} snake which has bitten a person, if it has <b>been</b> <b>killed,</b> <b>and</b> carry it along {{to the hospital for}} possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision can be taken them as to whether and which anti-venom is to be administered. However, attempts to catch it or kill the venomous snake are not advised as the snake may bite more people.|$|E

5|$|In {{his final}} {{report on the}} campaign, General Krueger {{reported}} 3,280 Japanese dead had been counted and 75 had been captured. Perhaps 1,100 more were missing, and were never seen again. American casualties were 326killed, 1,189wounded, and four missing.

5|$|Lyons' admissions {{during the}} first {{interview}} were not very detailed, {{and many of the}} details provided did not match the evidence. Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used. During the interview, he was confused about {{the number of people that}} had <b>been</b> <b>killed,</b> <b>and</b> he thought that the women were awake, and moving about the house at the time, which conflicted with the forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|The ARVN {{operation}} soon {{settled down}} to become a search and destroy mission, with South Vietnamese troops combing the countryside in small patrols looking for PAVN supply caches. Phase II of the operation began {{with the arrival of}} elements of the 9th Infantry Division. Four tank-infantry task forces attacked into the Parrot's Beak from the south. After three days of operations, ARVN claimed 1,010 PAVN troops had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 204 prisoners taken for the loss of 66 ARVN dead and 330 wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle is}} noted {{as the most}} {{significant}} defeat for the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. Not only had four frigates been lost with their entire crews, but 105 experienced sailors had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 168 wounded {{in one of the}} bloodiest frigate encounters of the war. French losses were also heavy, with Duperré reporting 36 killed and 112 wounded on his squadron and among the soldiers firing from the shore.|$|E
5|$|When the Chjeno-Piast coalition, which Piłsudski had {{strongly}} criticized, {{formed a}} new government, on 12–14 May 1926, Piłsudski returned {{to power in}} a coup d'état (the May Coup), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, Liberation, the Peasant Party, and even the Polish Communist Party. Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down; 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had <b>been</b> <b>killed,</b> <b>and</b> over 900 persons had been wounded.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{it was by}} far {{the largest}} battle ever fought in North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe {{reported}} his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded. The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> over 1,000 captured. As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.|$|E

5|$|Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky and is {{informed}} that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is {{in league with}} Renard: Bond kills Davidov and follows the trail to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones. The two witness Renard stealing the GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from a bomb and set off an explosion, from which Bond and Jones escape. Elektra kidnaps M after she thinks Bond had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> Bond establishes that Elektra intends to create a nuclear explosion in a submarine in Istanbul to increase the value of her own oil pipeline. Bond frees M, kills Elektra and then disarms the bomb on the submarine where he kills Renard.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the raid}} one {{civilian}} and three American soldiers had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> eight wounded including the Ojo de Agua post's commanding officer, Sergeant Schaffer, who was included among the former. The Seditionistas also took several casualties, with five men dead and at least nine others wounded, of whom two later died. A Japanese man was found among the dead, as were two Carranzista soldiers, a fact which was seen as evidence that the Carranzistas had been supporting the Plan of San Diego. The American soldiers were commended for their bravery during the raid, and Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} this ship, Rivoli, was launched, the Royal Navy had {{achieved}} dominance over the French in the Adriatic Sea. Not only had the regional commander Bernard Dubourdieu <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> his squadron destroyed at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, but French efforts to supply their scattered garrisons were proving increasingly risky. This was demonstrated by {{the destruction of a}} well-armed convoy from Corfu to Trieste at the Action of 29 November 1811. Rivoli's launch was therefore seen by the French Navy as an opportunity to reverse these defeats, as the new ship of the line outgunned the British frigates that operated within the Adriatic and would be able to operate in the Adriatic without the threat of attack by the frigate squadron based on Lissa.|$|E
50|$|On November 22, {{one soldier}} <b>was</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> two wounded in a {{roadside}} bombing. The next day 23 Houthi fighters <b>and</b> supporters <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 30 injured {{by a car}} bomb targeting a Shi'a religious procession in al-Jawf province. On November 26, two Shi'a mourners <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> eight injured by a bomb while {{on their way to}} Sa'adah city to attend Badreddin al-Houthi's funeral.|$|R
50|$|Ninety {{minutes after}} it began, {{the attack was}} over. 2,008 sailors <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 710 others wounded; 218 {{soldiers}} and airmen (who {{were part of the}} Army until the independent U.S. Air Force was formed in 1947) <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 364 wounded; 109 marines <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 69 wounded; <b>and</b> 68 civilians <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 35 wounded.

By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.|$|E
5|$|In October 1998, Milošević and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to temporarily end the fighting, whereby Yugoslavia would halve the amount of troops and police personnel stationed in Kosovo. The agreement came after Holbrooke convinced the KLA to consider negotiations with Belgrade, while making it clear to Milošević that failing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict {{would lead to a}} NATO bombing campaign against Serbia. The agreement required Yugoslavia to let Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) observers enter Kosovo to ensure that the Yugoslavs were abiding by their commitment to withdraw thousands of soldier and police officers from the province. Small-scale clashes continued, and by December, over 1,000 people had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> more than 300,000 displaced in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Number 18 {{was one of}} the girls in the storage truck, but that she escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Traumatized, she does not understand what Jason wants. She knows that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E

5|$|Ladd and the {{commander}} of the SOG compound (whose men and camp had been incorporated into the defenses of KSCB) proposed that, if the Marines would provide the helicopters, the SOG reconnaissance men would go in themselves to pick up any survivors. The Marines continued to oppose the operation until Westmoreland actually had to issue an order to Cushman to allow the rescue operation to proceed. It was not until 15:00 hours that the relief effort was launched and it was successful. Of the 500 CIDG troops at Lang Vei, 200 had been killed or were missing and 75 more were wounded. Of the 24 Americans at the camp, 10 had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> 11 wounded.|$|E

An unsuccessful kidnapping attempt occurred the following day and, in December, Ramón Oñaederra, an alleged ETA member and Mikel Goikoetxea, an alleged ETA leader, were assassinated by the GAL in separate incidents. Prior to the Monbar attack, two people had <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> six injured in three separate attacks in the town in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} hunts almost entirely at night, {{watching}} from a perch before dropping or gliding silently {{down to its}} victim, but very occasionally it will hunt in daylight when it has young to feed. This species takes {{a wide range of}} prey, mainly woodland rodents, but also other mammals up {{to the size of a}} young rabbit, and birds, earthworms and beetles. In urban areas, birds make up a larger proportion of the diet, and species as unlikely as mallard and kittiwake have <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>and</b> eaten.|$|E
