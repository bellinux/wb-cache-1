500|$|With the state's highest precipitation, southeastern South Dakota {{once had}} [...] to -tall grasses, herbs, and low shrubs. The region {{has plenty of}} {{groundwater}} and, because of common spring floods, does not have many burrowing animals. Before modern agriculture, the tall grass prairies had large numbers of big bluestem, little bluestem, Indian grass, switchgrass, sand dropseed, and other tall grasses. Flood plains along the Missouri and Big Sioux Rivers are habitat for wild rye, bluejoint, and panicgrass. The tall grass prairies have wild rose and buck bush shrubs, and goldenrod, sunflower, cinquefoil, and milkweed herbs. Marsh hawks, <b>bobolink,</b> short-eared owl, and short-billed marsh wren birds make their home in this prairie, and jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, meadow mice, and deer are common animal life.|$|E

The two passages woven together appear in the essay Cambridge Thirty Years Ago, as a quotation. An early poem on The <b>Bobolink,</b> delightful and widely popular, was omitted from later editions of his poems by Lowell, perhaps because to his maturer taste the theme was too much moralized in his early manner. [...] "Shelley and Wordsworth," [...] says Mr. Brownell, [...] "have not more worthily immortalized the skylark than Lowell has the <b>bobolink,</b> its New England congener." ...|$|E

40|$|Aim In the Northern Hemisphere, bird {{migration}} from the tropic to the temperate zone in spring {{is thought to}} proceed at a rate determined {{in large part by}} local phenology. In contrast, little is understood about where birds go or the factors that determine why they move or where they stop during the post-breeding period. Location Study sites were in Oregon, Nebraska and Vermont, and location data we collected extend south to Argentina. Methods We deployed light-level geolocators on individual <b>Bobolinks</b> from three populations across the breeding range and compare their southbound movement phenology to austral greening as indicated by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Results <b>Bobolinks</b> from all breeding populations synchronously arrived and remained for up to several weeks in two sequential, small non-breeding areas that were separated by thousands of kilometres, before staging for pre-alternate moult. Similar to the migration patterns of birds to northern breeding areas, movements into the Southern Hemisphere corresponded to increasing primary productivity. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the <b>Bobolink's</b> southbound migration is broadly constrained by resource availability, and its non-breeding distribution has been shaped by the seasonal phenology of grasslands in both time and space. This is the first documentation of individual birds from across a continental breeding range exhibiting phenological matching during their post-breeding southward migration. Known conservation threats overlap temporally and spatially with large concentrations of <b>Bobolinks,</b> and should be closely examined. We emphasize the need to consider how individuals move and interact with their environment throughout their annual cycle and over hemispheric scales. ...|$|R
50|$|They often migrate in flocks, {{feeding on}} {{cultivated}} grains and rice, {{which leads to}} them being considered a pest by farmers in some areas. Although <b>bobolinks</b> migrate long distances, they have rarely been sighted in Europe—like many vagrants from the Americas, {{the overwhelming majority of}} records are from the British Isles.|$|R
50|$|West of the Cobbles, the {{landscape}} changes to open managed hay fields dotted with {{eastern red cedar}} and then to upland forests of red oak, eastern hemlock, yellow birch, shagbark hickory, sugar maple, and black birch.

6000|$|To all {{of which}} remarks Nan gave her assent; the hop-pole took the {{likeness}} of a tall figure she {{had seen in the}} porch, the sage-bed, curiously enough, suggested a strawberry ditto, the lettuce vividly reminded her of certain vegetable productions a basket had brought, and the <b>bobolink</b> only sung in his cheeriest voice, [...] "Go home, go home! he is there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 127. Bobolink: If Lowell had a {{favorite}} bird, {{it was the}} <b>bobolink,</b> although the oriole was a close competitor for his praises. In one of his letters he says: [...] "I think the <b>bobolink</b> the best singer in the world, even undervaluing the lark and the nightingale in the comparison." [...] And in another he writes: [...] "That liquid tinkle of theirs is the true fountain of youth if one can only drink it with the right ears, and I always date the New Year from the day of my first draught. Messer Roberto di Lincoln, with his summer alb over his shoulders, is the true chorister for the bridals of earth and sky. There is no bird {{that seems to me}} so thoroughly happy as he, so void of all arrière pensée about getting a livelihood. The robin sings matins and vespers somewhat conscientiously, it seems to me--makes a business of it and pipes as it were by the yard--but Bob squanders song like a poet." ...|$|E
