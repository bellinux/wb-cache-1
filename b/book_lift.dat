Focusing on the key tools of impact assessment, consultation, simplification, and access to legislation, the authors provide fresh empirical evidence on the progress made in the member states and in Brussels, drawing on an extensive research project and an original survey of directors of better regulation programmes in Europe. Radaelli and De Francesco show how indicators define, measure, and appraise better regulation policy, linking measures to policy processes in which the stakeholders learn by monitoring...|$|R

40|$|No {{longer are}} heavy, sturdy, {{expensive}} mounts and tripods required to photograph deep space. With today's advances in technology, {{all that is}} required is an entry-DSLR and an entry level GoTo telescope. Here is {{all of the information}} needed to start photographing the night sky without buying expensive tracking mounts. By using multiple short exposures and combining them with mostly ‘freeware’ computer programs, the effect of image rotation can be minimized to a point where it is undetectable in normal astrophotography, even for a deep-sky object such as a galaxy or nebula. All the processes, techniques, and equipment needed to use inexpensive, lightweight altazimuth and equatorial mounts and very short exposures photography to image deep space objects are explained, step-by-step, in full detail, supported by clear, easy to understand graphics and photographs.   Currently available lightweight mounts and tripods are identified and examined from an economic versus capability perspective to help users determine what camera, telescope, and mount is the best fit for them. A similar analysis is presented for entry-level telescopes and mounts sold as bundled packages by the telescope manufacturers. This <b>book</b> <b>lifts</b> the veil of mystery from the creation of deep space photographs and makes astrophotography affordable and accessible to most amateur astronomers...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{intended}} {{to respond to the}} extent to which South African textbooks on the subject of history is linked to the governmental policy documents and whether they are producing and reproducing national identity. The two textbooks are aimed at students in grade 10. Both books were produced in 2008 but published by different publishers. The essay is based on Norman Faircloughs critical discourse theory which has been supplemented by Michael Billings theory Banal Nationalism, which assumes that it is the national words that remind us daily of our homeland that is producing and reproducing national identity.    The survey shows that both textbooks are closely tied to the government policy document for the teaching of history. The textbooks refer to the policy, both explicitly and implicitly. The two textbooks reproduce a common national identity in South Africa based on the discussions taking place in society. In other words, the textbooks have been influenced by Rainbowism and African Renaissance. The <b>books</b> <b>lift</b> up both the idea of a reconciled South Africa and a proud nation in the continent of Africa. The texts and exercises in the books contribute to the production of national identity by reminding students that they can be proud to be South African in a unique multicultural nation. The analysis also shows that the textbooks strive to include all people in the national community regardless of ethnicity. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{right kind}} of {{democracy}} – an ideology analysis of school literatures description of the term democracy. Writers: Fredrik Hedlund & Mattias Ahlqvist Democracy is today a word and a concept {{that in many ways}} is taken for granted and almost never is reflected on. The concept democracy is also considered as an essential issue in the swedish school system, both regarding the way the education should be managed and also {{as a part of the}} students democratic schooling – all according to the comprehensive document Läroplanen för de frivilliga skolformerna (Lpf 94). The main purpose of this paper is to investigate how swedish literature in political and social science talks about and looks upon democracy – what do the books say it means? The materials we have chosen for this report are the books Zigma and Forum. As metod we are using a textual ideology analysis in which we have created three dimensions – meaning/associations, criticism of democracy, and demos/citizenship. The dimensions are designed to fit our critical point of wiew regarding how democracy is looked upon in school literature today. Our results have shown that both books gives the same meaning and significance to the word, that no one of the <b>books</b> <b>lifts</b> forth any serious criticism of democracy and that no one of the books is trying to discuss nor question the word demos/citizenship. Key words: democracy, criticism, demos/citizenship, rights and obligations...|$|R

40|$|Data metrics {{in schools}} are {{becoming}} increasingly complex and (some would say, as a result) increasingly less likely to effect change in classroom practice and schooling outcomes. Despite their best efforts, teachers generally find the measures something of a ‘black-box’. The authors of this book advocate a move away from this situation, towards a greater professional understanding; away from a ‘data dictatorship’ in which teachers are merely the passive recipients of data outcomes, towards a ‘data democracy’ in which teachers are instead active participants. The <b>book</b> <b>lifts</b> the lid {{on a range of}} data-gathering techniques and methods, and explores the provenance and problematisation of pupil / school data collection and utilisation. Chapters include: the political context of school data collection and how it is used for accountability and inspection purposes; how teachers and schools use pupil attainment and progress data; how ‘context’ is brought into measurement and how practitioners can interpret outcomes from different models; the use of data for target-setting, self-evaluation and school improvement; collection strategies and inter-agency data for post-compulsory progression; devising and using measures for evaluating progress in the social and emotional aspects of learning and ‘Every Child Matters’ outcomes; uncovering the differential effectiveness of schools across the range of prior attainment. Using Effectiveness Data for School Improvement brings together in one place, for the first time, the various metrics and models in use in schools. A full technical specification is included so that both ‘data experts’ and ‘data novices’ will find the book essential for understanding what is becoming an increasingly important aspect of school and curriculum management. <br/...|$|R
