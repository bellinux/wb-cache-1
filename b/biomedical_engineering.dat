40|$|Biomedical informatics, imaging, and {{engineering}} are major forces driving the knowledge revolutions that are shaping the agendas for biomedical research and clinical {{medicine in the}} 21 st century. These disciplines produce the tools and techniques to advance biomedical research, and continually feed new technologies and procedures into clinical medicine. To sustain this force, an increased investment is needed in the physics, <b>biomedical</b> science, <b>engineering,</b> mathematics, information science, and computer science undergirding <b>biomedical</b> informatics, <b>engineering,</b> and imaging. This investment should be made primarily through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). However, the NIH is not structured to support such disciplines as <b>biomedical</b> informatics, <b>engineering,</b> and imaging that cross boundaries between disease- and organ-oriented institutes. The solution to this dilemma {{is the creation of}} a new institute or center at the NIH devoted to <b>biomedical</b> imaging, <b>engineering,</b> and informatics. Bills are being introduced into the 106 th Congress to authorize such an entity. The pathway is long and arduous, from the introduction of bills in the House and Senate to the realization of new opportunities for <b>biomedical</b> informatics, <b>engineering,</b> and imaging at the NIH. There are many opportunities for medical informaticians to contribute to this realization...|$|R
