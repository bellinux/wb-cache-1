25|$|Various {{styles of}} <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> and mounts {{are used for}} a variety of sizes and types of bulbs, {{including}} spots and halogens.|$|E
2500|$|A {{lampholder}} plug {{fits into}} the <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> or Edison screw socket of a lampholder {{in place of a}} light bulb and enables an electrical appliance to be powered from a wall or ceiling light fitting. As mentioned in Early History above, they were first introduced in the late 1800s and in use to the 1960s in situations where wall sockets were scarce and sometimes non-existent in some rooms (bathrooms, cellars, attics, etc.). Also, as in some countries (such as Italy) electricity was supplied on a [...] "split tariff" [...] basis with electricity for lighting being charged at a lower rate than that for other purposes, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs and were thus in broad use.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} {{adapters}} between screw sizes, and for adapting {{to or from}} <b>bayonet</b> <b>caps.</b> A socket extender makes the bulb stick out further, such as to accommodate a compact fluorescent lamp with a self-ballast that doesn't fit in a recessed lighting fixture.|$|R
5000|$|The all-glass PF1 bulb was {{introduced}} in 1954. [...] Eliminating both the metal base, and the multiple manufacturing steps needed to attach it to the glass bulb, cut the cost substantially compared to the larger M series bulbs. The design required a fibre ring around the base to hold the contact wires {{against the side of}} the glass base. An adapter was available allowing the bulb to fit into flash guns that accepted the <b>bayonet</b> <b>capped</b> bulbs. The PF1 (along with the M2) had a faster ignition time (less delay between shutter contact and peak output), so it could be used with X synch below 1/30 of a second—while most bulbs require a shutter speed of 1/15 on X synch to keep the shutter open long enough for the bulb to ignite and burn. A smaller version, the AG-1 {{was introduced}} in 1958 which did not require the fibre ring. Though it was smaller and had reduced light output, it was cheaper to manufacture and rapidly supplanted the PF1.|$|R
50|$|The {{exposure}} meter uses a circular CdS cell 8.5 mm in diameter (coverage with 50 mm lens = 21°), {{and having a}} sensitivity of -0 (some estimates claim -1) - 20 Ev at 100 ASA (0.3-0.4 asb at f/1.4 to 200 000 asb; 0,06 to 32.000 cd/m2). Information from the {{exposure meter}} is displayed using a dual match needle system {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 exposure meter can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 exposure meter required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type threaded cap and is superior in design to that of the <b>bayonet</b> <b>caps</b> that surfaced as of the M6.|$|R
50|$|Bayonet bases or caps {{are often}} {{abbreviated}} to BA, {{often with a}} number after. The number refers to {{the diameter of the}} base (e.g., BA22 is a 22 mm diameter <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> lamp). BA15, a 15 mm base, can also be referred to as SBC standing for small <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap.</b> The lower-case letter s or d specifies whether the bulb has single or double contacts.|$|E
50|$|Bayonet mount bulbs {{are used}} in most {{standard}} fittings and have been the dominant standard in most installations since the introduction of electric lighting in Ireland.Various styles of <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> and mounts are used {{for a variety of}} sizes and types of bulbs, including spots and halogens.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} {{light is}} {{a device that}} produces visible light by the flow of electric current. It {{is the most common}} form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society, providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities. In technical usage, a replaceable component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp. Compact lamps are commonly called light bulbs; for example, the incandescent light bulb. Lamps usually have a base made of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which secures the lamp in the socket of a light fixture. The electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw-thread base, two metal pins, two metal caps or a <b>bayonet</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first section}} {{has a large}} number of old string, wind, and {{percussion}} instruments. The oldest, two Thracian lyres, date to the seventeenth century. Other noteworthy exhibits are a bellows organ, bagpipes, old gramophones, and a reconstruction of an ancient lyre. The most notable feature of section two is the 200 buckles of all types - priests buckles large and small, Sarakatsani buckles, Thracian buckles, and buckles from Orini. There are also collars, earrings, necklaces, watches, bracelets, crowns, and crosses, all dating to the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The weapons in section three date from the late Neolithic to the present day and include slingstones, stone arrowheads, and metal arrowheads and spearheads. The more modern weapons include muzzle-loaded rifles, flintlocks, nineteenth-century revolvers, sabres from 1821, powder magazines, and percussion caps. There are also military uniforms of various nations, <b>caps,</b> <b>bayonets,</b> medals, and cartridge belts. Of particular interest is a swordstick made by a craftsman from Melnik.|$|R

50|$|The bayonet {{light bulb}} mount is the {{standard}} fitting in many {{former members of the}} British Empire including the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as parts of the Middle East and Africa (although not Canada, which primarily uses Edison screw sockets along with the United States and Mexico). The standard size is B22d-2, often referred to in the context of lighting as simply BC. Older installations in some other countries, including France and Greece use this base. First developed by St. George Lane Fox-Pitt in the UK and improved upon by the Brush Electric Company from the late 1870s onward, standard bulbs have two pins {{on opposite sides of the}} cap; however, some specialized bulbs have three pins (cap designation B22d-3) to prevent use in domestic light fittings. Examples of three-pin bulbs are found in mercury street lamps and fireglow bulbs in some older models of electric radiative heater. Older railway carriages in the UK also made use of a 3 pin bulb base to discourage theft. <b>Bayonet</b> <b>cap</b> bulbs are also very common worldwide in applications where vibration may loosen screw-mount bulbs, such as automotive lighting and other small , and in many flashlights. In many other countries the Edison screw (E) base is used for lighting.|$|E
