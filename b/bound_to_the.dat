5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> serine in the active site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|Reversible inhibitors {{attach to}} enzymes with non-covalent {{interactions}} such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and ionic bonds. Multiple weak bonds between the inhibitor and the active site combine to produce strong and specific binding. In contrast to substrates and irreversible inhibitors, reversible inhibitors {{generally do not}} undergo chemical reactions when <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enzyme and can be easily removed by dilution or dialysis.|$|E

5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} can be <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{nucleus of}} an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or}} more electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} this would be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of the}} main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|By 1778, Isaac Parsons (1752–96) was in {{ownership}} of Lot Number 17. The parcel was later resurveyed for David Hunter by surveyor John Mitchel on April17, 1788.

Most of the western area of the present-day corporate boundaries of Romney were located within Lot Number 17. Lot Number 17's eastern boundary stretched between the present-day Savilla-Vale and Wirgman Hill neighborhoods of Romney. The location of Valley {{was not included in}} surveyor John Mitchel's plan for Romney dated June 30, 1790, and the forested lands of Depot Valley remained undeveloped into the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E
5|$|Hapticity {{is a term}} to {{describe}} the coordination {{of a group of}} contiguous atoms of a ligand <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character eta, η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. Electron spin resonance studies indicated the formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs. The carbides Y3C, Y2C, and YC2 can be hydrolyzed to form hydrocarbons.|$|E
