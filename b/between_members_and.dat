25|$|Stunt Night is a {{competition}} {{among the four}} classes that builds a bond <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> creates class spirit. It began in 1909 when George Rosborough, the physical education instructor, initiated Stunt Night to give the campus residents, who could not go home, an activity during the Christmas holidays. The Stunt Night committee selects a theme for the event, allowing the class directors time to prepare a skit and an original song. The winning class has the honor of decorating the Stunt Night blanket which is then displayed in the Musick Alumni Center and Museum for a year.|$|E
500|$|On his {{birthday}} on March 26, 2016, original guitarist James Iha joined Billy Corgan, Jimmy Chamberlin, and Jeff Schroeder on stage unannounced at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. He performed a few songs, including [...] "Mayonaise", [...] "Soma" [...] and [...] "Whir" [...] marking {{his first appearance}} with the Smashing Pumpkins in 16 years. Iha also played at {{the second of the}} two Smashing Pumpkins shows at the Ace Hotel the following day, which was Easter Sunday. Iha joined the Pumpkins for a third time at their April 14 concert at the Civic Opera House in Chicago. In August, Corgan mentioned that he had been reaching out to the original lineup, including speaking to Wretzky {{for the first time in}} sixteen years, in hopes of rekindling the relationship <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> seeing if it were potentially feasible to reform the band's original lineup of Corgan, Iha, Wretzky, and Chamberlin. In June 2017, Chamberlin also mentioned the possibility of a reunion tour in 2018.|$|E
2500|$|The Soka Gakkai liturgy {{refers to}} all of its first three presidents—Tsunesabura Makiguchi, Josei Toda and Daisaku Ikeda—as [...] "the eternal mentors of kosen-rufu". [...] Chilson reports that [...] "as Soka Gakkai's long-time leader, Ikeda is revered by Gakkai members". The {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> their mentors {{is referred to as}} [...] "the oneness of mentor and disciple". [...] The mentor is to lead and thereby improve the lives of his disciples. The mentor's actions is seen as giving disciples confidence in their own unrealized potential. [...] The role of disciples is seen as supporting their mentor and realizing his vision using their unique abilities and circumstances. The relationship is seen as non-hierarchical and mutually weighted. Disciples are encouraged to be active creators rather than passive followers. Seager writes: [...] "The oneness of the mentor-disciple relationship is described not in terms of demands and duties as many critics imagine it to be, but in terms of choice, freedom and responsibility. It is the disciple's choice and decision to follow the mentor's vision for their common goal. In response, it is the mentor's wish to raise and foster the disciple to become greater than the mentor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinction}} <b>between</b> <b>members</b> <b>and</b> nonmembers is {{the critical}} distinction in this case, not the distinction between Indian and non-Indians. Thus, states may not impose taxes on transactions between members that take place on reservations, because this would interfere with the sovereignty of tribes vis-à-vis their own members. Tribes also retain the power to regulate hunting on lands they own or lands held in trust for them by the United States, but not on lands held in fee. And although other decisions of the Court had recognized broader retained powers in the civil context, criminal powers of Indian tribes were strictly limited to members because [...] "the exercise of criminal jurisdiction subjects a person {{not only to the}} adjudicatory power of the tribunal, but also to the prosecuting power of the tribe, and involves a far more direct intrusion on personal liberties." [...] Thus, Indian tribes may only prosecute members for crimes committed on their reservations. Because Duro was {{not a member of the}} Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, that tribe did not have the power to prosecute him for the crime of illegally firing a weapon.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{under section}} 172 {{directors}} must [...] "promote {{the success of}} the company". This somewhat nebulous provision created significant debate during its passage through Parliament, since it goes on to prescribe that decisions should be taken in the interests of members, with regard to long term consequences, the need to act fairly <b>between</b> <b>members,</b> <b>and</b> a range of other [...] "stakeholders", such as employees, suppliers, the environment, the general community, and creditors. Many groups objected to this [...] "enlightened shareholder value" [...] model, which in form elevated the interests of members, who are invariably shareholders, above other stakeholders. However, the duty is particularly difficult to sue upon since it is only a duty for a director to do what she or [...] "he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote {{the success of the}} company". Proof of subjective bad faith toward any group being difficult, directors have the discretion to balance all competing interests, even if to the short term detriment of shareholders in a particular instance. There is also a duty under section 173 to exercise independent judgment and the duty of care in section 174 applies to the decision making process of a director having regard to the factors listed in section 172, so it remains theoretically possible to challenge a decision if made without any rational basis. Only registered shareholders, not other stakeholders without being members of the general meeting, have standing to claim any breach of the provision. But section 172's criteria are useful as an aspirational standard because in the annual Director's Report companies must explain how they have complied with their duties to stakeholders. Also, the idea of whether a company's success will be promoted is central when a court determines whether a derivative claim should proceed in the course of corporate litigation.|$|E
