5|$|Allegedly, Vattier {{had tried}} to take title {{to a piece of}} {{property}} in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court. Henry Clay represented Hinde in the Ohio State Court proceedings. Hinde claimed that Vattier tried to use the lot to pay Findlay by claiming to have a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> and title that was superior to the Hinde family. After more than fifteen years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children. Originally owned by Hinde's father-in-law, James Bradford, after his death the property passed to Hinde's wife, Belinda (Bradford) Hinde.|$|E

Logbook loans and the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> Acts {{have been subject to}} much criticism. In 2009, a consultation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills examined the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> Acts and proposed that <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> for consumer lending, such as logbook loans, should be banned. The government's response to the consultation was published in 2011.

25|$|The {{general area}} of central New Jersey was once {{occupied}} by the Lenape Native Americans. According to a 1677 <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> now in the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton, New Jersey, Thomas Lawrence, a New York baker, purchased {{thousands of acres of}} land from local Native Americans named Querameck, Kesyacs, Isarick, Metapis, Peckawan, and Turantecas. In this document, the area is called Piscopeek, which later become known as Lawrence Brook, after its purchaser. Around the late 17th century, settlers began arriving {{in the northern part of}} East Brunswick, and by the mid-19th century, a small village had formed in the southeastern part, known as the Old Bridge section of the town, an area that was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.|$|E
25|$|In response, {{several of}} the {{companies}} filed suit to prevent this. Years of legal wrangling ensued, until March, 2007 when the matter finally went to trial in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which ruled for International Air Response, the successor to T Aviation. The Government had required {{the return of the}} three C-130As provided to T or a payment of US$2.4 million plus interest, and the court invalidated this request based on existing law (40 USC 544) which states that if a <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> is provided, that is evidence that the transaction meets all regulatory requirements. In thus ruling, the court determined that despite the transactions being illegal from the Forest Service's perspective, the purchasers could not be held liable for the agency's improper activities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> {{have existed}} at common law {{since at least}} the Middle Ages, when they were most {{commonly}} used commercially in the shipping industry. As the general population began to own more personal goods in the Victorian era, <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> came {{to be used as a}} form of consumer credit. Lenders would extend credit on the security of:all and every the household goods, furniture, plate, linen, china, books, stock in trade, brewing utensils and all the effects.Most often, people would grant <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> over their goods as security for a loan. Borrowers would transfer ownership of their goods to the lender, while retaining possession of them when making repayments. When the loan was repaid, the borrower would regain ownership. <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> used in this way are known as “security bills”.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, Israeli {{settlers}} {{moved into}} a sealed section of the al-Kurd family's house and refused to leave, claiming the property was owned by Jews. In 2008, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that the Shimon Hatzadik property belonged to the Sephardi Community Committee. The Arab families had protected tenant status {{as long as they}} paid rent but several families refused to pay, ending in their eviction. The al-Kurds were evicted in November 2008. Muhammad al-Kurd, the head of the family, died eleven days later. The court ruling was based on an Ottoman-era <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> whose authenticity was challenged in 2009 {{on the grounds that the}} building had only been rented to the Sephardi group. Fawzieh al-Kurd continued to protest the eviction, moving into an encampment in East Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Shahzad is {{believed}} to have bought the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder on April 24, a week prior to the attempted bombing. The vehicle had been listed in an online Craigslist ad, and he reportedly bought it from a female Connecticut college student for $1,300 (negotiated down from $1,800), which he paid in $100 bills. He reportedly exchanged the cash for the car at a Connecticut shopping center parking lot, where he inspected the interior and cargo area (but not the engine) and declined the offer of a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> He later had the car windows tinted, which made it harder to peer inside. A surveillance tape from the parking lot shows Shahzad test-driving the car, according to the FBI. He bought a second vehicle through Craigslist (a black Isuzu Rodeo) from a mechanic in Stratford, Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Drafted by {{a treaty}} and a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> and {{constituted}} between 1820 and 1858, the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu (as {{it was first}} called) combined disparate regions, religions, and ethnicities: to the east, Ladakh was ethnically and culturally Tibetan and its inhabitants practised Buddhism; to the south, Jammu had a mixed population of Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs; in the heavily populated central Kashmir valley, the population was overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim, however, {{there was also a}} small but influential Hindu minority, the Kashmiri brahmins or pandits; to the northeast, sparsely populated Baltistan had a population ethnically related to Ladakh, but which practised Shia Islam; to the north, also sparsely populated, Gilgit Agency, was an area of diverse, mostly Shi'a groups; and, to the west, Punch was Muslim, but of different ethnicity than the Kashmir valley. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, in which Kashmir sided with the British, and the subsequent assumption of direct rule by Great Britain, the princely state of Kashmir came under the suzerainty of the British Crown.|$|E

Individuals (broadly, non-incorporated legal persons) may give a chattel mortgage over their personal property; however, it must be in the statutory form prescribed by the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> Act 1878 and the <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sale</b> Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882 for it to constitute valid security.|$|R

A <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as prostitutes in ancient Rome were often slaves.

500|$|The {{property}} was originally {{part of the}} Northampton land grant given to Col. Henry Darnall (c. 16451711), a relative of Lord Baltimore, in 1695. His heirs sold the land on April 2, 1745, to Col.Charles Ridgely (170272), a tobacco farmer and trader. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> records that the property included [...] "... houses, tobacco houses (tobacco barns), stables, gardens, and orchards." [...] By the late 1750s, Hampton extended to more than [...] and included an ironworks. His son, Capt.Charles Ridgely (173390), expanded the family business considerably to include gristmills, apple orchards, and stone quarries. During the American Revolutionary War, the ironworks was {{a significant source of}} income for the Ridgelys, producing cannons and ammunition for the Continental Army. In 1783, Capt. Ridgely began construction of the main house, Hampton Mansion. He said its concept was inspired by Castle Howard in England, owned by relatives of his mother. When it was completed in 1790, the Hampton Mansion was the largest private home in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Point du Sable {{settled on}} the north bank of the Chicago River close to its mouth {{at some time in}} the 1780s. The {{earliest}} known record of Point du Sable living in Chicago is an entry that Hugh Heward made in his journal on May 10, 1790 during a journey from Detroit across Michigan and through Illinois. Heward's party stopped at Pointe du Sable's house en route to the Chicago portage; they swapped their canoe for a pirogue that belonged to Point du Sable, and they bought bread, flour and pork from him. Perrish Grignon, who visited Chicago in about 1794, described Point du Sable as a large man who was a wealthy trader. In 1800 he sold his farm to John Kinzie's frontman, Jean La Lime, for 6,000 livres; the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> which was rediscovered in 1913 in an archive in Detroit, outlined all of the property Point du Sable owned as well as many of his personal artifacts. This included a house, two barns, a horse drawn mill, a bakehouse, a poultry house, a dairy and a smokehouse. The house was a [...] log cabin filled with fine furniture and paintings.|$|E

500|$|By {{choosing}} a market as the {{location for the}} sale, the couple ensured a large audience, which made their separation a widely witnessed fact. The use of the halter was symbolic; after the sale, it was handed to the purchaser as a signal that the transaction was concluded, and in some instances, those involved would often attempt further to legitimate the sale by forcing the winning bidder to sign a contract, recognising that the seller had no further liability for his wife. In 1735, a successful wife sale in St Clements was announced by the common cryer, who wandered the streets ensuring that local traders {{were aware of the}} former husband's intention not to honour [...] "any debts she should contract". The same point was made in an advertisement placed in the Ipswich Journal in 1789: [...] "no person or persons to intrust her with my name... for she is no longer my right". Those involved in such sales sometimes attempted to legalise the transaction, as demonstrated by a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> for a wife, preserved in the British Museum. The bill is contained in a petition presented to a Somerset Justice of the Peace in 1758, by a wife who about 18months earlier had been sold by her husband for £6 6s [...] "for the support of his extravagancy". The petition does not object to the sale, but complains that the husband returned three months later to demand more money from his wife and her new [...] "husband".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 17, 1910. It states: [...] "John Deering is a poor inventor living modestly {{with his wife and}} only daughter. He has approached Mr. Cobleigh, a capitalist, with a proposition to share the profits of a new invention with him, providing that he (Cobleigh) furnish the capital to swing it. Cobleigh comes to see the model of Deering's invention and is greatly impressed with it. Cobleigh offers Deering a small amount of money for the invention, but Deering refuses to accept it. Then Cobleigh, having failed to get his invention by fair means, determines to secure it by foul. He drugs Deering, and the result of the poison is to make the inventor temporarily insane. While in this condition, Cobleigh has Deering transferred to an insane asylum. Then he forges the inventor's name to the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale</b> and thinks that his crime will never be discovered. Deering's daughter, Grace, failing to induce her sweetheart, Tom Reynolds, to aid in rescuing Deering, breaks into the asylum and takes her father out singlehandedly. She conveys him to a camp in the woods where her tender care restores him to health. Then she takes him home again and he demands his rights from Cobleigh. The latter denies that he owes Deering a cent, and the inventor goes to law. Tom, who acts as his counsel, shows by enlarged stereopticon views of the two signatures that Cobleigh had traced the one from the other. Cobleigh, overcome by the revelation of his crime, is arrested, and the Deering family and the faithful Tom are happy." ...|$|E
