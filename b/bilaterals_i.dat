40|$|Few {{cases of}} {{synchronous}} <b>bilateral</b> stage <b>I</b> seminomas {{have been reported}} in the world literature. We present a case of bilateral synchronous testicular seminoma, the current literature on the management of stage I seminoma, and the implications for radiotherapy. A forty-year-old man presented with synchronous bilateral classical seminomas, both stage IA. After undergoing bilateral inguinal orchiectomy, he received adjuvant external beam radiotherapy, with a standard paraaortic field. After 18 months of followup, he remains well, without evidence of recurrence. Bilateral germ cell tumors (BGCTs) are reported consistently at a low rate. Bilateral radical inguinal orchiectomy is standard of care, yet some groups have proposed an organ preservation approach. Of the reported cases of <b>bilateral</b> stage <b>I</b> synchronous GCT, with concordant seminoma histology, most of them were treated with bilateral orchiectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy.

40|$|Introduction  Bilateral {{same day}} type I {{tympanoplasty}} scores over unilateral type I tympanoplasty {{in terms of}} convenience and conservation of resources but, it is rarely performed because of theoretical risk of postoperative sensorineural deafness. Materials and Methods A total of 60 patients with central perforation of tympanic membrane of both ears were included in this study. Thirty patients had undergone unilateral type I tympanoplasty and {{an equal number of}} patients were treated with <b>bilateral</b> type <b>I</b> tympanoplasty in the same sitting. The results were compared to evaluate the advantages and efficacy of single sitting <b>bilateral</b> type <b>I</b> tympanoplasty with unilateral type I tympanoplasty. Result Perforation closure was successful in 94. 6 % and 93. 3 % ears while hearing improvement in 82. 1 % and 86. 6 % in group <b>I</b> (<b>bilateral</b> tympanoplasty) and group II (unilateral tympanoplasty) respectively. Mean hearing gain for successfully operated ears in group I (both left and right) and group II is 18. 1 dB and 16. 5 dB. None of the patients developed iatrogenic sensorineural hearing loss. Discussion Bilateral perforations of the TM is a common finding and CSOM is found to be the most common cause in more than 90 % of patients.

40|$|Should {{principals}} {{communicate with}} their agents, explain and justify their evaluations? Economic research of communication and information transmission in organizations has usually focused on how to give agents incentives to gather information and how to elicit them truthfully. Yet also principals spend much time talking to their agents, not only giving instructions and evaluations, but also explaining and justifying them. This paper shows {{that it can be}} optimal for the principal to explain her subjective evaluation to the agent and make it understandable, even if communication is costly. The explanations are valuable, although they convey no additional information about the agent's effort and take place after the effort choice of the agent. The communication allows making the optimal contract contingent on the evaluation in a more refined way. Therefore it becomes possible to give the agent the right incentives at lower costs, because he understands the evaluation of his work better and learns, whether it is trustworthy. However a commitment issue arises, that can become quite costly. This might explain why evaluations and other kinds of feedback are often highly structured and institutionalized. Furthermore, the optimal contract is stochastic and <b>bilateral,</b> <b>i.</b> e. payments to third parties are not required to implement the optimal contract...|$|R

40|$|A {{great many}} chaos-based image {{encryption}} schemes {{have been proposed}} in the past decades. Most of them use the permutation-diffusion architecture in pixel level, which has been proved insecure enough as they are not dependent on plain-images and so cannot resist chosen/known plain-image attack usually. In this paper, we propose a novel image encryption scheme comprising of one permutation process and one diffusion process. In the permutation process, the image sized is expanded to one sized by dividing the plain-image into two parts: one consisting of the higher 4 bits and one consisting of the lower 4 bits. The permutation operations are done row-by-row and column-by-column {{to increase the speed}} of permutation process. The chaotic cat map is utilized to generate chaotic sequences, which are quantized to shuffle the expanded image. The chaotic sequence for permutation process is dependent on plain-image and cipher keys, resulting in good key sensitivity and plain-image sensitivity. To achieve more avalanche effect and larger key space, a chaotic Bernoulli shift map based <b>bilateral</b> (<b>i.</b> e., horizontal and vertical) diffusion function is applied as well. The security and performance of the proposed image encryption have been analyzed, including histograms, correlation coefficients, information entropy, key sensitivity analysis, key space analysis, differential analysis, encryption rate analysis etc. All the experimental results suggest that the proposed image encryption scheme is robust and secure and can be used for secure image and video communication applications...|$|R
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers in American men. The cancer could either be locally con ned, or it could spread outside the organ. When locally con ned, there are several options for {{treating}} and curing this disease. Otherwise, surgery is the only option, and in extreme cases of outside spread, it could very easily recur within a short time even after surgery and subsequent radiation therapy. Hence, it is important to know, based on pre-surgery biopsy results how likely the cancer is organ-con ned or not. The paper considers a hierarchical Bayesian neural network approach for posterior prediction probabilities of certain features indicative of non-organ con ned prostate cancer. In particular, we nd such probabilities for margin positivity (MP) and seminal vesicle (SV) positivity jointly. The available training set consists of bivariate binary outcomes indicating the presence or absence of the two.

40|$|Background: Cortico-subcortical {{circuits}} {{are organized}} into the sensorimotor, associative and limbic loop. These neuronal preconditions {{play an important}} role regarding the understanding and treatment of behavioral problems in children. Differencing evidence argues for a lateralized organization of the sensorimotor loop and a <b>bilateral</b> (<b>i.</b> e. non-lateralized) organization of the associative loop. However, a firm behavioral-neurobiological distinction of these circuits has been difficult, specifically in children. Objectives: Thus, the aim was a comprehensive functional visualization and differentiation of the sensorimotor and the associative circuit during childhood. As a new approach, laterality and rostrality features were used to distinguish between the two circuits within one single motor task. Methods: 24 healthy boys performed self-paced index finger tapping with each hand separately during functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. Results: A contrast analysis for left against right hand movement revealed lateralized activation in typical sensorimotor regions such as primary sensorimotor cortex, caudal supplementary motor area (SMA), caudal putamen and thalamus. A conjunction analysis confirmed bilateral involvement of known associative regions including pre-SMA, rostral SMA and rostral putamen. Conclusion: A functional visualization of two distinct corticostriatal circuits is provided in childhood. Both, the sensorimotor and associative circuit may be discriminated by their laterality characteristics already in minors. Additionally, the results support the concept of a modified functional subdivision of the SMA in a rostral (associative) and caudal (motor) part. A further development of this approach might help to nurture behavioral assessment and neurofeedback training in child mental health...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{climate change and}} human migration is not homogenous and depends critically on the differential vulnerability of population and places. If places and populations are not vulnerable, or susceptible, to climate change, then the climate–migration relationship may not materialize. The key to understanding and, from a policy perspective, planning for whether and how climate change will impact future migration patterns is therefore knowledge {{of the link between}} climate vulnerability and migration. However, beyond specific case studies, little is known about this association in global perspective. We therefore provide a descriptive, country-level portrait of this relationship. We show that the negative association between climate vulnerability and international migration holds only for countries least vulnerable to climate change, which suggests the potential for trapped populations in more vulnerable countries. However, when analyzed separately by life supporting sector (food, water, health, ecosystem services, human habitat, and infrastructure) and vulnerability dimension (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), we detect evidence of a relationship among more, but not the most, vulnerable countries. The <b>bilateral</b> (<b>i.</b> e., country-to-country) migration show that, on average, people move from countries of higher vulnerability to lower vulnerability, reducing global risk by 15 %.
