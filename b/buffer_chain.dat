In this paper, we propose the boundary scan design and verification flow using a <b>buffer</b> <b>chain</b> method. The advantages of the proposed flow include: (1) The <b>buffer</b> <b>chain</b> method is easy to implement using Samsung inhouse tool, (2) the flow is effective to solve the post-layout problems at the pre-layout step, and (3) the flow reduces the TAT (Turn Around Time) of the boundary scan design and verification.

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Current Mode Logic buffers {{are based}} on the MOS {{differential}} amplifier circuit. Since CML buffers utilize a differential circuit topology, they are less vulnerable to common-mode noise than standard CMOS buffers. CML buffers are able to operate in higher frequency ranges than standard CMOS buffers, which makes them the optimum choice as output drivers for high-speed integrated circuits. The process of designing a tapered CML <b>buffer</b> <b>chain</b> is explored in this paper, including all important design issues. For this project, a tapered CML <b>buffer</b> <b>chain</b> was designed for a 6 -bit interpolating flash analog-to-digital converter operating at 1 GHz. Electrical and Electronic Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Decoder design {{involves}} {{choosing the}} optimal circuit style {{and figuring out}} their sizing, including adding buffers if necessary. The problem of sizing a simple chain of logic gates has an elegant analytical solution, though {{there have been no}} corresponding analytical results until now which include the resistive effects of the interconnect. Using simple RC models, we analyze the problem of optimally sizing the decoder chain with RC interconnect and find the optimum fan-out to be about 4, just {{as in the case of}} a simple <b>buffer</b> <b>chain.</b> As in the simple <b>buffer</b> <b>chain,</b> supporting a fan-out of 4 often requires noninteger number of stages in the chain. Nevertheless, this result is used to arrive at a tight lower bound on the delay of a decoder. Two simple heuristics for sizing of real decoder with integer stages are examined. We evaluate a simple technique to reduce power, namely, reducing the sizes of the inputs of the word drivers, while sizing each of the subchains for maximum speed, and find that it provides for an efficient mechanism to trade off speed and power. We then use the RC models to compare different circuit techniques in use today and find that decoders with two input gates for all stages after the predecoder and pulse mode circuit techniques with skewed N to P ratios have the best performance. Index Terms—Decoder circuit comparison, low power, optimal decoder structure, optimal sizing, pulsed circuits, random access memory (RAM), resistive interconnect. I...|$|E

Next the paper describes a sizing method for tapered <b>buffer</b> <b>chains.</b> It is shown that the first-order sizing behavior, which considers only the capacitive energy dissipation, can be improved by considering the short-circuit dissipation as well, and that the second-order polynomial expressions for short-circuit energy improves the accuracy over linear expressions. These results are used to derive sizing rules for <b>buffered</b> <b>chains,</b> which optimize the overall energy-delay product...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel table-based approach for efficient {{statistical analysis of}} Finfield effect transistor circuits. The proposed approach uses a new scheme for interpolation of look-up tables (LUTs) with respect to process parameters. The effect of various process parameters, viz., channel length, fin width, and effective oxide thickness is studied for three circuits: <b>buffer</b> <b>chain,</b> {{static random access memory}} cell, and high-gain low-voltage op-amp. Compared to mixed-mode (device-circuit) simulation, the proposed LUT-based approach is shown to be much faster, thus making it practically a feasible and attractive option for variability analysis especially for emerging technologies where compact models are not available for circuit simulation...|$|E

We then study the trade off between power and delay in a standard inverter within a particular <b>buffer</b> <b>chain</b> when reducing {{the size of the}} pull-down device. In the last part of this paper, we present an alternate leakage suppressed inverter for driving large loads. We finally compare the performance of our proposed circuit with those of standard and scaled-down inverters and show that we can significantly reduce the standby power in certain situations with a modest reduction in speed.

40|$|Large digital chips use a {{significant}} amount of energy to distribute a multi-GHz clock. By discharging the clock network to ground every cycle, the energy stored in this large capacitor is wasted. Instead, the energy can be recovered using an on-chip DC-DC converter. This paper investigates the integration of two DC-DC converter topologies, boost and buck-boost, with a high-speed clock driver. The high operating frequency significantly shrinks the required size of the L and C components so they can be placed on-chip; typical converters place them off-chip. The clock driver and DC-DC converter are able to share the entire tapered <b>buffer</b> <b>chain,</b> including the widest drive transistors in the final stage. To achieve voltage regulation, the clock duty cycle must be modulated; implying only single-edge-triggered flops should be used. However, this minor drawback is eclipsed by the benefits: by recovering energy from the clock, the output power can actually exceed the additional power needed to operate the converter circuitry, resulting in an effective efficiency greater than 100 %. Furthermore, the converter output can be used to operate additional power-saving features like low-voltage islands or body bias voltages. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A Dynamic Back End of the Line Customization Technique for Yield Improvement Ardavan Aryanpour, M. Sc July 2010 As CMOS {{technology}} evolves and transistors get smaller, although chip manufacturers benefit {{significantly from}} being able to fit more transistors in a smaller area and also producing chips with lower power dissipation, they have to confront newer problems that are directly related to the size of transistors and the thickness of the deposited layers on a wafer. Smaller transistors are faster and dissipate less power, but the smaller the technology becomes, the harder the fabrication process is to control. Thin silicon, metal and oxide layers must be accurately deposited because any variation in the thickness will cause unexpected behavior in the device. These variations affect many parameters in CMOS. Any slight change in temperature, doping density, deposition timing, etc., can cause a significant change of characteristics of a CMOS device and the variation caused by these changes is called Process Variation (PV). In this thesis, two circuits are taken into study in order to understand how process variation impacts the electrical specifications of a circuit example. The first example is a tapered <b>buffer</b> <b>chain</b> and the second example is a senseamplifier flip flop. The idea is to propose a technique to decrease the loss percentage (Increase the yield). Basically for one specific design a few variant circuit layouts with different power-speed specifications are implemented and {{based on the results of}} the mid fabrication measurements on the test circuits that are deposited throughout the wafer, one of them is chosen with the means of choosing a proper masking sequence.
