5|$|Discussions {{concerning}} {{the scope and}} nature of <b>base</b> <b>development</b> in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s neighbouring South Pacific Area (SOPAC). The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase, while SOPAC {{would be responsible for}} the development of the naval base. The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the initial stages of naval <b>base</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tinian's harbor {{suffered}} from congestion due to extensive <b>base</b> <b>development</b> work, and ships sometimes took months to unload. The {{director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., went to Purnell, who arranged for an order from King to Nimitz stating that all shipments related to the Manhattan Project and the 509th Composite Group had to be unloaded immediately on arrival, regardless of the consequent disruption to the port's operations.|$|E
5|$|In New Guinea, {{logistics}} {{and construction}} activities were coordinated by task force engineer staffs. These were often hastily assembled {{and had not}} {{always been able to}} meet the demands imposed by <b>base</b> <b>development</b> in such a challenging theater of operations. The scale of operations in the Philippines was much greater, so for this purpose the Army Service Command (ASCOM) was formed in Brisbane on 23 July 1944. Casey was appointed to command ASCOM. In his absence, Sverdrup became MacArthur's chief engineer. Although part of USASOS, ASCOM operated under the control of Sixth Army, moving as far forward as combat operations allowed, developed new bases, and operated them until USASOS was ready to take over, at which point the units under ASCOM simply reverted to USASOS, allowing a seamless transfer of command. For the Battle of Leyte Casey's ASCOM had 43,000 men, of whom 21,000 were engineers.|$|E

5|$|The geographical, {{engineering}} and logistical difficulties of conducting operations in SWPA were driven home by Alamo Force's first operation, Operation Chronicle, {{the occupation of}} Woodlark and Kiriwina Islands in June 1943. Despite {{the fact that the}} operation was unopposed by the Japanese, it was subject to delays. Krueger visited Kiriwina, where road work and airbase development were held up by heavy rains, on 11 July. He was dissatisfied with the rate of progress and relieved the task force commander. The arrival of additional engineers sped up the <b>base</b> <b>development</b> effort, and No. 79 Squadron RAAF commenced operations from Kiriwina on 18 August.|$|E
25|$|Later {{applications}} of continuously supported track include Balfour Beatty's 'embedded slab track', {{which uses a}} rounded rectangular rail profile (BB14072) embedded in a slipformed (or pre-cast) concrete <b>base</b> (<b>development</b> 2000s). The 'embedded rail structure', used in the Netherlands since 1976, initially used a conventional UIC54 rail embedded in concrete, and later developed (late 1990s) to use a 'mushroom' shaped SA42 rail profile; a version for light rail using a rail supported in an asphalt concrete–filled steel trough has also been developed (2002).|$|E
25|$|Kirkpatrick {{returned}} to Washington, D.C., in September 1944, {{where he became}} a {{special assistant to the}} Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R.

On Tinian he was responsible for <b>base</b> <b>development</b> in support of Project Alberta and the 509th Composite Group, and was alternate to Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, Groves's deputy for Operations. The facilities would be used for operations including the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For his services to the Manhattan Project he was awarded a second Legion of Merit, and the Commendation Ribbon.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Japanese commanders {{believed}} that the landing at Cape Torokina was only temporary and would be followed up by another move on Buka. As a result, they held off launching a concerted counterattack {{even though there were}} up to 15,000 troops available in southern Bougainville. Meanwhile, further <b>base</b> <b>development</b> saw the Allies establish several airfields inside the Torokina perimeter, which were used to project airpower towards the main Japanese base at Rabaul, while Japanese sea lanes of communication between Rabaul and Bougainville were heavily interdicted. As the conditions necessary for a large-scale counterattack faded, the Japanese 17th Army commander, Hyakutake, was ordered to delay his plans, postponing the assault on Torokina until March 1944.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{estimated}} US {{strength in}} the area to be between 5,000 and 10,000 troops; in reality over 14,000 troops had been landed around Cape Torokina on the first day. These were followed by another 3,500 on 6 November. These troops were drawn from Major General Allen H. Turnage's 3rd Marine Division, which had landed as part of Rear Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson's Third Fleet Amphibious Forces. Following the initial landing operations, Turnage, assisted by Brigadier General Oscar R. Cauldwell, had been in tactical command of the US troops ashore while Lieutenant General Alexander A. Vandegrift returned to Guadalcanal with Wilkinson. As Japanese resistance to the landing petered out, Turnage began reorganizing his forces around the perimeter, establishing patrols and unloading supplies, and commencing important <b>base</b> <b>development</b> work.|$|E
25|$|On 30 January, 300 {{troops from}} the New Zealand 30th Infantry Battalion, along with American and New Zealand {{intelligence}} and communications personnel, were landed on Nissan Island. Escorted by a small naval force including several destroyer escorts, motor torpedo boats and landing craft, the party was tasked with establishing {{the strength of the}} Japanese there, as well as siting landing beaches and determining prospects for <b>base</b> <b>development.</b> The reconnaissance party remained ashore for 24 hours, during which contact was established with the native population who provided intelligence, and several patrols were sent out to survey the ground and determine the dispositions of the local garrison. During this time, there were several minor skirmishes which resulted in four killed and five wounded, before the force was withdrawn by sea to Vella Lavella.|$|E

500|$|In addition, {{there were}} three senior {{officers}} on Tinian, {{who were part of}} the Manhattan Project but not formally part of Project Alberta: Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, the representative of the Military Liaison Committee; [...] Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, Groves' Deputy for Operations; and Colonel Elmer E.

It was estimated that [...] of stores would be required for the construction effort alone. A dredge to clear the harbour was towed from Australia. <b>Base</b> <b>development</b> included improvements to the road system, and establishing an electricity supply, fresh water distillation plant, sewerage system and cold storage. The population of the island would peak at 3,000. The Army Task Group was commanded by Colonel J. E. S. (Jack) Stone; Colonel John Woollett was the garrison commander. [...] The construction force was built around 38 Corps Engineer Regiment, with the 48, 59 and 61 Field Squadrons, and 63 Field Park Squadron, and 12 and 73 Independent Field Squadrons. Part of 25 Engineer Regiment also deployed. They were augmented by two construction troops from the Republic of Fiji Military Forces. With work on the plantations halted {{for the duration of}} Operation Grapple, the Gilbertese civilians were also employed on construction works and unloading the barges.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} ascertain the impact and influence of civil society particularly NGOs in achieving broad <b>based</b> <b>development</b> in the rural district of Mberengwa. The research was prompted {{by the lack of}} effectiveness of civil society in promoting broad <b>based</b> <b>development.</b> There has been mushrooming of CSOs within the development sector but with no significant development gains. The reason for undertaking this study was to identify the role of NGOs in the promotion of broad <b>based</b> <b>development</b> and to find out what causes the ineffectiveness of NGOs in promoting broad <b>based</b> <b>development.</b> The research examined the capacity of these NGOs, weaknesses and challenges in influencing or causing broad <b>based</b> <b>development.</b> A detailed case study was undertaken in the district of Mberengwa; and the impact of the following NGO projects on attaining broad based development: International Labour Organisation TREE project, Care International PRIZE project and World Vision Negove, Nyamhondo, Ngungumbane Area Development Projects. In order for the researcher to come with various answers to his research, data was gathered from beneficiaries of these projects, councillors, Mberengwa District Administrator, District heads of relevant government departments, programme officers of International Labour Organisation, Care International and World Vision. The researcher used a sample of 100 from a population of 490. Descriptive research design was used and questionnaires, field observation, document analysis and interviews were used as research instruments. The study showed that NGOs {{have a positive impact on}} influencing broad <b>based</b> <b>development</b> although they have some shortcomings. However, they are mostly affected by the legal framework under which they are operating. Laws such as Private and Voluntary Organisation Act impose restrictive hindrances that limit NGOs sources of funding which is a critical element to determine the scale of their operation. The study recommends that laws governing civil society in Zimbabwe that restricts the operations of NGOs be repealed or amended. Finally, it is also recommended that further research be undertaken in order to establish how best NGOs can influence broad <b>based</b> <b>development...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile ashore, the {{fighting}} continued. Resistance {{to the initial}} landing was light and was quickly overcome with {{only a small number}} of casualties, which came exclusively in the first wave of the assault. Over the course of several hours, the beachhead around Falamai was secured amidst sporadic resistance from the Japanese and then over the following days patrols were sent out to clear the island. Meanwhile, the force holding Soanotalu fought off several sharp attacks between 29 October and 2 November, including one attack by a company-sized element that resulted in about 40 Japanese being killed. On Stirling Island, the New Zealanders had been virtually unopposed and after landing had settled down to a routine of patrolling and <b>base</b> <b>development.</b> There were a few minor Japanese raids, but largely Japanese air assets were focused on responding to the landing around Cape Torokina, which commenced on 1 November.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout November, US forces {{established}} a perimeter around Cape Torokina, during which significant <b>base</b> <b>development</b> work was undertaken with eight naval construction battalions (Seabees) and a brigade of New Zealand engineers being deployed. This work included {{the construction of}} three airfields and advanced PT boat base on Puruata Island. Advance parties of the 25th, 53rd, 71st and 75th Naval Construction Battalions arrived on the first day. The construction of Torokina Airfield, a fighter airstrip, {{was assigned to the}} 71st Naval Construction Battalion. Work began on the third day. Owing to the limited size of the beachhead, the choice of sites was limited, and the area was still under sniper fire. The [...] airstrip was completed on 10 December, allowing 18 Vought F4U Corsairs to land, although a Douglas SBD Dauntless had already made an emergency landing on 24 November.

2500|$|Construction of a PT-boat base on Puruata Island was {{undertaken}} by the 75th Naval Construction Battalion, {{with help from the}} 71st and 77th Naval Construction Battalions. A wooden pile pier was built, along with crash boat and fueling piers, and 18 small-boat moorings. Base facilities included accommodation, mess halls, five steel-framed warehouses and an emergency hospital. The main medical facility was on Bougainville, and built by the 36th Naval Construction Battalion. It consisted of 70 Quonset hut and a [...] mess hall, with accommodation for 500 patients. The inland road network was the responsibility of the US Army engineers, particularly the 117th Combat Engineer Battalion.
