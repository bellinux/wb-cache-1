In 2000, BC Research was purchased by Immune Network Ltd and was sold to Cromedica (now PRA International) in July 2001 for a consideration of $8.3 million according to 2001 audited financials published on SEDAR. Its plant biotechnology team was mostly spun off in Silvagen Inc. which specialized in clonal reforestation and which became a part of CellFor. In 1999 Azure Dynamics, a hybrid commercial vehicle systems developer, was formed with some of the transportation team and left the facility in 2004 having gone public in 2001 as Azure Dynamics Corporation. [...] Technologies, Inc., specializing in microwave-assisted natural product extraction, purification and isolation, was also spun off in 2001 as a joint venture with Environment Canada.

All modules were developed and refined based on student usability testing. Course implementation permitted student choice of face-to-face, hybrid, or online course formats.

Worldwide, there is an increasing concern on health care that creates a major opportunity for development of new pharmaceutical formulations. Ageing populations worried about {{the quality of life in}} the older years are actively seeking for new, more effective and patient compliant drug delivery devices. This has been the driving force for the continuous growth of the research made on delivery devices, which has become a powerful technique in health care. It has been recognized for long that simple pills or injections may not be the suitable methods of administration of a certain active compound. These medications present several problems and/or limitations, like poor drug bioavailability and systemic toxicity, derived essentially from pharmacokinetic and other carrier limitations and low solubility of the drugs in water. Therefore and to overcome these drawbacks, clinicians recommend frequent drug dosing, at high concentrations, in order to overcome poor drug bioavailability but causing a potential risk of systemic toxicity. Polymer science has open new strategies for drug delivery systems.

Chemical sensing using SPR responses of semiconducting metal oxide films deposited on top of noble metal thin films could offer a simple, sensitive and reliable method {{for the detection of}} low concentration of gases. In this article, ultra-thin SnO 2 /Au bi-layer films of various thicknesses were deposited by pulsed laser deposition technique on BK 7 glass substrates and their SPR responses were measured in the Kretschmann geometry of attenuated total reflection using a polarized light beam at 633 nm wavelength. The widths of the SPR dip and SPR angles were investigated as the function of the SnO 2 and Au layer thickness and the wavelength of excited laser light in order to find the optimized structural parameters for SPR gas sensors based on SnO 2 /Au bi-layer films. The SPR responses of bi-layer films were also simulated with Macleod's general characteristic matrices method in order to compare with experimental data. The simulated results show the similar trend as the experimental date in term of the dependence of SPR angle and width with Au and SnO 2 layer thickness, however, discrepancy between the simulated results and experimental data does existed, particularly, the shape of SPR response predicted by the theory is much broader than the experimental results. The SPR responses of the SnO 2 /Au bi-layer films upon 50 or 100 ppm NO gas exposure were measured and the primary results indicated that gas sensing using the SPR responses of the SnO 2 /Au bi-layer films is feasible.
