5|$|I {{understand}} {{there is a}} clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply for the}} same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to confer the appointment on me.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
25|$|Warne joined English team Accrington Cricket Club in 1991. He {{enjoyed a}} good {{season with the}} ball, taking 73 wickets at 15.4 each, but scored only 330 runs {{at an average of}} 15. The {{committee}} at Accrington Cricket Club decided not to re-engage him for the 1992 Lancashire League season as he was not seen to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{were two}} {{attempts}} to make a U.S. version of Jonathan Creek. The first involved Castle Rock, the production company behind series such as Seinfeld, but the initial scripts were not felt to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough,</b> and David Renwick's scripts were rejected by CBS. The second attempt, also by Renwick, was for Whoopi Goldberg and would have included Alan Davies.|$|E
25|$|Durham won the toss against Leicestershire {{and elected}} to bat first at Grace Road, Leicester. The first day was {{dominated}} by Durham's Australian left-handed opener, Mike Hussey. Hussey may not <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to make the Australian Test squad, but he was good to make an undefeated 165 off 290 balls on a flat pitch on the first day. Former England Under-19 batsman Gordon Muchall helped Hussey add 166 for the third-wicket partnership, before being run out for 82. Durham finished day one on 325 for 3.|$|E
25|$|A CG(X) {{based on}} the Zumwalt hull would lose {{one or both of}} its guns, and replace them with more VLS {{launchers}} for anti-aircraft missiles. However, Zumwalts lack of capability in air defense and BMD was cited as a major reason for the near-cancellation of the class in July 2008. Recent intelligence that China is developing targetable anti-ship ballistic missiles {{based on the}} DF-21 appears to be shaping the Navy's thinking on the CG(X)'s capabilities, when previously Zumwalts air defense was believed to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to justify delaying the introduction of the CG(X).|$|E

25|$|Although Elway's {{performance}} in the AFC Championship Game was widely considered his best ever, many sports writers and fans believed that the Broncos' best effort would not <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to beat the 49ers. After all, Denver had barely defeated the Steelers, who only had a 9–7 regular season record, while the 9–6–1 Cleveland Browns had almost overcome a 17-point second half deficit before Denver put them away in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the Elway-led Broncos had already lost two Super Bowls. On the other hand, the Montana-led 49ers, with their powerful offense, had already won three Super Bowls.|$|E
25|$|Ready-made {{clothing}} {{was available for}} all classes, at a price; {{the cost of a}} new cloak for an ordinary commoner might represent three fifths of their annual subsistence. Clothing was recycled down the social scale, until it fell to rags. Centonarii ("patch-workers") made a living by sewing clothing and other items from recycled fabric patches. Owners of slave-run farms and sheep-flocks were advised that whenever the opportunity arose, female slaves should be fully occupied in the production of homespun woolen cloth; this would likely <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for clothing the better class of slave or supervisor.|$|E
25|$|Then {{came the}} 1985 Indian tour. Mendis {{led from the}} front, scoring three fifties and one series-saving century in the third Test, as India were {{defeated}} 1–0 in three Tests. After that tour, which also included a drawn ODI series, Mendis' career declined, {{and by the end}} of his career it was probably only his captaincy that kept him in. He made two Test fifties in his last ten Tests, and two ODI fifties in his last 32 ODIs following the India tour. Ranjan Madugalle replaced him as captain for the very last Test that Mendis played, where he bowed out with a rearguard 56 that was, however, not to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to save a draw. He remained within the Sri Lankan cricketing sphere, however, as he was manager of the successful 1996 Cricket World Cup side.|$|E

25|$|The DSSC has {{a number}} of {{attractive}} features; it is simple to make using conventional roll-printing techniques, is semi-flexible and semi-transparent which offers a variety of uses not applicable to glass-based systems, and most of the materials used are low-cost. In practice it has proven difficult to eliminate a number of expensive materials, notably platinum and ruthenium, and the liquid electrolyte presents a serious challenge to making a cell suitable for use in all weather. Although its conversion efficiency is less than the best thin-film cells, in theory its price/performance ratio should <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to allow them to compete with fossil fuel electrical generation by achieving grid parity. Commercial applications, which were held up due to chemical stability problems, are forecast in the European Union Photovoltaic Roadmap to significantly contribute to renewable electricity generation by 2020.|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle won a {{place at}} St Cyr in 1909; his grading was mediocre (119th out of 221 entrants) but he was {{relatively}} young and this was his first attempt at the exam. Under a law of 21 March 1905, aspiring army officers were required to serve {{a year in the}} ranks, including time both as a private and as an NCO, before attending the academy. Accordingly, in October 1909 de Gaulle enlisted (for four years, as required, rather than the normal two year term for conscripts) in the 33rd Infantry Regiment of the French Army, based at Arras. This was an historic regiment with Austerlitz, Wagram and Borodino amongst its battle honours. In April 1910 he was promoted to corporal. His company commander declined to promote him to sergeant, the usual rank for a potential officer, commenting that the young man clearly felt that nothing less than Constable of France would <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for him. He was eventually promoted to sergeant in September 1910.|$|E
25|$|Arachne {{is upset}} that Spider-Man {{has not taken}} her bait, and she visits him in another dream {{in which the two}} of them get married. When that does not work, she uses a {{headline}} in the Daily Bugle about 50 stolen pairs of shoes to weasel her way into the office of J. Jonah Jameson. Her furies steal the shoes for themselves and descend upon Jameson ("Deeply Furious"). Arachne convinces him to run a headline pronouncing Spider-Man a needed hero, and he does. After enjoying the blackout and its intimacy, MJ and Peter come to a standstill: because of the dreams and the added pressure of needing Spider-Man, Peter doesn't think he can <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for MJ anymore. She assures him that he is all she needs in the world ("If the World Should End"). On a path of soul-searching, Peter realizes that if MJ loves him then he can go on being Spider-Man; he finds his inner hero and vanquishes the Sinister Six ("The Boy Falls From the Sky").|$|E

25|$|Cognitive {{emotions}} and states {{tend to be}} felt {{in the initial stages}} of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive {{emotions and}} responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them (Miller, 2017). Jealousy may become cognitive whenever an individual begins to process what their partner is out doing or what they see in the person they are cheating with that they don’t see in them. Resentment and the feeling of incompetence take on the cognitive state in the initial stages when the individual begins to recognize and feel that nothing they do or say will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> or just enough to get the infidelity suspicious to cease. Anger takes on cognitive emotional traits whenever the accuser notices and realizes why they are feeling so angry and the accused is confronted with it. Like previously stated, the initial stages of cheating are when it cannot be proven by the suspicious partner. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, {{there were}} 50 GMs (USSR: 19, Yugoslavia: 7, USA: 5, Argentina: 4, West Germany: 2, France: 2, Sweden: 1, Czechoslovakia: 1, Hungary: 1, Austria: 1, Belgium: 1, Denmark: 1, Netherlands: 1, Poland: 1). In 1972, there were 88 GMs with 33 {{representing}} the USSR. The current FIDE ratings list includes over 1000 Grandmasters. Nigel Short was rated the third {{best player in}} the world in 1989 with a rating of 2650; in the 21st century such a rating would only <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for a player to reach the top 100 or so, with the third {{best player in the}} world usually rated around 2800. Other minor factors come into play: there are more tournaments worldwide and cheaper air travel makes them more accessible to globe-trotting chess professionals, who include many players from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe whose movements are no longer restricted as they were before the 1990s. Additionally, players can make norms in tournaments that would have been previously considered too short for norms, making norms easier to get and allowing for more norm tournaments to be held.|$|E
