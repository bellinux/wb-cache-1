5|$|Jon Snow {{is first}} {{introduced}} in A Game of Thrones (1996), {{as he and}} his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed {{from the rest of the}} Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a good family. At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat.|$|E

25|$|Theophrastus, in On the Causes of Plants, {{does not}} give as {{systematic}} and detailed an account of olive husbandry as he does of the vine, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> clear (in 1.16.10) that the cultivated olive must be vegetatively propagated; indeed, the pits give rise to thorny, wild-type olives, spread far and wide by birds. Theophrastus reports how the bearing olive can be grafted on the wild olive, for which the Greeks had a separate name, kotinos. In his Enquiry into Plants (2.1.2–4) he states that the olive can be propagated from {{a piece of the}} trunk, the root, a twig, or a stake.|$|E

In the summer of 1991, she finally awakes from the coma, and makes {{her way back to}} Salem. She and Roman are reunited until another man with Roman's original face returns to Salem.

The real Roman has been held captive, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> his way back to Salem and Marlena. She is conflicted about her feelings for Roman and his substitute, who goes back to using his self-given name, John Black. Marlena and Roman reunited.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relevant}} to note here that Turner was extremely conservative in {{his use of the}} word “Indian.” Instead he referred to the different Indian peoples by their culture’s name, such as Yaqui or Aztec, in order to humanize and emphasize their identities. For Turner, Díaz “created a machine and oiled the machine with the flesh and blood of a people. He rewarded all except the people; the people were the sacrifice.” Indians were seen as chattel and although Díaz’s regime justified its means for this treatment, Turner emphasizes this point. Additionally, Turner does not explicitly mention the científicos, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> a stand against the “scientific knowledge” of that time in regard to race; in a way, against positivism. He indirectly brings up issues surrounding the Indian questions of labor—through haciendas—and of education. Turner points out that regardless of the public primary schools that had been built, “what promise does study hold out for a youth born to shoulder a debt of his father and carry it {{to the end of his}} days?” At its core, Turner’s question embodies the meaning of slavery, because that is precisely what he saw.|$|E

500|$|Hazlitt also {{reflects}} on Shakespeare's {{thorough understanding of}} the complexity of human character. Queen Gertrude, [...] "who was so criminal in some respects [...] not without sensibility and affection in other relations of life." [...] Again, he comments on the idea expressed by other critics that some characters are too inconsistent in their behaviour to be plausible, particularly Polonius. If [...] "his advice to [...] Laertes is very excellent, and his advice to the King and Queen on the subject of Hamlet's madness very ridiculous", that is [...] "because [...] kept up the distinction which there is in nature, between the understandings and the moral habits of men. [...] Polonius is not a fool, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> himself so." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{popular press}} {{focused on the}} {{relationship}} between Jagger and Richards. Graham Smith in the Daily Mail said, [...] "Unsurprisingly, The Rolling Stones guitarist isn't entirely complimentary towards his childhood friend. But nobody was expecting him to decimate Jagger's status as a legendary ladies' man by revealing the singer has a [...] "tiny todger", before quoting Richards, [...] "Because I love the man dearly; I'm still his mate. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> it very difficult to be his friend." [...] Tom Bryant in The Daily Mirror wrote, [...] "Keith says his songwriting partner 'started to become unbearable' in the early 80s, adding: 'I think Mick thinks I belong to him but I haven't been to his dressing room in 20 years.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Eckhart first gained wide {{exposure}} in 2000 as George, a ponytailed, goateed biker, in Steven Soderbergh's drama Erin Brockovich. The film {{was met with}} reasonable reviews, and was a box office success, earning $256million worldwide. His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation. Sure, I didn't earn any money for nine months, but every day I was reading scripts, I was producing my own material, I was taking meetings, I was working on my craft." ...|$|E

I wonder if the drug might be more fascinating for him than the feeling of returning to the entertainment industry, [...] " [...] and concluded, [...] "I cannot take any more. Regrettably, this is the end. It is no longer possible for him to restore his reputation." [...] He had been appearing in the radio program named [...] "Tashiro Nakamura　Nanbu Akua-Chan", broadcast in Rainbowtown FM, aimed at supporting Tashiro's comeback, where nobody got paid even once before the programme was cancelled.|$|E

King James, softened by his affection for Elena, decides to forgive Douglas; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> a show of severity by condemning Malcolm. [...] Finally, he relents and brings the young couple together. In her rondo finale, Elena rejoices to have saved both her father and her true love, while everyone else rejoices that peace has been restored: (Rondo: Tanti affetti in tal momento! mi si fanno al core intorno, che l’immenso mio contento / [...] "So many emotions at such moment / Come clamouring about my heart / That I cannot explain to you / My immense happiness") ...|$|E

2500|$|Both took {{command of}} a financially strong company (working capital {{increased}} {{from a low}} of $46 million in 1957, to $103 million, and the firm eliminated all long-term debt), with sales increasing from $362 million (91,469 automobiles) in 1957, to more than $1 billion (422,273 total units) in 1960. Abernethy predicted a total of 450,000 Ramblers to be delivered for the 1962 year, despite increasing competition from the new domestic-made compact cars offered by the Big Three. However, Abernethy [...] "was more or less given an anchor and told to swim" [...] after taking over the automaker from Romney. He [...] "may lack some of the eloquence of his predecessor, George Romney, who revived the company in the late 1950s, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> up for it with vocal volume." [...] One of the first tasks for the small automaker was to make its capital work harder in the face of competition with the automotive giants.|$|E
2500|$|Seid {{and his men}} {{express their}} {{feelings}} that Allah will protect them: Salve, Allah! tutta quanta / [...] "Hail Allah! All the earth resounds with his mighty name".

Suddenly everyone notices flames at sea: the Pasha's fleet is burning. As the Dervish whips off his disguise and reveals himself to be Corrado, his corsairs invade the banquet, and a battle takes place. At first, it seems that Corrado and his men will win, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> a fatal mistake. Seeing that the harem is burning, Corrado decides to rescue Gulnara and the other women. This gives the Pasha and his men time to regroup. They take Corrado prisoner and Seid confronts him - Audace cotanto, mostrarti pur sai? / [...] "Yet so bold do you stand before me" [...] - as he condemns Corrado to a grisly death, in spite of pleas from Gulnara and the harem to spare him for saving their lives.|$|E
2500|$|Sam {{fails to}} earn {{schooling}} qualifications, but she gains attention {{because of her}} looks after winning the title of [...] "Miss Queen Vic" [...] at the local public house; she starts to believe she can have a career modelling, but when she attempts to get a portfolio done by a professional photographer, he persuades her to do a topless shoot and the photos are then published in a pornographic magazine. This causes problems in Ricky and Sam's relationship, which is already under strain as Ricky is unable to provide Sam with the luxurious lifestyle she desires. After just a year of marriage, Sam grows bored and begins lusting after a playboy named Clive (Sean Gallagher) whom she meets at a New Year's Eve party with her friend Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton). After having a brief affair, Sam thinks she has {{fallen in love with}} Clive, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> it clear that he is only interested in sex when he tries to coax her into having a threesome.

2500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{compared}} {{the film to}} other horror sequels and recently released slasher films of the early 1980s {{rather than to the}} original. [...] "By the standards of most recent horror films, this—like its predecessor—is a class act." [...] She notes that there [...] "is some variety to the crimes, as there is to the characters, and an audience is more likely to do more screaming at suspenseful moments than at scary ones." [...] Maslin applauded the performance of the cast and Rosenthal and concluded, [...] "That may not be much to ask of a horror film, but it's more than many of them offer." [...] David Pirie's review in Time Out magazine gave Rosenthal's film positive marks, stating, [...] "Rosenthal is no Carpenter, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> a fair job of emulating the latter's visual style in this sequel." [...] He wrote that the Myers character had evolved since the first film to become [...] "an agent of Absolute Evil." [...] Film historian Jim Harper suggests, [...] "Time has been a little fairer to the film" [...] than original critics. In retrospect, [...] "many critics have come to recognise that it's considerably better than the slew of imitation slashers that swamped the genre in the eighties." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first two}} letters of Ecruliani's {{treatise}} were addressed to Giorgio Garnero (1550-1614), [...] "a Burgundian medical writer", while the third letter consisted of his responses to her philosophical viewpoints. [...] In {{an excerpt from}} Erculiani's letter to Garnero, she speculated that the Biblical flood occurred because of an imbalance between earth and man: [...] " [...] occurred because men's presence on earth had increased so much in number, size, and lifespan, that {{around the time of}} the sin, the earth element, which dominates men, was much diminished; nor had it been replenished for centuries, with the result that [...] was so greatly diminished that it was necessarily swallowed up by water, which had contributed little of itself to [...] men."Erculiani later followed up the statement within her fourth letter, addressed to Queen Anna's [...] "chancellor for Transylvania", Martin Berzevicy (1538-1596), who visited Padua in 1568. [...] She expressed her belief that God and nature work in unison: [...] "it is true that the doctors of the church and the divine theologians have put forth different causes and reasons; but for me, it is enough to say that God and Nature herself do not contradict those causes, <b>but</b> <b>He</b> <b>makes</b> use of her in His works." ...|$|E
2500|$|The two Natures {{and the two}} Reasons imply two societies. Edmund is the New Man, {{a member}} of an age of competition, suspicion, glory, in {{contrast}} with the older society which has come down from the Middle Ages, with its belief in co-operation, reasonable decency, and respect for the whole as greater than the part. King Lear is thus an allegory. The older society, that of the medieval vision, with its doting king, falls into error, and is threatened by the new Machiavellianism; it is regenerated and saved by a vision of a new order, embodied in the king's rejected daughter. Cordelia, in the allegorical scheme, is threefold: a person; an ethical principle (love); and a community. Nevertheless, Shakespeare's understanding of the New Man is so extensive as to amount almost to sympathy. Edmund is the last great expression in Shakespeare of that side of Renaissance individualism – the energy, the emancipation, the courage – which has made a positive contribution to the heritage of the West. [...] "He embodies something vital which a final synthesis must reaffirm. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>makes</b> an absolute claim which Shakespeare will not support. It is right for man to feel, as Edmund does, that society exists for man, not man for society. It is not right to assert the kind of man Edmund would erect to this supremacy." ...|$|E
