On the possibility of a sequel, Lundgren said: [...] "I didn't consider [...] as a franchise, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> over there , I started thinking, 'How would I do this different? How would I stay close to the subject matter?' Organ trafficking is quite big as well, so I thought that could be interesting. We could follow up with some kind of other trade." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|One of Oscorp's leading {{scientific}} minds who {{attempts to}} engineer a revolutionary regeneration serum to help regrow limbs and human tissue. Something goes wrong, {{and he is}} transformed into the monster known as the Lizard. Ifans said his character spends {{the majority of the}} film as a human. While playing the 9-foot-tall reptile, Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit. Initially, a large stunt-double was used as a stand-in for the role, but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character. Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life, Ifans continued, [...] "I had a green suit on, and then this cardboard head, and these small claws... Each and every time you see the Lizard, the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard's eyes move, they're my eyes. If I frown or show any emotion, they're my emotions. That's how spectacularly advanced technology is." [...] Ifans said that he voiced the man-beast as well, explaining, [...] "I'm sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> shooting the CGI moments, when I wasn't actually human, when I was Lizard, I looked like a crash-test dummy in a green leotard thing. There were many moments when I had to speak to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard." ...|$|E

500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a Stylist magazine, Duffy said of {{becoming}} poet laureate, [...] "There's no requirement. I do get {{asked to do}} things and so far I've been happy to do them." [...] She also spoke about being appointed to the role by Queen Elizabeth II, saying, [...] "She's lovely! I met her before I became poet laureate <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> appointed I had an 'audience' with her which meant we were alone, at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry. Her mother was friends with Ted Hughes whose poetry I admire a lot. We spoke about his influence on me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pei {{encouraged}} {{criticism of}} the governance and often promoted officials who submitted good criticism. [...] On one occasion, when the officials Dugu Yu (獨孤郁), Li Zhengci (李正辭), and Yan Xiufu (嚴休復) were set to be promoted from being Shiyi (拾遺) to Bujue (補闕), they met him to thank him. [...] Pei commented, [...] "The Bujue Dugu and Li often submitted their best thoughts, {{and now they are}} finally being promoted. [...] I am embarrassed that that is all they are receiving for their labor. [...] The Bujue Yan might have had uncommon achievements, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> submitting your promotion, I had hesitations." [...] This caused Yan much embarrassment.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Rosberg was booed by the crowd, mirroring a similar incident towards {{him at the}} previous race in Belgium. Hamilton later told the press {{that he did not}} feel comfortable about the fans behaving in such a manner: [...] "I've had it here, years and years ago, and it's great personally for me to have such great support, from the Ferrari fans and the Mercedes fans. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> up there, it was awkward for me to hear them booing Nico because I just don't like that in sport." [...] Wolff affirmed that booing should not be heard on the podium but acknowledged Formula One is an emotional sport for its fan base while also saying: [...] "It's a sport and sport should unite." [...] When asked about the booing in the press conference, Rosberg replied while it was [...] "not nice" [...] he hoped over time the fans would forgive him for his past actions. In the podium interviews, conducted by former driver Jean Alesi, Massa expressed his happiness on standing on the podium and was certain luck was beside him and that there was [...] "a lot more to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 1998, Šakić {{was interviewed}} by Argentine {{national}} television. The full interview was broadcast on El Trece on 6 April. In it, Šakić admitted to being in a leadership position at Jasenovac from December 1942 to October 1944 but denied that anyone had been killed during this time. He said: [...] "When I was there no guard or administrator was allowed to so much as touch a prisoner. I'm not speaking {{about what it was}} like before or afterward, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there no one could touch anyone". Šakić claimed all the deaths that occurred during his command came as a result of natural causes. The interview caused a public uproar, with Argentine president Carlos Menem calling for Šakić's arrest a day after the broadcast. Šakić disappeared soon afterwards. His wife claimed that he had left to seek refuge in the Croatian Embassy in Buenos Aires, which the embassy denied. She stated that her husband had not committed acts of genocide in Jasenovac, saying: [...] "It's such a huge lie. I am distraught. After fifty years, they come up with an atrocious thing like this". Dinko Šakić was arrested on 1 May.|$|E

2500|$|Nolan {{compared}} Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), as a {{film about}} human nature. He also sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). He stated: [...] "When you say you're making a family film, it has all these pejorative connotations that it'll be somehow soft. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid, these were family films in the best sense, and they were as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum. I wanted to bring that back in some way." [...] He also cited the space drama The Right Stuff (1983) as an example to follow and screened it for the crew before production. To emulate that film, he sought to capture reflection on the Interstellar astronauts' visors. For further inspiration grounded in real-world space travel, the director also invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set. Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and sought to emulate the look of their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of a spacecraft interior.|$|E
2500|$|Although details, {{such as the}} superlaser's location, shifted between {{different}} concept models during production of Star Wars, {{the notion of the}} Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them. George Lucas gave the original task of designing a [...] "Death Star" [...] to concept artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell, who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film [...] In a 2016 interview, Cantwell related that [...] "I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle." [...] As it [...] "would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and refill this depression," [...] Cantwell suggested a trench to Lucas to save the labor. Lucas liked the idea, and the Death Star model was created by John Stears. The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials. Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light & Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi. Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film. Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.|$|E
2500|$|Derulo {{commented on}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest that [...] "This album {{has a lot}} of dimensions, 'The Other Side' and 'Marry Me' was one side. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making this album, I wasn’t {{thinking}} about making hit songs... it was just about getting myself out of the darkness. It came from an honest place, I feel like it’s me" [...] Much of the new material incorporates hip hop and R styles unlike previously seen in Derulo's earlier albums. Four new songs were recorded for Talk Dirty: [...] "Wiggle" [...] (with Snoop Dogg), [...] "Zipper", [...] "Bubblegum" [...] (with Tyga) and [...] "Kama Sutra" [...] (with Kid Ink). The newly recorded material for the reissue follow the [...] "provocative nature and upbeat sound of the aforementioned" [...] title track Talk Dirty. [...] "Wiggle" [...] is an [...] "upbeat club-ready" [...] hip-hop infused R song that's all about a woman's [...] "big fat butt". Compared to the [...] "matching the slinky nature" [...] of the album's title track, the song features guest vocals from Snoop Dogg. Ricky Reed from Wallpaper. produced [...] "Wiggle", while also handling the song's music and programming with assistance from [...] Axident, Joe London and John Ryan. The song was recorded by Alex Granelli at Serenity West Recording in Los Angeles, Tha Compound in Los Angeles and at Start From Infinity [...] "Joshua Tree Sessions". It was mixed by Manny Marroquin with additional engineering provided by Ricky Reed, Axident, John Ryan, Joe Spargur and Alex Granelli. It was mastered by Chris Gehringer at Sterling Sound in New York City. Speaking to NewNowNext, Derulo described it as [...] "a song that you can’t help but move to. If the person next to you is not moving, don’t trust that person—that is not a good person".|$|E
