40|$|Piezoelectric {{nanomaterials}} (PNs) {{are attractive}} for applications including sensing, actuating, energy harvesting, among others in nano-electro-mechanical-systems (NEMS) {{because of their}} excellent electromechanical coupling, mechanical and physical properties. However, the properties of PNs do not coincide with their bulk counterparts and depend on the particular size. A large amount of efforts have been devoted to studying the size-dependent properties of PNs by using experimental characterization, atomistic simulation and continuum mechanics modeling with the consideration of the scale features of the nanomaterials. This paper reviews the recent progresses and achievements in the research on the continuum mechanics modeling of the size-dependent mechanical and physical properties of PNs. We start from the fundamentals of the modified continuum mechanics models for PNs, including the theories of surface piezoelectricity, flexoelectricity and non-local piezoelectricity, {{with the introduction of}} the modified piezoelectric beam and plate models particularly for nanostructured piezoelectric materials with certain configurations. Then, we give a review on the investigation of the size-dependent properties of PNs by using the modified continuum mechanics models, such as the electromechanical coupling, bending, vibration, <b>buckling,</b> <b>wave</b> propagation and dynamic characteristics. Finally, analytical modeling and analysis of nanoscale actuators and energy harvesters based on piezoelectric nanostructures are presented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a bridging research between a modeling methodology in quantum mechanics/relativity and elasticity. Using the symplectic method commonly applied in quantum mechanics and relativity, a new symplectic elasticity {{approach is developed}} for deriving exact analytical solutions to some basic problems in solid mechanics and elasticity which have long been bottlenecks {{in the history of}} elasticity. In specific, it is applied to bending of rectangular thin plates where exact solutions are hitherto unavailable. It employs the Hamiltonian principle with Legendre’s transformation. Analytical bending solutions could be obtained by eigenvalue analysis and expansion of eigenfunctions. Here, bending analysis requires the solving of an eigenvalue equation unlike in classical mechanics where eigenvalue analysis is only required in vibration and buckling problems. Furthermore, unlike the semi-inverse approaches in classical plate analysis employed by Timoshenko and others such as Navier’s solution, Levy’s solution, Rayleigh–Ritz method, etc. where a trial deflection function is pre-determined, this new symplectic plate analysis is completely rational without any guess functions and yet it renders exact solutions beyond the scope of applicability of the semi-inverse approaches. In short, the symplectic plate analysis developed in this paper {{presents a}} breakthrough in analytical mechanics in which an area previously unaccountable by Timoshenko’s plate theory and the likes has been trespassed. Here, examples for plates with selected boundary conditions are solved and the exact solutions discussed. Comparison with the classical solutions shows excellent agreement. As the derivation of this new approach is fundamental, further research can be conducted not only on other types of boundary conditions, but also for thick plates as well as vibration, <b>buckling,</b> <b>wave</b> propagation, etc...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} 25 {{complete}} cylinders was tested experimentally {{to determine the}} effects of stiffening elements on the buckling of cylinders with moderate wall thickness, and to present a physical basis for an understanding of the mechanism of cylinder buckling. It was found that both axial and circumferential stiffeners spaced at distances comparable to the <b>buckle</b> <b>wave</b> length of the unstiffened cylinder will raise the buckling stress, reduce the wave length, and alter the shape of the <b>buckling</b> <b>waves.</b> It was shown that for cylinders of D/t = 400, the addition of axial stiffening as little as 2 % or 3 % of the cylinder wall material can raise the buckling stress by 30 % over the unstiffened case. The experiments of this study lend support to a theory developed by Donnell and Wan which ascribes the reduction of the buckling stress of a real cylinder below the classical theoretical value to the initial imperfections of construction in the real cylinder. Conversely, the results cast doubt on the validity of the theory which explains the "premature" failure on the basis of external energy disturbances present in the testing laboratory. It was shown that the <b>buckling</b> <b>waves</b> of a reasonably well-made cylinder develop with extreme rapidity without the necessity of a change in cylinder length, and are fully developed in their lateral dimensions throughout the buckling process. Some previous results of Kanemitsu and Nojima which exhibited an essentially different buckling mechanism were explained as the consequence of excessive initial imperfection.

40|$|Edge effects play an {{important}} role for many properties of graphene. While most works have focused on the effects from isolated free edges, we present a novel knotting phenomenon induced by the interactions between a pair of free edges in graphene, and investigate its effect on the buckling of monolayer graphene. Upon compression, the buckling of graphene starts gradually in the form of two <b>buckling</b> <b>waves</b> from the warped edges. The collision of these two <b>buckling</b> <b>waves</b> results {{in the creation of a}} knot structure in graphene. The knot structure enables the buckled graphene to exhibit two unique post-buckling characteristics. First, it induces a five-fold increase in graphene's mechanical stiffness during the buckling process. Second, the knotted structure enables graphene to exhibit a mechanically stable post-buckling regime over a large (3 %) compressive strain regime, which is significantly larger than the critical buckling strain of about 0. 5 %. The combination of these two effects enables graphene to exhibit an unexpected post-buckling stability that has previously not been reported. We predict that numerical simulations or experiments should observe two distinct stress strain relations for the buckling of identical graphene samples, due to the characteristic randomness in the formation process of the knot structure.

40|$|The problem {{considered}} {{in this paper}} concerns the edge-wave buckling phenomenon commonly encountered in forming processes such as rolling and levelling.

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that the non-contact buckling response of long rectangular plates subjected to compressive or shearing loadings is {{solely dependent on}} material and section properties, as well as boundary conditions along the two unloaded side edges. In addition, the boundary conditions at the loaded ends do not influence the critical load. The above rule was also applied to the analysis and design of plates in unilateral contact with elastic or rigid mediums although without any reasonable verification. The results contained in this paper reveal that the boundary condition at the loaded edges (end conditions) significantly affects the contact buckling performance. To investigate the end condition effect, a transfer function method is employed herein to study the initial buckling behaviour of thin plates with different boundary conditions resting on tensionless elastic or rigid foundations. For very long plates with both ends clamped, the buckling mode {{can be considered as}} a series of periodically repeating <b>buckling</b> <b>waves</b> and an infinite plate model with only one <b>buckle</b> <b>wave</b> being effective to predict the buckling behaviour. However, for long plates with simply supported loaded ends, local effects dominate the buckling mode and the buckling loads can be reduced by up to 18 % compared to long plates with clamped loaded ends. Experimental tests and ABAQUS modelling also verify that the critical stresses for plates with simply supported loaded ends are lower than those for plates with clamped loaded ended plates...|$|R

40|$|Change of {{the bonding}} {{environment}} at the free edges of graphene monolayer leads to excess edge energy and edge force, {{depending on the}} edge morphology (zigzag or armchair). By using a reactive empirical bond-order potential and atomistic simulations, we show that the excess edge energy in free-standing graphene nanoribbons can be partially relaxed by both in-plane and out-of-plane deformation. The excess edge energy and edge force are calculated for graphene nanoribbons with parallel zigzag or armchair edges. Depending on the longitudinal constraint, the compressive edge force leads to either in-plane elongation of the ribbon or out-of-plane buckling deformation. In the former case, the longitudinal strain is inversely proportional to the ribbon width. In the latter case, energy minimization predicts an intrinsic wavelength for edge buckling to be 6. 2 nm along the zigzag edge and 8. 0 nm along the armchair edge. For graphene nanoribbons of width less than the intrinsic wavelength, interaction between the two free edges becomes significant, leading to anti-phase correlation of the <b>buckling</b> <b>waves.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 10 figures, and 1 tabl...|$|R

40|$|Cone-cylinder intersections are {{commonly}} found in pressure vessels and piping. Examples include conical end closures to cylindrical vessels and conical reducers between cylinders of different radii. In {{the case of a}} cone large end-to-cylinder intersection under internal pressure, the intersection is subject to a large circumferential compressive force. Both the cone and the cylinder may be thickened near the intersection to resist this compression, but it is often convenient and necessary to augment further the strength of the intersection using an annular plate ring stiffener. Under this large circumferential compression, the intersection may fail by elastic buckling, plastic buckling or plastic collapse. This paper describes an investigation of the elastic buckling strength of ring-stiffened cone-cylinder intersections. Two buckling modes are identified: a shell mode for thin intersections with a shallow cone (a cone with its apex half angle approaching 90 °) and/or a relatively stocky ring stiffener, and a ring mode for other cases. An existing elastic buckling approximation for annular plate rings in steel silos is found to be applicable to the intersection when it buckles in the ring mode. New approximate design equations are also established for the shell mode. In addition, simple expressions are identified which relate the number of circumferential <b>buckling</b> <b>waves</b> to the geometric parameters of the intersection.

40|$|AbstractAs {{the major}} {{structural}} constituent of the cytoskeleton, microtubules (MTs) serve {{a variety of}} biological functions that range from facilitating organelle transport to maintaining the mechanical integrity of the cell. Neuronal MTs exhibit a distinct configuration, hexagonally packed bundles of MT filaments, interconnected by MT-associated protein (MAP) tau. Building on our previous work on mechanical response of axonal MT bundles under uniaxial tension, this study is focused on exploring the compression scenarios. Intracellular MTs carry a large fraction of the compressive loads sensed by the cell and therefore, like any other column-like structure, are prone to substantial bending and buckling. Various biological activities, e. g., actomyosin contractility and many pathological conditions are driven or followed by bending, looping, and buckling of MT filaments. The coarse-grained model previously developed in our lab {{has been used to}} study the mechanical behavior of individual and bundled in vivo MT filaments under uniaxial compression. Both configurations show tip-localized, decaying, and short-wavelength buckling. This behavior highlights the role of the surrounding cytoplasm and MAP tau on MT buckling behavior, which allows MT filaments to bear much larger compressive forces. It is observed that MAP tau interconnections improve this effect by a factor of two. The enhanced ability of MT bundles to damp <b>buckling</b> <b>waves</b> relative to individual MT filaments, may be interpreted as a self-defense mechanism because it helps axonal MTs to endure harsher environments while maintaining their function. The results indicate that MT filaments in a bundle do not buckle simultaneously implying that the applied stress is not equally shared among the MT filaments, that is a consequence of the nonuniform distribution of MAP tau proteins along the bundle length. Furthermore, from a pathological perspective, it is observed that axonal MT bundles are more vulnerable to failure in compression than tension...|$|R

Accordingly, the accurate determination of their behavior {{becomes more and more}} important. One of the most important problems in spherical shell behavior is the determination of buckling loads either experimentally or theoretically. Therefore, in this study some elastic and plastic buckling problems associated with spherical shells are investigated. The first part of this research study presents the analytical, numerical, and experimental results of moderately thick and thin hemispherical metal shells into the plastic buckling range illustrating the importance of geometry changes on the buckling load. The hemispherical shell is rigidly supported around the base circumference against horizontal translation and the load is vertically applied by a rigid cylindrical boss (Loading actuator) at the apex. Kinematics stages of initial buckling and subsequent propagation of plastic deformation for a rigid-perfectly plastic shell models are formulated on the basis of Drucker- Shield's limited interaction yield condition. The effect of the radius of the boss used to apply the loading, on the initial and subsequent collapse load is studied. In the numerical model, the material is assumed to be isotropic and linear elastic perfectly plastic without strain hardening obeying the Tresca or Von Mises yield criterion. Finally, the results of the analytical solution are compared and verified with the numerical results using ABAQUS software and experimental findings. Good agreement is observed between the load-deflection curves obtained using three different fundamental approaches. In the second part, the Southwell’s nondestructive method for columns is analytically extended to spherical shells subjected to uniform external pressure acting radially. Subsequently finite element simulation and experimental work shown that the theory is applicable to spherical shells with an arbitrary axi-symmetrical loading too. The results showed that the technique provides a useful estimate of the elastic buckling load provided care is taken in interpreting the results. The usefulness of the method lies in its generality, simplicity and in the fact that, it is non-destructive.

Within a range of shear rates from 2 to 100 s(- 1) at 25 degreesC {{the transition from the}} L-alpha, phase to MLVs in the C 10 E 3 system apparently is controlled by strai. This transition involves an intermediate structure with cylindrical scattering symmetry. This can be interpreted as multilamellar cylinders (MLCs) or as a coherent stripe <b>buckling</b> with the <b>wave</b> vector of the undulation in a neutral direction. The intermediate structures found along the transition path are stable for long times, when shear is turned off. This allows for studies on trapped intermediate structures and experiments where different positions within the gap of a couette shear cell were examined in so-called gap-scan experiments. These experiments revealed that the transition from planar lainellae to MLVs is homogeneous throughout the gap. A temperature increase to 32 degreesC changes neither the pathway nor the strain control in comparison with experiments run at 25 degreesC. Upon a further increase in temperature to 38 degreesC, the transition leads to a mixture of MLC and planar lamellae or a weakly buckled state.

40|$|Suhr, JonghwanWei, BingqingDue to the {{outstanding}} mechanical, thermal and electronic properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), CNT and CNT reinforced polymer composite {{are becoming more}} and more pervasive in engineering applications, especially in energy absorbing and damping materials. Therefore, the underlying mechanism of the intriguing mechanical properties of CNT arrays and CNT reinforced composites is an essential and fundamental science for the potential applications of CNT related materials. It is fundamental and critical to investigate the mechanical properties of CNTs first, since the intrinsic properties and collective behavior of CNTs play an important role in the mechanical response of composite. The buckling behavior of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT) was investigated. By taking van der Waals interactions into account, both experiments and modeling results confirm that VACNTs buckle in the bottom region with a high mode <b>buckling,</b> following <b>wave</b> damping effect. Then, the compressive behavior of VACNTs was quantified by strain energy density function. The effects of CNT structure/morphology, including diameter, cross section area, moment of inertia, defect degree and density, on mechanical properties were statistically investigated and compared with cellular materials, showing significant influence on determining the mechanical properties of VACNTs. The focus of CNT polymer composites is on the application-oriented viscoelastic properties. The static viscoelastic characterization was conducted by creep and stress relaxation tests with stress/strain variation and quantified by nonlinear power-law model. The dynamic properties were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) with frequency variation. And CNTs show significant enhancement in elastic response and considerable influence on viscous response. In addition, the temperature effects were investigated and composites show better thermal stability. By using timetemperature superposition (TTS) and Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) fitting, the prediction scale of viscoelastic behavior in time/frequency range can be significant enlarged. The viscoelastic responses are complicated by the intrinsic anisotropy of CNTs, so it is also essential to study their anisotropic properties. The compressive and viscoelastic characterization were performed on longitudinal, transverse and random composites and compared with PDMS. The results confirm the exceptional reinforcement of CNTs in longitudinal composites, which have lateral support from polymer matrix. And the increased damping effects of composites can be explained by the interfacial sliding and the energy dissipation between nanotubes and polymer matrix. Furthermore, the fatigue tests of CNT polymer composites were performed to investigate mechanical robustness and long-term stability. From the stress-number of cycles (S-N) data in cyclic DMA tests, CNTs improved the fatigue life of composites considerably, especially in high-cycle fatigue strength, caused by the hindering of crack propagation from CNTs, the interface debonding and the CNT reinforcement effects. Also, the microscopy images of fracture surfaces indicate different fatigue resistance and different fracture/crack mechanism between longitudinal and transverse composites.

In Eurocode 4 - 1 and EDIN 18800 - 5 the design bending moment for distorsional lateral buckling {{is based on}} the reduction of the plastic design bending Moment M_p_l_. _R_d with the factor #kappa#_M. The reduction factor #kappa#_M {{is a function of the}} related slenderness anti #lambda#_M dependent on the characteristic value of the bending moment resistance and the critical bending moment M_K_i. The critical bending Moment M_K_i takes into account the boundary conditions of the beam and the type of loading. The determination of M_K_i is based on a model where the structural steel section is laterally braced at the top flange and where the influence of the concrete slab and the distorsional effects of the web is taken into account by an elastic restraint against rotation. The influence of the bending moment distribution is allowed for by a factor which was determined for a steel section, laterally braced at the top flange but neglecting the influence elastic restraint against torsion. The influence of the torsion elastic restraint of the concrete slab and the distorsional deformations of the web are taken into account by an effective St. Venant torsion stiffness based on a one <b>wave</b> <b>buckling</b> shape. This assumption can lead to significant errors. It is shown that the elastic critical bending moment of composite beams can be determined by help of an analogy between the differential equilibrium equations of the compression member on elastic foundation and the lateral torsion buckling problem. Based on this analogy a new simplified and more accurate method for the determination of elastic critical bending moment is derived and compared with the method given in Eurocode 4 - 1 and exact FEM calculation.
