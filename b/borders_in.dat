5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire and its neighbors. Brazil experienced no serious conflicts {{with its neighbors}} {{to the north and}} west, due to the buffer of the nearly impenetrable and sparsely populated Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes inherited from Portugal and Spain over the control of the navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually agreed <b>borders</b> <b>in</b> this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.|$|E

5|$|Almirante Latorres genesis can {{be traced}} to the {{numerous}} naval arms races between Chile and Argentina, which in turn were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual <b>borders</b> <b>in</b> Patagonia and Puna de Atacama, along with control of the Beagle Channel. Naval races flared up in the 1890s and in 1902; the latter was eventually settled via British mediation. Provisions in the dispute-ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries' navies. The United Kingdom's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución-class pre-dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile, and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia-class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Riverina region, the {{majority}} of Wagga Wagga residents supported the federation of the Australian colonies, in large part due to the prospect of free trade across colonial <b>borders.</b> <b>In</b> 1898, a group of residents promoted Wagga Wagga for consideration as the site of the future national capital due to its location equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne and its ample water supply. Despite the bid's lack of success, in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted strongly in favour of federation.|$|E

5|$|Croatia and Slovenia started {{negotiations}} to define maritime <b>borders</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Piran in 1992 {{but failed to}} agree, resulting in a dispute. Both countries also declared their economic zones, which partially overlap. Croatia's application to become an EU member state was initially suspended pending resolution of its border disputes with Slovenia. These were eventually settled with an agreement to accept the decision of an international arbitration commission set up via the UN, enabling Croatia to progress towards EU membership. The dispute has caused no major practical problems in areas other than the EU membership negotiations progress, even before the arbitration agreement.|$|E

5|$|The <b>borders</b> <b>in</b> {{the region}} had been disputed since the American {{purchase}} of Alaska from Russia in 1867, {{and most of}} the influx of prospectors were American. Amid fresh concerns that the United States might annex the gold fields, the mounted police were tasked to assert Canadian control along the border line. The force set up control posts at the borders of the Yukon and at easily controlled mountain passes, equipping the posts with Maxim guns. The police checked for illegal weapons and prevented the entry of criminals and collected customs duties, while helping protect and guide the flow of migrants, mediating in their disputes and providing practical advice.|$|E

5|$|These moves {{were met}} with some criticism, as the {{preserved}} counties were created to sustain a stable and continuing layout, irrespective of interim local government reviews affecting principal areas. This led to some areas, such as the Aberconwy district, moving to a preserved county {{it had never been}} administered by in the past, and therefore these moves went generally unreported due to the preserved county's limited status. The Boundary Commission proceeded to retain the eight preserved counties, and modified their <b>borders</b> <b>in</b> 2003 to match with the incumbent principal area boundaries. The 2003 arrangement brings towns such as Llandudno, Conwy and Betws-y-Coed into the preserved county of Clwyd.|$|E
