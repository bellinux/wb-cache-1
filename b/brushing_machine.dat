Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of rotating roller brushes that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of travel.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether {{patients should be}} advised to perform toothbrushing before or after an acidic challenge to minimize enamel and dentin wear by brushing abrasion. METHODS: The study was a two-period crossover design (A and B, each 14 days) in which three enamel and dentin specimens were fixed in intraoral appliances of 10 volunteers. The following regimens were performed {{three times a day}} with at least 4 hours in between: A: 20 -second brushing treatment in an automatic <b>brushing</b> <b>machine,</b> 5 minutes intraoral exposure of the specimens, extraoral erosion of enamel and dentin specimens for 40 seconds or B: Extraoral erosion for 40 seconds, 5 minutes intraoral exposure of the specimens, 20 -second brushing treatment in an automatic <b>brushing</b> <b>machine.</b> Enamel and dentin loss {{at the end of each}} 14 -day regimen was assessed by profilometry and statistically analyzed by t-test. RESULTS: For all volunteers, mean enamel and dentin wear was significantly lower when brushing treatment was performed before erosion (A: enamel: 2. 3 +/- 1. 0 microm, dentin: 4. 1 +/- 1. 6 microm) than when brushing was applied after erosion (B: enamel: 6. 4 +/- 3. 0 microm, dentin: 15. 3 +/- 6. 8 microm).

The toothbrushes were applied with a control slurry free of abrasive particles (RDA-value 10) or toothpastes slurries with different abrasivity (RDA-values 20, 50 or 100). Each erosive-abrasive cycle was followed by storage of the dentin samples in artificial saliva for 3 h. After each 4 cycles, the samples were stored in artificial saliva for 15 h. After 60 cycles, dentin loss was measured by profilometry and statistically analysed by ANOVA and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Dentin loss increased along with the RDA-value of the toothpaste slurries. The impact of the filament diameter on dentin loss was less evident compared to the RDA-value. However, toothbrushes with smaller filament stiffness caused higher dentin wear in all toothpaste slurry groups (RDA 20, 50 and 100) except for the paste-free control group (RDA 10).

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of phytoseiid populations was made of two well- cultivated and regularly sprayed apple orchards with two unsprayed orchards in Cache Valley, northern Utah. Two phytoseiid species, Typhlodromus mcgregori Chant and T. occidentalis Nesbitt were observed on the apple leaves, under the bark, and occasionally in the litter and soil. Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) occurred in the soil and litter and occasionally under bark. T. mcgregori was dominant in the unsprayed orchards, and T. occidentalis in the sprayed. Of the phytophagous mites, which served as food for the phytoseiids, the two-spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch was dominant. Other phytophagous mites were the brown mite, Bryobia rubrioculus (Scheuten), the European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), and the McDaniel mite, Tetranychus mcdanieli McGregor. The study suggests T. mcgregori to be a non-specific, facultative predator of phytophagous mites. T. mcgregori was adversely affected by standard pesticide practices, but T. occiden talis survived in larger numbers. The phytoseiids seem well adjusted to {{the environment of the}} unsprayed orchards and to contribute to the low phytophagous mite populations in those orchards.

Methods: Sound bovine enamel samples (2 mm/diameter and 2 mm/depth) were prepared and immersed in artificial white spot lesion for 24 h. The preparation of artificial white spot lesions was performed by pH-cycling process. The samples were randomly divided into two groups (n= 20), according the dentifrice used: containing fluoride (Colgate Total 12) or Aloe vera (Forever Bright Aloe Vera Toothgel).

40|$|Abstract. Exposed dentine with patent tubules {{allows the}} {{movement}} of tubule fluid leading to dentine sensitivity. Occlusion of patent dentinal tubules effectively reduces the state of dentine hypersensitivity. Strontium chloride (SrCl 2) has been well known {{as a component of}} desensitizing dentifrice.

The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the occlusion effect of dentinal tubule between the sodium metasilicate and the existing desensitizing dentifrices. Sixty-four human dentine specimens were embedded into a Teflon mold and were grinded with the use of silicone carbide papers to expose the surface of dentin. The dentin surface was etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 60 seconds and was treated with ultrasonic washing for 1 hour.
