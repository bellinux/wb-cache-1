5|$|The {{following}} season, 1921–22, saw {{the formation}} of a Northern section of the Third Division and the Third Division became Division Three South. This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and Fourth Division were formed, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> Palace were above all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the Fulham game. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table in the following season, 1922–23, finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.|$|E

In 2010 Perry was faced with the decision whether to play for Australia at the ICC World Twenty20 or at the 2010 AFC Women's Asian Cup which overlapped, of which she chose cricket.|$|E
25|$|<b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> {{the advance}} of the {{northern}} army was of the highest military importance, for Fairfax was thereby set free from the necessity of undertaking sieges. Moreover, {{the publication of the}} King's papers, taken at Naseby, gave Fairfax's troops, a measure of official and popular support, which a month before, they could not have been said to possess. It was now obvious that they represented the armed force of England against the Irish, Danes, French, Lorrainers, etc., whom Charles had for three years been endeavouring to let loose on English soil. Even the Presbyterians abandoned for the time, any attempt to negotiate with the King, and advocated a vigorous prosecution of the war.|$|E

25|$|At {{this moment}} most prisons in Tonga still abide {{with the old}} laissez-faire attitude. Usually having no fences, no iron bars and so forth, that makes it very easy for the inmates to escape. This system may be {{required}} to change, adapting for the influx of foreign born/raised criminals who may treat such a system with contempt, alternatively a minimum/maximum security prison system may need to be developed placing escapists or repeat offenders into closed prisons, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> the jailors can trust on the goodwill of the inmates. Some are glad to be in prison, not to be bothered by demanding family members. There is no social stigma on being in prison (although that may change now too), but then of course it also does not serve as a deterrent against crimes.|$|E
25|$|In 416 Wallia reached {{agreement}} with Constantius; he sent Galla Placidia back to Honorius and received provisions, six hundred thousand modii of wheat. From 416 to 418, Wallia's Goths campaigned in Hispania on Constantius's behalf, exterminating the Siling Vandals in Baetica {{and reducing the}} Alans {{to the point where}} the survivors sought the protection of the king of the Asding Vandals. (After retrenchment they formed another barbarian supergroup, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> they were reduced in numbers and effectively cowed.) In 418, by {{agreement with}} Constantius, Wallia's Goths accepted land to farm in Aquitania. Constantius also reinstituted an annual council of the southern Gallic provinces, to meet at Arelate. Although Constantius rebuilt the western field army to some extent– the Notitia Dignitatum gives a list of the units of the western field army at this time—he did so only by replacing half of its units (vanished in the wars since 395) by re-graded barbarians, and by garrison troops removed from the frontier.|$|E
25|$|John of Arsuf {{had died}} in 1258 and was {{replaced}} as bailli by Geoffrey of Sergines, Louis IX's lieutenant in Acre. Plaisance died in 1261, but as her son Hugh II was still underage, Cyprus passed to his cousin Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan, whose mother Isabella of Cyprus, Alice of Champagne and Hugh I of Cyprus' daughter and Hugh II's aunt, took over the regency in Acre. She appointed as bailli her husband Henry of Antioch (who was also Plaisance's uncle), but died in 1264. The regency in Acre was then claimed by Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan and his cousin Hugh of Brienne, and Hugh II died in 1267 before he {{reached the age of}} majority. Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan won the dispute and succeeded Hugh II on Cyprus as Hugh III. When Conradin was executed in Sicily in 1268, there was no other Hohenstaufen heir to succeed him, and Hugh III inherited the Kingdom of Jerusalem as well in 1269. This was disputed by another branch of the Lusignan family: Maria of Antioch, daughter of Bohemond IV of Antioch and Melisende of Lusignan (herself a daughter of Isabella I and Amalric II), claimed the throne as the oldest living relative of Isabella I, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> her claim was ignored. By this time, the Mamluks under Baibars were taking advantage of the kingdom's constant disputes, and began conquering the remaining crusader cities along the coast. In 1265, Baibars took Caesarea, Haifa and Arsuf, and Safad and Toron in 1266. In 1268 he captured Jaffa and Beaufort, and then besieged and destroyed Antioch.|$|E

500|$|Biko and {{his comrades}} {{regarded}} multi-racial anti-apartheid groups as unwittingly replicating {{the structure of}} apartheid because they contained whites in dominant positions of control, and therefore {{did not participate in}} these multi-racial organisations. Instead, they called for an anti-apartheid programme that was controlled by black people. Biko nevertheless believed that sympathetic whites had a place in the anti-apartheid struggle; he called on them to reject any concept that they themselves could be spokespeople for the black majority and instead focus their efforts on convincing the wider white community on the inevitability of apartheid's fall. Biko clarified his position to Woods: [...] "I don't reject liberalism as such or white liberals as such. I reject only the concept that black liberation can be achieved through the leadership of white liberals." [...] He added that [...] "the [...] liberal is no enemy, he's a friend– <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> he holds us back, offering a formula too gentle, too inadequate for our struggle".|$|E

It was not until 16 June 618, exactly a year after he formally broke with Sui by executing his deputies, that Li Yuan deposed the puppet emperor and proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Tang dynasty, with the temple name of Gaozu. The new dynasty still {{had to face the}} various local rebels and warlords that had sprung up throughout the Chinese Empire, but by 628, with a judicious mixture of force and clemency, the Tang had succeeded in the pacification and consolidation of China under their rule.|$|E

[...] Black Book eventually won six Golden Calves at this festival, including Best Director. When the shooting of Black Book was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production.

Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with Black Book, Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> none of them has come to fruition.
