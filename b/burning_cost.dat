40|$|The Benktander (1976) and Neuhaus (1992) {{credibility}} claims reserving {{methods are}} reconsidered {{in the framework}} of a credible loss ratio reserving method. As a main contribution we provide a simple and practical optimal credibility weight for combining the chain-ladder or individual loss ratio reserve (grossed up latest claims experience of an origin period) with the Bornhuetter-Ferguson or collective loss ratio reserve (experience based <b>burning</b> <b>cost</b> estimate of the total ultimate claims of an origin period). The obtained simple optimal credibility weights minimize simultaneously the mean squared error and the variance of the claims reserve. We note also that the standard Chain-Ladder, Cape Cod and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods can be reinterpreted in the credible context and extended to optimal credible standard methods. The new approach is inspired from Mack (2000). Two advantages over the Mack method are worthwhile to be mentioned. First, a pragmatic estimation of the required parameters leads to a straightforward calculation of the optimal credibility weights and mean squared errors of the credible reserves. An advantage of the collective loss ratio claims reserve over the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reserve in Mack (2000) is that different actuaries come always to the same results provided they use the same actuarial premium...|$|E

40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{frequently}} used definition of reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies, by reinsurance the cedant (insurance company) cedes part of the risk to the reinsurer. Reinsurance plays nowadays a crucial role in insurance industry as it does not only reduce the reinsured's exposure, but it can also significantly reduce the required solvency capital. In past few decades various approaches to reinsurance actuarial modelling were published and many actuaries are nowadays just reinsurance specialized. The thesis provides an overview of the actuarial aspects of modelling a non-life per risk and for motor third party liability per event excess of loss reinsurance structure, according to the author's knowledge no study of such wide scope exists and various aspects have to be found in various fragmented articles published worldwide. The thesis is based on recent industry literature describing latest trends and methodologies used, the theory is compared with the praxis as the author has working experience from underwriting at CEE reinsurer and actuarial reinsurance modelling at global reinsurance broker. The sequence of topics which are dealt corresponds to sequence of the steps taken by actuary modelling reinsurance and each step is discussed in detail. Starting with data preparation and besides loss inflation, more individual claims development methods are introduced and own probabilistic model is constructed. Further, <b>burning</b> <b>cost</b> analysis and probabilistic rating focused on heavy tailed distributions are discussed. A special attention is given to exposure rating which is not commonly known discipline among actuaries outside of reinsurance industry and different methodologies for property and casualty exposure modelling are introduced including many best practice suggestions. All main approaches to the reinsurance modelling are also illustrated on either real or realistically looking data, similar to those provided by European insurance companies to their reinsurers during renewal periods...|$|E
40|$|While we {{will never}} know the true costs of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, past {{experience}} in assessing these kinds of damages provides both a framework for assessing the nature of damages as well as information on the potential magnitude of costs. From society’s perspective, the cost of an oil spill consists of both “private ” costs to the oil rig operator(s) and “external ” or third-party costs to the government, victims, and natural resources. While many of these external costs will ultimately be borne by the legally responsible parties (subject to any liability caps), it is useful to start from this categorization: Private Costs Damage to the oil rig and related equipment Containment costs to stop or reduce further oil spillage (e. g., efforts to cap wells, booms, dispersants, controlled <b>burning)</b> Cleanup <b>costs</b> incurred by responsible parties Lost oil Cost of litigation (including punitive damages or other penalties not directly related to above) External Costs Loss of life and injury to workers Containment costs to stop or reduce further oil spillage (e. g., booms, dispersants, controlled <b>burning)</b> Cleanup <b>costs</b> incurred by government agencie...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{utilization of}} forest harvest residues as supplemental, inexpensive {{and renewable energy}} raises two key concerns: 1) continued removal may negatively affect long-term site productivity; and 2) because 50 - 60 % of this material's green weight is water, transportation and <b>burning</b> <b>costs</b> of the green biomass very inefficient. Leaving the harvest residues to passively field-dry in the clearcut is a common forestry practice in the Nordic countries and is also used as a nutrient management strategy. While field-drying, nutrients are retained on site through the processes of physical foliage shedding, leaching and decomposition. The present study investigated the effects of field-drying on moisture reduction {{and the release of}} nutrients from black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S.

40|$|There is a world-wide {{shift from}} burnt to green cane harvesting. In many countries, {{including}} the United States and South Africa, certain areas are changing to green cane harvesting due to public, tourism and environmental pressures against open field <b>burning,</b> increasing labour <b>costs,</b> {{and the potential}} use of sugarcane trash as biomass {{for the production of}} bio-products. While some countries have already converted to total green cane harvesting, of the 23 million tonnes of cane that is annually processed in South Africa, almost 85 % is still burnt. Since the 1940 s there have been factory trials all over the world on green cane processing but, due to the sheer magnitude of such trials, none have managed to shed much light on the effect on downstream processing beyond clarification. This paper reports on the effects of harvesting green billeted sugarcane compared to burnt billeted and/or whole-stalk sugarcane on factory front end processes and on downstream processing in a pilot plant. Pilot plant processing was done on samples collected from two factories situated in the Midlands area of South Africa. Sufficient cane of each treatment was harvested and processed to purge the extraction plant of other cane. Trash materials and mixed juice were collected and analysed. The effects of trash levels on prepared cane, bagasse and mixed juice are reported. Factory mixed juice (300 L) was transported to the SMRI in Durban and further processed in the SMRI pilot plant to clarified juice, syrup, A-massecuite, A-molasses, A-sugar, and affinated sugar.

40|$|The {{production}} of paddy in Malaysia is around 2, 2 million metric tones which rice husk represents 20 % of the weight. Rice mills usually dispose the rice husk through open <b>burning.</b> With the <b>cost</b> increment of fossilized fuel, rice husk {{would have the}} potential to be a cheap source of renewable energy, In addition, rice husk ashes also contained a high content of silica, an important raw material for industries. Previous studies on the fluidized bed technology have shown its potential in waste disposal, and energy recovery from biomass. Spouted bed offers several advantages in comparison with the bubbling fluidized bed such as a better solid mixing and low-pressure drop to maintain the bed fluidization. With the low bulk density of rice husk (100 kgm(- 3)) compared to inert bed material and having a high content of volatile matter (64 %), most of rice husk burn in the freeboard region. It is important to burn the husk in the bed to maintain the bed temperature. Mixing study conducted has shown the preferred sand size in the range of 600 - 800 um with the operating bed height of 1 - 1. 15 Dc. Air velocity of 2 - 3 Ums was not feasible due to the nature of the husk. With conventional spouted bed, circulation of particles slowed down at the dense phase of the bed.

40|$|Since bellyache bush invaded to East Timor it has {{significantly}} reduced crop and animal production and consequential {{loss of income}} from farm enterprises. Methods of control of bellyache bush chosen should be appropriate to the poor economic position of the farmers. An integrated method of controlling bellyache bush involving slashing combined with mulching and or <b>burning</b> is low <b>cost</b> and is widely used by the Timorese farmers. Although these practices are commonly used to control weeds, {{there are still many}} problems that appear in the field during and after weed control. For instance, rapid regeneration of cut stems and production of less fuel than mixed stands to support burning management. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} investigate mechanical control such as cutting stems at different heights and cutting stems at different heights in combination with mulch, handpulling and mulching of small plants and mulching of seedlings. This study also investigates bellyache bush properties as a fuel for burning management in the late dry season to control its infestations. Mechanical control of bellyache bush plants was undertaken south of Darwin at Acacia (12 º 45 ’S, 131 º 09 ’E) which has an annual average rainfall of 1588. 1 mm and Channel Island (12 º 33 ’S, 130 º 51 ’E) which has annual rainfall of 1713. 9 mm. This study was conducted from January 2007 to February 2008. All bellyache bush plants were cut off at different heights according to treatment 0 cm (ground level), 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm and uncut plants considered as a control. The results indicated that all cutting treatments achieved 100 % mortality under low canopy cover, irrespective of season. While, under high canopy cover bellyache bush plants only achieved 100 % mortality if cut at 0 cm and 10 cm height. Stems cut at 20 cm, 30 cm and 40 cm heights re-sprouted in the dry season. Hand-pulling completely killed small plants while mulching did not. Mulching achieved a partial kill of seedlings however it stimulated seedling emergence in the wet season, irrespective of site. The use of bellyache bush as a fuel for burning management was studied. The study was undertaken at Channel Island, Acacia and Katherine (14 º 22 ’S, 132 º 09 ’E). The latter has a mean annual rainfall of 875 mm. All bellyache bush plants in the plot were cut in May. Five 1 m x 1 m quadrat samples were selected within a 10 m x 10 m plot to measure wet weight and dry weight for the curing rate calculation. In addition, 15 of the cut stems were randomly selected to measure re-sprouting. From five randomly selected 25 cm x 25 cm quadrat samples were taken to calculate the weight of fine fuel (less than 6 mm in diameter), medium (6 mm- 25 mm) and coarse (greater than 25 mm). Heat yield of fuel combustion of this material was calculated by using a bomb calorimeter (As 10 - 38. 5 leco 350 calorimeters). The results indicated that cut stems of bellyache bush from a low canopy cover site had 7 percent moisture content while stems from a high canopy cover site had a 66 percent moisture content by the end of the dry season. The proportion of these stems in the site with low canopy cover re-sprouted significantly less than those in the high canopy cover site. The fuel load at bellyache bush monoculture had less fine, medium and coarse fuel compared with tropical savanna fuel. However, results from this study indicated that it had a similar heat yield of combustion to other plants in the tropical savanna. A study of the use of fire as a control tool for bellyache bush was undertaken at Acacia and Katherine from May 2007 to February 2008. This study was carried out on established plants of bellyache bush. The experiment was undertaken in three 10 m X 10 m plots at each of the two sites. The experiment consisted of three treatments namely: cutting stems at 30 cm and followed by burning, uncut plants plus burning and unburnt plants considered as a control. Each of 20 pieces of bellyache bush stems were randomly selected for fine 0 - 6 mm, medium 6 - 25 mm and coarse 25 mm fuel. All these pieces were weighed before and after fire to calculate fuel consumption. Fire intensity was calculated by using Byram’s fire intensity equation. Fifteen soil temperature sensors were buried under uncut plants before burning. After burning all soil temperature sensors were dug out the temperature read and used to calculate fire temperature. Plant mortality was calculated by counting live bellyache bush plants before and after fire. Seed germination and seed recruitment was calculated by counting all seedlings within five 1 m x 1 m randomly chosen quadrats. The results show that fire consumed all bellyache bush stems in the late dry season burning. Fire intensity of bellyache bush fuels was quite low compared to other tropical savanna fuel. Soil temperatures ranged between 54. 17 ºC to 126. 13 ºC. All bellyache bush plants were completely killed by the fire treatment, but fire stimulated seedling emergence in the following wet season. It was concluded from the results of the experiments that mechanical control slashing system may provide a suitable fuel for the burning management if cut early in the dry season. By late in the dry season bellyache bush plants cut early in the dry season have a low moisture content are completely cured and able to support fire spread of adequate intensity to destroy the plants...|$|R
