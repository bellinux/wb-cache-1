5|$|This is not {{say there}} was no popular concern; by 2005 for example a chorus of US {{executives}} along with trade union and mid-ranking government officials had been speaking out about what they perceived to <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> trade practices by China.|$|E
5|$|Whether a {{timeframe}} {{should be}} imposed for the calling of by-elections has {{been subject to}} much debate. Several arguments have been advanced by the Government. First, when a voter casts a vote for a candidate, he is also voting for the political party that the candidate is a member of. Thus, once the party has received the voter's mandate, a vacant seat will not affect this mandate. Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by-election can be called would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to them. Secondly, the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member, as MPs from other constituencies can help {{to address the needs}} of residents in that GRC.|$|E

5|$|Botha, who {{had been}} asked by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone to form a government, began to make {{policies}} and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention {{in a way that}} Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English-speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose timing and terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, he rejected the notion of responsible government—self-government while retaining colonial status—on the grounds that he thought it would take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union.|$|E
5|$|The company {{feared the}} unionization attempt and hired labor spies {{to follow the}} union leaders and {{determine}} their plans. The company leadership thought the AASEREA's demands were unreasonable, and believed it to <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> for the employees' wages to exceed the income the business provided its shareholders. The union men discovered the spies and attacked and injured them. This began a rapid rise in tensions. Less {{than half of the}} company's employees had joined the AASEREA, denying Thorpe's committee enough support from the company's employees to enforce a strike. The AASEREA instead sought assistance from other Indianapolis unions. On October 30, a letter signed by Thorpe {{and other members of the}} committee was sent to Robert L. Todd, President of the Traction and Terminal Company. In the letter he made a series of demands, including wage increases, reduced work hours, and the reinstatement of men fired for joining the union. The committee informed the company that the demands had to be met if a strike was to be averted.|$|E

25|$|In {{determining}} {{premiums and}} premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location, credit scores, gender, occupation, marital status, and education level. However, {{the use of}} such factors is often considered to <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> or unlawfully discriminatory, and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes {{about the ways in which}} insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.|$|E

25|$|For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, {{thinking}} {{they would have}} 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it would clearly <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> to give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.|$|E
25|$|The game, however, was {{particularly}} noted for the sending off of Argentina captain Antonio Rattín after receiving his second caution of the game. The Argentines considered the second caution to <b>be</b> <b>unfair,</b> including Rattín himself, {{who had to}} be escorted from the pitch by police before he would leave. Rattín was booked {{at the start of the}} match for a lunge on Bobby Charlton. Rattín then fouled Geoff Hurst and received a second booking for arguing with the referee.|$|E
25|$|The {{first section}} of law 41 makes clear that the captains of the two teams have the {{responsibility}} for ensuring that play is conducted according to the spirit and traditions of the game, as well as within its Laws. This leads to a statement that the umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. It contains an override {{of the laws of}} cricket: if either umpire considers an action that is not covered by the laws to <b>be</b> <b>unfair,</b> he can intervene and call the ball dead.|$|E

Those who are not so careful and regularly surpass their credit limit or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as £25–35 until a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading that they would presume charges over £12 to <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to £12.|$|E
25|$|Passenger fare {{subsidies}} are unpopular outside Metro Manila, with subsidy opponents claiming that their taxes {{are being used}} to subsidize Metro Manila commuters without any benefit to the countryside, and that the fare subsidies should be used for infrastructure improvements {{in the rest of the}} country. In his 2013 State of the Nation Address, President Benigno Aquino III claimed that it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> for non-Metro Manila residents to use their taxes to subsidize the LRT and MRT. However, supporters of the subsidies claimed that the rest of the country benefits economically from efficient transportation in Metro Manila.|$|E
25|$|Rolf Bech-Sørensen {{stated that}} advance tolls would <b>be</b> <b>unfair,</b> {{as it was}} {{taxation}} of people which would not receive the benefit and that it essentially would be taxation of commuting. He therefore proposed that a referendum about advanced tolls {{be held at the}} same time as the 1983 municipal election. The National Roads Administration stated that the advanced tolls would reduce the capital need for the bridge by NOK30 million. State Secretary Karl-Wilhelm Sirkka of the Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that the ministry would in general approve advanced tolls if they had municipal and county support. The proposal was followed up by the county council without much debate.|$|E
