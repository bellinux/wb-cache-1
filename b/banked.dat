5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he <b>banked</b> the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier <b>banked,</b> one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E

5|$|At times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, {{near the}} end of the Paris sojourn and after two {{successful}} concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers.

However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was worrying about the high costs of living in Londonhe informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be anchored to an assured salary.|$|E

5|$|Bootham Crescent was renovated {{over the}} summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and {{terraces}} were <b>banked</b> up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York's 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground. There were teething problems in Bootham Crescent's early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were questions over {{the quality of the}} pitch. In March 1938 the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 season, the Zero-G Rolls {{were removed}} from the ride and {{replaced}} with <b>banked</b> hills. Robin's hill was installed in March and Batman's in April. Batman's train was painted red so that Robin could use it, because Robin's train was damaged during a previous incident. The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate at all, but three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track. Because of all of the problems the coaster had and the numerous failed attempts to fix the coaster, Six Flags decided to cut their financial and technical losses and dismantle the ride.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake horsepower compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply <b>banked</b> turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.|$|E

The database covers the universe of systemic <b>banking</b> crises for the period 1970 - 2007, with detailed data on crisis containment and resolution policies for 42 crisis episodes, and also includes data on the timing of currency crises and sovereign debt crises. The database extends and builds on the Caprio, Klingebiel, Laeven, and Noguera (2005) <b>banking</b> crisis database, and is the most complete and detailed database on <b>banking</b> crises to date. <b>Banking</b> crisis;Banking sector;Sovereign debt;Databases;Spillovers;Economic recovery;Fiscal sustainability;banking, <b>banking</b> crises, <b>banking</b> system, recapitalization, deposit insurance, <b>bank</b> closures, <b>bank</b> runs, currency crisis, debt crisis, asset management, financial crises, sovereign debt crisis, crisis resolution, financial crisis, <b>bank</b> restructuring, systemic <b>banking</b> crisis, crisis episodes, <b>banking</b> system assets, systemic <b>banking</b> crises, asset management company, reserve requirements, pre-crisis, credit boom, currency crises, subordinated debt, <b>bank</b> assets, containment phase, debt restructuring, financial distress, <b>bank</b> liabilities, asset management companies, <b>bank</b> shareholders, <b>bank</b> supervision, insolvent <b>banks,</b> crisis countries, <b>bank</b> insolvency, <b>bank</b> run, recession, <b>bank</b> of england, tier 1 capital, regulatory forbearance, crisis management, <b>bank</b> intervention, liquidity crisis, financial liberalization, <b>bank</b> failures, connected lending, foreign exchange, <b>banks</b> assets, deposit insurance coverage, macroeconomic policies, <b>banking</b> assets, tier 2 capital, savings <b>bank,</b> investment <b>bank,</b> systemic financial crises, deposit insurance scheme, national <b>bank,</b> credit booms, private <b>bank,</b> financial restructuring, contagion, credit policy, resolution of <b>banking</b> crises, <b>banking</b> distress, loan classification, small <b>bank,</b> cross-country experience, mortgage lending, crisis episode, closed <b>banks,</b> state <b>bank,</b> <b>banking</b> sector problems, systemic crisis, <b>banking</b> crisis resolution, <b>banking</b> system distress, currency depreciation, <b>bank</b> rehabilitation, <b>bank</b> failure, <b>bank</b> restructuring agencies, crisis management strategies, <b>banking</b> supervision, capital adequacy, <b>bank</b> recapitalization, <b>bank</b> recapitalizations, agricultural <b>bank,</b> <b>bank</b> capital, bad debt, cooperative <b>banking,</b> <b>bank</b> deposits, <b>bank</b> debts, <b>bank</b> reporting, loss allocation, <b>bank</b> interventions, recessions, <b>banking</b> policy, <b>bank</b> soundness, macroeconomic stability, merchant <b>banking,</b> <b>bank</b> losses, <b>bank</b> creditors, economic crisis, <b>bank</b> bailouts, <b>bank</b> depositors, <b>bank</b> of japan, <b>bank</b> indonesia, <b>bank</b> debt, capital requirement, <b>bank</b> insolvencies, disintermediation, bankers, <b>bank</b> credit, capital adequacy ratio, private commercial <b>bank,</b> <b>bank</b> relationships, <b>bank</b> lending, <b>banks</b> ? loan, <b>bank</b> share, state <b>banking</b> system, <b>bank</b> behavior, <b>banking</b> law, capital regulation, restructuring agencies, federal deposit insurance, <b>bank</b> loans, excess liquidity, <b>bank</b> staff, contingent liabilities, state <b>banking,</b> preventing <b>banking</b> crisis, central <b>banking,</b> <b>bank</b> of thailand, insider lending, <b>bank</b> for international settlements, financial reforms, interbank market, economic recession, <b>banking</b> practices, runs on <b>banks,</b> corporate sector...|$|R

40|$|A {{rapidly growing}} {{empirical}} literature {{is studying the}} causes and consequences of <b>bank</b> fragility in present-day economies. The paper reviews the two basic methodologies adopted in cross-country empirical studies-the signals approach and the multivariate probability model-and their application to studying the determinants of <b>banking</b> crises. The use of these models to provide early warnings for crises is also reviewed, as are studies of the economic effects of <b>banking</b> crises and of the policies to forestall them. The paper concludes by identifying directions for future research. <b>Bank</b> resolution;Economic models;banking crises, <b>banking,</b> <b>banking</b> crisis, deposit insurance, <b>bank</b> fragility, <b>banking</b> system, <b>banking</b> sector, financial crises, financial liberalization, <b>bank</b> runs, <b>bank</b> regulation, <b>bank</b> failures, currency crises, <b>bank</b> failure, crisis probabilities, crisis episodes, <b>bank</b> distress, recapitalization, systemic <b>banking</b> crisis, contagion, financial crisis, prudential regulation, bankers, <b>banking</b> systems, early warning system, <b>bank</b> ownership, <b>banking</b> sector fragility, <b>bank</b> credit, <b>bank</b> for international settlements, systemic <b>banking</b> crises, foreign exchange, early warning systems, <b>bank</b> capital, <b>banking</b> crisis regressions, capital adequacy, prudential supervision, <b>banking</b> distress, <b>bank</b> entry, crisis countries, <b>banking</b> sector problems, <b>bank</b> stability, systemic crisis, insurance design, probability model, <b>bank</b> performance, pre-crisis, deposit insurance scheme, recession, macroeconomic stability, credit boom, <b>bank</b> crisis, <b>bank</b> recapitalization, speculative attacks, <b>bank</b> insolvencies, recessions, cross country experience, <b>bank</b> balance sheet, <b>banking</b> system failures, <b>bank</b> interest, crisis probability, <b>bank</b> policy, <b>bank</b> vulnerability, <b>banking</b> panics, loan crisis, credit booms, nationalization of <b>banks,</b> <b>bank</b> panic, crisis episode, <b>banking</b> regulation, prudential regulation and supervision, <b>banking</b> sector distress, <b>bank</b> soundness, market <b>banking</b> crises, <b>banking</b> markets, <b>bank</b> interest rates, <b>bank</b> competition, <b>bank</b> regulators, <b>bank</b> of england, <b>bank</b> restructuring, deposit guarantees, <b>bank</b> exposure, interbank market, <b>bank</b> portfolios, <b>bank</b> safety, regulatory forbearance, corporate sector, <b>bank</b> size, <b>banking</b> market, financial sector crisis, <b>bank</b> managers, <b>bank</b> lending, <b>banking</b> assets, systemic risk, information dissemination, <b>banking</b> system stability, crisis problem, crises resolution, <b>bank</b> of korea...|$|R
