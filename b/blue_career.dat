50|$|Baby Blue started rapping {{while at}} school and {{eventually}} recorded a track called 'I Woulda', which was inspired by her cousin's gang-related death in the US. The track received heavy rotation and {{was the start of}} Baby <b>Blue's</b> <b>career</b> as a recording artist. When she was 19 she sent her music to UK artist Estelle, who immediately invited Baby Blue to New York City to record the song 'Hey Girl' featuring John Legend, as well as 'Don't Talk', another track for Estelle's début album The 18th Day, which was certified gold in the UK and she was also featured rapping in the video for the hit top 20 track 1980.|$|R

50|$|In 1925 Johnson married, and his wife, Mary, {{soon began}} a <b>blues</b> <b>career</b> of her own, {{performing}} as Mary Johnson and pursuing a recording career from 1929 to 1936. (She {{is not to}} be confused with the later soul and gospel singer of the same name.) As with many other early blues artists, information on Mary Johnson is often contradictory and confusing. Various online sources give her name before marriage as Mary Smith and state that she began performing in her teens. However, the writer James Sallis gave her original name as Mary Williams and stated that her interest in writing and performing blues began when she started helping Lonnie write songs and developed from there. The two never recorded together. They had six children before their divorce in 1932.|$|R
5000|$|Bell enjoyed writing risqué lyrics, and in 1939 he {{was advised}} {{that he could}} make {{so-called}} party records with [...] "blue" [...] lyrics, primarily for use in juke boxes in cocktail bars. He entered into this endeavour using his self-established record company, while continuing to make ethnic and mainstream comedy records. In an interview on the Dr. Demento radio program, Bell stated that he kept his straight and <b>blue</b> <b>careers</b> separate for many years, the latter being a secret to most of his fans and associates. His eventual fame would come mostly from his risqué material. His first juke box release was a hot jazz arrangement of a traditional risqué drinking song, [...] "Sweet Violets", but his first big success in this field was an original song, [...] "Take a Ship for Yourself".|$|R

50|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Leal ranked behind only Jim Clancy and Dave Stieb among the <b>Blue</b> Jays' <b>career</b> leaders in starts, innings, wins, losses, strikeouts, and walks.

50|$|Born {{and raised}} in Bakersfield, California, Blue played her high school career at West High School. Blue set the CIF Central Section record for points scored in a single season (913 in the 2000-01 season) and <b>career</b> (2,934 points). <b>Blue</b> {{averaged}} 29 points per game her senior year at West and lead Kern County in assist per game as well. Blue {{is regarded as the}} best player to ever come out of the CIF Central Section. However, {{due to the lack of}} talent around her, West High never won a section championship during <b>Blue's</b> <b>career.</b> The closest West came was in 2002 when West lost to crosstown rival Stockdale 82-55 in the CIF Central Section Division II championship game. Blue was named a WBCA All-American. She participated in the 2001 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored two points, but had a good game.|$|R

2500|$|The St. Louis Blues {{signed him}} to an {{entry-level}} contract on March 12, 2012, subsequently adding him to their NHL roster. After travelling and practicing with the team for a week, he was given his first opportunity for NHL play after winger Andy McDonald received a shoulder injury. Schwartz made his NHL debut on March 17, 2012, in Tampa Bay, skating on the second line with Jamie Langenbrunner and Patrik Berglund. [...] During the game, he scored his first NHL goal, a game-winner, from his first NHL shot on the powerplay at the 19:24 mark of the first period, when he intercepted a rebound {{in front of the}} net and beat goaltender Dwayne Roloson. On September 27, 2014, Schwartz agreed to a two-year, $4.7 million contract extension with the Blues after an off-season surrounded with uncertainly about whether he would rejoin the club. Schwartz switched to number 17 beginning in the 2014–15 season, having previously worn number 9 in his <b>Blues</b> <b>career.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After further {{travels through}} Mississippi, {{he found it}} {{advisable}} to take his mother's name and, as Robert Lee McCoy, moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in the mid-1930s. Local musicians with whom he played included Henry Townsend, Big Joe Williams, and Sonny Boy Williamson. This led to two recording dates in 1937, the four musicians recording together at the Victor Records studio in Aurora, Illinois, as well as recordings under his own name, including [...] "Prowling Night-Hawk" [...] (recorded 5 May 1937), from which he was to take his later pseudonym. These sessions led to Chicago <b>blues</b> <b>careers</b> for the other musicians, though not for McCoy, who continued his rambling life, playing and recording (for Victor/Bluebird Records and Decca Records) solo and with various other musicians, under various names. Kansas City Red was his drummer from the early 1940s to around 1946. He recorded Kansas City Red’s song [...] "The Moon Is Rising".|$|R

5000|$|Dick Biondi's lifelong love {{of radio}} began {{at an early}} age, when {{he was allowed to}} read a {{commercial}} on WMBO, Auburn, New York. [...] His father, Mike, an Endicott fireman, and mother, Rose, encouraged him in his goal; {{at the time it was}} to become a sportscaster. [...] He went on to work behind the scenes and learned about broadcasting at WINR, Binghamton, New York, where one of his co-workers was a young Rod Serling. Another co-worker, himself a sportcaster, took an interest in the young Biondi and began working with him on pronunciation and diction. As a sportscaster, Biondi began his on-air career in radio on WCBA 1350 AM in Corning, New York. He continued on to KVOB, Alexandria, Louisiana, but it wasn't until working for KSYL in Alexandria, that Biondi started doing music shows. It was here where he became acquainted with Rhythm and <b>blues.</b> <b>Career</b> moves took him to York, Pennsylvania and WHOT-AM, Youngstown, Ohio. When Dick arrived there, Rock and Roll was on the airwaves and he began doing local appearances with such stars as Fabian, Paul Anka and Bobby Darin.|$|R
