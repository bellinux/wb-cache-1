25|$|In the 1590s Essex was {{especially}} popular in London, {{where he was}} considered a pillar of Protestantism. At {{the height of the}} Anglo-Spanish war (1585–1604) he pushed an offensive strategy, supporting the Dutch rebels and French Huguenots against their Catholic enemy. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> championed maritime attacks on Spain and outright war against the Irish rebel O'Neill, the broad alliance against Spain was broken by the decision of King Henry IV of France to sue for peace.|$|E
500|$|Alberta had {{implemented}} prohibition in 1916 as {{the result}} of a referendum supported by the powerful United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) lobby group. [...] By the time Stewart took office, it was becoming apparent that the policy was not being universally complied with: Conservative MLA George Douglas Stanley alleged that judges were often hungover when they sat in judgment of those accused of violating liquor laws, and Cross's replacement as Attorney-General, John Boyle, admitted that in his estimation 65% of the province's male population broke the Prohibition Act. [...] In 1921 the government realized profits of $800,000 on alcohol legally sold for [...] "medicinal" [...] purposes, and Boyle estimated bootleggers' profits at nine times that figure. [...] Stewart blamed the problems on insufficient public support for the law, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so it was clear that there was not enough support to repeal it.|$|E
2500|$|Donald Trump {{asserted}} that a deal was [...] "weeks" [...] away in mid-April 2013. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said that, contrary to rumor, {{he was not}} seeking to renegotiate his initial agreement with GSA, The Trump Organization re-evaluated its partnership with Colony Capital. Trump said his company was likely to either replace Colony or finance the entire redevelopment deal in cash. GSA officials said any such change would not affect the negotiations.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{could cut}} some wood," [...] Harry suggested; <b>but</b> realized, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, how {{insignificant}} {{would be such}} a fire after these mighty shafts of flame.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Sir!' burst forth Malcolm; <b>but</b> then, <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{was about}} to utter his thanks, his eye sought for the {{guardian}} who had ever been his mouthpiece, and, with a sudden shriek of dismay, he cried, 'My uncle! where is he? where is Sir David?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But me no <b>buts,</b> <b>but</b> <b>even</b> {{leave him}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is. And {{for yet another}} reason. When the {{lightning}} cometh again--there, look abroad." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke {{a strong}} gust filled the yacht's topsails.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> passed, four shadows {{detached}} {{themselves from}} the tall stove, resolved themselves into armed men, and sprang after him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't go! Capture the hose!" [...] {{called out}} Flockley, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke he took good care {{to get behind}} another sophomore.|$|E
60|$|If it hadn't {{been for}} his habit of pouring out this {{information}} and learning on every one that he addressed, I'd have liked him pretty well. <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> it was, <b>he</b> and I were, you would have thought, great pals.|$|R
60|$|Possibly, the vexation {{might have}} been {{something}} different, {{were it not for}} the brisk confidence inspired by the breeze. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> it was, <b>he</b> felt a slight twinge, from a sudden indefinite association in his mind of Babo with Atufal.|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{since she}} wasn't stupid she was intelligent; {{it was he}} who was stupid--the proof of which was that he would do what she liked. But he made a last effort to understand, her allusion to the [...] "difference" [...] {{bringing}} him round to it. He indeed caught at something subtle <b>but</b> strong <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke. [...] "Is what you meant a moment ago that the difference will be in her being made to believe you hate me?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, {{the giant}} had swooped down {{and in a}} moment they were in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness.|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said this, he had {{obviously}} given up his search, and walked straight towards Mrs. Gould, {{who looked at}} him with doubtful surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be foolish, Béla," [...] she retorted. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, {{a little}} gleam of satisfaction, of gratified vanity, of anticipatory revenge, shot through her velvety dark eyes.|$|E
60|$|In {{his first}} hopefulness Masterton did not doubt {{what the answer}} would be, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>evening</b> {{approached}} <b>he</b> grew concerned <b>as</b> to the girl's opportunities of coming, and regretted {{that he had not}} given her a choice of time.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> Æolus, great <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was, {{expressed}} {{himself with}} some surprise that afternoon to Mr. Jerningham {{as to the}} singular fortune which had befallen George Roden. [...] "I {{believe it to be}} quite true, Mr. Jerningham. These wonderful things do happen sometimes." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> did <b>he?</b> <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> forgot {{and called}} his heart's desire, {{which was the}} life of the second mate, even then, without intention, mechanically, his sailor's considerative eye lifted to note the draw of the sails and roved from sail to sail. Thereupon, so reminded, he {{returned}} to his fidelity.|$|R
60|$|Endicott dealt {{each of the}} two opponents a {{card face}} downwards, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so, the one which he had dealt to Lambert fluttered to the ground.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> stood, {{there came}} a sound which made his heart grow cold. A cry, muffled, far away and full of anguish; a sobbing cry, which {{suddenly}} ceased.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{spoke the}} impetuous Flambeau had run his boat ashore in the {{rattling}} reeds, and {{they stood in}} the long, quaint islet beside the odd and silent house.|$|E
50|$|After World War II, Heyde was interned and imprisoned, but escaped in 1947. He went {{underground}} {{using the}} alias Fritz Sawade and continued practicing {{as a sports}} physician and psychiatrist in Flensburg. Many friends and associates knew about his real identity, <b>but</b> remained silent <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was an expert witness in court cases.|$|R
50|$|The {{death of}} Hank's father drives Hank on an alcohol-fueled binge and a sexual {{encounter}} with Karen. After the funeral, Hank stays in New York {{to finish a}} manuscript for a new novella. Upon returning to L.A., he believes the original copy to be lost when he is carjacked, but Mia had previously stolen the manuscript, and now she takes credit for it herself and attempts to have it published. On Karen's and Bill's wedding day, Hank chooses to be unselfish and accept the situation {{so as not to}} destroy his beloved's wedding day. <b>But</b> that <b>evening,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> and Becca leave the reception, Karen runs out and jumps into his car, presumably to resume their life together.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think Mr. Buckley when {{he arrived}} never heard {{anything}} unusual. <b>But</b> one <b>evening</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walked upstairs carrying an ink-bottle, he found his hand full of some liquid. Thinking that he had spilt the ink, {{he went to a}} window where he found his hand full of water, to account for which there was no stain on the ceiling, or anything else that he could discover. On another occasion one of the young ladies was kneeling by a trunk in an attic, alone, when water was switched over her face, as if from a wet brush. {177b} There was a small pool of water on the floor, and the wall beyond her was sprinkled.|$|R
6000|$|<b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so, he {{felt himself}} seized from behind in a grip of iron. The {{revolver}} was wrenched from his hand, {{and the voice of}} Julius Hersheimmer said drawlingly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it served}} him right," [...] {{answered}} Henry, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke {{he had to}} shudder, {{and he wondered if}} the Indian was really dead or only partly choked to death.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{determined}} thus, what moon {{there was}} became unveiled, {{and the light}} of it fell upon his face, which was turned towards Galliard. An exclamation of surprise escaped Sir Crispin.|$|E
6000|$|The Count had gone. <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> they looked, <b>he</b> reappeared, leading another figure by the hand. They {{held their}} breath with wonder. No one had ever seen him there save alone, and now a woman stood by his side. They could see nothing of her, save her long hair flowing in the breeze, and the bare outline of her figure. [...] "Who was she? Guiseppe must know! Who was she?" [...] they asked him eagerly.|$|R
60|$|His {{walk across}} the Parks was not made happy by much self-triumph. In spite of his commissionership and coming {{parliamentary}} honours, his solitary moments were seldom very happy. It was at his club, when living with Undy and Undy's peers, that he was best able to throw off his cares and enjoy himself. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> then, high <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was mounted on his fast-trotting horse, black Care would sit behind him, ever mounted on the same steed.|$|R
6000|$|He {{would have}} told his mother what he had seen, and his {{surprise}} that the minister had not spoken of finding the gold to the other men, but he was checked, first by his mother's attitude towards him, which was clearly {{the same as the}} minister's, and, second, by the knowledge that she would have condemned his dropping the gold in the minister's path,--though he knew not WHY,--or asked his reason for it, which he was equally sure he could not formulate, though he also knew not why. <b>But</b> that <b>evening,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was returning from the spring with water, he heard the minister's voice in the kitchen. It had been a day of surprises and revelations to Johnny, but the climax seemed to be reached <b>as</b> <b>he</b> entered the room; and he now stood transfixed and open-mouthed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> heard Mr. Staples say:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom, are you badly hurt?" [...] {{questioned}} Sam, <b>but,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke, Tom {{tried to}} stagger to his feet. Seeing this, Sam began a chase after Baxter, with the lumberman beside him.|$|E
60|$|Edward spurned the Italian {{away from}} him with his foot until he sprawled among the rushes, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> lay there like a wounded snake his dark eyes never left the King's face.|$|E
60|$|He glanced {{again at}} the dark eyes which looked {{straight}} at his own. They were dull and lustreless, <b>but,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gazed, a little shifting sparkle came into them, and the lips quivered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seems to {{be going}} a bit stale lately," [...] said Lord Algernon, [...] "and I think {{is getting a little}} queer in his head. He has a trick of {{stopping}} and staring straight ahead, at times, when he seems to go off for a minute or two. There!" [...] continued the young man, with a light laugh. [...] "I say! he's doing it now!" [...] They both turned quickly and gazed at the bent figure--not fifty yards away--standing in exactly the same attitude <b>as</b> before. <b>But,</b> <b>even</b> <b>as</b> they gazed, <b>he</b> slowly lifted his rake and began his monotonous work again.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That is it,' he said. 'I {{would rather}} {{be able to do}} such things as you do, than {{be one of the most}} famous {{soldiers}} of the Mahdi; but I could never persuade others. They say that the Mahdi himself, although he is hostile to the Turks, and would conquer Egypt, would willingly befriend white men. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>he,</b> powerful <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is, cannot go against the feelings of his emirs. Must we always be ignorant? Must we always be fighting? I can see no way out of it. Can you, Mudil?' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{his first}} impulse to drop {{into the bottom of}} the cab; his next, to cover his face with his hands. So he sat, while the cabman toasted the publican, and the publican toasted the cabman, and both {{reviewed}} the affairs of the nation; so he still sat, when his master condescended to return, and drive off at last down-hill, along the curve of Lynedoch Place; <b>but</b> <b>even</b> so sitting, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> passed the end of his father's street, he took one glance from between shielding fingers, and beheld a doctor's carriage at the door.|$|R
