5|$|Oskar, a meek 12-year-old boy, resides {{with his}} mother Yvonne in the western Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg in 1981 and {{occasionally}} visits his father Erik in the countryside. One such visit to his father, when Oskar and Erik are enjoying a cosy night playing games, a drunken neighbour arrives, and Erik starts to drink heavily with him, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> father/son evening.|$|E

The Cracking Unit is a device that <b>breaks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{hydrocarbons}}, that make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> diesel, into smaller sizes.

5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> regular summer meetings of the artists as they could no longer find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Io's {{colorful}} {{appearance is}} the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide frost is ubiquitous across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen in many places across Io, forming yellow to yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.|$|E

The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley. The appellants had now succeeded completely in <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> circle of favourites around the king.|$|E
5|$|The WSGA, led by Frank Wolcott (WSGA Member {{and large}} North Platte rancher), hired gunmen with the {{intention}} of eliminating alleged rustlers in Johnson County and <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> NWFSGA. By that time, prominent names in Wyoming started taking sides. Acting Governor Amos W. Barber supported the cattlemen, who blamed the small ranchers and homesteaders for the criminal activity in the state, while former cowboy and sheriff of Buffalo (the county seat of Johnson County), Red Angus, supported the homesteaders, who believed that the cattle barons were stealing their land.|$|E
5|$|The group stayed {{together}} until March 22, 2004 when, during the Draft Lottery, Benjamin was drafted to the Raw brand, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>The</b> World's Greatest Tag Team. On the Raw brand Benjamin was quickly {{added to the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship picture, first challenging for it at Bad Blood in June 2004 against Randy Orton. He eventually won the championship at Taboo Tuesday in October by defeating Chris Jericho, and held the championship for approximately eight months, eventually losing it to Carlito in June 2005. He held the championship twice more during 2006.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines were {{becoming}} worn out {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for a few years before being sold for <b>breaking</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> machinery of Avon, Dwarf and Elk was in good enough shape that they were assigned as tenders to the coastguard district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a tugboat in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916 the Australian Government {{offered the}} British Army Council a sixth {{division}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the Australian Army's main expeditionary force during World War I. This offer was an element {{of an attempt to}} establish an Australian and New Zealand Army, though the Australian Government acknowledged that forming a sixth division could cause difficulties in providing sufficient reinforcements to replace the AIF's casualties from December 1916. In such an event, the government proposed <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> division to reinforce the five others. The Army Council declined this offer as it preferred Australia to raise only as many units as it could reinforce.|$|E
5|$|The European Cup was {{retained}} in 1980, this time against Kevin Keegan's Hamburger SV at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Clough and Taylor then {{began the process}} of <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> championship winning team, selling off Martin O'Neill, Ian Bowyer, Garry Birtles, and Larry Lloyd; as a new team was built based around youngsters such as Gary Mills, Stuart Gray, Colin Walsh, and Bryn Gunn. New signings included striker Ian Wallace and Switzerland international Raimondo Ponte. Taylor retired in May 1982 after Forest finished 12th in the league, with recent signings Justin Fashanu and Raimondo Ponte proving to be unsuccessful. Clough would stay at Forest for another 11 seasons, but without Taylor would only add two League Cups and two Full Members Cups to the club's trophy cabinet, and would struggle against alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|They began a {{rivalry with}} the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick that lasted over three months, until the Judgment Day {{pay-per-view}} on May 21, 2006, where MNM lost the tag team title to London and Kendrick. Nitro and Melina suddenly turned on Mercury, attacking him and <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> group. Later that night Nitro and Melina were fired from the SmackDown' brand in storyline, to facilitate their move to Raw, where they reappeared the following week. The legitimate reason for the team's sudden split was later revealed to be Mercury failing a WWE Wellness Policy drug test and being forced to serve a 30-day suspension.|$|E
5|$|As the division's assault units {{began their}} {{approach}} march towards {{the line of}} departure late {{on the evening of}} 6 June, the German artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered the march, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> assaulting units as men became lost. Suffering over 2,000 casualties before the battle even began, many of the division's assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men, nevertheless they arrived on time and at the appointed hour, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines had destroyed {{a large part of the}} German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome by the division's lead battalions—the 33rd, 34th, 38th and 39th—and by 5am, the division had gained the crest of the Messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter-attack. In the engagements that followed the division largely played only a supporting role.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E

5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} {{to rein in the}} SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, {{the railway}} to Skagen not only {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of the village but also brought in considerable numbers of tourists. It was largely responsible for <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> regular summer meetings of the artists' colony as they could no longer find suitable accommodation and venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901, Holger Drachmann in 1903. Anna and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen continued to paint in Skagen until well into the 20th century and were occasionally joined by their earlier friends. Other painters, sometimes referred to as the younger group of Skagen painters, continued to visit the area. They included Jørgen Aabye, Tupsy and Gad Frederik Clement, Ella Heide, Frederik Lange and Johannes Wilhjelm, some of whom settled in the area until the 1930s or even later. Skagens Museum's has a large collection of works from all the recognized artists who painted in Skagen.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2009, it was {{announced}} by the Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F. that Poder Mexica had been stripped of the Mexican National Trios Championship because Black Warrior had left CMLL, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> team. At the same time, they announced an eight-team tournament to crown a new trios champion. The {{top half of the}} bracket took place on December 22, 2009 and {{the bottom half of the}} bracket took place on December 29. In the top bracket the team of Máscara Dorada, Stuka, Jr. and Metro defeated Guerreros Tuareg (Arkangel de la Muerte, Loco Max, and Skándalo) in the first round and Los Cancerberos del Infierno (Virus, Euforia, and Pólvora) in the second round to qualify for the finals. The bottom bracket took place on December 29, 2009 and saw the team of Poder Mexica (Sangre Azteca, Dragón Rojo, Jr., and Misterioso, Jr.) defeat Fabian El Gitano, Máximo, and Rouge, and then Delta, Leono, and Valiente to qualify for the final. On January 6, 2010 Máscara Dorada, Stuka, Jr. and Metro defeated Poder Mexica to become the new Mexican National Trios Champions.|$|E
