2500|$|In June 1910 both ships, {{still missing}} their eight-inch guns, were {{commissioned}} into the Armed Reserve of the Baltic Fleet. The decision permitted the Navy {{to bring their}} crews to full strength. In the end of July Andrei Pervozvanny sailed to its sea trials with 583 men on board, Imperator Pavel I sailed to her trials in September–October with even fewer men. As predicted by theory, they turned out very [...] "wet" [...] ships even in calm seas. At [...] <b>bow</b> <b>waves</b> swept over all open decks and flooded the lookout cupolas and optical sights of main gun turrets, effectively prohibiting fire at high speed.

50|$|A <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> is {{the wave}} that forms at {{the bow of}} a ship when it moves through the water. As the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> spreads out, it defines the outer limits of a ship's wake. A large <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> slows the ship down, is a risk to smaller boats, and in a harbor can damage shore {{facilities}} and moored ships. Therefore, ship hulls are generally designed to produce as small a <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> as possible.|$|R

50|$|Hull {{speed or}} {{displacement}} speed is {{the speed at}} which the wavelength of the boat's <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> (in displacement mode) is equal to the boat length.

When hull speed is reached, a boat in pure displacement mode will appear trapped in a trough behind its very large <b>bow</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} air {{entrainment}} by breaking waves {{are essential for}} advancing the understanding of these flows and creating valid models. The present study used experimental simulations of a ship <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> to examine its dynamics and air entrainment processes. The simulated waves were created by a deflecting plate mounted at an angle in a supercritical free-surface flow in a flume. Measurements of the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> geometry at two scales and also for a <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> created by a wedge in a towing tank are presented. Contact line and <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> profile measurements from the different experiments are compared and demonstrate the similarity of the flume simulations to the towing tank experiments. The <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> profile data from the towing tank experiments were used to investigate the scaling of the wave with the flow and the dependence on geometric parameters. In addition, surface disturbances observed on the plunging wave are documented herein because of the role they play in air entrainment. The air entrainment itself is explored in Waniewski et al (2001) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> carries energy {{away from}} the ship {{at the expense of}} its kinetic energy—it slows the ship. A major goal of naval {{architecture}} is therefore {{to reduce the size of}} the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> and improve the ship's fuel economy. Modern ships are commonly fitted with a bulbous bow to achieve this.|$|R

50|$|The {{size of the}} {{bow wave}} is a {{function}} of the speed of the ship, its draft, surface waves, water depth, and the shape of the bow. A ship with a large draft and a blunt bow will produce a large wave, and ships that plane over the water surface will create smaller <b>bow</b> <b>waves.</b> Bow wave patterns are studied in the field of computational fluid dynamics.|$|E

40|$|The cometary <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> of P/Giacobini-Zinner {{has been}} {{analyzed}} using the {{complete set of}} ICE field and particle observations to determine {{if it is a}} shock. Changes in the magnetic field and plasma flow velocities from upstream to downstream have been analyzed to determine the direction of the normal and the propagation velocity of the <b>bow</b> <b>wave.</b> The velocity has then been compared with the fast magnetosonic wave speed upstream to derive the Mach number and establish whether it is supersonic, i. e., a shock, or subsonic, i. e., a large amplitude wave. The various measurements have also been compared with values derived from a Rankine-Hugoniot analysis. The results indicate that, inbound, the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> is a shock with M = 1. 5. Outbound, a subsonic Mach number is obtained, however, arguments are presented that the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> is also likely to be a shock at this location...|$|R

40|$|A <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> {{breaking}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} prominent factors to be considered regarding the nonlinearity of added resistance for a ship. Considering the stability of the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> breaking, which is mostly influenced by the ship speed and the waterline entrance angle, can enhance understanding of the nonlinearity. Understanding of the nonlinearity can be improved by considering the stability of the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> breaking, which is mostly influenced by the ship speed and the waterline entrance angle. New transfer function containing the ship speed is proposed to make a better representative of the nonlinearity. This method is evaluated with the model test data of the Fast Displacement Ship (FDS) under the short waves condition (λ/L= 0. 4). This study has shown that new transfer function can be an efficient analysis method of the ship performance prediction offering intuitive consistency with proposed residual resistance concept. The findings lead to better understanding the nonlinearity considering <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> breaking. Ship Hydromechanics and Structure...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "dust wave" [...] {{is applied}} {{when the dust}} piles up but the gas is largely unaffected, {{as opposed to a}} [...] "bow wave" [...] where both dust and gas are stopped. Dust waves occur when the {{interstellar}} medium is sufficiently dense and the stellar wind sufficiently weak that the dust stand-off distance is larger than the stand-off distance of a bow shock. This would clearly be more likely for slow-moving stars, but slow-moving luminous stars may not have lifetimes long enough to produce a bow wave. Low luminosity late class O stars should commonly produce <b>bow</b> <b>waves</b> if this model is correct.|$|E
50|$|In 1888, a Risso’s dolphin {{appeared}} in the sounds. This dolphin became famous as Pelorus Jack {{and became the first}} dolphin in the world to receive the protection of the law.

He would join boats bound for Nelson at the entrance to Pelorus Sound and for eight kilometres would ride their <b>bow</b> <b>waves</b> to Pelorus Sound. He did not go through the pass with them, but would met returning boats as they exited the pass. Pelorus Jack was last seen in April 1912.

50|$|In {{supersonic}} flight (Mach numbers {{greater than}} 1.0), wave drag {{is the result}} of shockwaves present in the fluid and attached to the body, typically oblique shockwaves formed at the leading and trailing edges of the body. In highly supersonic flows, or in bodies with turning angles sufficiently large, unattached shockwaves, or <b>bow</b> <b>waves</b> will instead form. Additionally, local areas of transonic flow behind the initial shockwave may occur at lower supersonic speeds, and can lead to the development of additional, smaller shockwaves present on the surfaces of other lifting bodies, similar to those found in transonic flows. In supersonic flow regimes, wave drag is commonly separated into two components, supersonic lift-dependent wave drag and supersonic volume-dependent wave drag.|$|E
40|$|The dual basic {{tasks of}} {{evaluating}} ship waves at the free surface and of removing unwanted short waves are considered {{within the framework}} of the ‘free-surface Green function potential flow theory’, based on a Green function that satisfies the radiation condition and the Kelvin-Michell linearized boundary condition at the free surface. A practical approach based on parabolic extrapolation within an extrapolation layer bordering the free surface is used. The height of the extrapolation layer is defined explicitly via simple analytical relations in terms of the Froude number and the slenderness of the ship hull, and varies from the bow to the stern. The bow-to-stern variation is an important ingredient that accounts for the fact that waves along the ship hull aft of the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> differ from the <b>bow</b> <b>wave.</b> Indeed, a ship <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> is significantly higher and shorter than waves aft of the <b>bow</b> <b>wave,</b> is affected by nearfield effects related to the rapid variation of the hull geometry at a ship bow, and consequently contains more short wave components. ...|$|R
