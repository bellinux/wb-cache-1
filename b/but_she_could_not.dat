5|$|Goldman made funeral {{arrangements}} for Berkman. It {{had been his}} desire to be cremated and have his ashes buried in Waldheim Cemetery in Chicago, near the graves of the Haymarket defendants who had inspired him, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> afford the expense. Instead, Berkman was buried in a common grave in Cochez Cemetery in Nice.|$|E
5|$|Penelo {{is usually}} {{trying to keep}} Vaan out of trouble, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> stop Vaan from intruding into the palace grounds. She {{encountered}} Vaan, who was arrested along with Balthier and Fran. This encounter forced her {{into a series of}} events, when she was kidnapped by Bangaa headhunter Ba'gamnan and held as hostage in exchange for Balthier. When she managed to escape, she met with Larsa Solidor, one of the sons of Archadian Emperor Gramis, who took care of her and convinced her he wished to make peace with Dalmasca. When she is finally reunited with Vaan, she made him promise not to leave her side, and ever since traveled with Vaan, furthering their relationship as sky pirate and partner.|$|E

The lady smiled, and invited Soubirous to pray the rosary with her. Soubirous tried to keep this a secret, but Toinette told her mother. After parental cross-examination, she and her sister {{received}} corporal punishment for their story.|$|E
25|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} Wolverine and the X-Men, voiced by Jennifer Hale, as a {{supporting}} character. After a mysterious explosion at the Institute, Jean was lost and the X-Men disbanded until Wolverine reformed the X-Men. Mr. Sinister fooled Cyclops in to thinking that Jean {{was in the}} villain's clutches {{but of course it}} was only a set-up. Unknown to anyone, Jean was in a hospital. When she finally awoke, the doctors asked for her name <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> remember anything.|$|E
25|$|Wuornos told several {{inconsistent}} {{stories about}} the killings. She claimed initially that all seven men had raped her while she {{was working as a}} prostitute but later recanted the claim of self-defense, citing robbery and a desire to leave no witnesses as the reason for murder. During an interview with filmmaker Nick Broomfield, when she thought the cameras were off, she told him that it was, in fact, self-defense, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> stand being on death row—where she had been for ten years at that point—and wanted to die.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} morning of Wednesday 3 February 2010, the 26-year-old Faiza Ashraf {{was waiting for the}} bus going from her home in Haslum to {{downtown}} Oslo, where she worked in a clothing boutique. While she was standing at the bus-stop at approx. 06:44, 25-year-old Håvard Nyfløt pulled up, grabbed her and forced her into the trunk of his car. Ashraf managed to call the police from her cell-phone and inform them that she was being kidnapped, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> give her exact location. This event was witnessed by at least one passing motorist.|$|E
25|$|In the pilot, Sookie {{was played}} by Alex Borstein <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be {{released}} from her Mad TV contract. She was therefore replaced by Melissa McCarthy, who re-filmed Sookie's scenes. The role of Dean also changed after the pilot, with the original actor replaced by newcomer Jared Padalecki. The character Lane was based on Sherman-Palladino's friend and fellow producer Helen Pai; Japanese-American actress Keiko Agena was cast in the role when they could not find an appropriate Korean-American actress. Liza Weil auditioned to play Rory, and while she was considered wrong for the part – Sherman-Palladino liked her {{so much that she}} wrote the role of Paris specially for her.|$|E
25|$|Blankers-Koen {{was born}} Francina Elsje Koen on 26 April 1918 in Lage Vuursche (near Baarn) to Arnoldus and Helena Koen. Her {{father was a}} {{government}} official who competed in the shot put and discus. She had five brothers. As a teenager, she enjoyed tennis, swimming, gymnastics, ice skating, fencing and running. Standing , she was a natural athlete. It soon became clear she was a sports talent, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> decide which sport to pick. A swimming coach advised her to do track because there were already several top swimmers in the Netherlands at that time (such as Rie Mastenbroek), {{and she would have}} a better chance to qualify for the Olympics in a track event.|$|E

60|$|She {{had meant}} to tell Mr. Dutton {{that it was all}} her father's selfishness, <b>but</b> somehow <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> say so, there was {{something}} about him that hindered all unbefitting outbreaks of vexation.|$|R
25|$|In 1966, with {{a slight}} {{improvement}} in her health, she made a valiant attempt to complete her work in Chalak opposite Raj Kapoor, which needed only a short spell of shooting, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> even survive that strain. When acting {{was no longer an}} option, Madhubala turned her attention to film direction. In 1969 she was set to make her directorial debut with the film Farz aur Ishq. However, the film was never made, as during pre-production, she died on 23 February 1969, shortly after her 36th birthday. Her tomb was built with marble and inscriptions included aayats from the Quran and verse dedications. Controversially, her tomb was demolished in 2010 to make space for new graves.|$|E
25|$|She {{took part}} in her second outdoor world championships the {{following}} year, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> match her previous form at finished in tenth place overall in the 2009 women's triple jump competition with a best mark of 13.91m. Despite this lacklustre performance on the world stage, she remained dominant in continental competition and won both the long jump and triple jump gold medals at the 2009 Asian Indoor Games (setting two Games records and helping Kazakhstan top the athletics medal table in the process). Competing at her final championships of that year, she retained her triple jump title at the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships, beating Xu Tingting and Irina Litvinenko with a jump of 14.53m.|$|E
25|$|Chidu {{switched}} to the 1500m for the 1991 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the change brought her a bronze medal behind Lyudmila Rogachova and Ivana Kubešová. Her finishing time o f 4:06.27 minutes made her the third fastest indoors that season. Her first and only global outdoor appearance for Romania came at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> progress beyond the 800m heats. She was a guest performer at the Japan Championships in Athletics that year and topped the podium in the 1500m. She missed a 1500m medal by one place at the 1992 European Athletics Indoor Championships, losing to teammate Doina Melinte. She returned to that event for the 1994 edition. A gold medal came at the Balkan Athletics Indoor Championships.|$|E

25|$|Fatmawati objected {{when her}} husband took Hartini, his new wife, {{according}} to Muslim law. Sukarno married another woman from Java in 1953 and Fatmawati {{moved out of the}} presidential palace and lived separately in Jakarta. As part of the settlement Fatmawati was allowed to keep the title of First Lady. This development was a major blow to the growing women's movement. Fatmawati decided {{that she was going to}} divorce the President, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find a religious leader who was willing to oppose the will of Sukarno. The women's organisation consoled and advised Fatmawati and they tried to encourage her to return to the palace and reestablish her rights. Sukarno himself was annoyed by this development although his new wife understood Fatmawati's anger.|$|E
25|$|From 1864 to 1871, Lewis {{was written}} about or interviewed by Lydia Maria Child, Elizabeth Peabody, Anna Quincy Waterston, and Laura Curtis Bullard. These were all {{important}} women in Boston and New York abolitionist circles. Because of these women, articles about Lewis appeared in important abolitionist journals including Broken Fetter, the Christian Register, and the Independent, {{as well as}} many others. Lewis was perceptive to her reception in Boston. She was not opposed to the coverage she received in the abolitionist press, and she was not known to deny monetary aid, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> tolerate the false praise. She knew that some did not really appreciate her art, but saw her as an opportunity to express and show their support for human rights.|$|E
25|$|His sister Elena Krylenko {{worked for}} Maxim Litvinov in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (although {{she was never}} {{a member of the}} Party); in 1924 she decided to leave Russia with the American writer Max Eastman (who had been in Russia for almost two years, researching and writing a life of Trotsky). To enable her to leave, Litvinov agreed to pass her off as a member of his {{delegation}} when he travelled to London for an international conference. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> leave the delegation and remain in a free country without a passport, which the Bolsheviks would not give her. So, in the hours before their train left, she and Max Eastman got married. They were still married and living in America when she died in 1956. Thus she escaped the purges.|$|E

60|$|Aunt Letty did dislike Lady Desmond very much; <b>but,</b> nevertheless, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{deny the}} truth of all this; and {{therefore}} it may {{be said that the}} visits of the countess to Castle Richmond were on the whole successful.|$|R

25|$|Islamic {{tradition}} {{states that}} the Zamzam Well was revealed to Hajra, the second wife of Abraham and mother of Ishmael. By the instruction of God, Abraham left {{his wife and son}} at a spot in the desert and walked away. She was desperately seeking water for her infant son, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find any, as Mecca is located in a hot dry valley with few sources of water. Hajra ran seven times {{back and forth in the}} scorching heat between the two hills of Safa and Marwah, looking for water. Getting thirstier by the second, the infant Ishmael scraped the land with his feet, where suddenly water sprang out. There are other versions of the story involving God sending his angel, Gabriel (Jibra'il), who kicked the ground with his heel (or wing), and the water rose. A similar story about a well is also mentioned in the Bible.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} he made his last film, Querelle (1982), Fassbinder was using drugs and alcohol {{as a way to}} assist his unrelenting schedule. On the night of 9–10 June 1982, Wolf Gremm, {{director}} of the film Kamikaze 1989 (1982), which starred Fassbinder, was staying in his apartment. Early that evening, Fassbinder retired to his bedroom. He was working on notes for a future film, Rosa L, based on the life of Polish-German revolutionary socialist Rosa Luxemburg. Fassbinder was watching television while reading when, shortly after 1 a.m., he {{received a phone call from}} his friend and assistant Harry Baer. At 3:30 a.m, when Juliane Lorenz arrived home, she heard the noise of the television in Fassbinder's room, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hear him snoring. Though not allowed to enter the room uninvited, she went in and discovered his lifeless body with a cigarette still between his lips. A thin ribbon of blood trickled from one nostril.|$|E
25|$|There seem to {{have been}} very few victims of the Black Death at higher levels of society. The only member of the royal family who can be said with any {{certainty}} to have died from the Black Death was in France {{at the time of her}} infection. Edward III's daughter Joan was residing in Bordeaux on her way to marry Pedro of Castile in the summer of 1348. When the plague broke out in her household she was moved to a small village nearby, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> avoid infection, and died there on 2 September. It is possible that the popular religious author Richard Rolle, who died on 30 September 1349, was another victim of the Black Death. The English philosopher William of Ockham has been mentioned as a plague victim. This, however, is an impossibility. Ockham was living in Munich at the time of his death, on 10 April 1347, two years before the Black Death reached that city.|$|E
60|$|The princess {{was not at}} all {{pleased when}} she heard the maiden's reply, <b>but,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> do without the dress, she was forced to give in, and {{contented}} herself with thinking that after all it did not matter much.|$|R
60|$|Polly {{was glad}} to hear that Fan was crying. It would do her good; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>n't</b> help {{softening}} to Tom, who did seem in a predicament between two weeping damsels. A little smile began to dimple the cheek that was n't hidden, and then a hand came slowly out from under the curly head, and was stretched toward him silently. Tom was just going to give it a hearty shake, when he saw a red mark on the wrist, and knew what made it. His face changed, and he took the chubby hand so gently, that Polly peeped to see what it meant.|$|R
