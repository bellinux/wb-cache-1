5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found <b>both,</b> <b>and</b> were able to set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E
5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke <b>both,</b> <b>and</b> 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, the Luftwaffe lost between 69 and 71 {{aircraft}} {{destroyed or}} {{damaged beyond repair}} {{as a result of}} its operations over Britain on 18 August 1940. Of this total, 59 were lost to certain or probable action by fighters while two fell to ground fire, four to a combination of <b>both</b> <b>and</b> one collided with a British training aircraft. The remaining three crashed in German-held territory owing to technical failures. Altogether, the losses represented seven per cent of the force committed. Around 29 aircraft crashed in England. Personnel losses were 94 German crews killed, 40 captured and 25 returned with wounds. Some 27 to 31 German aircraft returned with damage.|$|E

5|$|As the Japanese ships {{continued}} to pound the Tsesarevich, the battleship , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, boldly charged Tōgō's battleline {{in an attempt}} to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging <b>both</b> <b>and</b> forcing them to turn away. Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized. Peresvet received a total of 39 hits of all sizes that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 12-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs took until late September.|$|E
5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} the woods of rural England.

Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills <b>both</b> <b>and</b> assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E

5|$|During the 1939–40 season {{football}} was stopped following Britain's {{declaration of war}} and was not resumed {{until the end of}} World War II. This was because most British men were sent to the army. Stockport played only two matches in the 1939–40 season before war was declared, losing <b>both</b> <b>and</b> being bottom of the league. Regional league competitions were set up; appearances in these tournaments do not count in players' official records. Due to teams having a depleting number of players most teams resigned from football, the clubs that were left to compete used guest players to make up their numbers. The FA Cup was also suspended and replaced with the Football League War Cup.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by male and female {{employer}} to {{the male and female}} employees and also male and female employees to male and female employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by <b>both</b> employers <b>and</b> employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the male and female employer to the male and female employees and male and female employees to male and female employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find the most frequently used types of request used by <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employers <b>and</b> <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employees to <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employers. The result of this research showed that <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their male and female employees. However, <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employees used various types of request, <b>both</b> to male <b>and</b> female employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employers <b>and</b> <b>both</b> male <b>and</b> female employees...|$|R

5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of <b>both,</b> <b>and</b> possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E
