5000|$|... ==Ecological importance== <b>Bluehearts</b> are hemiparasitic, {{meaning they}} are able to grow {{independently}} without a host but grow more strongly with a host. They attach to their host plant by parasitic roots called haustoria. During stressful conditions (such as drought), <b>bluehearts</b> may heighten their parasitic effects to the point where a large group of them may damage small trees. Common host trees of <b>bluehearts</b> are white oak (Quercus alba), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), and cottonwood (Populus deltoides). Caterpillars of the common buckeye (Junonia coenia) feed on the blueheart.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, Buchnera {{americana}} is {{only found}} in “a 10 km {{stretch of the}} shoreline of Lake Huron in South-western Ontario”. Only six populations exist, and they are considered Endangered provincially and nationally. [...] In the United States, <b>bluehearts</b> are found in 11 states, from Ohio and Indiana to Georgia and Missouri. They are state ranked from S1 to S5 according to their degree of occurrence: S1 is extremely rare and S5 is secure. In Georgia and Virginia <b>bluehearts</b> are listed as S1; they are listed as S2 in Ohio and Texas; they are listed as S3 in Illinois, Kansas, Tennessee and parts of Kentucky; they are listed as S4 in Arkansas, Missouri and parts of Kentucky. In Ontario their natural interdunal habitats are threatened by development for housing, cottages and recreational areas, such as parks where the flowers are stepped on or picked. In the United States, <b>bluehearts</b> live in prairie habitats where fire is a necessary disturbance for seed germination and growth of other plants, but detrimental to <b>bluehearts.</b> Since burning occurs in a rotational 3-4 year cycle in Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, <b>Bluehearts</b> are greatly affected by habitat loss in these areas of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Many rare {{plants are}} found at Lynx Prairie such as American <b>bluehearts</b> (Buchnera americana), {{rattlesnake}} master (Eryngium yuccifolium), crested coralroot (Hexalectris spicata), gladecress (Leavenworthia uniflora), scaly blazing star (Liatris squarrosa), and Texas rock sandwort (Minuartia michauxii var. texana).|$|E
50|$|Buchnera americana, {{commonly}} known as American <b>bluehearts</b> or bupleurum, is a locally endangered herbaceous perennial plant of the broomrape family orobanchaceae. Found widely across the eastern United States, it also occurs in one location in the Canadian province of Ontario.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bluehearts</b> {{are found}} in 12 states, ranging from Ohio to Florida. They are most common in Missouri and Tennessee, where they are {{abundant}} in moist environments. The plant also occurs in a small area of south-western Ontario 10 km from Lake Huron.|$|E
5000|$|During the Korean War, Operation <b>Bluehearts</b> was the American amphibious landing {{conducted}} at Pohang on 18 July 1950 by the First Cavalry Division. The town {{was still in}} friendly hands, but was {{in the path of}} the rapid North Korean advance. The American units quickly joined the defenders.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the west}} end of the Indiana Dunes, in Gary there is a dune and swale {{province}} of the system. The area is characterized by low, linear sand ridges, parallel to the shoreline. Between these ridges are low areas of marsh or ponds. The ridges are characterized by prairie and savanna life forms and the marsh areas and ponds by the plants and wildlife of those characteristic areas of the dune lands. The dune and swale topography is easiest to see in the Miller Woods area of the lakeshore. Much of the dune and swales was eliminated by the construction of the industrial plants of Gary, East Chicago, Whiting and Hammond. [...] Some key identifiers of a dune and swale community include the common yellowthroat, Blanding's turtle, and <b>bluehearts.</b>|$|E
50|$|Days {{after the}} {{beginning}} of the war, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the U.S. Army officer in command of all U.N. forces in Korea, envisioned an amphibious assault to retake the Seoul area. The city had fallen in the first days of the war in the First Battle of Seoul. MacArthur later wrote that he thought the North Korean army would push the Republic of Korea Army back far past Seoul. He also said he decided days after the war began that the battered, demoralized, and under-equipped South Koreans, many of whom did not support the South Korean government put in power by the United States, could not hold off the North Korean forces even with American support. MacArthur felt that he could turn the tide if he made a decisive troop movement behind enemy lines, and preferred Inchon over Chumunjin-up or Kunsan as the landing site. He had originally envisioned such a landing, code named Operation <b>Bluehearts,</b> for 22 July, with the U.S. Armys 1st Cavalry Division landing at Inchon. However, by 10 July the plan was abandoned as it was clear the 1st Cavalry Division would be needed on the Pusan Perimeter. On 23 July, MacArthur formulated a new plan, Operation Chromite, calling for an amphibious assault by the U.S. Armys 2nd Infantry Division and the United States Marine Corpss 5th Marine Regiment in mid-September 1950, but this, too fell through as both units were moved to the Pusan Perimeter as well. MacArthur decided instead to use the U.S. Armys 7th Infantry Division, his last reserve unit in East Asia, to conduct the operation as soon as it could be raised to wartime strength.|$|E
