40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. This paper unpacks the <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> <b>road</b> transport challenges experienced at most of South African border posts with particular focus on Beitbridge border. The paper is based on research conducted by the Cross-Border Road Transport Agency (C-BRTA) in 2011 focusing on the State of South African border posts and Analysis of Trade Supply Chains. The historic structural and institutional configuration of South African border posts like other SADC border posts manifest deficiencies in terms of facilitating smooth <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> <b>road</b> transport movements. The number of government departments and agencies operating at South African border posts range from five (5) to twelve (12) and the departments/ agencies operates in silos. Customs processes constitute the greatest transit time in undertaking <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> movement in either direction, that is, for both northbound and southbound traffic at Beitbridge border post. Other transport challenges include inadequate and poorly maintained infrastructure, misalignment of working hours and lack of coordination between domestic border agencies and other stakeholders. Understanding of the origins and magnitude of <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> transport challenges is a fundamental departure point towards finding ideal interventions to the challenges experienced at Beitbridge. This paper outlines some of the solutions that may be deployed to address the <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> transport challenges experienced at South African border posts.

50|$|From the U.S. side, San Ysidro is the {{southern}} terminus of San Diego's municipal bus and light rail (San Diego Trolley) systems, providing public transportation {{to and from}} the Mexican border with Tijuana. The newly rebuilt San Ysidro trolley station is located directly next to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility. Tijuana is home to the world's busiest <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> with about 300,000 people <b>crossing</b> the <b>border</b> between San Diego and Tijuana every day. Queues take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more to cross to the United States, on non-US holidays, with wait of a few hours on US national holidays or some Mexican holidays. Expect street vendors during the wait. However, after clearing customs and immigration formalities, Interstate 5 is a major 8-10 lane freeway from San Ysidro to downtown San Diego, Los Angeles, and north to the Canada-US border. Interstate 805 branches off from I-5 just north of the border, and takes a more easterly route which bypasses downtown San Diego, rejoining with I-5 {{in the northern part of}} the city.

Over the next 1.5 mi, NY 189 passes through highly isolated areas of Clinton County dominated by patches of forests interspersed with small clearings. After Lagree Road and Swamp Road, two local roads maintained by the town of Clinton, the route passes by a small handful of residences on its way into the hamlet of Churubusco, the only community along NY 189. Here, it intersects with County Route 8 (CR 8), named Looby Road west of NY 189 and Clinton Mills Road east of the highway. The route continues north through the western portion of the small community, passing by the former site of NY 189's U.S. Customs and Border Protection station, once located in what is now a clearing south of Broad Street.The route's second and last intersection in Churubusco is with Broad Street, which links NY 189 to the more populated eastern half of the hamlet.

50|$|Since {{the only}} {{entry to the}} course is on the American side of the border, Canadian golfers {{historically}} used a small local road, Brown <b>Road,</b> to <b>cross</b> the <b>border</b> and access the country club; while Canada had a seasonal border checkpoint on the road, entry to the U.S. had been unsecured since the 1950s. In 2008, however, U.S. border officials closed the unpatrolled <b>border</b> <b>crossing</b> on Brown <b>Road,</b> citing increased concerns over terrorism and a drug sale on the course in 2006. The closure required Canadian golfers to make a 33 km detour through Fort Fairfield to access the course and was criticized by the Fort Fairfield town manager and the country club's golf pro. U.S. Senator Susan Collins and Canadian MP Mike Allen proposed that U.S. border officials establish a new seasonal border checkpoint on Brown Road. As of 2012-13, there is a seasonally open border checkpoint along the Brown Road on the Canadian side.|$|R

About 3.5 km to the south is the Upper Lusatian village of Klein Priebus (Little Przewóz).The former fortress, erected by the Silesian Piasts at the border with the lands of Upper Lusatia in the south, became part of the Duchy of Żagań in 1274. Duke Jan II the Mad had his older brother Balthasar imprisoned and starved to death at the castle's tower in 1472, shortly before he sold his duchy to Duke Albert III of Saxony. With Żagań, Przewóz fell back to the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1549, until in 1742 the bulk of Silesia was conquered and annexed by Prussia upon the First Silesian War. From 1871 on the area was part of the German Reich and by the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line in 1945 it fell to the Republic of Poland (see Territorial changes of Poland after World War II).|$|R

40|$|The failure by Sothern African Development Community (SADC) {{countries}} to fully implement the SADC Protocol on Transport, Communications and Meteorology (the Protocol) and bilateral agreements {{in regard to}} road transport negatively impacts the seamless movement of <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> <b>road</b> transport and significantly contributes to the challenges faced by the <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> industry as a whole. The full implementation of the Protocol in regard to road transport, and bilateral agreements would lead to efficient <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> transport regulation and transportation and in turn culminate in reduction of challenges facing the sector. This would lead to reduction of transportation costs, improvement in productivity, and accelerated growth in intra-regional trade, regional economic integration and overall SADC socio-economic development. This paper outlines {{the extent to which}} the provisions of the Protocol and bilateral agreements have been implemented by SADC countries and the key challenges emanating from the partial operationalisation of the instruments. The paper is based on findings from engagements with key government and private sector stakeholders in the regional transport environment and various research conducted by the C-BRTA between 2011 and 2014. The partial operationalisation of the instruments has resulted in disjointed regulatory frameworks and inability to: holistically address corridor constraints/ non-tariff barriers, facilitate seamless <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> movements, facilitate liberalisation of access to transport markets in the region, harmonise standards and procedures, and facilitate economic growth and trade between SADC countries. It is possible for the SADC region to realise the aspirations set out in the Protocol and bilateral agreements, and this paper outlines some of the solutions. To begin with, there is need for SADC {{countries to}} embrace the need to eradicate the existing self-centric regulatory approach limited to micro-needs and market protectionism. This would need to be underpinned by strong orientation towards the need to achieve macro benefits emanating from a regional perspective in regard to regulating <b>cross</b> <b>border</b> <b>road</b> transport movement. Taking off from this departure point, SADC countries can objectively establish a solid ground towards fully operationalising the Protocol and bilateral agreements. This paper outlines some of the interventions that can be implemented to ensure SADC countries fully operationalise the provisions of the Protocol on transport and bilateral agreements.

US 3 continues north to Lancaster, where it joins US 2 in the town center, and where NH 135 branches off to the west. After US 2 leaves to the west, US 3 continues north, roughly paralleling the course of the Connecticut River (which also forms the border with Vermont), through Northumberland and Groveton, where NH 110 ends. North of Groveton, US 3 continues to follow the river, through Stratford, North Stratford, and Columbia, until it reaches Colebrook, where it crosses NH 26 and meets the southern terminus of NH 145. Still following the Connecticut River north, US 3 passes through portions of Stewartstown and Clarksville.
