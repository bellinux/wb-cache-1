40|$|A 36 -year-old, heavily trafficked highway asphalt {{pavement}} was analyzed in detail. The variation in structural capacity {{was assessed by}} a falling-weight deflectometer (FWD). Trenches were cut to examine the distresses in the pavement structure. Sample cores were taken {{for the study of}} distress modes, volumetric characteristics, and mechanical properties of the asphalt mixtures. Asphalt binder was extracted from the cores for the study of rheological properties. Rutting, cracking, fracture at the <b>pavement</b> <b>bottom,</b> and debonding at the interfaces were found to be the major distress modes. Air voids (AVs) were found to vary greatly in the samples and to be particularly high at the construction joints and at the <b>pavement</b> <b>bottom.</b> The total AV contents are primarily attributed to a few large voids, not a large number of seemingly disconnected voids. The stiffness of the road samples was much higher than that of the new mixture of the same type, and the average stiffness of the samples from the wheel path is lower than that of the samples from the nonwheel path. The increased stiffness by aging apparently reduces the sensitivity of the samples to stress change in fatigue tests. All binders in the different layers of the pavement were found to be severely aged, and pavement depth and mixture type significantly affect aging rate. Possible reasons for the durability of the pavement and pitfalls that may need to be avoided are discussed. The findings are important for the development of long-life flexible pavements.

40|$|As {{shown by}} strains {{measured}} on full scale experimental aircraft structures, traffic of slow-moving multiple loads leads to asymmetric transverse strains {{that can be}} higher than longitudinal strains at the <b>bottom</b> of asphalt <b>pavement</b> layers. To analyze this effect, a model and a software called ViscoRoute have been developed. In these tools, the structure is represented by a multilayered half-space, the thermo-viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt layers is accounted by the Huet-Sayegh rheological law and loads are assumed to move at constant speed. First, the paper presents a comparison of results obtained with ViscoRoute to results stemming from the specialized literature. For thick asphalt pavement and several configurations of moving loads, other ViscoRoute simulations confirm {{that it is necessary}} to incorporate viscoelastic effects in the modelling to well predict the pavement behaviour and to anticipate possible damages in the structure.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to find the relationship between the thickness of pavement with the percentage of bottom ash. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values are tested by adding 4 % and 8 % of <b>bottom</b> ash in <b>pavement</b> design as to determine thickness of the pavement using original sample and different percentage of additive. As the thickness of the pavement varies, the cost constructing the road pavement structure has been calculated for original, 4 % and 8 % of bottomash. The CBR value of the sample increases from 4. 40 % to 8. 71 % as the percentage of bottom ash is increased by 4 %. The addition of the original sample with 8 % of bottom ash has increased the CBR value to 13. 31. Overall, the addition of bottom ash to the original sample has increased the value of CBR thus decreasing the cost of constructing the road pavement structrure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{creation}} of large impervious surface in urban and urbanizing areas {{have led to}} significant impacts on local climate, which {{is commonly known as}} urban heat island (UHI). In this study, porous pavements made of recycled sludge were examined as a way to control UHI by lowering the surface temperature. A novel image analysis technique was applied to quantify cooling effect of porous pavement materials without and with water. Although the porous pavement itself has smaller heat capacity than the natural soil, supplying water to the pavement decreased its surface temperature. At its highest point, the difference in surface temperatures without and with water was more than 10 o C. The water was supplied either {{from the top of the}} pavement or from the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pavement</b> using the capillary effects. In both cases, pavement temperature was effectively lowered. The cooling effect of pavement by surface coating using epoxy-based polymers was negligible because surface pores were blocked. Field tests also confirmed the cooling potential of porous pavements...|$|R

Based on the {{discussion}} of beneath cement concrete pavement void disease, the slab bottom grouting is the main method to solve the disease, and also discussing the strength, frost resistance, resistance to shrinkage, flow uniformity, grouting construction points and ratio of grouting materials, the key points of construction quality control of grouting are specified, the cement pavement disease treatments are put forward.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{structural}} behaviour of asphalt pavements on steel bridges and {{on the influence of}} the pavement on the reduction of stresses and strains in orthotropic decks. For this aim a simplified model has been proposed for evaluating the effects attributable to local bending of the steel deck. This model can be represented by a simply supported continuous plate that is made by the pavement, waterproofing, and deck. The pavement and waterproofing are considered to {{be an integral part of}} the structural deck system. Based on this model, a finite-element software was used for estimating stresses and strains both in the pavement and deck as a function of loads, temperatures, and dynamic modulus of asphalt mixture. The results showed that tensile stresses and strains at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pavement</b> due to the positive bending moment are higher than those at the top of the pavement produced by negative bending moment. The pavement contributed significantly towards reducing stresses and strains in the orthotropic deck by increasing the dynamic modulus of asphalt mixture. This means that a higher fatigue life of steel orthotropic decks might be expected. Thus, it is proposed that bridge designers should take these results into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the performance of cementitious high carbon fly ash (CHCFA) stabilized recycled asphalt pavement as a base course material in a real world setting. Three test road cells were built at MnROAD facility in Minnesota. These cells have the same asphalt surface layers, subbases, and subgrades, but three different base courses: conventional crushed aggregates, untreated recycled pavement materials (RPM), and CHCFA stabilized RPM materials. During and after the construction of the three cells, laboratory and field tests were carried out to characterize the material properties. The test results were used in the mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide (MEPDG) to predict the pavement performance. Based on the performance prediction, the life cycle analyses of cost, energy consumption, and greenhouse gasses were performed. The leaching impacts of these three types of base materials were compared. The laboratory and field tests showed that fly ash stabilized RPM had higher modulus than crushed aggregate and RPM did. Based on the MEPDG performance prediction, the service life of the Cell 79 containing fly ash stabilized RPM, is 23. 5 years, which is about twice the service life (11 years) of the Cell 77 with RPM base, and about three times the service life (7. 5 years) of the Cell 78 with crushed aggregate base. The life cycle analysis indicated that the usage of the fly ash stabilized RPM as the base of the flexible pavement can significantly reduce the life cycle cost, the energy consumption, the greenhouse gases emission. Concentrations of many trace elements, particularly those with relatively low water quality standards, diminish over time as water flows through the pavement profile. For many elements, concentrations below US water drinking water quality standards are attained at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pavement</b> profile within 2 - 4 pore volumes of flow...|$|R
40|$|Moisture {{damage of}} the asphalt mixture {{is defined as}} the loss of strength, {{stiffness}} and durability due to the presence of moisture (in a liquid or vapour state) leading to adhesive failure at the aggregate-bitumen interface and/or the cohesive failure within the bitumen or bitumen-filler mastic. The presence of moisture can accelerate the distress of asphalt pavement in several different modes, such as rutting, fatigue cracking, thermal cracking and the formation of potholes. In the field, the moisture damage normally happens first at the interface of two pavement layers or at the <b>bottom</b> of <b>pavement</b> layers and develops gradually upward. Once moisture has come into contact and interacted with the asphalt mixture, moisture damage could be developed by the following mechanisms: detachment, displacement, spontaneous emulsification, pore pressure, and hydraulic scour. It should be mentioned that moisture damage is not limited to only one mechanism but {{is the result of a}} combination of several mechanisms. As mentioned previously, the common modes of moisture damage of asphalt mixtures are a loss of adhesion between the aggregate and bitumen and/or a loss of cohesion in the mixture. Among these two failures, the adhesive failure is recognised as the main mode of moisture damage. Hence, the physico-chemical interactions between aggregates and bitumen in the presence of moisture are believed to partially govern the moisture sensitivity of asphalt mixtures, which can also affect the serviceability, performance and durability of the asphalt pavement. This thesis describes the work that was carried out with regard to the moisture damage evaluation of aggregate-bitumen bonds through different procedures. The fundamental properties of the individual material such as the chemical composition and rheological properties of bitumen, moisture absorption, surface morphology and mineralogical composition of aggregates were first characterised. Two types of equipment, namely the dynamic contact angle (DCA) analyser and dynamic vapour sorption (DVS) system were used for determining the surface energy of the bitumen and aggregates, respectively. The obtained surface energy results were then combined thermodynamically to determine the work of adhesion between aggregate and bitumen, and the reduction in the adhesive properties if water is introduced into the system. Three established mechanical tests consisting of the standard peel test, Pneumatic Adhesion Tensile Testing Instrument (PATTI) test and a pull off test were developed and redesigned to make sure that these tests are practical, reliable and feasible to measure the bonding strength of aggregate-bitumen combined specimens. The composite substrate peel test (CSPT) was developed to prepare composite substrates using crushed coarse aggregates as a more practical replacement for the aggregate substrates prepared from aggregate boulders. Finally, the moisture damage results from mechanical tests and thermodynamic results were compared and correlated with the basic physico-chemical properties of the original materials. The results showed that in the dry condition, all techniques used in this research, including the mechanical tests and the surface energy tests led to similar results, with bitumen rather than aggregates dominating the bonding properties of aggregate-bitumen systems. After moisture conditioning, the four mechanical tests, including standard peel test, CSPT, PATTI test and pull-off test showed similar moisture sensitivity ranking and failure surface results demonstrating the good correlation between these four tests. In addition, based on the comparison conducted, the four mechanical tests are all considered to be reliable to evaluate the moisture sensitivity of different aggregate-bitumen systems. However, based on the aggregates considered in this research, the moisture sensitivity parameters obtained from the surface energy tests are suggested unreliable to evaluate the moisture sensitivity of aggregate-bitumen systems...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversityTransverse {{cracking}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} distress types in asphalt pavement. The crack initiates from pavement surface and propagates downward (thermal cracking), or initiates from <b>pavement</b> <b>bottom</b> and propagates upward (reflective cracking). In this study, the mechanism and key factors of a transverse cracking type named Surface-initiated reflective cracking (SIRC) are identified and evaluated. SIRC refers to crack that initiates at the surface of pavement layer in transverse direction and propagates downward to match the existing transverse cracking, and there is no cracking in the interlayer. The mechanism and key factors of the SIRC are evaluated by using three-dimensional Finite Element Method and laboratory modified Hamburg Wheel Tracking Test. Results indicate that when the HMA surface layer is thick, thermal load associated with traffic load, overlay stiffness and thickness above existing crack/joint are the key factors to initiate SIRC. When the pavement thickness is at certain thickness range (i. e., thick enough to protect the existing crack/joint to move but not too thick which can allow the surface layer bending downward with weak base structure), with relative stiff overlay material and weak base, tensile stress can develop at the surface of the pavement layer which can ultimate lead to SIRC under repeated traffic load. The widely used transverse cracking prediction model TCMODEL is evaluated to check its predictive quality on conventional transverse cracking and the SIRC. It is found that the predicted transverse crack from TCMODEL do not match well with the field measurements and therefore, it is necessary to develop new predictive models for transverse cracking including all transverse cracking types. Statistical methods in conjunction with engineering interpretation is used to develop crack initiation and propagation models for both SIRC and conventional transverse cracking. Hour of low temperature (< 15 °F), percent passing # 200 sieve, IDT strength and service life (age) are found to be the critical indicators for the initiation of the transverse cracking. Material properties (mixture creep compliance, work density, and percent passing # 200 sieve), pavement structure (overlay thickness), climate (hour of low temperature), and traffic (AADTT) are found to be critical factors for the propagation of the transverse cracking.

40|$|Although {{possessing}} remarkable toughness in {{its original}} state, asphalt concrete (AC) becomes brittle and prone to damage with time {{in the form of}} costly pavement cracking. The time required to reach an unacceptable level of embrittlement depends upon a number of factors and varies widely from pavement to pavement, even within a given region and mixture type. Given the annual costs associated with pavement repair of damage caused by mechanical and thermal loads, considerable interest exists in testing methods to estimate damage in AC pavements. Current methods to evaluate the existing conditions of AC pavement surfaces for sustainability-based pavement asset management are based upon the binder’s rheological properties, are time consuming, costly, and by themselves, may cause additional damage. Oxidative aging is a key contributor in the deterioration of AC pavements. Exposure to environmental conditions causes gradual oxidative aging of the AC, where the highest aged material is located at the surface, whereas the material at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pavement</b> is significantly less aged. Over time, increasing aging at the surface leads to a pavement with graded material properties through its thickness where the material near the surface has warmer embrittlement temperatures and higher stiffness when compared with the bottom of the layer. Increasing aging also results in significant loss of adhesion between the binder, aggregates, and fines, which contributes to an increase in the microflaw population in the mastic and at the interfaces between the mastic and the aggregates. As the pavement is subjected to thermal and mechanical loads, microcracks develop and coalesce to form larger cracks. Repeated loading and exposure to environmental conditions eventually leads to significant deterioration of AC pavements. Although surveys are conducted to monitor the condition of pavements and to determine when preventative or corrective maintenance is necessary, accurate assessment of the amount of pavement deterioration has remained a challenge. A study to assess oxidative aging of AC using noncollinear wave mixing of two dilatational waves will be presented. Criteria are used to assure that the detected scattered wave originated via wave interaction in the AC and not from nonlinearities in the testing equipment. These criteria include frequency and propagating direction of the resultant scattered wave, and the time-of-flight separation between the two primary waves and the resulting scattered wave. It was observed that AC exhibits nonlinear behavior. It was also observed that the nonlinear response decreases with increased aging until ~ 24 hours of aging after which the nonlinear response exponentially increases. This observation is consistent with earlier studies including acoustic emission response to thermal loading, and with changes in dynamic modulus and fracture energy with increasing aging...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between predicted and observed fatigue life of asphalt. This study also investigates {{the positive effects of}} modifying bitumen with Retona, a bitumen modifier produced in Indonesia from natural asphalt rock sources, on pavement performance in terms of increased resistance to fatigue and permanent deformation. Classical pavement fatigue analysis assumes cracking to initiate from the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pavement</b> and propagates to the top. However, when relating ‘predicted’ pavement fatigue life to ‘observed’ fatigue life, one immediately encounters a ‘conflict’ with theory because in practice cracks are also initiated at the pavement surface. This thesis also attempts to explain the phenomenon of surface or top-down cracking. In the past, many studies were made to validate design procedures by matching predicted performance with field performance. However, this project, only takes into account the studies that were carried out in the Netherlands and by Dutch researchers elsewhere. Test results performed in the 1990 ’s on three pavement sections on the accelerated pavement testing facility Lintrack, then owned by the Section of Road and Railway Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering Delft University of Technology, have therefore been used in this study. The Lintrack research provided a large amount of valuable data with respect to pavement performance and was therefore perfectly suited for a study to match theory with practice. To achieve these goals, several steps were taken. Firstly, the data obtained from observations made on the Lintrack accelerated pavement test sections (built in 1990) were studied. The sections were simple two-layered pavement systems consisting of a gravel asphalt concrete (GAC) layer overlying a sand subgrade. The data consisted of information on the geometry and material characteristics of the test pavements, loading and environmental conditions, deflection test results and visual condition data in terms of cracking and permanent deformation. Secondly, a fatigue cracking prediction model was developed based on laboratory data obtained from four point bending (4 PB) tests on the same material type. To more accurately simulate the fatigue behaviour of a real pavement in the laboratory, a new test setup termed as the “beam on elastic foundation” (BOEF) test was developed. Since the GAC pavement sections built in 1990 had been removed, the GAC (GAC 1990) material was not available anymore. Therefore, a new GAC (GAC 2010) mixture needed to be produced and considerable efforts were made to produce the GAC 2010 mixture such that it truly replicated the GAC 1990 mixture. Material characterization tests performed to understand better the GAC 2010 mixture included, in addition to the two mentioned fatigue tests; monotonic uniaxial tension and compression tests, indirect tension tests, mastic healing tests and tests on the recovered bitumen such as penetration and Dynamic Shear Rheometer tests. The analysis of the Lintrack APT sections was carried out by determining; (1) the pavement life based on the back calculated modulus of the asphalt layer for different probability of survival levels, and (2) the magnitude of damage that was initiated {{at the bottom of the}} asphalt layer expressed by means of Miner’s damage ratio. The cumulative damage ratio, ni/Nfi (Miner’s ratio), was calculated based on the tensile strain at the bottom of the asphalt layer at different temperatures that occurred during the Lintrack tests and the fatigue relationships that were obtained from 4 PB and BOEF fatigue laboratory tests. It is shown that the observed pavement life based on the back-calculated asphalt modulus from deflection measurements is longer than the pavement life calculated on the basis of damage initiation at the bottom of the asphalt layer. The results showed that for all three Lintrack sections, the BOEF based predictions exhibited a better agreement as evidenced from the smaller shift factor between “field stiffness reduction” lifetime and the lifetime based on “fatigue” predictions. Therefore, BOEF test based fatigue models are highly recommended to be used for predicting pavement life in practice. This study has shown that it is very difficult to relate cracking visible at the surface of the pavement to the initiation of fatigue damage at the bottom of the asphalt layer. Finite element simulations using detailed tyre–pavement contact pressure modelling have been carried out. The results showed that significant tensile strains had developed at the pavement surface. The magnitude of these tensile strains was such that they can be held responsible for the development of surface cracking. It should be noted however that surface cracking cannot be explained using a stress based analysis. This study clearly showed that permanent deformation (in this study this was permanent deformation of the subgrade) exhibits significant effects on the formation of longitudinal cracks at the edges of the wheel paths. The study on modifying GAC with Retona showed that the GAC+Retona mixture exhibits better mechanical properties compared to the reference GAC mixture. The Retona modified mixture showed a higher fatigue life and higher resistance to permanent deformation compared to the reference GAC mixture...|$|R
