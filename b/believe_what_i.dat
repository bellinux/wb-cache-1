25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst Clarkson {{states such}} views in his columns {{and in public}} appearances, his public persona does not {{necessarily}} represent his personal views, as he acknowledged whilst interviewing Alastair Campbell saying [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> write, {{any more than you}} [...] believe what you say".|$|E
2500|$|In 1188, Raymond {{attacked}} again, {{joined by}} the Lusignans, vassals of Richard. It was rumoured that Henry himself had financed the revolts. Philip attacked Henry in Normandy and captured strongholds in Berry, then they met to discuss peace again. Henry refused to make Richard his heir, with one story reporting that Richard said [...] "Now at last, I must <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had always thought impossible." ...|$|E

6000|$|Himself he {{answered}} her: [...] "I killed Samoval. It was I who fought that duel. And then <b>believing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did, I fastened the guilt upon Ned, and went the lengths of perjury in my blind effort to avenge myself. That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done. Tell me, one of you, of your charity, {{what is there}} left for me to do?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, Gullit recalled, [...] "Four {{months ago}} I visited Robben Island and met three {{guys who were}} cell-mates of Nelson Mandela. They remembered me {{dedicating}} my award in 1987 to Mandela {{and they said they}} couldn’t <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had done, and were sure the football authorities would withdraw the award. That's what apartheid did to them, it made them believe injustice was a normal part of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Cimino, {{he would}} call Washburn while on the road {{scouting}} for locations and feed him notes on dialogue and story. Upon reviewing Washburn's draft, Cimino said, [...] "I came back, and read it and I just could not <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> read. It was like {{it was written by}} somebody who was... mentally deranged." [...] Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn't take the pressure and had to go home. Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself. Washburn's response to Cimino's comments were, [...] "It's all nonsense. It's lies. I didn't have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many other celebrities {{released}} statements {{responding to}} Houston's death. Darlene Love, Houston's godmother, hearing {{the news of}} her death, said, [...] "It felt like I had been struck by a lightning bolt in my gut." [...] Dolly Parton, whose song [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] was covered by Houston, said, [...] "I will always be grateful and {{in awe of the}} wonderful performance she did on my song, and I can truly say {{from the bottom of my}} heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you.

'Yes,' said Mrs. Prendergast, 'while {{we lived}} at our dear old country home, <b>I</b> never quite <b>believed</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> heard of jealous ill-nature, but I {{have seen how}} it was ever since those Christmas parties, when {{certainly}} people paid her {{a great deal of}} attention.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took the}} pistols, {{scarcely}} knowing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did, or <b>believing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> heard, while Dupin went on, {{very much as}} if in a soliloquy. I have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance. His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.|$|R

I'm sorry. Sorry, sir.' So I ask him another question, {{he looks at his}} watch and I said, 'You're done, get out of here." [...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> just witnessed, and so I call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I get on the phone and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell. Don't take Calvin Johnson, but don't take JaMarcus Russell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirby {{moved on}} to comic-book {{publisher}} and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate, earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle, published [...] from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas, a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon, who {{in addition to his}} staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, [...] "I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was seeing. He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and I took him over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of Blue Bolt through... about 25 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trump recalls {{some of his}} romantic exploits, [...] "Beautiful, famous, successful, married — I’ve {{had them}} all, secretly, the world’s biggest names." [...] Trump {{reflects}} on how such exploits made him feel at the time, [...] "Oftentimes when I was sleeping {{with one of the}} top women in the world I would say to myself, thinking about me as a boy from Queens, 'Can you <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am getting?'" [...] He explained that he was successful in his endeavors with women due to some unknown quality he possessed, [...] "The women I have dated over the years could have any man they want; they are the top models and most beautiful women in the world. I have been able to date (screw) them all because I have something that many men do not have. I don’t know what it is but women have always liked it." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{looked at}} me in wide-eyed consternation for a moment, and then she went very white and rose from her seat. [...] "I do," [...] she replied, and turning her back upon me, she walked quickly toward her room. I started to follow, for even <b>believing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did, I was sorry that I had hurt her. I reached {{the door to the}} crew's room just behind her and in time to see von Schoenvorts lean forward and whisper {{something}} to her as she passed; but she must have guessed that she might be watched, for she passed on.|$|R

2500|$|Cao Xing {{refused to}} betray Lü Bu {{so he turned}} against Hao Meng and fought with his superior. During the fight, Hao Meng injured Cao Xing with his spear, but Cao managed to cut off one of Hao's arms with his sword. By then, Gao Shun had shown up to attack Hao Meng's camp and he {{beheaded}} Hao. Cao Xing was placed on a stretcher and sent to Xiapi to meet Lü Bu. Lü Bu asked him, [...] "Hao Meng was instigated by Yuan Shu. Who else {{is involved in the}} plot?" [...] Cao Xing replied, [...] "Chen Gong is an accomplice." [...] At that time, Chen Gong was nearby and he gave an obvious angry expression when his name was mentioned. Lü Bu felt that Chen Gong was his key adviser so he refused to believe the accusation. Cao Xing said, [...] "Hao Meng often urged me to rebel, but I said that you, General, are like a god and cannot be defeated. Unfortunately, Hao Meng refused to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> told him." [...] Lü Bu then exclaimed, [...] "You're a true soldier!" [...] He treated Cao Xing well and placed him in charge of Hao Meng's men after he had recovered.|$|E
