5|$|In the Hanzhong state, sin and {{criminal}} <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> not differentiated. In order to eliminate sin, an adherent {{first had to}} acknowledge his crime, and then {{would have to go}} to a 'quiet room' to meditate. There, he would have to write three confessions which would be offered to the Lord of Heaven, the Lord of Earth and the Lord of Water. For public crimes, an accused would be pardoned three times for his actions and then be sentenced. A sentence depended on the type of crime, but always involved community service. For a minor crime, the sentence was usually to repair a road. A repeat offender might be asked to donate building materials to improve local buildings. Other laws banned alcohol and prohibited the killing of animals during the spring and summer.|$|E

25|$|Fantasies {{of group}} sex are {{extremely}} common among {{both men and}} women. In major studies, between 54 and 88% of people fantasize about watching others have sex, between 40 and 42% fantasize about being watched by others, and between 39 and 72% fantasize about bondage.

25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, Boltzmann's science was being {{threatened}} by another philosophical objection. Some physicists, including Mach's student, Gustav Jaumann, interpreted Hertz to mean that all electromagnetic behavior is continuous, as if there were no atoms and molecules, and likewise as if all physical <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> ultimately electromagnetic. This movement around 1900 deeply depressed Boltzmann since it could mean the end of his kinetic theory and statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} study Human Sexual Response {{was published by}} Masters and Johnson in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask) by psychiatrist David Reuben was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted {{not just from the}} publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive sexual revolution that had already been well underway for some time.|$|E
50|$|Operant {{conditioning}} (or instrumental conditioning) {{is a form}} {{of learning}} in which an individual's <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> modified by its consequences. Two complementary motivations drive instrumental learning: the maximization of positive outcomes and minimization of aversive ones. There are two ways in which <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> reinforced or strengthened: positive reinforcement occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by producing some desirable consequence; negative reinforcement occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> strengthened by avoiding some undesirable consequence. There are two ways in which <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> decreased or weakened: negative punishment occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> weakened by not producing a reinforcing consequence; and positive punishment occurs when a <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> weakened by producing a consequence that is a disincentive. In combination, these basic reinforcing and punishing contingencies provide four ways for modifying behavior. Reinforcement increases the relative probability or frequency of the behavior it follows, while punishment decreases the relative probability or frequency of the behaviour it follows.|$|R

25|$|A small 2004 {{study by}} Ellen Paek empirically {{examined}} {{the extent to}} which religiosity, operationalized as religious orientation and religious behavior, is related to the controversial idea of emotional intelligence (EI). The study examined {{the extent to which}} religious orientation and <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> related to self-reported EI in 148 church attending adult Christians. Non-religious individuals were not part of the study. The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, number of years of church attendance was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.|$|E
25|$|MnO2 and RuO2 {{are typical}} {{materials}} used as electrodes for pseudocapacitors, {{since they have}} the electrochemical signature of a capacitive electrode (linear dependence on current versus voltage curve) as well as exhibiting faradaic behavior. Additionally, the charge storage originates from electron-transfer mechanisms rather than accumulation of ions in the electrochemical double layer. Pseudocapacitors were created through faradaic redox reactions that occur within the active electrode materials. More research was focused on transition-metal oxides such as MnO2 since transition-metal oxides haves a lower cost compared to noble metal oxides such as RuO2. Moreover, the charge storage mechanisms of transition-metal oxides are based predominantly on pseudocapacitance. Two mechanisms of MnO2 charge storage <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> introduced. The first mechanism implies the intercalation of protons (H+) or alkali metal cations (C+) in {{the bulk of the}} material upon reduction followed by deintercalation upon oxidation.|$|E

Interpersonal theorists argue that [...] "behavioral patterns {{are determined by the}} characteristics of the situation, how the person perceives them, and his behavioral dispositions at the time." [...] The most important component of personality is self-esteem. Blassingame explains, [...] "Our sense of self-esteem is heightened or lowered by our perception of the images others have of us." [...] Interpersonal behavior revolves around the dominant-submissive axes: [...] "One form of behavior tends to elicit its complement: dominance leads to submission and vice versa. The extent of submissiveness often depends on the structure of the group to which the person belongs." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to Ticonderoga, Arnold began to exert more {{authority over the}} place as Allen's men drifted away. [...] However, a Connecticut force of 1,000 men under Colonel Benjamin Hinman arrived in June with orders placing him in command with Arnold as his subordinate. This act angered Arnold, who felt his {{efforts on behalf of}} the revolution were not being recognized; he resigned his commission and headed for his home in Connecticut. [...] Arnold's angry response to the loss of command led some members of Congress to dislike him in spite of his military contributions. [...] Congressional opinion of Arnold was also negatively affected by reports circulated by two men that Arnold came to consider enemies. [...] John Brown and James Easton were two of Allen's lieutenants who had traveled to Massachusetts and Philadelphia to report on the action. [...] While their characterizations of Arnold's <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> accurate, he apparently came to believe that they had probably slandered him, and later interactions with both men were marked by conflict. [...] In an encounter between Arnold and Easton in June, Easton slighted Arnold's authority, to which Arnold responded by challenging the other man to a duel. [...] Easton demurred, and Arnold, in his account of the affair, [...] "took the Liberty of Breaking his head". [...] After Arnold resigned his Massachusetts commission, the state's Committee of Safety appointed Easton to take over the Massachusetts troops at Ticonderoga.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{is complex and}} does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative. Accounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome {{are thought to be}} rare in historical records before the 19th century, although reports of irrational, unintelligible, or uncontrolled <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> common. A detailed case report in 1797 concerning James Tilly Matthews, and accounts by Philippe Pinel published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature. The Latinized term dementia praecox was first used by German alienist Heinrich Schule in 1886 and then in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder (hebephrenia). In 1893 Emil Kraepelin borrowed the term from Schule and Pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). [...] Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was probably caused by a long-term, smouldering systemic or [...] "whole body" [...] disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after puberty in a final decisive cascade. [...] His use of the term [...] "praecox" [...] distinguished it from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease which typically occur later in life. It is sometimes argued that {{the use of the term}} démence précoce in 1852 by the French physician Bénédict Morel constitutes the medical discovery of schizophrenia. However, this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect Morel's descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the dementia praecox disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century.|$|E
500|$|The 26-episode anime {{adaptation}} of Outlaw Star began broadcasting in Japan on TV Tokyo from January 8, 1998 and ended on June 25, 1998, though the broadcast began on January 9, {{as it was}} in a 1:15A.M. time slot. The series was licensed by Bandai Entertainment The English version was produced by ZRO Limit Productions and was aired on the evening Toonami block beginning on January 15, 2001. This broadcast of the show was heavily edited due to its adult content. Profanity was removed, scenes with violence and lewd <b>behavior</b> <b>were</b> cut or toned down, and many scenes containing nudity were altered by digitally inserting clothing onto characters. Episode 23, in which the Outlaw Star crew visits a hot spring planet, was not aired due to nudity and suggestive themes. However, some instances of adult language were not removed for the anime's initial run. Sean Akins, Toonami's creative director, claimed that Cartoon Network made all of their own edits to their licensed properties during this time period, which they did [...] "in a way that preserves the story". The role of Fred Luo, a recurring homosexual character, was considerably toned down. Cartoon Network had no specific editing policy with regard to gay characters, but that [...] "overt sexuality or implied sexuality of any kind are not allowed". Outlaw Star was also aired on the late night Adult Swim block throughout 2002. However, the broadcast was cancelled late in the year and, according to Akins, the network allowed its rights to the anime to expire by 2003. Outlaw Star was aired in the United Kingdom on CNX in October 2002. Following Funimation's acquisition of the series, the series is currently planned to be aired again on Cartoon Network, with their current Toonami block starting on Saturday August 19, 2017 at 2:30am.|$|E
