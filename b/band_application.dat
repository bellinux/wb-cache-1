In Queensland, Australia, the runoff of PSII inhibitor herbicides (in particular diuron and atrazine) {{is a major concern}} due to their potential impact on the Great Barrier Reef. This study compared the conventional practice of broadcast application of herbicides in sugarcane production across the whole field with the <b>banded</b> <b>application</b> of particular herbicides onto raised beds only using a shielded sprayer. This study found that the application of two moderately soluble herbicides, diuron and atrazine, to only the raised beds decreased the average total load of both herbicides moving off-site by > 90 % compared with the conventional treatment. This was despite the area being covered with the herbicides by the <b>banded</b> <b>application</b> being only 60 % less than with the conventional treatment.

Similarly, the average total amount of diuron in drainage water was 4. 6 % of that applied in the conventional treatment compared with 0. 9 % of that applied in the <b>banded</b> <b>application</b> treatment.

This can only be achieved through assessing and validating them at real farm scale and using existing farm equipment, under diverse climatic and soil conditions representa- tive of European agriculture. In 2013 and 2014, 12 on-farm experiments (i. e. real field conditions on com- mercial farms, with natural weed flora) were conducted in four important European grain maize-producing regions comparing the efficacy of herbicide band appli- cation integrated with inter-row mechanical weeding as a potential IWM tool with the conventional broadcast herbicide application (CON) used by the farms. The IWM tools tested were as follows: (i) early post-emer- gence herbicide <b>band</b> <b>application</b> combined with hoeing, followed by a second hoeing in southern Ger- many, (ii) early post-emergence herbicide band appli- cation followed by hoeing in eastern Hungary and central Slovenia and (iii) pre-emergence herbicide <b>band</b> <b>application</b> followed by hoeing in northern Italy. Her- bicide <b>band</b> <b>application</b> integrated with hoeing pro- vided good and partial weed control along and between maize rows respectively.
