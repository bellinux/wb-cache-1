However, Luthria was looking for an older actor and chose Kumar {{for the role of}} Shoaib Khan (based on Dawood Ibrahim). In February 2012 it was announced that there were two male leads in the film, the second said to be Shahid Kapoor, but the following month Imran Khan was confirmed as the second male lead. Many actresses were considered for the female lead, including Illeana D'Cruz, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Asin Thottumkal, Sonam Kapoor and Deepika Padukone, but in April it was reported that Sonakshi Sinha had been cast. Sonali Bendre was also signed as a lead character in the film. The film marked Bendre's first role since Shankar Dada MBBS. Bendre did not charge her fees for the film owing to the fact that Sobha Kapoor, one of the producers of the film has been the friend of her Mother-in-law for the past 40 years also out of gratitude for Luthria, who shot her first song Sambhala hai Maine in the 1994 film Naaraaz. In November 2012, it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on Eid 2013. TV actor Chetan Hansraj was signed as an antagonist in the film. Kumar revealed during the trailer launch of the film about having no aspirations to set new benchmarks on a role previously enacted by Hashmi. Khan in preparation {{for his role in the}} film drew inspiration from Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor, copying their mannerisms, behaviour and dressing style by watching DVD's of films starring them produced in the 1980s. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> copying mannerism of film stars drew appreciation from peers.|$|E

It was also thought to be too distant from the Rand Tram (opened from Boksburg to Springs in 1890 in order to service the coalfields discovered in Springs and in Brakpan) that trundled along far away, just north of Leeupan before curving around near the present day Apex station then <b>back</b> towards Brakpan. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>days,</b> Brakpan did not exist as a town, only as The Brakpan Colliery.

The blinds were down over the windows of his room, shut up in his absence, and from where he sat he could only hear a rustle, her footsteps crossing, till beyond the bed he saw her standing before his dressing-table. She had something in her hand. He hardly breathed, hoping she would not see him, and go away. He saw her touch things on the table as if they had some virtue in them, then face the window--grey from head to foot like a ghost. The least turn of her head, and she must see him! Her lips moved: [...] "Oh! Jon!" [...] She was speaking to herself; the tone of her voice troubled Jon's heart. He saw in her hand a little photograph.

40|$|The {{particle}} image velocimetry technique (PIV) allows {{to measure}} instantaneous flow velocity fields within a thin sheet {{or a small}} volume illuminated by laser light by determining the velocity of tracer particles following the flow faithfully. PIV is under development for more than 25 years. Due to the fast progress made {{in the field of}} computers, lasers, electronics, video technique etc. in the past decade it was possible to set up reliable, modular and mobile advanced measurement systems which cannot only be used for fundamental research such as turbulent flows but also in industrial test facilities such as in large wind tunnels. The latter being one of DLR’s primary objectives, teams of the University of Oldenburg and DLR carried out measurements of the instantaneous flow field by means of Particle Image Velocimetry {{for the first time in}} a wind tunnel of DLR Göttingen <b>back</b> <b>in</b> 1984. <b>In</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> the recording of the PIV images had to be done photographically. Also, the evaluation of the recordings to obtain the displacement of the images of the tracer particles, added to the flow, had to be performed optically. A few months later DLR had the first double oscillator Nd:YAG laser at its disposal and started the development of a PIV system applicable for aerodynamic research in large industrial wind tunnels. Around 1995 a major breakthrough in the development of PIV, which has been a prerequisite to bring this technique out of the laboratory, has been made. Then, digital video cameras, allowing capturing the two frames of a PIV recording within a short time interval and with full spatial resolution became available. In the following decade the PIV technique has been widely spread and differentiated into many distinct applications ranging from micro flows to combustion and supersonic flows, both for research and industrial needs. Nowadays the PIV technique is considered a ‘validated tool’ by the aeronautical industry and used in large industrial wind tunnels to support the design of new aircraft to reduce drag, noise etc. to meet the challenges of VISION 2020. The presentation will give a short historical overview of the development of the PIV technique from photographical PIV recording and evaluation to high speed PIV and tomographic PIV, which became important tools for turbulence research...|$|R
40|$|Where does patch come from? According to Publish or Perish, the {{earliest}} appearance of “patch ” {{as a technical}} term in the open literature was in Haralick’s 1973 paper on textural features for image classification [1] (the term could exist before that {{but it is difficult}} to track <b>back</b> further). <b>In</b> <b>those</b> old <b>days,</b> pixels are termed “ ” and small-area typically refer to a window or patch of 3 × 3 pixels. Seven years later, in JS Lee’s pioneering paper on image enhancement [2], local statistics (e. g., mean and variance) are calculated on a patch-by-patch basis in order to drive the filter to remove additive or multiplicative noise. In early 1980 s, computing optical flow (e. g., Horn’s method [3]) or disparity field (e. g., Lukas-Kanade algorithm [4]) from a pair of images is also based on the assumption that the gradient of image intensity field can be locally calculated within a patch where patch is often interchanged with the term window or block. Fast advances of communication and computing technologies in later 1980 s and early 1990 s stimulated the research into image compression especially the development of standard [5]. Under the context of JPEG compression, 2 Perceptual Digital Imaging: Methods and Applications 8 × 8 [6] became the favorite but also contributed to the notorious block artifact; from this perspective, decomposing an image into non-overlapping patches or blocks represents a simple yet effective way of overcoming the [7].
