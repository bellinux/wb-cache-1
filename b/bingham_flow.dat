In the salt-floec~dated gels there must be an energy barrier causing thixotropic hysteresis. This might be expected from the summation of residual double-layer repulsion and van der Waals attraction.

The second approach uses a locally-implicit formulation to simultaneously solve for the fluid stress and the underlying particle distribution functions. After investigating issues related to the lattice symmetry and non-hydrodynamic Burnett stresses, the two models were compared in terms of spatial convergence and their behaviour in transient and inertial flows. The choice of lattice and the presence of Burnett stresses was found to influence the results of both models, however the latter did not significantly degrade the velocity field.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of a {{lava flow}} is reproduced by a two-dimensional {{model of a}} Bingham liquid flowing down a slope. The liquid is described by two parameters, viscosity and yield stress, both strongly temperature dependent. Assuming liquidus temperature at the eruption vent, the temperature decrease due to the heat loss by radiation produces changes in the rheological parameters and, consequently, in velocity, strain and strain rate along the flow. Velocity, compressive strain, strain rate and stress along the flow direction are computed as functions of {{the distance from the}} vent and of time, for different kinds of lava flows (basic and acidic) and are compared with corresponding results for a Newtonian liquid. The model shows that, in connection with the pronounced velocity decrease occurring at a certain distance from the vent, the compressive strain, strain rate and stress also show a strong variation. A greater compressive strain is, in fact, induced in a <b>Bingham</b> <b>flow</b> cooling by radiation, than in a Newtonian flow.

40|$|For {{around two}} decades of {{research}} and development in the field of grouting in hard jointed rock, the design process has taken some leaps forward. Stille and Gustafson, 2005 and Funehag and Gustafson 2008, shows how a grouting design can be computed. A grouting design in hard rock can based on the penetration length of grout in rock fractures. The design comprises considerations of the fracture apertures in the rock mass, the type of grout and its rheological properties and how the grout is injected i. e pressure and grouting times. When knowing these parameters an optimized geometry fitting the design is made. Thörn, et al, 2014 describes a fundamental analysis with a comprehensive tool to retrieve the fracture distribution and aperture distribution of the fractures crossing a cored borehole. The data needed about the core is geological mapping and hydraulic section tests. In Gustafson, Claesson and Fransson, (2013) a full derivation of a radial <b>Bingham</b> <b>flow</b> in a slit is described for constant pressure. By optimizing with a specific pressure and an efficient grouting time (efficient time means the time when the pressure has reached the designed pressure) a prognosis a more realistic time consumption for grouting can be computed. However, {{the time it takes to}} reach a certain pressure is dependent on the capacity of the pump and the how large the fractures widths are. For poorly chosen pumps together with large fractures the time to reach the design pressure can be significant. The overall objective for this new formulation was to involve the grouting pressure as a variable rather than constant. A pressure build-up mimic more a realistic pumping scenario which enables better prognosis of grouting works. This paper brings up this new formulation of the radial <b>Bingham</b> <b>flow</b> with variable injection pressure in slit. The benefits of this new formulation is that it can easily be integrated in other computer programs. One program that uses this new formulation is a grouting simulator owned and developed by Edvirt AB.

Further, the results show that it can be used to predict suitable pump capacity to fit the coming grouting works...|$|E

Rheology 31 (1987) 385 - 404]. The finite volume method used belongs to a very popular class of methods for solving Newtonian flow problems, which use the SIMPLE algorithm to solve the discretised set of equations, and have matured over the years. By regularising the Bingham constitutive equation it is easy to extend such a solver to <b>Bingham</b> <b>flows</b> since all that this requires is to modify the viscosity function. This is a tempting approach, since it requires minimum programming effort and makes available all the existing features of the mature finite volume solver. On the other hand, regularisation introduces a parameter which controls the error in addition to the grid spacing, and makes it difficult to locate the yield surfaces. Furthermore, the equations become stiffer and more difficult to solve, while the discontinuity at the yield surfaces causes large truncation errors. The present work attempts to investigate {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} such a method by applying it to the lid-driven cavity problem for a range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers (up to 100 and 5000 respectively).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with new numerical and algorithmic tools for flows with pressure and shear dependent viscosity together with the necessary background of the generalized Navier-Stokes equations. In general, the viscosity can depend on the density, for instance {{in the case of}} compressible flow, and if the relation between the pressure and the density is reversible, the viscosity may depend on the pressure. This, however, is not the case for incompressible powder flow where the viscous stresses may change with varying pressure whereas density changes remain negligible. Meanwhile, the viscosity of the flow may change as the shear rate is varied, for instance in <b>Bingham</b> <b>flow.</b> Both dependencies can occur together, something that holds for the so-called nonflowing or slow-flowing materials, namely slow-flowing smaller-sized bulk powder. The Navier-Stokes equations in primitive variables (velocity-pressure) are regarded as the privilege answer to incorporate these phenomena. The modification of the viscous stresses leads to generalized Navier-Stokes equations extending the range of their validity to such flow. The resulting equations are mathematically more complex than the Navier-Stokes equations. From the numerical point of view several problems arise. Firstly, the difficulty of approximating incompressible velocity fields. Secondly, poor conditioning and possible lack of differentiability of the involved nonlinear functions due to the material laws and finally, the eventual domination of convective effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} survey {{on the whole}} field of pore formation is assembled into {{the form of a}} general theory of the causes of porosity in castings. The conventionally accepted modes of feeding are assessed: liquid-, mass-, and interdendritic- feeding; and two further mechanisms are proposed: burst- and solid-feeding. The latter is investigated theoretically using various flow models: elastic-plastic, viscous, creep and <b>Bingham</b> <b>flow.</b> A new theory is proposed for the origin of layer porosity in castings. Experimental work {{on a wide variety of}} alloys: Al-Cu, Fe-C, Complex Ni- and Co-base alloys, cast both in air and in vacuum are investigated for the effect of section thickness, taper, and mould and metal temperatures. The formation of porosity appears to change from a non-nucleation to a nucleation mechanism as section thickness increases. A new method of interpreting radiographs based upon a longitudinal line count reveals that solid feeding becomes important in reducing porosity at high mould temperatures. Experiments on the effect of composition of an alloy on porosity cast doubt on the widely accepted theory that the presence of non-equilibrium eutectic liquid reduces porosity, but indicate that the non-equilibrium freezing range of the alloy may be the critical parameter. The effect of pressure on porosity is investigated utilising pressures below atmospheric; the results are inadequately explained by current theories and are discussed in terms of the nucleation and growth of pores; the effect would also appear to have considerable industrial potential for reducing porosity in vacuum cast components...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA one-dimensional analytical model for axial deformation of continuous fiber reinforced metal-matrix composites under both thermal cycling and isothermal creep, {{with or without}} externally applied stresses, has been developed. Fibers in the model {{are considered to be}} non-creeping, therm-elastic solids, whereas the matrix is considered to be thermo-elastic-plastic and creeping. The model accounts for the strain history of the composite, and allows for changing matrix creep mechanisms via the use of unified creep laws. The use of unified creep laws allows separation of the overall instantaneous creep strain rate into dislocation creep and diffusional creep components, which can be further separated into power law breakdown, pipe diffusion controlled power law, volume diffusion controlled power law, Coble and Nabarro-Herring creep. Additionally, the model allows for the incorporation of time-dependent interfacial sliding near the extremities of the fiber due to the existence of interfacial shear stresses. Based on a recent study, interfacial creep has been represented as being controlled by diffusional flow with a threshold stress (<b>Bingham</b> <b>flow).</b> The interfacial creep law allows simulation of non-isostrain deformation across the interface, and thus the model is capable of explaining experimental observations of strain incompatibility across the interface near fiber-ends.

40|$|We propose {{and study}} a new {{numerical}} scheme {{to compute the}} isothermal and unsteady flow of an incompressible viscoplastic Bingham medium. The main difficulty, for both theoretical and numerical approaches, {{is due to the}} non-differentiability of the plastic part of stress tensor in regionswhere the rate-of-strain tensor vanishes. This is handled by reformulating the definition of the plastic stress tensor in terms ofa projection. A new time scheme, based on the classical incremental projection method for the Newtonian Navier-Stokes equations, is proposed. The plastictensor is treated implicitly in the first sub-step of the projection scheme and is computed by using a fixed point procedure. A pseudo-timerelaxation is added into the Bingham projection whose effect is to ensure a geometric convergence of the fixed point algorithm. This is akey feature of the bi-projection scheme which provides a fast and accurate computation of the plastic tensor. Stability and error analyses of the numerical scheme are provided. The error induced by the pseudo-time relaxation term is controlled bya prescribed numerical parameter so that a first-order estimate of the time error is derived for the velocity field. A second-order cell-centred finite volume scheme on staggered grids is applied for the spatial discretisation. The scheme is assessed against previously published benchmark results for both Newtonian and <b>Bingham</b> <b>flows</b> in a two-dimensional lid-drivencavity for Reynolds number equals 1 000. Moreover, the proposed numerical scheme is able to reproduce the fundamental property of cessation in finite time of a viscoplasticmedium {{in the absence of any}} energy source term in the equations.
