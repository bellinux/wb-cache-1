25|$|By {{the time}} Buenaventura became central bank governor, over fifteen {{percent of the}} total loan {{portfolio}} of the entire banking sector was considered non-performing loans. Within the next year, this peaked at seventeen percent. The need to unload these <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> before they collapsed the industry spurred the BSP-led lobby for the Special Purpose Vehicles Act, a law that would allow banks to sell their <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> at a discount to companies that specialized in taking over <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> and turning them around. Carefully orchestrating the lobby before both houses of Congress, Buenaventura led the efforts for the passage of the law, telling lawmakers that the banking industry needed the flexibility since the government did not have the resources to launch its own rescue efforts.|$|E

This method exploits institutional features common in both countries which suggest a close linkage between default on notes and default on bank borrowing. Our main findings are as follows. First, {{the pattern of the}} estimated <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> rate series generally conforms to past business cycle patterns in both countries. Second, the <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> rate is substantially higher in Korea than Japan. Lastly, a much tighter linkage is observed for Japan between the <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> rate and a set of plausible economic explanatory variables. We offer some interpretation for these findings.

40|$|How do banks {{resolve a}} severe <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> {{problem in a}} capital-constrained, low income country when a {{government}} bailout is not an option? We address this question by examining new evidence of {{a sharp decline in}} <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> ratios in a panel of domestic banks in Bangladesh. On the aggregate level, the share of nonperforming loans in this market has dropped six fold, from above 41 % in 1999 to below 7 % in 2010. Notably, this dramatic improvement did not involve the creation of any centralized asset management facilities but relied on the bank management and governance reforms. We find that the gradual reduction of the <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> ratio is primarily driven by bank-level management quality improvements and macro-level economic and financial development factors.

25|$|The banking {{industry}} proved more enthusiastic about Buenaventura’s appointment as BSP governor than Buenaventura himself expected. It had good reason: Buenaventura was {{taking over the}} position {{at a time when}} the industry was in deep trouble, having accumulated a gargantuan portfolio of <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> that, in the face of the Asian financial crisis, threatened to collapse the entire financial system. Moreover, the industry was on the threshold of increasing globalization, and required radical shifts in regulatory policies in order to comply with global standards.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{political}} turmoil, Buenaventura doggedly persisted with {{his efforts to}} relieve the banking sector of its crippling burden of <b>bad</b> <b>loans.</b> Although the transition of power from Estrada to Arroyo interrupted congressional discussions on the issue, the talks eventually resumed, tracking the rescue plan outlined by the BSP and the Bankers Association of the Philippines. Finally, in 2003, congress passed the Special Purpose Vehicles Act, allowing banks to sell their bank loans at a discount and giving them regulatory incentives that {{made it easier to}} book the losses.|$|E

25|$|On October 24, 2012, American federal {{prosecutors}} filed a $1 billion civil lawsuit against Bank of America for mortgage fraud under the False Claims Act, which provides for possible penalties of triple the damages suffered. The government asserted that Countrywide, which {{was acquired by}} Bank of America, rubber-stamped mortgage loans to risky borrowers and forced taxpayers to guarantee billions of <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The suit was filed by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, the inspector general of FHFA and the special inspector for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In March 2014, Bank of America settled the suit by agreeing to pay $6.3 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and to buy back around $3.2 billion worth of mortgage bonds.|$|E
25|$|When {{the crisis}} loomed, {{one way to}} try to avert it was to simply start {{reducing}} the interest paid on discretionary and demand deposits. But such a move would have hurt the Medici name, and so it was undertaken too late. The bank's heavy leverage of their deposits meant that setbacks could be quite sudden. The fact that it {{seems to have been a}} common practice for Florentine banks to operate with as little as 5% of their deposits held in reserve lends further support to the idea that collapses could happen abruptly when <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> were discovered. In addition to all of that, Lorenzo the Magnificent was not at all concerned about the bank. Instead, he chose to concentrate his time and his family's resources on patronizing artists and pursuing his own poetic and political interests.|$|E
25|$|Outstanding debts became heavier, because {{prices and}} incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts {{remained}} at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday. Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers {{did not have time}} or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending. Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated.|$|E

40|$|Japan's {{financial}} system, {{and especially}} its banking system, today are in substantial trouble, epitomized by the <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> problems. This paper {{provides an overview}} of the major causes of the current banking mess. Fundamental forces include the transformation of the Japanese economy in the mid- 1970 s from one of excess investment demand to excess savings surplus, and with successful growth the development of a number of strong, increasingly companies. The paper briefly discusses four major causes that were particularly important: failure to create a prudential regulatory system as deregulation proceeded; the creation and then bursting of the stock and real estate market bubbles; globalization; and the high rate of financial innovation. A series of five major macroeconomic policy mistakes are identified as retarding the recovery of the economy, and indeed the late 1996 policy errors led to the 1987 - 98 recession. Japan's 1990 s poor economic performance has made the banking problems more severe and costly, as hopes were dashed that the economic recovery would reduce the <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> adjustment process...|$|R
25|$|BankAmerica {{experienced}} huge {{losses in}} 1986 and 1987 by {{the placement of}} a series of <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> in the Third World, particularly in Latin America. The company fired its CEO, Sam Armacost. Though Armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor, A.W. (Tom) Clausen, Clausen was appointed to replace Armacost. The losses resulted in a huge decline of BankAmerica stock, making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover. First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles (which had originated from banks once owned by BankAmerica), launched such a bid in the fall of 1986, although BankAmerica rebuffed it, mostly by selling operations. It sold its FinanceAmerica subsidiary to Chrysler and the brokerage firm Charles Schwab and Co. back to Mr. Schwab. It also sold Bank of America and Italy to Deutsche Bank. By the time of the 1987 stock market crash, BankAmerica's share price had fallen to $8, but by 1992 it had rebounded mightily {{to become one of the}} biggest gainers of that half-decade.|$|E
25|$|De Roover {{attributes}} {{the beginning of}} the bank's decline to Cosimo de' Medici. He spent the vast majority of his time wrapped up in politics, and when he was not preoccupied with the intricate plotting and other characteristics of Florentine politics, he was patronizing the many fine Renaissance scholars and artists who were present there, or engaged in composing his own renowned poetry. This left minimal time for the careful selection of branch managers and the maintenance of an alert watch against fraud within the bank, which was greatly needed. Most of the financial duties handed over to Francesco Sassetti, who had risen from being a mere factor in the Avignon branch to its general manager, and then a post in Geneva eventually to end up in 1458 in Florence proper at Cosimo's side. Sassetti was left to handle much of the business himself. In the end, it turned out badly. Whether simply due to bad luck, old age, increasing laziness, or diversion of his time to studying humanism like Cosimo, Sassetti failed to discover the fraud at the Lyons branch {{until it was too late}} for it to hope to remain solvent. The branch manager Lionetto de' Rossi had attempted to cover up his incompetence by being far too optimistic as to the number of <b>bad</b> <b>loans</b> the branch would have to cover, and by borrowing funds from other banks, thus artificially inflating his profits.|$|E

50|$|The Japanese {{recession}} in the 1990s had profound effects on the keiretsu. Many of the largest banks were hit hard by <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business.

30|$|Stable {{and vibrant}} balance sheets {{encourage}} banks to raise income through controlled loan growth. However, attitude towards more returns or profits makes easier credit more accessible {{for individuals and}} businesses, which usually transforms into future loan losses {{and a decrease in}} bank capital. Thus, <b>bad</b> <b>loan</b> growth decreases the solvency of banks. This result is consistent with previous findings that propose an indirect relationship between solvency and loan growth (Messai and Jouini 2013; Baradwaj et al. 2014).|$|R
