Much {{of the collection}} consists of family photographs, but also includes various identification, official and educational documentation as well as statements from employers, family correspondence, notes and an essay. Grace Polk Family Collection, AR 25104 Harry Polk (originally Hans Günther Pollak) was born on May 3, 1894 in Vienna, Austria. His parents were Hugo Pollak (1866 - 1935) and Thekla Pollak (née Lichtenstadt; 1871 - 1939). During World War I, Harry served in the Austrian Army and was held as a Prisoner of War in Siberia until 1921. After his release, {{he worked for the}} Ephrussi Bank in the Stocks and <b>Bonds</b> <b>Division.</b> In 1936, he married Elizabeth Sofer. The couple left Austria in 1938 for London and then for New York. While in the United States, Harry worked for the Waldes Company in Long Island City, a manufacturer of slide fasteners with branches in Vienna and Prague, until his retirement in 1964. He separated from his wife the same year and began to travel, finally settling in Austria. Harry Polk died in Vienna on August 24, 1983. Elizabeth Sofer was born in Vienna on March 23, 1902 to parents Julius Sofer (1871 - 1957) and Katharina Skalla Sofer (1864 - 1944). She worked for her father at the Waldes Koh-i-noor Company in Vienna. Elizabeth was a dancer and a member of several modern dance companies. Like her husband, she first worked for the Waldes branch in New York. In 1957, she began to work as a dance therapist at the Lexington School for the Deaf in New York City, and in 1958 co-founded the National Dance Teacher's Guild. From 1960 to 1982, she was a staff member at the Children's Center for Creative Arts at Adelphi University. She specialized in working with handicapped and emotionally disturbed children. In 1966, she co-founded the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA). In 1995, Elizabeth was honored with a lifetime achievement award from the ADTA and noted as a chief pioneer in the field of dance and movement therapy. She died on October 29, 2001 in New York. Julius Sofer (Elizabeth Polk's father) was a manufacturers' representative at the Waldes Koh-i-noor Company in Vienna. His connections to the American branch of the Waldes Company helped him to obtain affidavits and visas for the Polks and other members of their family. In 1938, Julius Sofer transferred to the export department of Waldes in Prague and then immigrated to Cuba in 1941. His wife Katharina Sofer stayed behind in Vienna and died there in 1944.

5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs.

He guided them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he should be given a chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second <b>Division.</b> <b>Bonds</b> was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|R
40|$|As {{symbolic}} interactionists {{have long}} argued, names classify objects andevents and convey meanings and distinctions. Names carry weight, whether light or heavy. Names provide ways of knowing—and being. Names construct and reify human <b>bonds</b> and social <b>divisions.</b> We attach value to some names and dismiss others. Much of sociology addresses relative power differentials between {{individuals or groups}} {{to make a name}} stick—or to resist the name with its attendant categorization, values, implicit or explicit direc-tives, and implications for subsequent life. Names, then, are rooted in actions and give rise to specific practices. In his provocative essay, Leon Anderson engages what the term and the practice, autoethnography, can and does mean. The name autoethnography and Anderson’s reexamination of it reminded me of Anselm Strauss’s (1969, 22) statement, “The naming of an object provides a directive for action. ” Categorization spawns expectations. In my view, Anderson offers a rap-prochement between contested definitions of social scientific work. He advocates a form of realist ethnography that has had and continues to hav...|$|R
