50|$|Bags {{cut from}} larger {{materials}} are usually saddle-stitched {{with an extra}} strip folded over the seam and stitched (for skin <b>bags)</b> or <b>glued</b> (for synthetic <b>bags)</b> to reduce leaks. Holes are then cut to accommodate the stocks. In the case of bags made from largely intact animal skins, the stocks are typically tied into the points where limbs and the head joined {{the body of the}} whole animal, a construction technique common in Central Europe.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the sprint flash mob, {{right before}} disappearing the {{participants}} left two toys and a <b>bag</b> with some <b>glued</b> on stickers against racism, xenophobia and the death penalty. The reason for this rapidity of the action as well as the poor format {{was the fact that the}} Minsk local authorities once again banned a peaceful LGBT campaign. The very action was timed to coincide with the European Week against Racism and Xenophobia, as well as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.|$|R
5000|$|The first track {{from the}} album, [...] "Bag of Glue", is a comedy song that {{previously}} appeared on their EP Horse Outside. It describes one of The Rubberbandits being seduced by [...] "a big fat bird" [...] {{and he needs}} to sniff <b>bags</b> of <b>glue</b> to feel okay with having sex with her. Sniffing glue is a habit typical of urban youth to achieve a short high. The second track, [...] "Pure Awkward", describes their interaction with several gangsta rappers such as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube, who attempts to have sex with them after they smoke crack.

40|$|Antimony {{trioxide}} {{is classified}} as a carcinogen by authorative sources. 1 - 4 The listings are based on experimental evidence that demonstrates induction of lung tumors in rats following inhalation of antimony trioxide. There are supportive human data which show an excess of mortality from lung cancer among antimony workers, but these data are not considered conclusive. 2, 3, 5 Exposure Antimony trioxide (ATO) is used as catalyst {{in the manufacture of}} polyester fabrics and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics and is used as a synergist to flame retardants in textiles, plastics, paints, adhesives and sealants. Antimony compounds are also used in the manufacture of pigments, paints, glass, pottery, and enamels. Antimony is common at low percentages in metal alloys. 6 The Danish Environmental Protection Agency (DEPA) detected antimony in their tests of many children’s products including perambulator covers, pencil cases, school <b>bags,</b> glitter <b>glue,</b> natural toys, mattress pads and fabric samples such as polyester clothing. 7 Antimony was found in a DEPA survey of jewelry that included children’s jewelry. ...|$|R
40|$|Subluxated {{cataracts}} {{secondary to}} blunt injury are {{a challenge to}} treat from the construction of rhexis to IOL insertion. For that reason, we designed a new glued endocapsular ring (ECR) / segment (ECS) for subluxated cataracts and IOLs for sutureless fibrin glue assisted trans-scleral fixation of the capsular <b>bag.</b> The <b>glued</b> ECR/segment stabilizes the capsular bag intra and post-operatively, allowing for sutureless fibrin glue assisted trans-scleral fixation. The segment gives vertical, horizontal and rotational stability as well as forniceal expansion. The advantages to this approach include easier implementation; faster surgery; easy adjustability; sturdier scleral fixation; fewer chances of segment drop into vitreous and lack of suture-related complications. Our hypothesis is that a glued versus sutured ECR/ECS will be more viable and stable on the sclera in the long term. Less pseudophakodonesis will also {{lead to a more}} stable capsule-bag complex and reduce the risk of posterior segment complications such as retinal detachment and cystoid macular edema. The nature of the device also makes its removal, if required, much more straightforward than the sutured rings/segments. This device can be used in patients with subluxated cataracts, colobomatous lens or subluxated IOLs. KEY WORD...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{over-identification}} means to publicly express those aspects which {{are well known}} but still taboo, or consciously disregarded. An effective way of subversion may consist in expressing positively the hidden aspects of the communication in a convincing way, better if it {{is close to the}} system dominant logic. This is a call to the background parts of the message not always seen but felt. Another example of over-identification exists in the work of street artist Banksy. In October 2003 he entered the landscape room at the Tate Britain, removed a framed painting from his <b>bag,</b> and <b>glued</b> it to the wall. Beside the work, a rural scene with an image of police tape stenciled over it, the artist placed a card reading: [...] "Banksy 1975. Crimewatch UK Has Ruined The Countryside For All Of Us. 2003. Oil On Canvas.". As mentioned prior, this installation ensures that the “felt message” is also the “seen message”. It is a reaction to a culturally dominating institution, Crimewatch UK. It was accomplished in a guerrilla-esque, under-the-radar manner, and it also amplifies a consensus of sentiments towards such institutions.|$|R
50|$|In an {{eye with}} total loss of bag {{where there is}} no capsular <b>bag</b> remnant, <b>glued</b> IOL {{scaffold}} is used. In this first a glued IOL is done behind the cataract pieces. The glued IOL then works as a scaffold and the cataract pieces are removed with the phaco handpiece using ultrasound. Here two partial thickness scleral flaps measuring 2.5 to 2.5 mm are made 180 degrees diagonally apart. Infusion is placed by anterior chamber maintainer and sclerotomies are made below the flaps with 20 gauge needle. The desired IOL is injected below the remaining lens particles in the eye and the remaining lens are positioned on the artificial lens or IOL(Fig 2). The haptics of the IOL are brought out under the flaps as in the glued IOL method and tucked into the scleral tunnel made with 26 gauge needle at the entry site. The phacoemulsification procedure is then continued on the IOL and the anterior chamber is formed {{by the end of the}} procedure. Scleral flaps and conjunctiva are then closed with fibrin glue.In IOL scaffold the IOL is placed above the iris (diaphragm of the eye) or above some remnant of the capsule whereas in glued IOL scaffold as there is not enough iris or capsule support a glued IOL is done which then acts as a scaffold.|$|R
50|$|Broodthaers later worked principally with {{assemblies}} of {{found objects}} and collage, often containing written texts. He incorporated written language in his art and used whatever {{was at hand}} for his raw materials—most notably the shells of eggs and mussels, but also furniture, clothing, garden tools, household gadgets and reproductions of artworks. In his Visual Tower (1966), Broodthaers made a seven-story circular tower of wood. He filled each story with uniform glass jars, and in every jar he placed an identical image taken from an illustrated magazine, of {{the eye of a}} beautiful young woman. For Surface de moules (avec sac) (Surface of mussels (with <b>bag))</b> (1966), he <b>glued</b> mussels in resin on a square panel; in 1974 the artist added a discreet metal hook to the centre of the work designed to support a shopping bag filled with mussel shells.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{previously}} {{developed a}} technique to study the effect of inhibitory innervation in the human oesophageal body, by creating an artificial high pressure zone (artificial HPZ) using an intra-oesophageal balloon. Swallowing provokes a fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ that precedes the peristaltic contraction. We aimed {{to prove that the}} swallow-induced fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ is due to relaxation of a segmental tonic contraction of the oesophageal wall at that level. METHODS: Studies were performed in five healthy subjects. Oesophageal pressures were measured at 5, 10 and 15 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter. A rubber balloon opposite the middle pressure sensor was used to induce the artificial HPZ. A barostat <b>bag</b> was <b>glued</b> to {{the opposite side of the}} balloon. The pressure in the barostat bag was pre-set at 8 mmHg below the pressure measured in the artificial HPZ. We studied deglutition-induced variations in the barostat bag volume after single and multiple swallows. RESULTS: Immediately after single swallows and during multiple swallows, we observed a fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ and a significant increase in the barostat bag volume (254 +/- 67 %) from 0. 99 (0. 37 - 1. 93) to 3. 74 (1. 91 - 4. 34) (P = 0. 005) denoting oesophageal wall relaxation. CONCLUSION: The swallow-induced fall in pressure in the artificial HPZ represents a real relaxation of a segmental tonic contraction of the oesophageal wall due to deglutitive inhibition. The oesophageal artificial HPZ is a simple method that can be used to study inhibitory phenomena in the body of the human oesophagus. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Sepsis with {{subsequent}} multisystem organ failure after translocation of bacteria from the gut {{is a serious}} risk associated with stress situations. We showed that intestinal bacterial translocation {{could be one of}} the pathways for pathogenic Streptococcus suis infections in the pig. In 24 piglets weighing 10 - 14 kg, free of the extracellular factor (EF+) producing phenotype of S. suis serotype 2, a silicon canula was placed in the proximal jejunum to enable intestinal inoculation and bypassing the upper alimentary tract. The pigs were individually housed. After stress induction in 18 pigs by means of a truck drive in individual cages for 1 h, pigs were inoculated through the intestinal canula either with S. suis type 2 EF+ or with growth medium only, and put back in their original housing. The six not transported pigs were also inoculated with the same strain. To prevent oral self-infection, faeces were collected in a <b>bag</b> that was <b>glued</b> around the anus. Clinical and behavioral symptoms were recorded for 72 h post inoculation, and then the animals were sacrificed for pathological and bacteriological examination. In three animals, the inoculation strain was re-isolated from mesenterial lymph nodes and typically affected organs. No S. suis type 2 EF+ was detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in any of the tonsil-swabs and -homogenates. We concluded that infection of the organs had taken place after bacterial translocation out of the gut and that the intestinal tract can be a porte d'entree for S. suis type 2 EF+.
