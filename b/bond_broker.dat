50|$|Brokers are the {{intermediate}} step between the underwriter {{and the actual}} bond holders, the cement-and-pavement financial professionals who answer orders for bond purchases. In most cases, underwriters will communicate and sell their maturities through multiple brokers. The broker seeks to distribute their bonds from the underwriter at a small percentage profit. Given the current legacy systems of the bond market, the distribution and sale of bonds is an exceptionally manual process requiring tremendous labor overhead and paperwork. As such, most municipal <b>bond</b> <b>brokers</b> only sell to high net worth individuals and organizations seeking to buy large quantities of bonds. Many of the people with direct ties to the impacted communities are therefore unable to contribute to their local governments, given little to no access to the profitable bond market.|$|R

50|$|In an 1910 review Hammond stated, that Professor Lough's book is {{the most}} comprehensive, the most {{scholarly}} and the best written treatise {{on the subject of}} corporation finance which has appeared in this country. Like the other volumes in the series of which it is a part, the book was written primarily in the interest of business men, although the author expresses the hope that it will also prove useful to stock and <b>bond</b> <b>brokers,</b> to lawyers, to bankers and to accountants. It is sure to do this but it is also bound to be of great use to teachers and students in the courses in business administration in our colleges and universities. It is more than probable that it was the author's experience with just such students which accounts in large measure for the clearness and logical method of his presentation.|$|R

50|$|In Schramm, the Courts {{opened the}} door for freight brokers to be held legally liable {{in the case of a}} {{trucking}} accident, involving a carrier whom they hired to carry freight, that resulted in injury to a person. Many guidelines, most under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's SAFER System, are available to freight brokers to screen potential carrier safety and, if it is proven that the broker did not utilize these government provided tools, liability can be transferred to or shared with them in the result of an injury accident. Another regulation that protects carriers and shippers is the freight <b>broker</b> <b>bond</b> - freight <b>brokers</b> must get <b>bonded</b> in order to operate legally. If a carrier file a claim, the bond would cover it.|$|R
