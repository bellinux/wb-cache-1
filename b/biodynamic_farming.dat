2500|$|Its {{title was}} {{inspired}} by a poem by John Keats, [...] "La Belle Dame sans Merci", which contained the lines [...] "The sedge is wither'd from the lake, And no birds sing." [...] "Silent Spring" [...] was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. [...] By August 1961, Carson agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: Silent Spring would be a metaphorical title for the entire booksuggesting a bleak future for the whole natural worldrather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong. [...] With Carson's approval, editor Paul Brooks at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, [...] "A Fable for Tomorrow", which was intended to provide a gentle introduction to a serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing and were planning to promote the book by sending the manuscript to select individuals for final suggestions. In Silent Spring, Carson relied on evidence from two New York state organic farmers, Marjorie Spock and Mary Richards, and that of <b>biodynamic</b> <b>farming</b> advocate Ehrenfried Pfeiffer in developing her case against DDT.|$|E

40|$|New figures {{released}} by Demeter-International reveal the steady global growth of biodynamic agriculture. Certified biodynamic hectares are up 2 % (from 144, 497 to 147, 495 hectares), biodynamic processors are up 5 % (from 456 to 478), and biodynamic distributors are up 3 % (from 185 to 190). The {{number of countries}} with Demeter-International certified biodynamic activity increased from 48 to 52. Croatia and Peru enter the list with newly reported <b>biodynamic</b> <b>farms,</b> and Bulgaria and Ukraine enter the list with new biodynamic distributors. There is considerable volatility in the statistics, with most countries reporting changes in the statistics for 2012 compared to the previous year. The three leading countries, based on biodynamic hectares, are Germany (with 66, 991 hectares, up 1 %), Italy (8, 688 ha., up 6 %), and France (8, 100 ha., up 8 %). Germany has the most <b>biodynamic</b> <b>farms</b> (1420), the most biodynamic processors (195), and the most biodynamic distributors (62). The largest percentage increases in biodynamic hectares were recorded by Spain (up 157 % to 2128 ha.), Ecuador (up 115 % to 236 ha.), and South Africa (up 96 % to 157 ha.). The total number of <b>biodynamic</b> <b>farms</b> decreased 16 % (from 5615 to 4733) with the biggest declines reported by Tunisia (down 23 % to 1, 560 farms) and India (down 19 % to 5, 882 <b>farms).</b> <b>Biodynamic</b> agriculture is based on Rudolf Steiner’s agricultural lectures which were delivered, in German, in the small village of Koberwitz (Kobierzyce, Poland) in 1924. Steiner indicated {{that this was an}} agriculture for all farmers. Demeter-International report the figures from all the <b>biodynamic</b> <b>farms</b> covered by their own certification. This underestimates the total world biodynamic activity since some countries, for example Australia, are not covered by Demeter-International certification, and some biodynamic farmers are certified ‘organic’ (rather than ‘biodynamic’) while some others are not certified at all...|$|R
50|$|The biodynamic {{certification}} Demeter, {{created in}} 1924, {{was the first}} certification and labelling system for organic production.
