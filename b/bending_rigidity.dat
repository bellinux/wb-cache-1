40|$|Introduction The {{statistics}} of directed walks constitute a fundamental statistical mechanics problem. This problem, {{apart from its}} theoretical interest, is of great practical importance in polymer physics {{as it can be}} used to describe the extension of a molecular chain under tension. For modest applied tensions, a polymer's elasticity is largely determined by entropic considerations. The statistical mechanical link thus connects the macroscopic force versus extension relation to the microscopic <b>bend</b> <b>rigidity</b> of the polymer. In this poster we investigate the statistical mechanics of a slightly more complicated system. The system consists of a chain that has a twist rigidity as well as a <b>bend</b> <b>rigidity.</b> This problem is also of some practical importance. Unlike many polymers, biopolymers such as actin and DNA are not free to rotate about the links between successive monomers. This allows them to resist any twist imposed upon them. If one end of such a chain is rotated about the a...|$|R

40|$|Fluctuation {{spectra of}} fluid {{compound}} membrane systems are calculated. The systems addressed contain two (or more) almost parallel membranes that are connected by harmonic tethers or by a continuous, harmonic confining potential. Additionally, such a compound {{system can be}} attached to a supporting substrate. We compare quasi-analytical results for tethers with analytical results for corresponding continuous models and investigate under what circumstances the discrete nature of the tethers actually influences the fluctuations. A tethered, supported membrane pair with similar <b>bending</b> <b>rigidities</b> and stiff tethers can possess a nonmonotonic fluctuation spectrum with a maximum. A nonmonotonic spectrum with a maximum and a minimum can occur for an either free or supported membrane pair of rather different <b>bending</b> <b>rigidities</b> and for stiff tethers. Typical membrane displacements are calculated for supported membrane pairs with discrete or continuous interacting potentials. Thereby an estimate of how close the constituent two membranes and the substrate typically approach each other is given.

40|$|Sandwich {{composites}} {{are generally}} used in marine applications, wind turbines, space and aircraft vehicles {{due to their}} high <b>bending</b> <b>rigidities</b> {{in addition to their}} lighter weights. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of divided foam core and interlayer sheet of glass fabric on the bending performances of sandwich composites which are manufactured with glass fabrics as the facesheets/interlayer sheets and PVC foam as the core material. Sandwich composites with single and divided core are manufactured and compared in terms of flexural behavious via three point bending tests. It is found that the bending performance is enhanced with the use of divided core and using divided core does not affect the behaviour of the sandwich composite against bending deformations. In the case of the plain core sandwich composite, dividing the core is advised for certain applications rather than perforating the core to increase the bending stiffness and strength of the textile reinforced sandwich composites because it is possible to purchase core with any thickness and there is no need for additional process such as perforation. The proposed application could enhance the bending performances without altering the weight and cost of the sandwich composites, which are preferred due to their higher <b>bending</b> <b>rigidities</b> in relation to their lighter weights. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of nanoparticle monolayers {{have been studied}} extensively.

The mechanics of the membranes are guided by strong interactions between ligand shells on adjacent particles. Upon fracture, the films crack perpendicular to the direction of strain at a fracture stress of 11 [...] 2.6 MPa, comparable to that of cross-linked polymer films. Free-standing nanoparticle membranes exhibit <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity</b> on the order of 10 eV, higher than what is predicted in theory for continuum plates of the same thickness, due to nonlocal microstructural constraints such as nonlocal coupling of particle rotational degrees of freedom.
