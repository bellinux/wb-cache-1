Scully informs him that Bianco and Melnick are with plastic surgeons, {{the boy is}} with social services, and no {{criminal}} charges will <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> against Karras since the electrical charge of the third rail destroyed the proof of the medusas in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> in a specific order. Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E

5|$|The {{seeds of}} {{radishes}} can <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> to extract radish seed oil. Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while {{not suitable for}} human consumption, this oil is a potential source of biofuel. The daikon grows well in cool climates and, apart from its industrial use, {{can be used as}} a cover crop, grown to increase soil fertility, to scavenge nutrients, suppress weeds, help alleviate soil compaction, and prevent winter erosion of the soil.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{expected}} to have another atomic bomb ready for use on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October. Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on 11 and 14 August. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> and coated, which would take until 16 August. It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his express authority. Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.|$|E
5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in {{a great variety of}} sounds. A combination action can be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) or general (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E
50|$|The vinyl was {{released}} in four versions as limited editions: 450 numbered copies <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> on black vinyl. 50 numbered copies <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> on black/white marbled vinyl for series subscribers. 100 'artist copies' <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> on black/white marbled vinyl. 6 copies were released in a wooden box with a test pressing along with both black and marbled vinyl.|$|R

5000|$|A related {{downshifting}} {{technique is}} called heel-and-toe, {{in which the}} brake and accelerator pedals <b>are</b> <b>pressed</b> simultaneously. Classically, the brake <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> with the ball of the right foot and the accelerator pedal {{is controlled by the}} right heel, while the clutch pedal <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> by the left foot. However, variants are possible, with the brake and accelerator pressed by sides of the right foot.|$|R
5|$|Over the Rainbow {{received}} poor reviews. Though praising Talbot's voice, critics noted a lack {{of depth}} in the performances, and questioned the appropriateness of releasing and rating work by such a young artist. The album peaked at number 35 on the UK Albums Chart. Despite its poor chart performance, additional copies of the album had to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> after sales were higher than expected. Talbot later toured Asia {{in support of the}} album; Over the Rainbow achieved more success on Asian charts, reaching number one in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. They can <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
5|$|Spedding {{recruited}} two chemistry {{professors at}} Ames for his group there, Harley Wilhelm and I. B. Johns. Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking for}} ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was produced {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. The Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E

5|$|The {{first phase}} of this work took place from 1539 until autumn 1540. The Moravian {{engineer}} Stefan von Haschenperg {{was responsible for the}} design of the fort, being paid the substantial salary of £75 a year for his work on this and other similar projects, including Calshot, Hurst, Sandgate and Sandown. Philip Chute, John Fletcher and William Oxenbridge, all prominent local men, served as the commissioners for the project, Oxenbridge becoming the pay master. Finding sufficient numbers of workmen was difficult and some had to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> into service unwillingly. More artillery pieces were sent to the castle ahead of the work being completed, and were probably installed in temporary battery positions around the castle site.|$|E
5|$|Two more Fat Man {{assemblies}} were readied, {{and scheduled}} to leave Kirtland Field for Tinian on August 11 and 14, and Tibbets was ordered by LeMay {{to return to}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, to collect them. At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast another plutonium core. Although cast, it still needed to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> and coated, which would take until August 16. Therefore, {{it could have been}} ready for use on August 19. Unable to reach Marshall, Groves ordered on his own authority on August 13 that the core should not be shipped.|$|E
5|$|Other {{finishing}} {{moves in}} the various Mortal Kombat games include Animalities (introduced in Mortal Kombat 3) turning a victor into an animal to violently finish off the opponent; Brutality (introduced in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) which is bashing an opponent into pieces with a long combo of hits; and Stage Fatalities/Death Traps (introduced in the original Mortal Kombat Pit Stage where the victor can uppercut their opponent off of the platform into a bed of spikes below, and later made more difficult in Mortal Kombat II by requiring specific and different button sequences to <b>be</b> <b>pressed)</b> utilizing parts of certain stages to execute a lethal finishing move (such as a pool of acid). Mortal Kombat: Deception added the Hara-Kiri, a self-Fatality allowing the losers {{to engage in a}} suicide-based finishing move (enabling a possible race between both players to see if the winning player can finish off the losing player before the losing character can kill himself or herself first).|$|E

5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E
5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course}} of a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

5|$|Throughout their career, the Grateful Dead {{were known}} to {{tolerate}} taping of the live shows. There was a demand from fans to hear the improvisations that resulted from each show, {{and the concept of}} taping shows appealed to the band's general community ethos. They were unique among bands in that their live shows tended not to <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> and packaged as LPs, but remained in tape form to be shared between tapers. The group were strongly opposed to commercial bootlegging and policed stores that sold them, while the saturation of tapes among fans suppressed any demand for product. In 1985, the Dead, after years of tolerance, officially endorsed live taping of their shows, and set up dedicated areas that they believed gave the best sound recording quality. Other bands, including Pearl Jam, Phish and the Dave Matthews Band tolerate taping in a similar manner to the Dead, provided no profit is involved. Because of the questionable legality of bootlegs, fans have sometimes simply dubbed a bootleg onto tape and freely passed it onto others.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated interfaces can then <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E
