40|$|Usually, {{development}} of automobile <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> power steering <b>hose</b> has been realized through investigating several actual prototype hoses experimentally. Recently, high durability for <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> has been required because periodic renewing the <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> {{has not been}} requested anymore. In this study, FEM stress analysis {{has been applied to}} the crimped portion of hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> in order to promote the {{development of}} the automobile hoses more efficiently. It is found that large normal stresses σ_n, which may be helpful for the sealing performance, appear at the crimped portion between the nipple and inner rubber. The results suggest that several grooves putting at the surface of nipple are effective for causing large σ_n, which may improve the sealing performance <b>and</b> <b>hose</b> life. The effect of compression set of the rubber on the sealing performance is investigated, and the life of hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> is estimated form the maximum stress appearing near the groove on the nipple...|$|R
50|$|The yard has eleven arrival tracks, two hump {{tracks and}} 40 {{classification}} tracks up to 920 m long. The freight wagons or sets of wagons are run {{over the hump}} and then retarded {{by a series of}} automatic retarders and finally pushed together for coupling. The wagons are then coupled together with their <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> <b>and</b> the <b>brakes</b> are tested by a remote-controlled brake test system. The entire marshalling operation is automatically controlled by a central electronic interlocking. Intervention by the signallers is only required if there is a fault.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} tubes {{were cut}} from a roll of rubber industrial tubing by his assistant, hence the natural curve of the tube. A curved metal adaptor was designed (Magill oral and nasal connectors) and a 4" [...] black rubber connecting hose to fit to the anesthetic circuit was adapted from an MG car <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> named the 'catheter mount' by Magill's theatre technician at Westminster Hospital. Originally, there was no inflatable cuff. The tube was packed {{either side of the}} sub-glottis by two green anaesthetic swabs, with ribbon gauze sewn on by hand to aid extraction at extubation of the endotracheal tube. Anaesthetic gel or ointment was used to lubricate the tube and provide some relief for the patient's sore throat post-procedure.|$|R
500|$|As {{part of the}} rebreather itself. The rebreather {{must have}} at least one source of fresh gas stored in a cylinder; many have two and some have more cylinders. Due to the lower gas {{consumption}} of rebreathers, these cylinders typically are smaller than those used for equivalent open-circuit dives. Rebreathers may use internal cylinders, or may also be supplied from [...] "off-board" [...] cylinders, which are not directly plumbed into the rebreather, but connected to it by a flexible <b>hose</b> <b>and</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>and</b> usually carried side slung.|$|R
50|$|Most {{automotive}} professionals {{agree that}} glycol-based brake fluid, (DOT 3, DOT 4, DOT 5.1) should be flushed, or changed, every 1-2 years under non-racing conditions. Many manufacturers also require periodic fluid changes to ensure reliability and safety. Once installed, moisture diffuses into the fluid through <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> <b>and</b> rubber seals and, eventually, the fluid {{will have to}} be replaced when the water content becomes too high. Electronic testers and test strips are commercially available to measure moisture content, however moisture test strips were taken off the market because they absorb moisture in the air before they can be used. The corrosion inhibitors also degrade over time. Degraded inhibitors cause corrosion in the braking system. The first metal to corrode is copper. You can determine when it is time to replace brake fluid when copper ions hit 200ppm. New fluid should always be stored in a sealed container to avoid moisture intrusion.|$|R

50|$|The {{accident}} investigation revealed: An engine replacement at the previous stop, Berlin-Grünau, {{in the middle}} of the night, required testing of the brakes. But several errors (lack of attention, misperception, deficient communication) by the driver and the assigned train preparation technician occurred. The first error, caused by the driver, was to not connect the main <b>brake's</b> <b>hoses</b> <b>and</b> to not open the respective valves after coupling the engine to the first wagon. Filling the brake system by the engine happened far too fast, without the driver noticing. The irresponsive, still activated brakes were misdiagnosed by the technician (who had to service three trains at the same time) to have a pressure higher than what the engine supplied. He did not report this to the driver, but reset the brakes by emptying their air reservoirs. The actual brake test never happened, but the driver later claimed to have received a positive confirmation. The technician, in turn, did not abort the departure of the train. As the result, the train left with all brakes dysfunctional, except the ones of the engine. This emerged as late as the train had to slow down before entering Elsterwerda station.|$|R

All trainlined electrical connections between the cars are made through six trainline jumper cables. Air connections between the cars are made through two air <b>hoses,</b> <b>brake</b> pipe <b>and</b> main reservoir.|$|R
50|$|Railroads have strict government-approved {{air brake}} testing {{procedures}} for various circumstances when assembling trains or switching out cars en route. After a cut is made between cars in a train {{and the train}} is rejoined, {{in addition to other}} tests, the crew must verify that the brakes apply and release on the rear car (to ensure that all of the <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> are connected <b>and</b> the angle cocks, or valves, are opened). In most cases, the engineer is able to use information from the ETD to verify that the air pressure reduces and increases {{at the rear of the}} train accordingly, indicating that proper brake pipe continuity. This device is said to constitute a fail-safe condition.|$|R
5000|$|Powerline's {{variant of}} the T Class was an entirely new model - the first for the then-new {{management}} of the company, with no parts recycled from previous models. A new mechanism was developed in India {{to make use of}} the 5 pole skew wound, twin flywheel system, and as has since become standard, the unit was fitted with all-wheel drive and all-wheel electrical pickup. RP-25 110 wheels were made standard. The units were also fitted with DCC decoders and NEM [...] "dunny seat" [...] couplers as standard, although Kadee metal couplers are included in every box. Each unit was also fitted with separately-applied detail parts like handrails, <b>brake</b> <b>hoses</b> <b>and</b> grilles, giving a much higher level of detail than previous models. The first run was to include initial releases of the VR and V/Line liveries on both body types, and high nose West Coast Railway and low nose Freight Australia schemes. An offer was made to customers, that if they paid $50 upfront, they would receive their model(s) for $198.00. As of 2015, the recommended retail price $295.00. The engines were due to be released in 2004, but production line delays caused the announcement to be pushed back to October 2004, and the final release to early 2007. Because of the parallel development and release schedules between Austrains and Powerline, the company adopted the marketing slogan, [...] "DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER T CLASS UNTIL YOU SEE OUR T CLASS". The final product is slightly smaller in all dimensions than the Austrains units, and Powerline has claimed that all dimensions bar some valence and handrail measurements are within 0.5mm. To cover for variants, some engines were released with decals to alter pilot stripes. Valence units were also released separately, to allow purchasers to modify or replace those provided.|$|R

Brake components used is the footbrake, <b>brake</b> master, <b>brake</b> <b>hoses,</b> discs, calipers, <b>and</b> <b>brake</b> fluid. Tests were conducted to check your brake force magnitude that occurred on disc brakes for electric car with an analysis of the components of the calculation of the footbrake to the brake load 4 kg, 6 kg, 8 kg, 10 kg, 12 kg which converts the motion of the brake pedal into hydraulic pressure. From result analysis obtained shows that the greater the load brake master the style press brake, brake oil pressure, brake pad pressing force, and the friction braking will be greater, the greater the force while charging the brake pedal a little further is obtained...|$|R

50|$|The ER5 has a {{twin piston}} front disk brake and a rear drum brake. Unlike many modern motorcycles, with fixed caliper and {{floating}} disk, the ER5 has a fixed disk and floating caliper. 'A' models have a trailing piston which {{is smaller than}} the leading piston but the later 'C' models have identical leading and trailing pistons, dramatically improving front braking. 'A' model owners often fit caliper units from 'C' models. As for most motorcycles, another common braking upgrade is to reduce sponginess by replacing the OEM <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> with a braided <b>brake</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|R

40|$|Testing {{facilities}} {{such as the}} TU Delft Vehicle Test Lab (VTL) {{are needed}} to provide necessary experimental data to validate and to compare the performance of several ABS controllers like the Feed-Forward Braking controller. Before testing ABS controllers with the VTL measurement system, {{it needs to be}} improved first. Earlier measurements reported in [11] showed a lack of developed braking torque due to decreased bandwidth of the measurement setup. This problem could be within the hydraulic brake line of the VTL measurement setup. Pressure dynamics results of the original situation show a significant decrease when increasing the actuating frequency. Differences in pressure dynamics are examined by replacing the original <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> with a stainless steel braided <b>brake</b> <b>hose.</b> Sinus wave excitation measurements show a relative small increase of the maximal reaching brake pressure with the design improvements situation. Random noise excitation measurements show increased bandwidth, compared to the frequency results reported in [4] and [11]. Improvements in brake pressure dynamics are realized by using a stainless steel braided <b>brake</b> <b>hose</b> in addition with relative low varying amplitudes.
