40|$|The {{collimator}} absorber {{array of}} the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) project {{is responsible for}} stopping the 1. 0 GeV protons {{that are in the}} halo of the beam. It is estimated that 0. 1 % of the 2 MW beam will be intercepted by the adopted collimating scheme implemented at various sections of the beam transport and accumulation. This paper summarizes the conceptual design of the collimator absorber as well as the supporting detailed analysis that were performed and guided the design process. Key requirement in the design process is the need for the collimator beam tube to minimize beam impedance while closely following its beta function. Due to lack of available experimental data, the long-term behavior of irradiated materials in an environment where they interface with coolant flow becomes an issue. Uncertainties in the long-term behavior prompted a special double-wall design that will enable not only <b>beam</b> halo <b>interception</b> but also the efficient transfer of deposited energy both under normal and off-normal conditions to the coolant flow. The thermo-mechanical response of the double wall beam tube and of a particle bed surrounding it are discussed in detail in the paper. 1...|$|R
40|$|A beam {{position}} monitor (BPM) for {{a storage}} or damping ring {{may be subject}} to heating problems due to the parasitic mode (PM) losses, <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> and synchrotron radiation interception. In addition, high PM losses can cause beam instabilities under some conditions. Recessing and/or msskiig the BPM may increase the PM losses in the process of solving the latter two problems. This paper presents three complemen-tary methods for estimating the PM losses and for improving the design of a stripline directional coupler type of BPM: bench measurements, computer modeling (TBCI) and an equivalent circuit representation. These methods lead to a decrease in PM losses without significant reduction in output signal for the north SLC damping ring BPMs...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of airborne LiDAR technology to quantify forest structure within eucalypt forests has been evaluated {{with a focus}} on the understorey stratum. To achieve this, three studies have been undertaken using multiple (4) LiDAR datasets acquired over three test areas located in Wedding Bells State Forest, Coffs Harbour, Australia. Initially, the effects of sensor configuration were evaluated using field measurements collected from three structurally and topographically differing field plots (40 x 90 m areas). Results indicated that canopy height profiles derived from LiDAR data at the plot scale were largely unaffected by a change in platform altitude from 1000 to 3000 m (p > 0. 05). In addition, the derivation of individual tree attributes was found to be highly sensitive to the density of LiDAR observations whilst higher platform altitudes showed an increased proportion of single returns over forested areas. In the second study, an innovative field based approach was developed to sample the structure of the understorey (horizontally and vertically) for LiDAR validation purposes. Using two separate LiDAR datasets, this research confirmed that mean understorey height and understorey cover can be effectively mapped in areas of low to medium canopy cover whilst no significant relationship (p > 0. 05) was identified between field and LiDAR estimates of maximum understorey height. In the third study, an optimised LiDAR <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> model was developed and validated, and then applied to assess the interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic factors of the LiDAR survey. This demonstrated that the probability of <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> through the forest canopy can be affected by factors both intrinsic (e. g. crown cover) and extrinsic (e. g. scan angle) to the structure of the canopy. Overall, the results of this research indicate that optimising the sensor configuration is important to the derivation of particular forest structural attributes and significantly, there is potential for LiDAR technology to provide quantitative and spatially detailed estimates of key understorey attributes such as mean height and cover...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-Ahigh-power X-band {{klystron}} {{employing a}} double-gap output cavity {{has been operating}} at SLAC. Multigap output circuits have lower surface gradients at the interaction gaps than single-gap ones but are prone to self-oscillate due to negative beam loading and trapped higher-order modes. In the double-gap circuit design, considerable attention had been directed {{to deal with these}} stability problems. The performance. of the present tube appears to be limited by gap breakdown and <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> particularly at long pulses. A three-gap output cavity is currently under development to further reduce the gap surface gradient. Another new feature of the circuit is an enlarged downstream drift tube to improve on beam clearance.

Cold test interaction structure scale models were investigated and analyses were undertaken {{to predict the}} electrical and thermal response of the hypothetical 200 W TWT at 42 GHz and 21 kV beam voltage. An intentionally narrow instantaneous bandwidth (1 %, {{with the possibility of}} electronic tuning of the center frequency over several percent) was sought with a highly dispersive, high impedance "forward wave' interaction structure based on a ladder (for economy in fabrication) and nonspace harmonic interaction, for a high gain rate and a short, economically focused tube. The "TunneLadder' interaction structure devised combines ladder properties with accommodation for a pencil beam. Except for the impedance and bandwidth, there is much in common with the millimeter wave helix TWTs which provided the ideal of diamond support rods. The benefits of these are enhanced in the TunneLadder case because of spatial separation of <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> and RF current heating...|$|E

40|$|Integral part of {{the primary}} {{collimator}} of the SNS accumulator ring is a halo intercept assembly {{in the form of}} movable scraper blades that allow interception of the halo protons in four planes. In order to achieve large coulomb scattering of the halo protons and energy losses of less than 1 %, platinum was chosen as the material of choice while its thickness was optimized to satisfy the energy loss requirements. This paper outlines the adopted design of the scraper assembly and presents the thermal response of the system that intercepts the beam halo as well as the subsequent thermal stress analysis and the issues associated with the performance of the scraper. Specifically, the current design incorporates a highly conducting material (copper) in the blade structure interfacing with the platinum scraper and is responsible for conducting the deposited energy away from the <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> region. The mechanical performance and durability of such system, especially of the special bonding between the dissimilar materials, is the primary focus of this effort. ...|$|E
40|$|Computer {{designed}} axisymmetric 2. 4 -cm-diameter three-, four-, and five-stage depressed collectors {{were evaluated}} {{in conjunction with}} an octave bandwidth, high-perveance, and high-electronic-efficiency, griddled-gun traveling wave tube (TWT).

Relatively high collector efficiencies were obtained, leading to a very substantial improvement in the overall TWT efficiency.

40|$|An axisymmetric, multistage, {{depressed}} {{collector of}} fixed geometric design was evaluated {{in conjunction with}} an octave bandwidth, dual mode traveling wave tube (TWT). The TWT was operated {{over a wide range}} of conditions to simulate different applications. The collector performance was optimized (within the constraint of fixed geometric design) over the range of TWT operating conditions covered. For operation of the TWT in the linear, low distortion range, 90 percent and greater collector efficiencies were obtained leading to TWT overall efficiencies of 20 to 35 percent, as compared with 2 to 5 percent with an undepressed collector. With collectors of this efficiency and minimized <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> losses, it becomes practical to design dual mode TWT's such that the low mode can represent operation well below saturation. Consequently, the required pulse up in beam current can be reduced or eliminated, and this mitigates beam control and dual mode TWT circuit design problems. For operation of the dual mode TWT at saturation, average collector efficiencies in excess of 85 percent were obtained for both the low and high modes across an octave bandwidth, leading to a three to fourfold increase in the TWT overall efficiency...|$|E
40|$|A high {{precision}} emittance measurement requires precise beam {{position at the}} measurement location. At present there is no existing technique, commercial or otherwise, for non-destructive pulse-to-pulse simultaneous beam position and emittance measurement. FARTECH, Inc. is currently developing a {{high precision}} cavity-based beam monitor for simultaneous beam position and emittance measurements pulse-to-pulse, without <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> and without moving parts. The design and analysis of a multi-cavity standing wave structure for a pulse-to-pulse emittance measurement {{system in which the}} quadrupole and the dipole standing wave modes resonate at harmonics of the beam operating frequency is presented. Considering the Next Linear Collider beams, an optimized 9 -cavity standing wave system is designed for simultaneous high precision beam position and emittance measurements. It operates with the {pi}-quadrupole mode resonating at 16 th harmonic of the NLC bunch frequency, and the 3 {pi}/ 4 dipole mode at 12 th harmonic (8. 568 GHz). The 9 -cavity system design indicates that the two dipoles resonate almost at the same frequency 8. 583 GHz and the quadrupole at 11. 427 GHz according to the scattering parameter calculations. The design can be trivially scaled so that the dipole frequency is at 8. 568 GHz, and the quadrupole frequency can then be tuned during fabrication to achieve the desired 11. 424 GHz. The output powers from these modes are estimated for the NLC beams. An estimated rms-beam size resolution is sub micro-meters and beam positions in sub nano-meters...|$|E
40|$|For Neutral Beam Injection at JET an {{ion source}} is {{required}} {{with a high}} monatomic species yield. It {{is now clear that}} the magnetic filter field arrangement used to enhance the monatomic species yield also produces non-uniformity in the ion source plasma density. This property was known from Langmuir probe array measurements taken during development of the ion source. Further experimental evidence is derived from the analysis of detailed spectroscopic and calonmetnc measurements of extracted beams on the Neutral Beam Test Bed Nonumformity of the ion source density results in reduced transmission of the extracted beam, with greater interception on beamline scraper elements. The maximum power injected to the JET plasma from the Octant 4 Neutral Beam Injector is often limited by excessive <b>beam</b> <b>interception</b> on beamline scraper elements and not by the limits of the electrical power supplies. A development programme was initiated to develop an ion source configuration to produce improved uniformity, without degrading the monatomic species yield. This was approached in two ways - 1 Development of a Monte-Carlo model of the ion source. 2 An expenmental programme of source modification on the Neutral Beam Test Bed. The Monte-Carlo model was used to design and predict the performance of a new filter field arrangement. It was anticipated that the new source configuration would give improved ion uniformity without significant degradation of the monatomic species yield When operated on the Test-Bed this ion source design showed a factor of 2 improvement in ion density uniformity, with the required monatomic species fraction for JET NBI Beams extracted from the new ion source have demonstrated improved beam transmission on the Test-Bed and a 33 % reduction of beamline scraper power load on the Octant 4 NB Injector.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental results}} of a megawatt power level, 140 GHz coaxial gyrotron oscillator. The coaxial gyrotron {{has the potential to}} transport very high power electron beams and thus achieve higher microwave output power levels than conventional gyrotrons. A TE 2, 3 coaxial gyrotron was designed to operate at 95 kV, 76 A. This tube was tested to high power with the first high power Inverted Magnetron Injection Gun (IMIG). The IMIG electron gun was tested to 10 MW (105 kV, 93 A), which is the highest power level for a non-relativistic gyrotron gun. Operation of the coaxial gyrotron oscillator yielded power levels of greater than 1 MW in two different configurations: with the coaxial conductor (at 92 kV, 70 A, and 16 % efficiency) and without the coaxial conductor (85 kV, 65 A, and 18 % efficiency). We also successfully operated this tube in three configurations (empty cavity, radial output, and axial output) with no <b>beam</b> <b>interception.</b> We observed regimes of dominant single mode and multi-mode operation. We also identified electron beam asymmetries and tube alignment as two major issues, which can limit the performance of a coaxial gyrotron. An unexpected source of magnetic field error was found in the magnetization of the stainless steel parts. All these results have led to techniques for improving not only coaxial gyrotrons but also other gyrotron tubes. (cont.) We also investigated a ferroelectric cathode, which has the potential to achieve higher currents than thermionic cathodes in a simpler, low cost gun. We report the first results on a ferroelectric cathode gun in a magnetron injection gun configuration suitable for use in a gyrotron. It had an annular emitter shape with a diameter of 11. 4 cm and a width of 0. 25 cm and operated at currents of up to 10 A (1. 1 A/cm 2) at 8 kV, in 5 Vs flat-top pulses. This result (along with the kiloampere beam obtained at Integrated Applied Physics) demonstrate the scalability of ferroelectric cathodes to large diameter electron beams. Also, the first ever microwaves from a ferroelectric cathode were generated in a collaboration experiment at Tel Aviv University. Finally, we developed a theory to explain the emission process from ferroelectric cathodes. The experiments reported have shown the suitability of ferroelectric cathodes for future microwave generation experiments. by Rahul N. Advani. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The Terahertz (THz) {{region of}} the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum (about 300 - 3000 GHz in frequency or about 0. 1 - 1 mm free space wavelength) has enormous potential for high-data-rate communications, spectroscopy, astronomy, space research, medicine, biology, surveillance, remote sensing, industrial process control, etc. It has been characterized as the most scientifically rich, yet under-utilized, {{region of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. The most critical roadblock to full exploitation of the THz band is lack of coherent radiation sources that are powerful (0. 001 - 1. 0 W continuous wave), efficient (> 1 %), frequency agile (instantaneously tunable over 1 % bandwidths or more), reliable, and comparatively inexpensive. To develop vacuum electron device (VED) radiation sources satisfying these requirements, fabrication and packaging approaches must be heavily considered to minimize costs, in addition to the basic interaction physics and circuit design. To minimize size of the prime power supply, beam voltage must be minimized, preferably 10 kV. Solid state sources satisfy the low voltage requirement, but are many orders of magnitude below power, efficiency, and bandwidth requirements. On the other hand, typical fast-wave VED sources in this regime (e. g., gyrotrons, FELs) tend to be large, expensive, high voltage and very high power devices unsuitable for most of the applications cited above. VEDs based on grating or inter-digital (ID) circuits have been researched and developed. However, achieving forward-wave amplifier operation with instantaneous fractional bandwidths > 1 % is problematic for these devices with low-energy (< 15 kV) electron beams. Moreover, the interaction impedance is quite low unless the beam-circuit spacing is kept particularly narrow, often leading to significant <b>beam</b> <b>interception.</b> One solution to satisfy the THz source requirements mentioned above is to develop micromachined VEDs, or "micro-VEDs". Among other benefits, micro-machining technologies provide superior high frequency wall conductivity as a result of superior surface smoothness compared with conventional mechanical or electric discharge machining approaches. Micro-VED technologies are already being applied to the development of millimeter-wave klystrons at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and submillimeter-wave klystrons at the University of Leeds. We are investigating the use of micro-machining technologies to develop THz regime TWTs, with emphasis on folded-waveguide TWTs. The folded-waveguide TWT (FW-TWT) has several features that make it attractive for THz-regime micro-VED applications. It is a relatively simple circuit to design and fabricate, it is amenable to precision pattern replication by micro-machining, and it is has been demonstrated capable of forward-wave amplification with appreciable bandwidth. We are conducting experimental and computational studies of micro-VED FW-TWTs to examine their feasibility for applications at frequencies from 200 - 1000 GHz...|$|E
