40|$|B {{chromosomes}} are genome symbionts, {{the presence}} of which in many eukaryote species is explained, in most cases, by their violation of Mendelian rules, usually based on meiotic or mitotic instability, leading to their accumulation in the germ line (drive). However, <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> integration into the genome as a regular member of the chromosome set should imply the loss of drive. A possible way of bypassing this di¤culty is to regularize meiosis when the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> is frequent in the population, in order to yield gametes with one <b>B</b> <b>chromosome.</b> In diploid organisms, this task needs to be achieved in the two sexes, but in haplodiploids the problem simpli¢es to only the diploid sex. We have found, to the authors' knowledge, the ¢rst evidence of a <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> that is regularizing its meiotic behaviour and limiting its number to one <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> per haploid genome, the same dosage as the standard (A) chromosomes, in the solitary wasp Trypoxylon albitarse.

40|$|About 10 – 15 % of {{the males}} and females of the {{grasshopper}} Melanoplus femur-rubrum collected near Rochester, New York, possessed a supernumerary <b>B</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The frequency of the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> remained fairly constant during the years 1971 – 1974.

This study was designed to determine the forces preventing the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> from increasing in frequency due to the high rate of transmission by the females. Eighty inseminated females collected in the wild were analyzed cytologically together with their embryos (10 – 20 per female). Ten of the 80 females had a <b>B</b> <b>chromosome,</b> and they transmitted it {{at a rate of about}} 0. 75.

For this reason, fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) is a useful tool for ascertaining the origin of these genomic elements, especially when combined with painting from microdissected B chromosomes. In order to investigate the origin of B chromosomes in the fish species Astyanax paranae, these two approaches were used along with PCR amplification of specific DNA sequences obtained from the B chromosomes and its comparison with those residing in the A chromosomes. Remarkably, chromosome painting with the one-arm metacentric <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> probe showed hybridization signals on entire <b>B</b> <b>chromosome,</b> while FISH mapping revealed the presence of H 1 histone and 18 S rDNA genes symmetrically placed in both arms of the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome.</b> These results support the hypothesis that the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> of A. paranae is an isochromosome.

Two types of rye B chromosomes {{that had been}} introduced into common wheat were dissected into separate segments by the gametocidal system to produce a number of rearranged B chromosomes, such as telosomes, terminal deletions and translocations with wheat chromosomes. A total of 13 dissected B chromosomes were isolated in common wheat, and were investigated for their nondisjunction properties. Rearranged B chromosomes, separated from their B-specific repetitive sequences on the distal part of the long arm, did not undergo nondisjunction, and neither did a translocated wheat chromosome carrying a long-arm distal segment containing the B-specific repetitive sequences. However, such rearranged B chromosomes, missing their B-specific sequences could undergo nondisjunction when they coexisted with the standard <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> or a wheat chromosome carrying the B-specific sequences. Deficiencies of the short arm did not completely abolish the nondisjunction properties of the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome,</b> but did reduce the frequency of nondisjunction.

40|$|Supernumerary or B {{chromosomes}} are selfish {{entities that}} maintain themselves in populations by accumulation mechanisms. The accumulation {{mechanism of the}} <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> of maize (Zea mays) involves nondisjunction at the second pollen mitosis, placing two copies of the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> {{into one of the}} two sperm. The <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> long arm must be present in the same nucleus for the centromere to undergo nondisjunction. A centromere, containing all of the normal DNA elements, translocated from the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> to the short arm of chromosome 9 was recently found to be epigenetically silenced for centromeric function. When intact B chromosomes were added to this genotype, thus supplying the long arm, the inactive centromere regained the property of nondisjunction causing the translocation chromosome 9 to be differentially distributed to the two sperm or resulted in chromosome breaks in 9 S, occasionally producing new translocations. Translocation of the inactive B centromere to chromosome 7 transferred the nondisjunction property to this chromosome. The results provide insight into the molecular and evolutionary basis of this <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> accumulation mechanism by demonstrating that nondisjunction is caused by a process that does not depend on normal centromere function but that the region of the chromosome required for nondisjunction resides in the centromeric region...|$|E

Twenty colonies were selected and divided into three groups: 1) colonies in which no individual possessed B chromosomes; 2) colonies in which some, but not all, individuals possessed <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and, 3) colonies in which all the individuals possessed <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The DNA from 8 individuals of each colony was analyzed using the PCR-RAPD technique. The heterozygosity values estimated were 0. 168, 0. 159 and 0. 16643 for the three groups, respectively. The molecular analysis of variance showed that 94. 16 % of the genetic variability was due to differences within the groups, while only 5. 84 % was distributed among the groups. These data and the graphic dispersion analysis performed suggest that the <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> have no significant effect on P. helleri genetic variability...|$|R
40|$|Accessory, supernumerary, or—most simply—B chromosomes, {{are found}} in many {{eukaryotic}} karyotypes. These small chromosomes do not follow the usual pattern of segregation, but rather are transmitted in a higher than expected frequency. As increasingly being demonstrated by next-generation sequencing (NGS), their structure comprises fragments of standard (A) chromosomes, although in some plant species, their sequence also includes contributions from organellar genomes. Transcriptomic analyses of various animal and plant species have revealed that, contrary to {{what used to be}} the common belief, some of the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> DNA is protein-encoding. This review summarizes the progress in understanding <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> biology enabled by the application of next-generation sequencing technology and state-of-the-art bioinformatics. In particular, a contrast is drawn between a direct sequencing approach and a strategy based on a comparative genomics as alternative routes that can be taken towards the identification of <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> sequences...|$|E
40|$|B {{chromosomes}} {{occur in}} approximately 15 % of eukaryotes {{and are usually}} heterochromatic and rich in repetitive DNAs. Here we describe characteristics of a <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> in the grasshopper Eumastusia koebelei koebelei (Rehn, 1909) through classical cytogenetic methods and mapping of some repetitive DNAs, including multigene families, telomeric repeats and a DNA fraction enriched with repetitive DNAs obtained from DOP-PCR. Eumastusia k. koebelei presented 2 n= 23, X 0 and, in one individual, two copies of the same variant of a <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> were noticed, which are associated during meiosis. The C-positive blocks were located in the pericentromeric regions of the standard complement and along {{the entire length of}} the B chromosomes. Some G+C-rich heterochromatic blocks were noticed, including conspicuous blocks in the B chromosomes. The mapping of 18 S rDNA and U 2 snDNA revealed only autosomal clusters, and the telomeric probe hybridized in terminal regions. Finally, the DOP-PCR probe obtained from an individual without a <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> revealed signals in the heterochromatic regions, including {{the entire length of the}} <b>B</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The possible intraspecific origin of the B chromosomes, due to the shared pool of repetitive DNAs between the A and B chromosomes and the possible consequences of their association are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Isolation of {{sequences}} {{from the}} maize <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> is always hampered by its high homology with the normal complements (A chromosomes). In this study, this hindrance {{was overcome by}} cloning sequences through microdissection of the pachytene <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> on a microscopic slide. Nineteen sequences were obtained and found to hybridize with genomic DNA in a B-dosage-dependent manner and with the pachytene <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), corroborating with their B origin. All but one sequences are repetitive and homologous to the A chromosome(s). Sequence comparison revealed that 12 sequences have homology with the knob repeat and flanking regions of several maize genes. Six have no homology to any documented sequence. The remaining one, pBPC 51, is B specific and was mapped to the central portion of distal heterochromatic region in the B long arm by seven B- 10 L translocations and FISH analysis. To gain insights into the molecular structure of the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome,</b> pBPC 51 was used to isolate large B fragments from a genomic library carrying 16 B's. Five clones (> 10 kb each) were isolated, and all were repetitive, sharing homology with A chromosomes in Southern and FISH analyses. Two of them were further characterized and sequenced. Each is composed of a number of restriction fragments with different levels of repetitiveness. Some of these are B specific and others share various degrees of homology with the A chromosomes. Their sequences (about 26 kb) show no homology with any published gene other than sequences of transposable elements (retrotransposons and MITEs) and the B as well as A centromeres. A 1. 6 kb B-specific repeat (CL-repeat) that mostly arrange in tandem array on the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> was identified in the two clones. Moreover, results of sequence analysis suggested that transposable elements play important roles in the <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> evolution. 玉米B染色體與正常染色體(A染色體) 之間的高度同源性，是選殖該染色體DNA的最大難題。該困難已在本論文中利用microdissection技術克服，以此技術直接取得粗絲期B染色體，再以PCR增幅並選殖B染色體DNA片段。所得到的DNA片段可藉由B染色體劑量反應分析(B-dosage response) 及螢光原位雜交技術證實其來源是B染色體。以此方式總共獲得 19 個B染色體DNA序列，它們都是重複性序列，而且都與A染色體具有同源性(只有一個例外) 。DNA序列比對顯示，其中 12 個序列與玉米染色體節重複序列(knob repeat) 及一些基因的附近區域具有相似度；而其他 6 個則與目前已發表的序列都不具有相似度。最後一個(pBPC 51) 是B染色體專一的序列，利用七個B- 10 L易位染色體及螢光原位雜交分析，將此序列定位在B染色體長臂的遠端異染色質區。 爲了能進一步了解B染色體的分子結構，利用pBPC 51 從帶 16 個B染色體的染色體組基因庫中，篩選大片段的B染色體DNA序列。總共獲得 5 個菌株，每一個菌株都帶有大於 10 kb的插入DNA，根據南方氏雜交分析和螢光原位雜交(FISH) 分析，這些插入DNA都是與A染色體具有同源性的重複性序列。接著，對其中 2 個菌株做進一步的分析及定序，將它們分成數個限制酵素切割片段後，發現每一片段具有程度不一的重複性；有些片段是B染色體專一，而其他片段則與A染色體具有不同程度的同源性。DNA序列比對顯示，這 2 個序列(約 26 kb) 除了與轉位子(transposable element) 、B染色體及A染色體中節序列具有相似度外，與目前已發表的基因都沒有相似。當中也發現一種B染色體專一的重複性序列(重複單位為 1. 6 kb) ，稱之為CL-repeat，此序列大都是以銜接排列(tandem arrange) 的方式存在於B染色體上。此外，DNA序列分析的結果顯示轉位子在B染色體的演化過程中，扮演著相當重要的角色。中文摘要……………………………………………………………………… 1 Abstract……………………………………………………………………… 2 Chapter One Literature review………………………………………… 3 Chapter Two Cloning and characterization of maize <b>B</b> <b>chromosome</b> sequences derived from microdissection…………………………… 26 Chapter Three Molecular organization of large fragments in maize B chromosome: indication of a novel repeat………………… 62 Chapter Four Conclusion……………………………………………… 10...|$|E

(2004). <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{are more}} {{frequent}} in mammals with acrocentric karyotypes: {{support for the}} theory of centromeric drive. ? Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences, 271, (Supplement 3), S 22 -S 24. Sponsorship: Megerle family and the Biosocial Research FoundationThe chromosomes of mammals tend to be either mostly acrocentric (having one long arm) or mostly bi?armed, with few species having intermediate karyotypes. The theory of centromeric drive suggests that this observation reflects a bias during female meiosis, favouring either more centromeres or fewer, and that the direction of this bias changes frequently over evolutionary time. <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are selfish genetic elements found in some individuals within some species. <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are often harmful, but persist because they drive (i. e. they are transmitted more frequently than expected). We predicted that species with mainly acrocentric chromosomes {{would be more likely}} to harbour <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> than those with mainly bi?armed chromosomes, because female meiosis would favour more centromeres over fewer in species with one?armed chromosomes. Our results show that <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are indeed more common in species with acrocentric chromosomes, across all mammals, among rodents, among non?rodents and in a test of independent taxonomic contrasts. These results provide independent evidence supporting the theory of centromeric drive and also help to explain the distribution of selfish DNA across species. In addition, we demonstrate an association between the shape of the <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and the shape of the typical (?A?) chromosomes. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Transcription of a protein-coding gene on <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of the Siberian {{roe deer}} (Capreolus pygargus). BMC Biology, 11 (1), [90]. Background Most {{eukaryotic}} species represent stable karyotypes {{with a particular}} diploid number. <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are additional to standard karyotypes and may vary in size, number and morphology even between cells of the same individual. For many years it was generally believed that <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> found in some plant, animal and fungi species lacked active genes. Recently, molecular cytogenetic studies showed the presence of additional copies of protein-coding genes on <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> However, the transcriptional activity of these genes remained elusive. We studied karyotypes of the Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) that possess up to 14 <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to investigate the presence and expression of genes on supernumerary chromosomes. Results Here, we describe a 2 Mbp region homologous to cattle chromosome 3 and containing TNNI 3 K (partial), FPGT, LRRIQ 3 and a large gene-sparse segment on <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of the Siberian roe deer. The presence of the copy of the autosomal region was demonstrated by B-specific cDNA analysis, PCR assisted mapping, cattle bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone localization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). By comparative analysis of B-specific and non-B chromosomal sequences we discovered some B chromosome-specific mutations in protein-coding genes, which further enabled the detection of a FPGT-TNNI 3 K transcript expressed from duplicated genes located on <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in roe deer fibroblasts. Conclusions Discovery of a large autosomal segment in all <b>B</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of the Siberian roe deer further corroborates the view of an autosomal origin for these elements. Detection of a B-derived transcript in fibroblasts implies that the protein coding sequences located on Bs are not fully inactivated. The origin, evolution and effect on host of B chromosomal genes seem {{to be similar to}} autosomal segmental duplications, which reinforces the view that supernumerary chromosomal elements might {{play an important role in}} genome evolution. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
