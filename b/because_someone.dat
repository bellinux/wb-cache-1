5|$|During a video {{interview}} at Gamescom, {{most of the}} setlist was inadvertently leaked <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> was scrolling through the setlist in the background. Harmonix released a video response to the leak the next day, officially denying the rumored setlist, while once again showing the setlist {{in the background and}} confirming additional songs. The full setlist was formally announced on August 25 on the Rock Band website.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E
5|$|After journeying {{across the}} world to get the spirits, meeting the other {{two members of the}} party, thwarting the {{invasion}} attempts of Navarre and Altena, discovering the powers of the Fire and Water Mana Stones, and learning the disappearance of the Mana Stone of Darkness along the way, the main character tries to open the gate to the Mana Sanctuary with the spirits' assistance. The first attempt fails, but the second succeeds; the Faerie realizes that it was opened <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> else released the power from all the Mana Stones. The characters travel into the Sanctuary and the main character claims the Mana Sword. It is then discovered that the main character's adversaries—Koren and the Darkshine Knight for Angela and Duran; Jagan and Isabella for Lise and Hawk; or the Deathjester and a mind-controlled Heath, for Kevin and Charlotte—have defeated the other two sets of primary enemies. The remaining adversaries capture the Faerie and will only release her in exchange for the Mana Sword. The trade is made, and once the enemy receives the Sword, the Mana Stones shatter and the God Beasts are released.|$|E

5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien creature, was that simply <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E

25|$|The Mae West was {{a common}} {{nickname}} for the first inflatable life preserver, which was invented in 1928 by Peter Markus (1885–1974) (US Patent 1694714), with his subsequent improvements in 1930 and 1931. The nickname originated <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> wearing the inflated life preserver often appeared to be as large-breasted as the actress Mae West. It was popular during the Second World War with U.S. Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force servicemen, who were issued inflatable Mae Wests {{as part of their}} flight gear. Air crew members whose lives were saved by use of the Mae West (and other personal flotation devices) were eligible for membership in the Goldfish Club.|$|E
25|$|Selected as a torch bearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) {{is stuck}} on the London Underground with members of his local {{football}} team <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> pulled the emergency stop when an argument broke out.

Meanwhile, Billy's granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), is in labour in a local fast food restaurant, refusing an ambulance, and refusing to give birth until she knows Billy has carried the torch and can be there. After some delays, Billy is able to carry the torch, watched by his friends and neighbours. He then hears that Lola is in labour, so rushes to the restaurant, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) delivers the baby.|$|E

25|$|The {{inheritance}} {{pattern of}} DNA means that close relatives share {{a higher percentage}} of alleles between each other than with other, random, members of society. This allows for the searching of close matches within CODIS when an exact match is not found. By focusing on close matches, investigators can potentially find a close relative whose profile is in CODIS narrowing their search to one specific family. Familial searching has led to several convictions after the exhaustion of all other leads including the Grim Sleeper serial killer. This practice also raised Fourth Amendment challenges as the individual who ends up being charged with a crime was only implicated <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> else's DNA was in the CODIS database. So far courts have allowed familial searching results to be used and entered into evidence during court proceedings and , eleven states have approved the use of familial searching in CODIS.|$|E

Then he starts to date Ivy Slade. By the end of Scandal, he and Reed are a couple again.

Taylor explained {{that it was a}} misunderstanding; [...] "It started <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> asked me if we would ever write for Kylie. I said that we'd been asked to write for her but we'd never got round to it. And I said if we had to give her one of our songs, [...] "Ready for the Floor" [...] would probably be the most suitable.

500|$|After the {{publication}} of Eureka, a vehement anonymous censure {{was published in the}} Literary Review. Poe believed it to have been written by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (1820–1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticized the work as pantheistic and [...] "a damnable heresy" [...] that [...] "conscience would compel him to denounce". Literary critic George Edward Woodberry in 1885 thought the essay was based on a crude understanding of the science a student learns in school [...] "rendered ridiculous" [...] by absurdity and the density of his ignorance. Thomas Dunn English, a writer, lawyer, and doctor who frequently criticized Poe, wrote a news article for the John-Donkey with the headline, [...] "Great Literary Crash". The article explained that a shelf of books crashed <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> had [...] "imprudently" [...] stacked an edition of Eureka on it and that it was a miracle that the whole building did not fall down because of it.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the songs}} {{included}} in Rock Band 3 were recorded either from master copies or live performances. Many were included to emphasize the keyboard instrument. Existing game content, including prior downloadable content and songs from the Rock Band Network, carries forward into Rock Band 3, with the full Rock Band library consisting of over 2,000 songs {{by the time the}} game was released. When Rock Band 3 was first detailed on June 11, 2010, Harmonix announced 22 of the game's songs. The next month, Harmonix used Facebook and Twitter to provide clues about additional songs for both Rock Band 3 and Dance Central, which they then confirmed to be six Rock Band tracks and three Dance Central tracks. During a video interview at the 2010 Gamescom convention, most of the setlist was inadvertently leaked <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> was scrolling through the setlist in the background.

500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall.

500|$|On 8 October Mahler was {{formally}} appointed to succeed Jahn as the Hofoper's director. His first production {{in his new}} office was Smetana's Czech nationalist opera Dalibor, with a reconstituted finale that left the hero Dalibor alive. This production caused anger among the more extreme Viennese German nationalists, who accused Mahler of [...] "fraternising with the anti-dynastic, inferior Czech nation." [...] The Austrian author Stefan Zweig, in his memoirs The World of Yesterday (1942), described Mahler's appointment {{as an example of}} the Viennese public's general distrust of young artists: [...] "Once, when an amazing exception occurred and Gustav Mahler was named director of the Court Opera at thirty-eight years old, a frightened murmur and astonishment ran through Vienna, <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> had entrusted the highest institute of art to 'such a young person' ... This suspicion—that all young people were 'not very reliable'—ran through all circles at that time." [...] Zweig also wrote that [...] "to have seen Gustav Mahler on the street [...] was an event that one would proudly report to his comrades the next morning as it if were a personal triumph." [...] During Mahler's tenure a total of 33new operas were introduced to the Hofoper; a further 55 were new or totally revamped productions. However, a proposal to stage Richard Strauss's controversial opera Salome in 1905 was rejected by the Viennese censors.|$|E
500|$|Within the Star Trek canon, {{there have}} been no officially {{recognized}} LGBT characters in the television spin-offs. [...] The International Review of Science Fiction ran a feature entitled [...] "Prisoners of Dogma and Prejudice: Why There Are no G/L/B/T Characters in Star Trek: Deep Space 9" [...] However, gender identity has occasionally been treated as an [...] "issue" [...] within the new Star Trek series, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the 1995 [...] episode [...] "Rejoined", which was the first episode of the show to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the Star Trek franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil [...] "mirror universe" [...] ("The Emperor's New Cloak") or body possession ("Warlord" [...] and others), and often for comedic purposes between otherwise heterosexual characters. In a 2000 Fandom interview, Star Trek screenwriter Ronald D. Moore suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was <b>because</b> <b>someone</b> wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was going to make any difference. In recent years, a few of the Star Trek novels and comics, which are officially licensed but not considered canon, have featured serious direct same-sex relationships, including portraying a minor canon character as gay.|$|E
