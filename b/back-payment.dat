25|$|In mid-1993, former drummer Steven Adler's {{lawsuit against}} the band was settled out of court; Adler {{received}} a <b>back-payment</b> check of $2,250,000 and 15% royalties for songs he recorded.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} his dismissal, in July 1991, Adler {{filed a lawsuit against}} his former Guns N' Roses band mates, contending that he was fired because the opiate-blocking drug he had been taking to aid his detox {{interfered}} with his concentration. He also alleged that the contract he had been made to sign took away his financial interest in the band, stating, [...] "I was told that every time I did heroin, the band would fine me $2,000. ... What these contracts actually said was that the band were paying me $2,000 to leave. They were taking my royalties, all my writing credits. They didn't like me any more and just wanted me gone." [...] The case was settled out of court in 1993; Adler received a <b>back-payment</b> check of $2,250,000 and was granted 15% of the royalties for everything he recorded prior to his departure.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2005, Mike Joyce told Marc Riley on BBC Radio 6 Music that {{financial}} hardship had reduced him to selling rare Smiths' recordings on eBay. By way of illustration, Riley played {{part of an}} unfinished instrumental known as the [...] "Click Track" [...] (or [...] "Cowbell Track"). Morrissey responded with a statement three days later revealing that Joyce had received £215,000 each from Marr and Morrissey in 1997, along with Marr's final <b>back-payment</b> of £260,000 in 2001. Morrissey failed to make his final payment because, he said, he was overseas in 2001 and did not receive the paperwork. Joyce obtained a default judgement against Morrissey, revised his outstanding claim to £688,000, and secured orders garnishing much of the singer's income. This {{was a source of}} ongoing inconvenience and grievance to Morrissey, who estimated that Joyce had cost him at least £1,515,000 in recovered royalties and legal fees up to 30 November 2005.|$|E

30|$|The {{estimation}} of a representative duration load curve {{is required to}} evaluate the impact of nodal reliability by seasons, week days, and weekend days. The curve can then be used to establish appropriate <b>back-payments</b> for users accepting an interruptible service {{as well as for}} those on an HR tariff.|$|R
50|$|By 2016, however, Concentrix was {{receiving}} heavy {{criticism from the}} cross-party parliamentary committee on welfare for incorrectly closing the claims of thousands of claimants, leaving them without money for essentials. A government report disclosed that of 36,000 appeals against Concentrix, 87% were upheld. In September 2016 the HMRC {{announced that it would}} not renew the contract, due to expire in 2017, although the Treasury has resisted calls for a full inquiry thus far. As a result of Concentrix' failings, thousands of claimants are also due to receive <b>back-payments</b> for incorrectly stopped claims.|$|R

50|$|Gustav led {{the firm}} through World War I, concentrating {{almost entirely on}} {{artillery}} manufacturing, particularly following the loss of overseas markets {{as a result of}} the Allied blockade. Vickers of England naturally suspended royalty payments during the war (Krupp held the patent on shell fuses, but <b>back-payment</b> was made in 1926).|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You" [...] by Led Zeppelin {{was thought}} to be a {{traditional}} song and was credited as [...] "Trad. arr.

5|$|With {{crude oil}} as the country's primary export, Gaddafi sought to improve Libya's oil sector. In October 1969, he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair, benefiting foreign {{corporations}} {{more than the}} Libyan state, and by threatening to reduce production, in December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil. In 1970, other OPEC states followed suit, leading to a global increase {{in the price of}} crude oil. The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement, in which they secured income tax, <b>back-payments</b> and better pricing from the oil corporations; these measures brought Libya an estimated $1 billion in additional revenues in its first year.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{describes}} a practical approach to identify nodal price compensation payment for nodal consumers willing {{to reduce their}} energy consumption (consumers’ demand response). The implementation of a nodal reliability service pricing is based on contingency assessment of N −  2 order for transmission lines. A representative annualized demand curve is used to reflect the system’s operation condition by seasons. Such curve is used to access the nodal reliability impact trough a whole year {{in order to determine}} <b>back-payments</b> (incentive payment) to users for service interruption. The IEEE_RTS 24 nodes system is used to implement the proposed approach.|$|R

5000|$|The English {{rock band}} Led Zeppelin adapted the song after hearing Baez's version, {{crediting}} the song as [...] "Traditional, arr. Page". In the 1980s, Bredon was {{made aware of}} Led Zeppelin's version of the song and so, since 1991, this version has been credited to Anne Bredon/Jimmy Page & Robert Plant. Bredon also received a <b>back-payment</b> of royalties.|$|E
50|$|His {{comeback}} {{success was}} somewhat derailed by a 1992 lawsuit, {{in which his}} former managers sued Braithwaite for <b>back-payment</b> of fees owing. The suit was successful, and Braithwaite essentially {{had to give up}} all the revenue he made from Edge and Rise, as well as a portion of the revenue from his next album, 1993s Taste the Salt and after a 1994 best-of collection was released, Braithwaite was dropped by his record company. He did not record another album for 12 years.|$|E
5000|$|The band covered Baez's version; both guitarist Jimmy Page {{and singer}} Robert Plant were fans of Baez.

5000|$|Ray {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the episode broadcast on 9 January 2012, when Morgan asks about his father and Bianca says it is Barack Obama. Bianca's adopted daughter, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), knowing the truth, attempts to contact Ray. Whitney takes Morgan to meet Ray the next day, and he soon comes to Walford to see Morgan. He saves Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) from a falling ladder, and she is attracted to him. Bianca soon realises that Whitney has taken Morgan to meet Ray, but does not {{want them to see}} each other, and Kim is disappointed to learn that Ray has a son. Whitney soon convinces Bianca to let Morgan see Ray again. Ray returns shortly after, wanting {{to spend more time with}} his son and offering to cook a meal for Bianca's family, although when Ray reveals he has a daughter, Sasha Dixon (Rebecca Sanneh), Bianca throws him out. He successfully gets a job as a barman and chef at The Queen Victoria public house. On his first day, Sasha arrives meets Morgan and Kim. Ray asks Kim out on a date, but Bianca is angry so takes Morgan out, and Kim tells Ray she has had enough of men with [...] "baggage". Ray continues to pursue Kim but she insists she is busy. Ray tells Bianca he wishes he could have been there for Morgan and how he changed his priorities for Sasha. Bianca misreads his kindness and goes to kiss him, but he turns away. When Ray discovers that Bianca is struggling with money, he gives her £300, saying it is for <b>back-payments</b> for Morgan. He starts to get somewhere with Kim but she suddenly leaves. He later hears from Kim's sister Denise Fox (Diane Parish) that Kim has caught head lice, so he gives Kim a hat to wear and they finally kiss. Kim becomes jealous when Ray playfights with Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) and later when he flirts with Bianca. As a result, she accidentally slices off the top of Ray's finger when he tries to help her fillet some fish. She accompanies him to the hospital where they open up to one another and decide to start a relationship.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003 Ridge {{started a}} {{relationship}} with ex-international cricketer Adam Parore, {{with whom she had}} two children. Ridge and Parore were involved in a controversial real estate scandal when they sought to demolish a 100-year-old house {{and replace it with a}} modern building. And also in 2009 the couple were embroiled in a $1 million leaky homes lawsuit. [...] They broke up in 2010.Ridge and her daughter, Jaime, took Mr Parore to the High Court at Auckland in September 2013 seeking a 50 per cent shareholding in the former international cricketer's Small Business Accounting (SBA) company and the <b>back-payment</b> of unpaid dividends.In his judgment Justice Murray Gilbert said [...] "Ms Ridge's claim fails at the first hurdle".He awarded Mr Parore scaled costs of $73,232, plus disbursements of $31,610, and a 50 per cent increase for any costs incurred after January 1, 2013.|$|E

30|$|The nodal {{incentives}} bonus is set individually {{according to}} each node interruption capacity (rate), {{and must be}} based on the difference between the reference price and the highest nodal price produced by ENNS. Hence, a higher <b>back-payment</b> is assigned to the nodes most affected by the contingencies on transmission lines. This is in opposition to a flat rate for all nodes in the system.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates human economic {{behavior in}} contexts which {{are characterized by}} different types of human interaction. First, we analyze the effects of introducing asymmetric information in an investment game (Berg et al., 1995), in which the division of an economic surplus between a trustor and a trustee is not contractible. Backward induction suggests that rational self-interested players would not voluntarily engage in any transaction, unless they expect trust and reciprocity {{to play a role}} in determining the behavior of their counterparts. In our experiment, only the trustee is aware of the size of the surplus obtained, so the trustor cannot tell if a low <b>back-payment</b> corresponds to a low or a high level of reciprocity. The introduction of asymmetric information in the investment game does not reduce the amounts sent and returned, when compared with previous experimental studies. Moreover, average payback levels increase with the average amount sent. Expectations about other's behavior and risk attitude are also elicited in the experiment. Our results show that the first movers' choices are functions of their expectations about the second movers' payback, and the second movers' choices depend on the difference between the amount the first movers have sent to them and their expectations about this amount. In the second part of the dissertation, we carry out a theoretical and experimental analysis of the problem of double moral hazard arising in a context of asymmetric information. We design a two-stage experiment to analyze a market for durable goods with warranties. In such a market, double moral hazard may arise as the seller can reduce (or increase) the initial quality of the product, while the buyer can reduce (or increase) the maintenance effort. In the first stage of the experiment, we analyze the impact of the warranty on the equilibrium levels of the product's initial quality and the effort of the buyer. In the second stage, we analyze the role of signaling and reputation in an intertemporal model. There, we show the suboptimality of the equilibria with warranty. We conclude that buyers will accept deviation from equilibrium price induced by sellers of durable goods with warranties. In the third and, last part of the dissertation, we design an experiment to study the strategic dependency in two-person iterated zero-sum games, and propose an account of the evidence for large variance in players' win rates across pairs of opponents. Our experiment controls the structure of the interdependence between players. This is achieved by using a computer program as one of the two players. The experimental analysis allows us to distinguish strategic dependence from non-strategic dependence in subjects' play...|$|E
