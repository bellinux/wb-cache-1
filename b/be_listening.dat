5|$|The {{heightened}} vigilance of the German garrison {{as the war}} entered {{its final}} phase made these operations especially hazardous, particularly as they were often attempted at extremely close quarters. On several occasions Rhodesian patrols only narrowly escaped discovery. During one action, two Rhodesian patrols catered {{for the possibility that}} Germans might <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to their transmissions by communicating in Shona, an African language. The LRDG's last actions of the war, in April and May 1945, were to help Tito's partisans capture German-held islands off Dalmatia.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Al Smith {{became the}} first Roman Catholic to gain a major party's {{nomination}} for president, and his religion became an issue during the campaign. His nomination made anti-Catholicism a rallying point especially for Lutheran and Southern Baptist ministers. They warned that national autonomy would be threatened because Smith would <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> not to the American people but to secret orders from the pope. There were rumors the pope would move to the United States to control his new realm.|$|E
25|$|Half an hour later, German radio {{broadcast}} {{the news of}} the rescue, to which the Stammheim inmates could <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> on their radios. In the course of the night, Baader was found dead with a gunshot wound {{in the back of his}} head and Ensslin was found hanged in her cell; Raspe died in the hospital the next day from a gunshot wound to the head. Irmgard Möller, who had several stab wounds in the chest, survived and was released from prison in 1994.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is to}} send application-specific UDP packets, hoping to generate an application layer response. For example, sending a DNS query to port 53 {{will result in a}} response, if a DNS server is present. This method is much more reliable at identifying open ports. However, it is limited to scanning ports for which an application specific probe packet is available. Some tools (e.g., nmap) generally have probes for less than 20 UDP services, while some commercial tools (e.g., nessus) have as many as 70. In some cases, a service may <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> on the port, but configured not to respond to the particular probe packet.|$|E
25|$|Interpretations abound. Perhaps this {{particular}} formation represents a council of some sort—the fifteen other figurines seem to <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> {{to the red}} granite one, with the celts forming a backdrop. One {{of the most striking}} offerings found at La Venta, the celts in Offering Number 4, depict a person with a ceremonial headdress “flying” and also the maize deity. There appears to be a definite symbolic link here, but it is unclear whether it is tied to the Olmec rudimentary writing system. To the red granite figurine's right, there seems be a line of three figurines filing past him. Another researcher has suggested that the granite figure is an initiate.|$|E

25|$|The {{band had}} {{originally}} planned to self-title their previous album, Documentaly (2011), {{due to the}} album's documentary theme. However, as {{the events of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami affecting the album's recording so much, as this did not reflect their attempt to express everything that was happening in 2011, as opposed to just what happened to the band. For their next album, they decided to revisit this idea. This was due to the band's greater exposure in Japan through their commercial tie-ups, which would mean a great number of people would <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to Sakanaction for the first time for this album. Yamaguchi described making music for this new audience as feeling like the band were releasing their first album again, which strengthened their desire to self-title this release.|$|E

500|$|A mixed {{review was}} given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that [...] "the vocal editing on 'Start Over' is far too sloppy, {{confirming}} again that a series of individual flourishes doesn't pass muster as a performance." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters also gave a mixed review for [...] "Start Over" [...] and [...] "Countdown" [...] saying that they [...] "just don't seem to <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to themselves, and will get by on listenability more than lyrical wizardry if they get by at all." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song, saying: [...] "While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity {{to try something new}} in some way or another, 'Start Over' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything." [...] He also noted that [...] "Start Over" [...] was an [...] "inoffensive ballad that doesn't do much for the record aside from break its momentum at the halfway point." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, the United States Supreme Court {{upheld the}} FCC's {{authority}} to fine broadcasts for indecent programming at hours when children could <b>be</b> <b>listening.</b> The landmark decision followed a 1973 airing of Filthy Words, a 12-minute monologue by comedian George Carlin that featured repetitive {{use of the}} [...] "seven dirty words". Between 1975 and 1987, no television or radio broadcaster was fined over indecency. The FCC deemed the seven words outlined in the Carlin monologue as indecent, and was only concerned with such material. Until 1987, this indecency ruling provided broadcasters with a clear, albeit limited, guide to follow.|$|E
2500|$|While {{attending}} college in Drury, Barker worked his first [...] "media job", at KTTS-FM Radio, in Springfield. He {{and his wife}} left Springfield and moved to Lake Worth, Florida, and he was news editor and announcer at nearby WWPG 1340 AM in Palm Beach (now WPBR in Lantana). In 1950, Barker moved to California in order {{to pursue a career}} in broadcasting. He was given his own radio show, The Bob Barker Show, which ran for the next six years from Burbank. He was hosting an audience-participation radio show on KNX (AM) in Los Angeles when game show producer Ralph Edwards happened to <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> and liked Barker's voice and style.|$|E
2500|$|Another long-standing {{tradition}} is the playing of Wagner's [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] at 7:00 each morning during finals {{week with the}} largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed {{at any other time}} (except if one happens to <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of The Ring Cycle), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. The playing of the Ride is such a strong tradition that the music was used during Apollo 17 to awaken Astronaut Harrison Schmitt, a Caltech alumnus. Unfortunately, the tradition arose at different times in different Houses, so Schmitt did not react as expected. Instead, he just became confused.|$|E

2500|$|Good {{friends in}} real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny {{inadvertently}} hatched a running gag in 1937, {{when a child}} prodigy, violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show, inspiring an Allen wisecrack about [...] "a certain alleged violinist," [...] who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air ("Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts" [...] was Allen's way of saying hello to his pal Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would <b>be</b> <b>listening.</b> Benny, according to Allen biographer Taylor, burst out laughing, then responded in kind on his own program. And they were off and running, going at it {{for over a decade}} and doing it well enough to convince some if not many fans of both shows that the two comedians really were blood enemies.|$|E
2500|$|Tatum was not {{inclined}} toward understatement or expansive use of space. [...] He seldom {{played in a}} simplified way, preferring interpretations that displayed his great technique and clever harmonizations. [...] When jazz pianist Stanley Cowell {{was growing up in}} Toledo, his father prevailed upon Tatum to play piano at the Cowell home. [...] Stanley described the scene as, [...] "Tatum played so brilliantly and so much ... that I thought the piano was gonna break. [...] My mother left the room ... so I said 'What's wrong, Mama?' [...] And she said 'Oh, that man plays too much piano. [...] A handful of critics, notably Keith Jarrett, have complained that Tatum played too many notes or was too ornamental or was even 'unjazzlike'. [...] Jazz critic Gary Giddins opined, [...] "That is the essence of Tatum. If you don't like his ornament, you should <b>be</b> <b>listening</b> to someone else. That's where his genius is." ...|$|E
