40|$|Preliminary fluid {{nitrogen}} flow data are reported for a five-brush, ceramic-coated-rub-runner <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> system, where the brushes and the rub runner were placed {{at each end}} of a centrally pressurized multifunction tester ('back-to-back' set of brushes) and tested at rotor speeds of 0, 10, 18, and 22. 5 krpm. After testing, both the brushes and the ceramic-coated rub runner appeared pristine. The coating withstood both the thermomechanical and dynamic loadings with minor wear track scarring. The bristle tips showed some indication of material shearing (smearing) wear. The Ergun (1952) porous flow equation was applied to the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> data. The Ergun relation fit the gaseous data but was in poor agreement with the fluid results. The <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> exit conditions were two phase. Two-phase, choked-flow design charts were applied but required one data point at each rotor speed to define the flow and area coefficients.

40|$|<b>Brush</b> <b>seal</b> dynamic {{behavior}} is {{strongly related to}} pressure and flow fields. Developments in <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> design have led to geometric modifications to control flow field and consequent <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> issues including blow-down, hang-up, and pressure stiffening. Some of the geometric enhancements {{have been found to}} have common use as backing plate modifications. Over the two decades of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> evolution, many backing plate configurations have been suggested in numerous patent disclosures. Even so, literature on the effects of geometric modifications on pressure and flow fields remains limited. This study numerically investigates <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> pressure and flow fields for such common conceptual backing plate configurations as single and multiple grooves, with and without by-pass passages. The CFD analysis presented employs a bulk porous medium approach for the bristle pack. The effectiveness of various backing plate configurations outlining important flow features is discussed. Results indicate that backing plate configurations have a decisive role in shaping seal pressure fields. In general, it has been found that all cases having bypass configuration leak more. Moreover, the major portion of the seal leakage through fence height is fed from the backing plate cavity. The single backing plate groove forms a constant pressure behind the bristle pack.

40|$|Pressure {{and flow}} fields {{lay at the}} basis of such common {{phenomena}} affecting <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> performance as bristle flutter, blow-down, hang-up, hysteresis, pressure stiffening, wear, and leakage. Over {{the past two decades}} of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> evolution, manufacturers and researchers have applied many geometric configurations to the front and backing plates of a standard <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> in order to control the flow field and consequent seal performance. The number of studies evaluating the effect of geometric configurations on the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> flow field remains limited in spite of the high number of filed patent disclosures. This study presents a numerical analysis of <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> pressure and flow fields with regard to common conceptual front plate configurations. A CFD model has been employed to calculate pressure and flow fields in the seal domain. The model incorporates a bulk porous medium approach for the bristle pack. The effectiveness of various conceptual geometries has been outlined in terms of flow field formation. Results disclose unique effects of geometry on pressure and flow fields such that a longer front plate drives outward radial flow while playing a protective role against upstream cavity disturbances. Findings also indicate that variations in front plate geometry do not directly affect leakage performance. A long front plate or damper shim considerably changes the flow field {{while at the same time}} having limited effect on the pressure field. Moreover, a strong suction towards the clearance enhances inward radial flow in clearance operation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} leakage {{characteristics}} of <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> including the flow field characteristic of brush seal {{and the effects}} of structural parameters on the leakage characteristic of <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> with the consideration of bristle deflection. The flow field characteristic of brush seal was discussed based on three-dimensional (3 -D) computational model of brush seal, two-way fluid–structure interaction and moving grid technique. Then the effect of structural parameters on the leakage characteristic of <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> was investigated from theoretical and numerical simulation perspectives with the emphasis on an improved prediction formula of leakage flow rate of <b>brush</b> <b>seals.</b> As illustrated in the analysis of the leakage characteristics of <b>brush</b> <b>seals,</b> (1) the leakage with the influence of bristle deflection is closer to the results of experiment relative to that without bristle deflection, and increases with the increasing inlet/outlet pressure ratios, which validate the developed 3 -D computational model with bristle deflection to be more reasonable; (2) the flow field characteristics (pressure and velocity) of brush seal are revealed reasonably; (3) with the increasing of the height of backing plate fence, the clearance of brush wire and the axial clearance between brush bristle and back plate, the leakage factor rises and then reaches a stable value when the clearance of brush is larger than 0. 3 mm; moreover, (4) with the increase of brush wire diameter, the leakage factor decreases firstly and then tends to stabilization, while rapidly decreases at first, then slowly decreases, and lastly tends to a value when the bristle row number increases; (5) the reliability and accuracy of the proposed prediction equation for <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> is validated to be high by the CFD computational results.

40|$|The leakage {{performance}} of a <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> with gaseous working fluids at static and low rotor speed conditions was studied. The leakage results included for air, helium, and carbon dioxide at several bristle/rotor interferences. Also, the effects of packing a lubricant into the bristles and also of reversing the pressure drop across the seal were studied. Results were {{compared to that of}} an annular seal at similar operating conditions. In order to generalize the results, they were correlated using corresponding state theory.

Visualization of the flow field revealed regions that are characteristically jetting, vortical, and crossflow and exist upstream, downstream or within the seal.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{superior}} performance and stable leakage characteristics, <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> {{is one of}} the emerging seals to be used in oil and oil mist applications in aero-engines and turbines. The viscous medium between the high speed rotor surface and bearing surfaces formed by <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> bristles generates a hydrodynamic lifting force that determines seal clearance and leakage rate in oil sealing applications. The analytical solution to bristle lifting force can be found by using Reynolds formulation. Following a short bearing approximation, a closed form solution of the lifting force has been previously presented. However, the solution suggests a strong dependence of hydrodynamic lift force and seal clearance on oil temperature and viscosity. This work presents an analytical solution to oil temperature rise due to shear heating.

40|$|Developments in turbine {{technologies}} lead {{to higher}} operating temperature and pressure conditions. Parasitic leakage flows around the turbine account for considerable efficiency losses that increase fuel cost dramatically. Brush seal has recently emerged as an improved sealing technology to provide better leakage performance and to replace classical labyrinth seals. In order to optimize efficiency, comprehensive study of the factors causing the leakage is required. The leakage performance of the brush seal is directly related with geometry, operating inlet and outlet boundary conditions, bristle pack configuration. Brush seal flow and pressure profiles with turbine operating conditions become complicated, and analytical formulations remain inadequate to correlate design parameters and leakage performance in operating conditions. Recently <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> have found ever increasing applications in steam turbines. Literature review indicates that there is very limited studies of brush seal for steam environment. There is also no correlation available for brush seal porosity coefficients in the literature. In an attempt to meet this need, six <b>brush</b> <b>seals</b> have been tested in a rotary test rig up to 100 psi upstream pressure.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The complicated fluid flow at the tip of a typical bristle within a <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> is simulated. A numerical model is developed to compute the three-dimensional details in the bristle tip region. Experimental and numerical leakage data are correlated to obtain an estimation of the flow through the overall <b>brush</b> <b>seal.</b> A parametric study is conducted by examining the flow through different seal geometries and associated bristle configurations. Comparisons are made between seals of different bristle angle, bristle diameter, bristle free length, seal backplate diameter, and lift-off gap. Numerical flow visualization illustrates the three-dimensional flow field, showing the circumferential, axial, and radial components of velocity near the bristle surface. Major flow characteristics (separation and recirculation) occur within the inter-bristle spacing and in the lift-off gap. The result of the investigation reveals that the geometry of the <b>brush</b> <b>seal</b> and associated bristle configurations can greatly influence the leakage. The moment due to the forces acting at the bristle tip can increase the lift-off gap which may increase leakage through the seal. For all seals considered, the radial force component is significantly greater than the tangential force component because the large stagnation pressure force predominately in the radial direction prevails over the smaller shearing force observed in the circumferential direction...|$|R
