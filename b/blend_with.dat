5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> the surroundings, making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E
5|$|In their {{introduced}} ranges, {{they also}} tend to seek out organisms that exhibit structures their slender bodies can easily <b>blend</b> <b>with.</b> These include macroalgae like Ulva lactuca, Ceramiumspp., Plocamiumspp., Cladophoraspp., Chorda filum, Fucus vesiculosus, Pylaiellaspp. and the introduced Sargassum muticum; hydrozoans like Obeliaspp. and Tubularia indivisa; bryozoans; tube-building amphipods like Monocorophium acherusicum and Jassa marmorata; and even soft-bodied tunicates like Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona intestinalis.|$|E
5|$|The grocery-store chain ICA had {{sponsored}} IFK Göteborg since 1974, {{and their}} logo was {{displayed on the}} chest of the shirt 1980–2010, leading some to consider it {{an integral part of}} the shirt. The ICA logo was reproduced in its original red colour for the first few years, but was then changed to a blue-and-white version to better <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> the kit colours.|$|E
40|$|Waste tire dust (WTD) of {{mechanically}} reclaimed scrap tires was <b>blended</b> <b>with</b> polypropylene (PP) in {{five different}} compositions to prepare PP/WTD blends. Three series of <b>blends</b> <b>with</b> three differ-ent sizes of WTD (250 – 500 lm, 500 – 710 lm, and 710 lm– 1 mm) were prepared in a Haake Rheomix Polydrive R 600 / 610 at a tem-perature of 180 C and a rotor speed of 50 rpm for 9 min. The {{results show that}} at the same blending composition, the PP/WTD <b>blends</b> <b>with</b> fine WTD size require higher equilibrium torque and exhibit higher values of tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and elongation at break (Eb) than that of <b>blends</b> <b>with</b> coarser WTD size. The swell-ing index of the PP/WTD blends reveals that the <b>blends</b> <b>with</b> fine WTD size have better swelling resistance in both oil and toluene than all <b>blends</b> <b>with</b> coarser WTD. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation indicates that the PP/WTD <b>blends</b> <b>with</b> the fin-est WTD size exhibit better PP/WTD adhesion than <b>blends</b> <b>with</b> coarse WTD sizes...|$|R

Garlic or pear are also {{sometimes}} boiled with ginger.|$|R
5|$|Measure 32 was {{a medium}} pattern of {{obtrusive}} polygons in navy blue or black, against background polygons of lighter grays and greens. This measure emphasized mistaken identity and course deception to complicate submarine attack. Patterns were carried across the bow, and light gray was used aft to <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> the wake. This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} painted white to aesthetically {{distinguish it from}} both Safeco Field and the nearby industrial area. The {{east side of the}} stadium has a large glass curtain wall that faces the nearby International District. The exterior of the stadium also consists of salmon-colored concrete, and {{the west side of the}} structure is partially clad with red brick. The coloring and facade were designed so the stadium would <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> the older buildings in neighboring Pioneer Square. To reduce costs, the exterior was not completed with brick or ornate steel work.|$|E
5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
50|$|In Spain, while Treixadura is most {{commonly}} found in the Rías Baixas and Ribeiro Denominación de Origen (DO)s, it {{is also found in}} other Galician wines such as the Monterrei DO where it is <b>blended</b> <b>with</b> Dona Blanca, Godello and Palomino. In Rías Baixas the grape is often <b>blended</b> <b>with</b> Albariño (Alvarinho), Loureira, Caino blanco, Torrontes and Godello. In Ribeiro it is often <b>blended</b> <b>with</b> Albariño, Albilla, Godello, Palomino, Loureira, Macabeo and Torrontes.|$|R

This cheese is supposedly coloured similarly to Cotswold stone.|$|R
5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E

25|$|Most {{species of}} Ctenizidae live in burrows rather than webs. They live in warm {{places such as}} China, North America, South America, Africa and Japan. They make silk hinged doors that <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> their habitat. Not {{all members of the}} family use trapdoors.|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of metropolitan Detroit continues {{to attract the}} attention of architects and preservationists alike. With one of the world's recognizable skylines, Detroit's waterfront panorama shows a variety of architectural styles. The city's historic Art Deco skyscrapers <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> the post-modern neogothic spires of One Detroit Center. Together with the Renaissance Center, they form the city's distinctive skyline.|$|E
50|$|Difference subtracts {{the bottom}} layer {{from the top}} layer or the other way round, to always get a {{positive}} value. <b>Blending</b> <b>with</b> black produces no change, as values for all colors are 0. (The RGB value for black is 0,0,0.) <b>Blending</b> <b>with</b> white inverts the picture.|$|R

25|$|The {{color of}} a device neither {{identifies}} its voltage class nor power system. Because the colors are not identified by national standards, the purpose of color-coding a receptacle is set by the building owner. In this case, building owners may select brown, ivory, white, almond, grey, and black receptacles in the 5-15 configuration to <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> the decor of a room.|$|E
25|$|The large Cotes de Provence AOC {{includes}} 85 communes {{between the}} towns of Nice and Marseille and is responsible for nearly 75% of all Provençal wine with rosés alone accounting for 80% of that total.

25|$|The {{incorporation}} of ancient concepts and {{racial and cultural}} assumptions into modern imperial ideology bolstered colonial claims to supremacy and right to colonize non-Europeans. Because of these numerous ramifications between ancient representations and modern colonial rhetoric, 19th century’s colonialist discourse acquires a “multi-layered” or “palimpsestic” structure. It forms a “historical, ideological and narcissistic continuum,” in which modern theories of domination feed upon and <b>blend</b> <b>with</b> “ancient myths of supremacy and grandeur”.|$|E
