40|$|Abstract. The {{stochastic}} {{field of}} sediment {{supply to the}} channel network of a drainage basin depends on the large-scale interactions among climatically driven processes such as forest fire and rainstorms, topography, channel network topology, and basin scale. During infrequent periods of intense erosion, large volumes of colluvium are concentrated in parts of a channel network, particularly near tributary junctions. The rivers carry <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> and wash <b>load</b> downstream from these storage sites at different rates. The <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> travels slowly, creating transient patterns of sediment transport, sediment storage, and channel morphology along the channel network. As the concentrations of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> migrate along the network their waveforms can undergo changes by diffusion, interference at tributary junctions, and loss of mass through temporary sediment storage in fans and terraces and through particle abrasion, which converts <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> to wash <b>load.</b> We investigated how these processes might influence the sediment mass balance in channels of third and higher order in a 215 -km 2 drainage basin within the Oregon Coast Range over a simulated 3000 -year period with a climate typical of the late Holocene. We used field measurements and a simulation model to illustrate interactions between the major controls on large-scale processes functioning {{over long periods of}} time in complex drainage basins. 1...|$|R

40|$|Grain size {{distribution}} of <b>bed</b> <b>material,</b> <b>bed</b> <b>load,</b> and bar head deposition were sampled during {{the evolution of}} a chute and lobe in the braided gravel bed Sunwapta River, Alberta. Although bed shear stress and total bed load transport rate varied substantially within the reach and from day to day (Ferguson et al., this issue), the median diameter D 50 of bed load was remarkably constant. The bed initially fined from chute to bar head but became more uniform. Sediment deposited on the bar head also had a near constant D 50, {{similar to that of the}} bed load truncated at the same lower size limit. Both load and deposition were finer on average than the bed, suggesting overall selective transport despite little sign of local sorting. In contrast to median diameters, maximum sizes (D(max)) of sediment in motion and deposited on the bar head varied substantially and showed a weak but significant dependence on shear stress. Inferring selective entrainment from this evidence alone would be dubious because D(max) was also found to increase systematically with the mass of sediment sampled. However, two different methods of analysis of fractional transport rates throughout the size range also showed size-selective entrainment and transport. In the marginal transport conditions of this study, size sorting appears to occur but only weakly and mainly in the coarser fractions...|$|R
50|$|Three {{components}} that {{are included in}} the load of a river system are the following: dissolved load, wash load and <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load</b> is the portion of the sediment that is transported by a stream that contains material derived from the bed. <b>Bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load</b> typically consists of all of the bed load, and the proportion of the suspended load that is represented in the bed sediments. It generally consists of grains coarser than 0.062 mm with the principal source being the channel bed. Its importance lies in that its composition is that of the bed, and the material in transport can therefore be actively interchanged with the bed. For this reason, <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load</b> exerts a control on river channel morphology. Bed load and wash load (the sediment that rides high in the flow and does not extract non-negligible momentum from it) together constitute the total load of sediment in a stream.

This paper compares finite-element analyses of two types of cubicle bed, recycled rubber-crumb mattresses and ethylene vinyl acetate mats, the properties of which were derived from simple laboratory experiments, with results from a two-farm study of cow injury assessments. The bed samples were subject to quasi-static compression tests and their force-displacement responses were measured. Both samples {{were found to be}} non-linear elastic, with a response that may be characterized as hyperelastic. While both products would provide sufficient cushioning to reduce severe hock and knee injuries, the rubber-crumb mattress was the more compliant of the two and should result in fewer injuries to the cows.

40|$|River {{channel and}} {{floodplain}} complexity, including {{the diversity of}} river bends, pool depths, oxbow lakes, scroll bars, and related features, is generated by the tendency of river channels to migrate laterally. The primary driver of this migration is the flow field, which molds the sediment of the channel boundary and is in turn altered by the gradient, curvature, and bar forms of the channel. However, the rate and texture of the sediment supply, determined by the topography, lithology, climate, and vegetation cover of the drainage basin, play important roles in affecting the resultant rates of bank erosion, bend growth, and form of floodplain erosion that generate sinuosity and oxbow lake production. We illustrate this point with examples of our recent studies of channel mobility and floodplain erosion and sedimentation. The supply of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> to a reach accelerates point bar growth that increases the cross-channel acceleration of flow and intensifies bank erosion. The vulnerability of floodplain surfaces to chute incision, which depends on point bar growth, floodplain texture, floodplain gradient, and vegetation cover, limits channel sinuosity and alters the average rate and length of oxbow lakes. The form and rate of sedimentation in oxbow lakes and thus {{the length of time}} they survive as open water bodies before filling depends on the initial diversion angle of the cutoff (and therefore, on average, the sinuosity of the channel), and the relative supplies of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> and wash <b>load...</b>|$|R

Within a given storm season, both antecedent storm history and cumulative flow (above the threshold for bed load transport, 0. 25 m** 3 s** minus ** 1) influenced bed load transport; however, {{the effects of these}} seasonal factors changed from year to year, presumably in response to storage and release of sediment around large organic debris upstream.

40|$|Abstract. Natural {{gravel bed}} {{channels}} commonly contain a fine mode {{of sand and}} fine gravel that fills voids of the bed framework of coarser gravel. If the supply of fine bed material exceeds the storage capacity of framework voids, excess fine material forms surficial patches, which can be voluminous in pools during low flow. Data collected in 34 natural channels in northern California and southern Oregon indicate the following. (1) Fine material on the bed surface can be readily winnowed and transported at high particle velocities, {{much of it in}} intermittent suspension. Fine material can dominate the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load</b> in gravel bed channels, but its abundance on the bed surface is limited by its increasing mobility as hiding places among prominent particles are filled. (2) Fine material in pools is typically replaced many times per year. (3) The proportion V * of residual pool volume filled with fine bed material correlates with annual sediment yield in channels whose parent material produces abundant sandy sediment. (4) Temporal and spatial changes in V * appear to correspond to variations in the balance between sediment inputs and water discharge. These results suggest that V * can be used to monitor and evaluate the supply of excess fine material in gravel bed channels and that samples of fine material in pools can characterize the fine, mobile mode of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|Bed load {{transport}} {{was investigated}} in four headwater streams in southeastern Alaska subjected to different management and disturbance regimes. Bed load yield was positively correlated to peak discharge during the fall 1999 monitoring period. Fine <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>materials</b> (1 - 11 mm) that were supplied from hillslope sources were equally mobilized during most storm events. Medium-sized <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> (11 - 200 m) were only partially mobilized even during large storms, whereas large particles (> 200 mm) were immobile and often formed interlocking channel structures. The transport distances of medium-size materials depended on amount of channel obstructions (e. g., woody debris) and sediment supply conditions; both of these factors were influenced by the occurrence of mass movement, timber harvesting, and the related recovery processes. The highest total bed load yield was observed in a channel affected by a debris flow in 1993. Total sediment yields are similar among channels with old-growth, clear cut (logged 4 years before monitoring), and young alder (affected by landslides and debris flows in 1961) riparian stands. By comparing the old-growth and young alder channels, it appears that bed load yield recovers from debris flow disturbances in about 40 years; however, recovery of channel conditions (e. g., reach types and woody debris) may take much longer.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{is to improve the}} one-dimensional numerical prediction of the fine and non-cohesive <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load</b> in alluvial rivers, especially during high intensity episodes during which sediment beds are strongly remobilized. For this reason, we attempt to reduce the major inaccuracy sources coming from the alluvial resistance and <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load</b> relations needed to close the mathematical system. Through a shared parameter called the control factor m, the interactions occurring in alluvial rivers are incorporated more deeply into the mathematical model and more particularly into the closure laws: <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load</b> (SVRD, Suction-Vortex Resuspension Dynamics) and the energy slope (Verbanck et al. 2007). The control factor m is assumedly related to the Rossiter resonance modes of the separated flow downstream the bed form crest. To further improve the representation of the flow-sediment-morphology interactions, a fully coupled model approach has been naturally chosen. In this work the terminology fully coupled means that the three equations forming the system are solved synchronously and that the terms often neglected by more traditional decoupled models are kept. The feasibility of the new closure methodology has been drawn up by reproducing numerically the silt-flushing experiment conducted by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (Y. R. C. C.) in the Lower Yellow River (LYR) in Northern China. The objective of the silt flushing experiment is to reverse the aggradation trend of the Lower Yellow River which, in the last decades, has become a perched river. The numerical simulation specifically reproduces the silt-flush effects in a reach of LYR located in the meandering part of the river. This reach (around 100 km) is delimited by Aishan and Luokou hydrometric stations. Since the SVRD formulation has been developed from flume observations, the law has first been confronted to river datasets. The confrontation has revealed that the SVRD law becomes less suitable for fine sediment fluxes (ratio of water depth over median particle size > 5000). Therefore, a modified equation SVRD- 2 has been built to enlarge the validity range. The suitability of the SVRD- 2 equation to predict fine sediment fluxes has been tested on data available from several hydrometric stations located in the meandering reach of the LYR: historical observations and measures collected during the flushes. The SVRD- 2 has also been compared with relations specifically calibrated for this configuration. The comparison has pointed out that the performance of the two formulas is similar, which is encouraging for the SVRD- 2 approach as it has not been calibrated on those data. The closed equation system has been written on its quasi-linear form and is solved by a Finite Volume Method combined with a linearized Riemann algorithm. The numerical model has been checked up on two test cases: deposition upstream of a dam and the aggradation experiment conducted by Soni 1975. As it is not yet possible to predict dynamically the value of the control factor m, a possible solution would be to extract its value from the measured data at the inlet cross section. Unfortunately, the necessary data are not measured locally. Moreover, a uniform value of the control factor m may not suffice to reproduce the flow along the whole reach. Therefore, it has been proposed to work temporarily in the reverse way. From the comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data, a time evolution of the control factor m has effectively been extracted and {{it has been shown that}} it varies along the reach. At Aishan, the evolution of the control factor m corresponds to the evolution expected from the data analysis previously conducted on other data sets: the value of the control factor m decreases during the flush as it tries to reach the optimal value m= 1. The time evolution at Luokou behaves differently to the one at Aishan, but remains in agreement with m evolution patterns observed historically for the river section flowing round Jinan City walls. For Luokou, the highlighted differences may come from three dimensional effects coming from the meander bend upstream the station. Generally, the results obtained for the hydraulics, the sediment transport and bed adaptation are encouraging but still need improvements and additional feeding from the experimental data. The results for the concentration and therefore the bed elevation are very sensitive to the value of the control factor m as it influences most of the terms of the <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> <b>load</b> equation (SVRD- 2). The major remaining difficulties are, firstly, to deal with the rapid transients for which the model is less suitable and, secondly, to improve the prediction of the value of control factor m. Before paying more attention into the transients, enhancements concerning the flow along the reach (initial condition and discharge rates during the first days of the flush) must be conducted in priority. Indeed as the prediction of the bed or the cross section evolutions depend directly on the quality of the prediction of the sediment concentration and the hydraulics, one should first improve these aspects. To perform this study, more information about the water levels or sediment concentrations is necessary at some intermediate stations. One solution is to lengthen the studied reach, upstream to Sunkou and downstream to Lijin, totaling a river length of 456 Km. A more entire signal of the energy slopes and the associated bed configurations at different stations would enlighten how the control factor m evolves along the reach during the silt-flush events.

40|$|Incubating salmonid eggs in streambeds {{are often}} {{threatened}} by deposition of fine sediment within the gravel. To relate sedimentation of spawning gravel beds to sediment transport, infiltration of fine sediment (< 2 mm in diameter) into clean gravel <b>beds,</b> <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> size distributions, scour-fill depths, and sediment transport during 10 storm flow events were measured in three streams of north coastal California. Although suspended sediment comprised most (75 - 94 %) of the clastic load during storm flows, <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>material</b> (0. 25 - 2 mm) accounted for most (70 - 78 %) {{of the fine}} sediment accumulated in experimental gravel implanted in the streambeds. Sand trapped in the interstices of the top several centimeters formed a seal that impeded deeper deposition of very fine sand and finer material. The seal was responsible {{at least in part}} for a decrease in the rate of fine-sediment accumulation with increasing cumulative bed load transport. Areas of the streambeds commonly scoured or filled 0. 1 m or more during storm flows, and thus scour and fill commonly created a sandy layer at least as thick as the seal formed by sediment infiltration. Scour could erode eggs laid in the bed and expose deeper levels of the bed to infiltration by fine sediment, {{but at the same time}} could allow fine sediment to be winnowed away. Great temporal and spatial variation in sedimentation in these streams suggests that individual storms of moderate size pose a threat to eggs in many but not all areas selected by fish for spawning...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} IHD {{researches}} of the Lake Biwa area, it {{is intended}} to investigate theinteraction between the hydrologic cycle and the geomorphologic processes such as weath-ering, denudation of slopes, and channel processes in small mountaineous watersheds. At first, four month's observation on the yield of water, dissolved matter, and sedimentsfrom the experimental basin in weathered granite region of the Daido River area wascarried out from the summer to the autumn of 1967. The runoff water from the basin involves small amounts of ~~and UC 05 ions, which suggests that the chemical weathering processes are less significant than themechanical ones. The base flow is of good durability, and is attributable to the storagein the sand deposit in the tributary valleys due to its similarity in water quality to thesurface runoff water. Soil conservation practice was carried out in the autumn of 1966, and little sand wassupplied from the bare mountain slopes. The <b>bed</b> <b>load</b> <b>material</b> deposited at the gaugingstation is attributable to the erosion of the sand deposit in the valleys...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work was to evaluate differences in agglomeration characteristics between commercially available alternative <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> and quartz-based <b>bed</b> <b>materials,</b> commonly used in fluidised bed combustion. Pure quartz <b>bed</b> <b>materials.</b> Magnesium oxide and foundry sand (natural sand with a clay coating) were used as alternative bed aterials. Carefully controlled bench-scale fluidised bed agglomeration experiments were performed, using calcium-rich bark and potassium-rich olive residue as model fuels with significantly different ash compositions, typical for forestry and griculture residues respectively. The resulting <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> particles and agglomerates were analysed with SEM/EDS. Analysis of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> and agglomerates suggested that Mg and Al in the <b>bed</b> <b>materials</b> affect the agglomeration temperature positively for calcium-rich fuels. Al-rich foundry sand was found to decrease the agglomeration temperature in (Si, K) -rich systems. For combustion of olive residue in MgO bed, no attack layer was formed and agglomeration probably occurred via direct adhesion by partly melted alkali-silicates. The {{results suggest that the}} choice of <b>bed</b> <b>material</b> should take the intended fuel use into consideration. Upprättat; 2005; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20080101 (ohmmar...|$|R
