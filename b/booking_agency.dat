25|$|After Paco Alonso {{chose to}} ignore Peña's booking ideas, Peña began {{negotiations}} with Televisa television channel to fund a new wrestling promotion that would provide Televisa with weekly wrestling shows. In 1992 Peña started a <b>booking</b> <b>agency,</b> providing wrestlers and matches for the Televisa owned Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) promotion. While Peña technically owned the promotion Televisa owns {{the rights to the}} AAA name. In a move that mirrored Flores' departure in the 1970s Peña left the promotion alongside a number of young wrestlers who were unhappy with their position in the promotion. With the creation of AAA the promotion replaced the UWA as Mexico's other main wrestling promotion, creating a long running rivalry between CMLL and AAA. Starting in 1996 CMLL began promoting an annual show in March, first paying homage to Salvador Lutteroth, then later Lutteroth and El Santo and then finally becoming the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas ("Homage to Two Legends") annual show series.|$|E
25|$|On June 4, 2015, Nichols' <b>booking</b> <b>agency</b> {{announced}} that she had suffered a mild stroke at her Los Angeles home and had been admitted to a Los Angeles-area hospital. This was barely {{three months after the}} death of her friend and Star Trek co-star Leonard Nimoy. Doctors were conducting tests to determine the severity of the stroke. Nichols was reportedly awake and resting comfortably. An online news article by Frazier Moore of the Associated Press, which cited news updates from the actress's Facebook page, stated that, four days afterward, the hospitalized actress was feeling much better and was improving, remaining cheerful and alert and taking the time to read the messages from fans and well-wishers on her Facebook page, of which there were many. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan did reveal a small stroke but she was able to begin inpatient therapy on June 5, 2015, for rehabilitation and recovery and to further evaluate her condition and determine the prognosis. Her fellow Star Trek actor George Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu, wished her well on his Twitter account page.|$|E
500|$|During this time, Jennings rented an {{apartment}} in Nashville with singer Johnny Cash. Jennings and Cash were both managed by [...] "Lucky" [...] Moeller's <b>booking</b> <b>agency</b> Moeller Talent, Inc. The tours organized by the agency were unproductive, with the artists being booked to venues located far {{from each other in}} close dates. After paying for the accommodation and travel expenditures, Jennings's profits were reduced, with him frequently requesting advances from the agency or RCA Records to play the next venue. While playing 300 days on the road, Jennings's debt increased along with his consumption of amphetamines, as he believed himself to be trapped on the circuit.|$|E
50|$|A key {{and popular}} feature of Juke Magazine was its {{extensive}} gig guide (particularly of Melbourne's music scene), which attracted {{a lot of}} attention by bands, <b>booking</b> <b>agencies</b> and venues.

500|$|King {{later said}} that while the idea of playing Reign in Blood in its {{entirety}} was suggested before by their <b>booking</b> <b>agency,</b> it was met with little support. The band ultimately decided they needed to add more excitement to their live shows, and to avoid repetition incorporated the ideas of raining blood. When asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked: [...] "It's time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan never saw it, South America and Australia never saw it. So you never know." [...] In 2008 the band performed Reign in Blood in its entirety once again, this time in Paris, France, during the third European Unholy Alliance Tour.|$|E
500|$|Simon & Garfunkel first burst {{onto the}} {{national}} scene when their hit single [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] made waves on radio in 1965, during {{a period in which}} the duo had broken up due to the failure of their debut release, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. (1964). Following another release, Sounds of Silence (1965), the duo recorded and released Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme (1966), which brought new critical and commercial success to the duo. Simon, then 25, felt he had finally [...] "made it" [...] into an upper echelon of rock and roll, while most importantly retaining artistic integrity ("making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin", wrote biographer Marc Eliot). The duo chose William Morris as their <b>booking</b> <b>agency</b> after a recommendation from Wally Amos, a mutual friend through their producer, Tom Wilson.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Ministry of Sound {{released}} Northern Exposure 2, Sasha and Digweed's next double-CD {{entry in}} their Northern Exposure series.

[...] After extensive touring, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City's famous Twilo nightclub, where they would DJ for the entire night. [...] In 1998, the two released separate mix albums on the Boxed label, as part of the Global Underground series: Digweed's , and Sasha's , which drew from his experience touring on the West Coast of the United States. Both DJs formed their own record labels that year: Sasha created Excession Records and Digweed started Bedrock Records. Excession released fewer than ten records, the last in 1998; the experience, however, led Sasha to found the management agency [...] "Excession: The Agency LTD." [...] Excession remains a <b>booking</b> <b>agency</b> for many DJs, including Hybrid, Nick Warren, and Steve Lawler.|$|E

500|$|The band {{soon had}} a manager, Rick DeVoe, who {{associated}} with larger bands such as NOFX, Pennywise and The Offspring. In addition, the band crucially {{drew the attention}} of Rick and Jean Bonde of the Tahoe <b>booking</b> <b>agency,</b> who were responsible for [...] "spreading {{the name of the}} band far and wide and getting the group as many gigs as humanly possible." [...] Surf film director Taylor Steele, friend of DeVoe, was preparing a national tour to promote his new surf video GoodTimes, and the band signed on for its first national tour, which extended as far as the East Coast. The band members purchased their own tour van and embarked on the GoodTimes tour with Unwritten Law, Sprung Monkey and 7 Seconds. The GoodTimes tour continued and the band was whisked away to Australia, with Pennywise paying for the band's plane tickets. Fletcher Dragge, guitarist of Pennywise, believed in the band strongly. He demanded Kevin Lyman, founder of the Warped Tour, sign the band for the 1996 festival, telling him that [...] "they're gonna be gigantic." [...] Australia was very receptive to the band and its humorous stage shows and pranks gained them a reputation, but also made them ostracized and considered a joke.|$|E
500|$|As they {{considered}} their previous effort a [...] "rush job" [...] {{to capitalize on}} their sudden success, the duo spent more time crafting the follow-up. It {{was the first time}} Simon insisted on total control in aspects of recording. Work began in 1966 and took nine months. [...] Garfunkel considered the recording of [...] "Scarborough Fair" [...] to be the point at which they stepped into the role of producer, as they were constantly beside engineer Roy Halee mixing the track. Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme was issued in October 1966, following the release of several singles and receiving sold-out college campus shows. The duo resumed their trek on the college circuit eleven days following the release, crafting an image that was described as [...] "alienated", [...] "weird", and [...] "poetic". Manager Mort Lewis also was responsible for this public perception, as he withheld them from television appearances (unless they were allowed to play an uninterrupted set or choose the setlist). Simon, then 26, felt he had finally [...] "made it" [...] into an upper echelon of rock and roll, while most importantly retaining artistic integrity ("making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin", wrote biographer Marc Eliot). The duo chose William Morris as their <b>booking</b> <b>agency</b> after a recommendation from Wally Amos, a mutual friend through their producer Tom Wilson.|$|E

5000|$|After much {{successful}} touring of the United States, Crash Worship {{followed suit}} with two full European tours in the mid-90s.

It was during this time that the band played at Myrtle Beach in South Carolina {{and several of the}} North Carolina beach resorts.|$|R
50|$|With the {{location}} established {{the next logical}} step was for Core Tex to integrate further with the punk scene. A number of punk <b>booking</b> <b>agencies</b> such as M.A.D., Destiny and Mutti's have their offices in Kreuzberg. As a result, touring bands would frequently have days off in Berlin. Core Tex provided music and beer under one roof and this attracted bands such as Agnostic Front, Sick Of It All and Ignite making frequent visits to the shop whilst on tour.|$|R
