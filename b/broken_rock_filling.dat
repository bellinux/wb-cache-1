It is {{of great}} {{significance}} to select the reasonable support pattern and support parameters for accurately determining {{the magnitude of the}} <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> zone of roadway. At present, the test methods of the <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> zone of the roadway surrounding rock all have stated disfigurements and deficiency. The borehole imaging method has advantages: simple operation and the test results being intuitive and reliable. The test results and analysis of the <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> zone of rail crossheading in 3 down 109 coal face of Luxi Coal Mine show that the test results consistent well with the actual situation and they have practical reference value for the test and application of the <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> zone of the roadway surrounding rock...|$|R

40|$|To {{estimate}} postgrouting rock mass strength {{growth is}} important for engineering design. In this paper, using self-developed indoor pressure-grouting devices, 19 groups of test cubic blocks were made of the different water cement ratio grouting into the <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> of three kinds of particle sizes. The shear strength parameters of each group under different conditions were tested. Then this paper presents a quantitative calculation method for predicting the strength growth of grouted <b>broken</b> <b>rock.</b> Relational equations were developed to investigate {{the relationship between the}} growth rates of uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), absolute value of uniaxial tensile strength (AUTS), internal friction angle, and cohesion for post- to pregrouting <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> based on Mohr-Coulomb strength criterion. From previous test data, the empirical equation between the growth rate of UCS and the ratio of the initial rock mass UCS to the grout concretion UCS has been determined. The equations of the growth rates of the internal friction coefficient and UCS for grouting <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> with rock mass rating (RMR) and its increment have been established. The calculated results are consistent with the experimental results. These observations are important for engineered design of grouting reinforcement for <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> mass...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>fills</b> {{that hit}} the seabed will remold the {{underlying}} material. If this material is a clay with sufficiently low shear strength, it will adopt rheological properties, causing flow through the <b>rock</b> <b>fill,</b> and contributing to the initial settlements of the <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> in addition to conventional consolidation theory. The settlements of the rocks depend upon {{the height of the}} <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> and how the rocks have been laid out. This is due to the viscosity of the clay, and the fact that clay is thixotropic. Thixotropy causes the viscosity to increase with decreased shear rate. The settlements finally come to a stop due to frictional forces from the surface area of the rocks. Clay is a non-newtonian Bingham fluid and will have a laminar flow through the <b>rock</b> <b>fill.</b> The Kozeny-Carman model is the most appropriate model for determining the permeability with laminar fluid flow through porous media. A clay with water content 52 % and shear strength 0, 35 kPa had a viscosity in a viscometer of $eta$ = 7, 8 Pas. Comparing theoretical and experimental results for immediate and layered loading of the <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> showed clay viscosities of 7 Pas and 40 Pas respectively. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{influencing}} factors of grouting diffusion in <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> mass {{were divided into}} four classifications: grouting pressure, grouting time, permeability coefficient and grout viscosity. Relations among similar factors were expressed to each other using an equation. Empirical formulas of relations among grout water-cement ratio, viscosity and time between the joint density of <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> mass and permeability coefficient, and between water absorption and permeability coefficient were established. The differences among the four diffusion radius formulas grouting in porous continuous media were compared. A new empirical formula of diffusion radius was obtained using multivariate nonlinear fitting analysis based on the mean value of the four empirical formulas. The tests of grouting diffusion in <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> mass were done in the field. The mean empirical formula {{is consistent with the}} measured value of the field tests on grouting diffusion radius, which provide a reference for the design of grouting into <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> mass...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Energy {{dissipation}} {{behind the}} hydraulic {{structure of a}} mobile dam was experimentally studied {{with the aid of}} Laser-Doppler Anemometry (LDA), aiming to optimize the design and length of the dissipation devices, most commonly a stilling basin followed by <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> alluvial bed protection. Measurements of the flow field over the rock protection were carried out in order to prevent damages at the foundations of the structure as well as to protect the river bed from erosion, namely due to operational reasons. The characterisation of mean velocity and turbulence intensities were carried out for different flow conditions and different <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> characteristic dimensions, using a physical model of the Crestuma dam, located in the Douro river. The obtained results (namely values of bottom shear stress) provide a better insight of the <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> protection behaviour and can help to achieve a cheaper and safer design of the <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> protection. 1...|$|R

40|$|In the {{underground}} engineering, the long-term {{stability of the}} surrounding <b>rocks</b> (especially the <b>broken</b> <b>rocks</b> containing water) and the ground settlement resulted from the seepage-creep coupling above goaf have been the important research subjects concerning the deep mining. For the <b>broken</b> <b>rock,</b> its porosity is an important structural parameter determining its creep properties, and the porosity change rate is more superior to describe the creep characteristics compared with the strain change rate at a certain direction. In this paper, MTS 815. 02 Rock Mechanics Test System is used {{to carry out the}} creep experiments on water-saturated broken limestone, and then the time curves of porosity and of the porosity change rate are obtained. By regression, we have got the relation equation between the porosity change rate with the instant porosity and the stress level during the creep. The study indicates that when the stress retains a constant level, the relation between the porosity change rate and the instant porosity can be fitted with a cubical polynomial. The obtained creep relation equation between the porosity change rate and the instant porosity and the instant stress provides a necessary state equation for studying the coupling between the seepage and the creep of the <b>broken</b> <b>rock.</b> Furthermore, the seepage in the <b>broken</b> <b>rock</b> has been verified to satisfy the Forchheimer’s non-Darcy flow according to our previous studies, and its seepage properties, k, β and ca can all be expressed respectively as the polynomial of the porosity, so, by combining with these three state equations we have obtained the four essential state equations for solving the coupling problems of the seepage and the creep for the <b>broken</b> <b>rocks...</b>|$|R

The main purpose of this work is to determine in the laboratory the strength of Bremanger <b>rock</b> <b>fills</b> under low stress. Tests are conducted on <b>rock</b> <b>fills</b> with a finer particle size distribution than that used at MV 2. Results obtained cannot be directly used {{in the design of}} MV 2 project. The influence of the testing equipment, for a given ratio of the equipment size to the particle size, of the degree of compaction and of the particle strength on the strength of the Bremanger <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> are investigated. The effect of the test boundary conditions is researched by conducting tests with a triaxial cell apparatus, medium and small scale shear boxes and a tilt apparatus. The movement of particles was also studied during medium scale shear box testing to get a better insight into this effect. Emphasis is put on determining the contribution of dilatancy to the shear resistance of the Bremanger sandstone <b>rock</b> <b>fills</b> with respect to the contribution to resistance to rolling of particles. For this purpose, dilatancy is measured during testing and the basic friction angle of the Bremanger <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> is determined on sandblasted rock discontinuities with a Golder shear box. The basic friction angle controls the resistance to rotation of smooth particles. Test results are fitted using empirical models.
