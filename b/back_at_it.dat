On June 15, 2011, Parker and Stone appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where they denied being unhappy with the show and stated that they still enjoy producing episodes. Parker commented that, while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show, they particularly enjoyed creating [...] "You're Getting Old", and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about, they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011. [...] "Looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> it kinda does look like we’re kinda saying we don't {{want to do this}} anymore, but it's not really what we were saying," [...] said Parker in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|The {{first thing}} Fuse and his art team {{had to do}} was {{figuring}} out how to create 3D models that preserve {{the look and feel of}} the previous games' 2D sprites, even when viewed in stereoscopic 3D. Some of the artists on the team created a concept trailer for how the game's visuals would work, featuring a 3D model of Phoenix. Looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> Fuse called the model [...] "cringe-worthy", but it was able to be used as a base. Everyone on the development team gave feedback on the model, and it was continuously refined until everyone was satisfied with its look; this process alone took six months. The art team also wanted to preserve the [...] "lively" [...] style of animation used in the 2D sprites. To do this, they used [...] "various tricks" [...] such as using different character models for different angles. They also took advantage of the increased capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS hardware, and added camera movements and connecting animations to give the character animation further fluidity.|$|E

When I look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. Somehow, I was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E

The I.G.Y. was an {{international}} scientific project promoting collaboration among the world's scientists. Fagen's lyrics reference, {{from the point of}} view of that time, an optimistic vision of futuristic concepts such as solar-powered cities, a transatlantic tunnel, permanent space stations, and spandex jackets. Fagen remembered being enchanted by the prospects of a [...] "gleaming future," [...] and hoped to give an optimistic look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "Green Flower Street" [...] is a [...] "nod to the jazz standard On Green Dolphin Street." [...] "Ruby Baby" [...] is modeled after the Drifters' version of the song. For his rewrite of [...] "Ruby Baby", he listened to several records from the 1950s to [...] "get a general atmosphere of the period." [...] "Maxine" [...] references the harmonies of the Four Freshmen, and revolves around an [...] "extremely idealized version of high-school romance." [...] The tune was created from an unrelated drum track played by Ed Greene. Fagen felt that drum track was not working for that particular song, but was so taken with it he wrote a new song around it, which became [...] "Maxine".|$|E

[...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they were here to do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it is for you to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E

Although the show was the most-watched program on Showtime, it received almost no media mention outside hard-core science fiction circles in its first seasons. Stargate SG-1 gained media attention when Stargate Atlantis was greenlit (the cover of the July 26, 2003 TV Guide issue notably called to [...] "Forget Trek!
