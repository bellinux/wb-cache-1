This article reviews the mechanism's performance in the region and highlights current developments. The analysis is based on a quantitative <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> provided by the United Nations Environment Programme and Technical University of Denmark (UNEP/DTU) CDM Pipeline and was complemented by interviews with selected investors. The findings indicate that despite the various support measures for underrepresented regions, the overall share of African CDM activities continues to be low. The significant rise in the share of Programmes of Activities of recent years cannot make up for the continuing low numbers of African stand-alone projects. Further, the collapse of the compliance market has proved fatal in terms of timing: ongoing efforts to support the development of a genuine African carbon market were suffocated by the lack of demand for Certified Emission Reductions at a moment when capacity building had started to bear fruit. Consequently, instead of being a mitigation tool with significant scale, the future role of the CDM in Africa might be limited to the voluntary market, {{while at the same time}} serving as a tool to foster sustainable development, with mitigation benefits...|$|E

These youth were shot in different ways by varying intents [...] some were murdered, some unintentionally shot themselves or were unintentionally shot by another, and others died by their own hand. All were tragic and should lead to public outcry about the continuous threat gun violence poses to our nation's youth. This report provides a detailed <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> on children and guns, including 2011 fatal injury, nonfatal injury, and violent death data, {{as well as other}} relevant studies. We analyzed the 2, 703 youth firearm deaths and 16, 700 youth firearm injuries, detailing trends, as well as where and how these shootings occurred. This is a public health crisis. These deaths are preventable. Most parents bring a gun into the home legally with no intent of doing harm. Many think they're doing their family a service by offering protection. Yet it is these guns that cause the majority of gun deaths and injuries. A gun in the home is a significant risk factor for homicide, suicide, and unintentional shootings. The firearm is much more likely to harm a family member, such as a child or teen, than to help prevent or deter a crime. Ultimately, where there are more guns, there are more gun deaths. We at Brady are working hard to reduce gun death and injury. The first step toward solving this public health crisis is understanding the problem [...] where, how, and why these deaths and injuries occur. This report provides that overview...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Classical {{inventory}} models offer {{a variety}} of insights into the optimal way to manage inventories of individual products. However, top managers and industry analysts are often concerned with the aggregate macroscopic view of a firm’s inventory rather than with the inventories of individual products. Given that classical inventory models often do not account for many practical considerations that a company’s management faces (e. g., competition, industry dynamics, business cycles, the financial state of the company and of the economy, etc.) and that they are derived at the product and not at the firm level, can insights from these models be used to explain the inventory dynamics of entire companies? This exploratory study aims to address this issue using empirical data. We analyze absolute and relative inventories using a quarterly data panel that contains 722 public US companies for the period 1992 to 2002. We have chosen companies that are not widely diversified and whose business in large part relies on inventory management in order to concentrate on empirically testing hypotheses derived from a variety of classical inventory models (EOQ, (Q,r), newsvendor, periodic review, etc.). We find empirical evidence that firms operating with more uncertain demand, longer lead times and higher gross margins have higher inventory levels. Furthermore, larger companies appear to benefit from economies of scale and therefore have relatively less inventory than smaller companies. We obtain mixed evidence on the relationship between inventory levels and inventory holding costs. We also analyze the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> into eight segments—oil and gas, electronics, wholesale, retail, machinery, hardware, food and chemicals—and find that, with a few notable exceptions, our hypotheses are supported within the segments as well.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{foresight}} and planning that has established a logical data model (i. e., the Master Model), a set of standard reference tables and 17 migration software systems {{as the foundation of}} a disciplined Corporate Data Environment (CDE), USTRANSCOM now finds itself in the enviable position of being able to implement DoD’s vision of a Global Information Grid (GIG) with speed and confidence. The urgency with which DoD views the need to shift the burden of tedious data filtering and interpretation tasks from human operators to automated machine-based processes, is reflected in the CDE and provides the opportunity for USTRANSCOM to take a leading role in implementing the GIG vision. USTRANSCOM is inundated with an overwhelming volume of data from a proliferation of heterogeneous internal and external sources. While virtually all of these data are captured and stored electronically, they are largely devoid of context and therefore have to be interpreted and transformed into useful information by human operators, planners and decision makers. The penalties associated with such a human-intensive data-centric environment include data bottlenecks, aged data, <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> exchange interfaces, and the inability to accurately interpret and analyze data within time-critical constraints. This places USTRANSCOM in a reactive mode, and forces the expenditure of valuable resources on treating symptoms rather than addressing the core problem. The report outlines a blueprint for extending USTRANSCOM’s existing Corporate Data Environment (CDE) to an information-centric knowledge management environment that provides a vehicle for making information and knowledge explicit and accessible throughout the organization. The Corporate Information-Centric Environment (CICE) architecture is proposed as a core solution to support: (1) the automatic filtering of data by placing data into information context; (2) the automated reasoning of software agents as they monitor events and assist human users in planning, replanning and decision-making tasks; and, (3) autonomic computing capabilities that allow systems to monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot themselves. The principal objective of CICE is to shift the burden of lower level data interpretation, filtering, and context building, from human operators to automated software-based processes...|$|E

The AMR meters using advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) identifies the voltage problems (voltage imbalance, outage, and power quality) and generates alarm signals for the operation centre based on threshold voltages. The aim of this thesis to write the use cases, map them into smart grid architecture model (SGAM) and analyze the benefits of use cases. The use cases of outage management and power quality are explained in this thesis. The use case is useful to understand the activities involved in low voltage monitoring process. The use case defines the steps or interaction of actors (smart meters, distribution system operator), and information systems (at control centre) with respect to requirements in different scenarios. The use cases reveal the process between actors and systems for sending alarms from smart meters to operation centre and how this information is applied for managing those problems. To provide the graphical structure or visual representation of the use cases, they are mapped into SGAM) which is three dimensional model comprised of zone, domain and interoperability layers.

Following a review of the works of economists such as Marshall (1890), Perroux (1950, 1970), Myrdal (1957), Hirschman (1958; 1970) and Krugman (1980), geographers such as Saxenian (1994), Cooke and Morgan (1998), Garofoli (1992), Darwent (1969), Scott (1988) and Storper (1997), industrial district exponents such as Piore and Sabel (1984), Sabel (1989), Sengenberger and Pyke (1988), Hirst and Zeitlin (1991), Brusco (1986), Wilkinson and You (1995), Rasiah (1994) and Becatini (1992) and subsequently business exponents such as Porter (1990) and Best (2001) and evolutionary economists such as Nelson and Winter (1982), Freeman (1986), Lundvall (1988; 1992), Dosi (1982), Pavitt (1984), Kim (1997) and Edquist (2004) the paper constructs a stylized model for evaluating the development of learning and innovation synergies in Penang and Johor. Four policy pillars that require simultaneous coordination are identified in the systemic quad as the basis for promoting systemically technological and productivity synergies. The four pillars are: one, basic infrastructure to provide systemic stability and efficiency; two, high tech infrastructure to provide systemic support for participation in learning and innovation; three, network cohesion to provide the systemic price, technological and social relationships necessary to drive interactive and interdependent coordination; and four, integration in global markets and value chains to provide the scale, scope and competition to drive learning and innovation.
