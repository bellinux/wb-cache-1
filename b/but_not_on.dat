5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} distinction that masculine bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the gender of authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E

The offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected at the same time <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|About 2.5million {{people lived}} in the Willamette River basin as of 2010, about 65percent of the {{population}} of Oregon. As of 2009, the basin contained 20 of the 25 most populous cities in Oregon. These cities include Springfield, Eugene, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, Keizer, Newberg, Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, Lake Oswego, and Portland. The largest is Portland, with more than 500,000 residents. Not all of these cities draw water directly from the Willamette for their municipal water supply. Other cities in the watershed (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the main-stem river) with populations of 20,000 or more are Gresham, Hillsboro, Beaverton, Tigard, McMinnville, Tualatin, Woodburn, and Forest Grove.|$|E
5|$|Although Calvatia craniiformis is {{generally}} considered a saprobic species, in controlled laboratory conditions, an ectomycorrhizae between the fungus and American sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) was reported in a 1966 publication. A Chinese study showed that C.craniifromis would readily form mycorrhiza with poplar seedlings on unsterilized, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> sterilized soil. Later research was unable to establish any similar association between C.craniiformis and Pinus ponderosa. Brain puffballs grow singly or in groups in fields and open woods, hardwood forests, and wet areas. In Asia, it has been recorded from China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea. The brain puffball has been recorded from Australia. In North America, its range includes the eastern and southern United States, and Mexico. In Michigan, {{it is one of}} the few macrofungi found regularly in black locust plantations. Fruit bodies serve as a food source for several species of flies.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that provides protection against {{different types of}} malicious software such as computer viruses, spyware, rootkits and Trojan horses.

5|$|Most of {{the artists}} conferred in New York and responded in a joint letter {{that they would be}} willing to participate, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the terms set. They {{proposed}} a competition with set fees for sketches and designs submitted by the invited artists, to be judged by a jury of their peers, and with the Mint committed to replace the Seated Liberty coins with the result. They also insisted that the same artist create both sides of a given coin, and that more time be given to allow the development of designs. Leech was unable to meet these terms, as there was only enough money available for the single prize. In addition to inviting the ten artists, he had sent thousands of solicitations through the country; a number of designs were submitted in response to the circulars. To judge the submissions, he appointed a jury consisting of Saint-Gaudens, Barber, and Henry Mitchell, a Boston seal engraver and member of the 1890 Assay Commission. The committee met in June 1891 and quickly rejected all entries.|$|E
5|$|The British South Africa Company had {{reservations}} about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's {{resources to the}} war effort, {{in part because of}} its desire to keep the colonial economy operating. There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> the same scale as in Britain. The retail sector suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose sharply, and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's economic viability hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal ferrochrome. A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal, tungsten, near Essexvale in southern Matabeleland in May 1917.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Post Office {{has never}} publicised an {{official}} stamp numbering {{system for the}} postage stamps they issued, so collectors use a stamp numbering system {{from one of the}} most popular stamp catalogues, such as Stanley Gibbons, Scott, MacDonnell Whyte, MDW (last edition 1991), Hibernian or Michel. There are differences between these numbering systems that result in a varying sequence of stamps in each listing, with some stamps included on some lists <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> othersâ€”usually varieties that the publishers think do not belong in a general catalogue. For instance, Ireland's first postage stamp, the 2d Map of Ireland, issued in 1922 is numbered 68 by Scott, 43 by Michel, D4 by Hibernian and MacDonnell Whyte and 74 by Stanley Gibbons.|$|E

5|$|The main rock {{formations}} {{in the area}} of West Branch Fishing Creek are the Catskill Formation, the Huntley Mountain Formation, and the Burgoon Sandstone. These formations are all primarily made of sandstone, but also contain conglomerate, shale, and siltstone. They were formed during the Devonian, Mississippian and Devonian, and the Mississippian, respectively. The Catskill Formation is mostly found in the lower and middle reaches of the watershed, along the creek and its tributaries. The Huntley Mountain Formation is found in {{the upper reaches of the}} watershed and on some of the streams in that part of the watershed. The Burgoon Sandstone is found in the watershed, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> many of its streams.|$|E
5|$|There was a Royal Flying Corps {{airfield}} at Saint-Inglevert {{during the}} First World War, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> {{the site of}} the current airfield.

From 29 June to 23 October, No. 214 Squadron RAF were based there flying Handley Page O/400s, and in November, they were replaced by No. 115 Squadron RAF, who were flying the same type of aircraft. Two more squadrons, No. 97 Squadron RAF and No. 100 Squadron RAF, were based there from 17 November, to be joined by two squadrons of the United States Navy in 1918, flying Sopwith Camels. All Royal Air Force squadrons departed from Saint-Inglevert on 4 March 1919.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a {{professional}} footballer and for years afterwards, Ramsey claimed to be two years younger than he really was â€” including in his ghosted autobiography, Talking Football, published in 1952. This began when Ramsey first turned professional with Southampton during the Second World War. He told Southampton he was born in 1922 rather than 1920, reasoning that this might improve his career prospects and compensate for the years he had lost to the hostilities. He propagated this false age for over two decades, in press articles, his autobiography and Who's Who â€” <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> official documents such as his marriage papers, in which he listed his true date of birth. Only after his knighthood in 1967 did Ramsey reveal his true age, deciding that he could not lie to Debrett's, publisher of Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage.|$|E
