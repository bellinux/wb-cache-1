40|$|Excimer laser surface {{treatment}} of aluminium alloy 6013 -T 651 {{was conducted with}} the aim of improving the intergranular corrosion resistance of the alloy. Laser {{surface treatment}} was performed under two different gas environments: air and nitrogen. The microstructure, phase, and composition of the modified surface structure were analysed using TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and EDX; the electrochemical and the intergranular corrosion cracking behaviours of the untreated and the laser treated specimens were evaluated by electrochemical polarisation test and immersion test respectively. Excimer laser surface treatment significantly increased the pitting potential and the intergranular corrosion resistance of the alloy, especially when the material was treated in nitrogen gas. A reduction in corrosion current density of three orders of magnitude was obtained for the N 2 treated material. The improvement is considered to be primarily owing to the reduction of large harmful intermetallics within the grains and the absence of precipitate free zones and Al-Cu-Si <b>bearing</b> <b>needle</b> like precipitates at the grain boundaries. The superior corrosion resistance of the N 2 treated material is attributed to the presence of the chemically stable AlN phase in the surface. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|A <b>needle</b> roller <b>bearing</b> is {{a bearing}} which uses small {{cylindrical}} rollers. Bearings {{are used to}} reduce friction of any rotating surface. <b>Needle</b> <b>bearings</b> have a large surface {{in contact with the}} bearing outer surfaces as compared to ball bearings. There is less added clearance(Diameter of the shaft and the diameter of the bearing are different) so they are much compact. The structure consists of a needle cage which contains the needle rollersthemselves and an outer race (The housing itself). Radial bearings are cylindrical and they use rollers parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial pattern of needle are being used by thrust <b>needles.</b> Complement <b>bearings</b> have solid inner as well as outer rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. The bearings have the largest number of rolling elements and also have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for compact designs. <b>Needle</b> roller <b>bearings</b> have relatively small diameter cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger than their diameter. As compared to other types of rolling <b>bearings,</b> <b>needle</b> roller <b>bearings</b> possess a small cross-sectional height and significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to their volume. Also, because the inertial force acting on them is limited, <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> are an ideal choice for applications with oscillating motion. These bearings also work well in compact and lightweight machine designs and they serve as a ready replacement for sliding <b>bearings.</b> <b>Needle</b> <b>bearings</b> features are great rigidity, smaller cross-section, higher loadcarrying capacity, and has lower inertia forces that facilitate to size and weight reductions in machinery. <b>Needle</b> <b>bearings</b> are designed to stand in oscillation, performwell under any conditions, and interchange with the sliding of bearings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Condition {{monitoring}} of dynamic systems based on oil analysis {{is well known}} for closed-loop systems. The motivation for this work stemmed from repeating failures of Wankel engines. Failure analysis identified contact fatigue as the failure mechanism, but could not identify the cause. Thus, the objective of the work was to develop a method for condition {{monitoring of}} open-loop oil systems. A variety of analytical techniques was evaluated, including directreading ferrography, analytical ferrography combined with computational image analysis, atomic emission spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Procedures for collection and separation of oil samples were developed. Analytical ferrography was found most useful in condition monitoring. Six engines were detected in their early failure stage. Those engines were disassembled, and contact fatigue failures in the <b>bearing</b> <b>needles</b> were observed. The quantitative image analysis allowed for a fairly objective rating of the wear level. The method developed in this work has already been implemented on a daily basis for monitoring the health of Wankel engines, with much success...|$|R

50|$|Stripped of its needle business, Torrington {{entered the}} 1980s as {{primarily}} a <b>bearing</b> manufacturer, with <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> accounting for 49 {{percent of the}} company's sales and heavy bearings contributing another 30 percent. After several years of corporate restructuring, Torrington became a considerably larger bearing manufacturer when the company acquired Fafnir Bearing Company in 1985. Formed, like Torrington, in Connecticut, Fafnir had evolved into a leading bearing producer from its origination in 1911, becoming by the mid-1980s a precision ball bearing manufacturer serving the aerospace, machine tool, industrial, and agricultural industries with distinction. When the two bearing producers were combined in 1985, adding Fafnir's seven manufacturing facilities to Torrington's already numerous manufacturing facilities, {{the result was the}} largest bearing manufacturing company in North America and {{one of the largest in}} the world, with total sales amounting to roughly $750 million.|$|R

40|$|The two-axis joint is a {{mechanical}} device that provides two-degrees-of-freedom motion between connected components. A compact, moment-resistant, two-axis joint {{is used to}} connect an electromechanical actuator to its driven structural members. Due {{to the requirements of}} the overall mechanism, the joint has a low profile to fit within the allowable space, low friction, and high moment-reacting capability. The mechanical arrangement of this joint can withstand high moments when loads are applied. These features allow the joint to be used in tight spaces where a high load capability is required, as well as in applications where penetrating the mounting surface is not an option or where surface mounting is required. The joint consists of one base, one clevis, one cap, two <b>needle</b> <b>bearings,</b> and a circular shim. The base of the joint is the housing (the base and the cap together), and is connected to the grounding structure via fasteners and a bolt pattern. Captive within the housing, between the base and the cap, are the rotating clevis and the <b>needle</b> <b>bearings.</b> The clevis is attached to the mechanical system (linear actuator) via a pin. This pin, and the rotational movement of the clevis with respect to the housing, provides two rotational degrees of freedom. The larger diameter flange of the clevis is sandwiched between a pair of <b>needle</b> <b>bearings,</b> one {{on each side of the}} flange. During the assembly of the two-axis joint, the circular shims are used to adjust the amount of preload that is applied to the <b>needle</b> <b>bearings.</b> The above arrangement enables the joint to handle high moments with minimal friction. To achieve the high-moment capability within a low-profile joint, the use of depth of engagement (like that of a conventional rotating shaft) to react moment is replaced with planar engagement parallel to the mounting surface. The <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> with the clevis flange provide the surface area to react the clevis loads/moments into the joint housing while providing minimal friction during rotation. The diameter of the flange and the bearings can be increased to react higher loads and still maintain a compact surface mounting capability. This type of joint can be used in a wide variety of mechanisms and mechanical systems. It is especially effective where precise, smooth, continuous motion is required. For example, the joint can be used at the end of a linear actuator that is required to extend and rotate simultaneously. The current design application is for use in a spacecraft docking-system capture mechanism. Other applications might include industrial robotic or assembly line apparatuses, positioning systems, or in the motion-based simulator industry that employs complex, multi-axis manipulators for various types of motions...|$|R

50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve <b>bearing</b> or <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R

40|$|This thesis work is an {{evaluation}} of journal bearings in manual transmissions in automobiles. Today both journal- and <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> can be positioned into the gearboxes {{and in order to}} reduce the power loss developed by friction when a relative angular velocity arises, the right type of bearing must be chosen. In order to succeed, this work is aimed to develop a Matlab simulation model, which should be used as a tool in the design process of manual transmissions. The program development is later supposed to be followed by real tests of journal bearings, partly to cover things that can not be covered in the model but also to confirm how well the model reflects the reality. The absence of resources resulted in no performed real test and therefore was a comparison between theoretical-  and practical results not possible. Here the plain journal bearings in full film lubrication will have an disadvantage compared to the <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> regarding the power lost. To reduce the drag below the values of the <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> a modified journal bearing in the area of boundary lubrication with a very low coefficient of friction may be an option. But problems with wear under this condition could most certainly be devastating and must be further investigated with real tests. Out of a efficiency point of view the most suitable bearing position is the gear in the most frequently used area. Here it is assumed to be the 4 th gear. A suitable journal bearing design should have a small sliding surface area in order to minimize the viscous drag. To achieve low friction the boundary lubricated area could be a good idea in cases when wear is not a critical factor. To longer the useful life nitrocarburizing is recommended, which both reduces wear and lower the coefficient of friction, in cases of asperites in contact. In order to work under the full film lubricated condition, with neglected wear, the sliding area needs to be large enough to create the required oil pressure...|$|R
