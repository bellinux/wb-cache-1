5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and <b>barking</b> at new stimuli can develop into a habit of <b>barking</b> excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized.

After working with the dog, Weatherwax gained control of the <b>barking</b> {{but was unable to}} break Pal of his motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave the dog to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave the dog to a friend, but when he learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was the dog to fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E

40|$|Thickness of the <b>bark</b> {{has serious}} {{influence}} on the round wood volume inside <b>bark,</b> if the diameter is measured over <b>bark.</b> The measured value of the <b>bark</b> thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible <b>bark</b> thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s <b>bark</b> thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding round wood volume differences, given by different <b>bark</b> thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of <b>bark</b> thickness measuring were realized: by using <b>bark</b> gauge, increment hammer and slide caliper. <b>Bark</b> gauge gives the highest <b>bark</b> thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %. Measuring by this method is very carefully to the <b>bark</b> and it gives the real values of {{the thickness of the}} undamaged <b>bark</b> layer. It is close to the results of electronic diameter measuring. Slide caliper give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. Slide caliper partly damages the surface layer of the <b>bark.</b> Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the <b>bark</b> thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface <b>bark</b> layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s <b>bark</b> thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce <b>bark</b> thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower round wood volume. It means, Peintingers tables correspond better with the measured values than with the Czech Standard. We can recommend the using of Peintinger’s table for deduction of spruce <b>bark</b> thickness in electronic measuring of the round wood over <b>bark</b> and to use the <b>bark</b> gauge for test measuring.

In this study, <b>bark</b> amount is expressed either as double <b>bark</b> thickness or as the proportion of over <b>bark</b> diameter or volume. Percent of <b>bark</b> volume of beech trees is about 6. 04 % of tree volume. Average double <b>bark</b> thickness was greatest at the base (1 % relative height) 18 mm and decreased uniformly towards the top (90 % relative height) 8 mm. <b>Bark</b> proportion (from the diameter) decreased from the base to the 20 % relative height being 4 % at its minimum.
