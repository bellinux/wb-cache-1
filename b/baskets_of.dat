Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female aeronaut, and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E

25|$|The rich mythical {{history of}} Nanumea {{describes}} a settlement {{led by an}} explorer/adventurer and warrior from the south named Tefolaha. Some accounts say Tefolaha and his crew came from Tonga, others name Samoa, but whether these names refer to today's Tonga and Samoa is not certain. Tefolaha, traditional accounts say, found the island of Nanumea populated by two women, Pai and Vau, whom it was believed had formed it from <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> sand. Tefolaha wagered with them for the island and eventually won it through trickery, whereupon Pai and Vau departed. Tefolaha's sons and daughters are today the founding ancestors of leading families and the seven chiefly lineages of Nanumea. Today's population also traces descent from crew members who arrived with Tefolaha, and from later visitors from the far distant and more recent past. Nanumean traditions describe the islets, Motu Foliki, Lafogaki and Te Afua-a-Taepoa, as being formed when sand spilled from the <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> two women, Pai and Vau, when they were forced off Nanumea by Tefolaha.|$|E

The ASC organized a train to pick up the fruit, and the response was overwhelming, with over 4,500 <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> peaches delivered. Ohio sailed for Liverpool with its cargo of peaches in late August.|$|E

On Easter Monday, the President of the United States holds an annual Easter egg roll on the White House lawn for young children. Since the rabbit is a pest in Australia, the Easter Bilby is available as an alternative. Easter eggs are a widely popular symbol of new life in Poland and other Slavic countries' folk traditions. A batik-like decorating process known as pisanka produces intricate, brilliantly-colored eggs.|$|E

Other investors, such as individuals using a retail broker, trade ETF shares on this secondary market.|$|E

500|$|In economics, a consumer's {{preferences}} are defined over all [...] "baskets" [...] of goods. Each basket is {{represented as a}} non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set of baskets, an indifference curve is defined for each consumer; a consumer's indifference curve contains all the <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair of baskets on the same indifference curve, the consumer does not prefer one basket over another. Through each basket of commodities passes one indifference curve. A consumer's preference set (relative to an indifference curve) is the union of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the indifference curve. A consumer's {{preferences are}} convex if all such preference sets are convex.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Amos Avery donated 100 {{acres of}} land to the Mashantucket Land Trust and kept the {{surrounding}} 40 acres. Amos Avery also restored the house to a [...] "more or less" [...] 18th-century appearance through a decade-long restoration effort. The restoration effort began in the mid-1950s when he poked {{a hole in the}} ceiling and felt the molding, spurring his desire to see what was underneath. The ceiling was removed and the room was restored and then it moved to the next room. Avery removed plaster off the fireplaces, replaced the wide floor boards and replicated the wainscotting. Upon Amos Avery's death in July 1998, aged 96, the house passed to his oldest son Edward. Many historical artifacts were put up for auction, including 12 wicker <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> Mohegan or Pequot origin, which were bid on by the Mashantucket Pequot Museum.|$|E

He walked this distance daily, often departing early with <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> watercress {{to sell to}} train passengers at the nearby station. He completed his upper primary schooling at the Protestant missionary-run Vinet private school in Ambohimalaza, where his mother arranged for him {{to live with a}} host family. After completing his primary studies he attended the Swedish missionary-run technical secondary school in Ambatomanga. He lived with one of his brothers and began producing and selling yogurt in individual serving pots to local villagers and students as a means to subsidize his studies. During this time he met his future wife, Lalao Rakotonirainy, a classmate at the secondary school. In 1972, in a climate of increasing political instability and widespread school-based protests against the Tsiranana administration, Ravalomanana dropped out of the school's eleventh grade program at the age of 23; he then pursued further technical training in Fianarantsoa. He participated in NGO-sponsored entrepreneurship training in Sweden and Germany, and business studies in Denmark underwritten by the Danish ambassador. After returning to Madagascar, he wed Lalao on 12 November 1974; their marriage produced one daughter and three sons.|$|E

500|$|The {{breeding}} behaviour of the melampittas is only known in any detail for the lesser melampitta. All {{that is known}} of the breeding of the greater melampitta are reports from local people that it creates nests that are <b>baskets</b> <b>of</b> vines suspended in the limestone sinkholes that it roosts in. There is also some evidence {{that it may be}} territorial. The lesser melampitta is known to start nesting in the dry season and continue into the beginning of the wet. The nest is a closed dome shape constructed out of live green moss. The nest that has been described was found [...] from the ground {{on the side of a}} tree fern, with nesting material woven into the bark and attached to dead fronds of the tree fern to secure it. The female lays a single chalky white and slightly speckled egg, which measures , and undertakes all the incubation duties. The incubation is quite long for a small passerine, lasting around 27 days, during which the male will feed the female. Both sexes feed the single chick, which is hatched covered in downy feathers. Unlike their relatives in the birds of paradise family, which feed their chicks by regurgitation, the parents feed the chick whole food that has not been swallowed. The chick takes up to 35 days to fledge, a long time for passerines.|$|E
