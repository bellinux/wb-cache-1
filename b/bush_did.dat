5|$|Following the {{attempted}} assassination of Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, Vice President George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not assume the presidential powers and duties as Acting President. Reagan {{was unable to}} invoke Section 3, {{because he was in}} surgery. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not invoke Section 4, because he was on a plane returning from Texas. Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush arrived in Washington. In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{announced}} its decision on June 29, 2006. The Court reversed the ruling of the Court of Appeals, holding that President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not have authority {{to set up}} the war crimes tribunals and finding the special military commissions illegal under both military justice law and the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{established}} {{the first national}} monument, Devils Tower in Wyoming, on September 24, 1906. He established 18 national monuments, although only nine still retain that designation. Sixteen Presidents have created national monuments since the program began; only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not. Bill Clinton created nineteen and expanded three others. Jimmy Carter protected vast parts of Alaska, proclaiming fifteen national monuments, some of which later were promoted to national parks. President Barack Obama created or expanded 34 national monuments, {{the most of any}} president, with over half a billion acres of public land and water protected.|$|E

25|$|George W. Bush, President of the United States (by satellite). Because of {{the events}} of Hurricane Gustav, <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not attend the convention, but instead {{delivered}} his remarks to the delegates by satellite.

25|$|President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> {{not attend}} the {{convention}} (although he did appear by satellite), in order to oversee relief efforts to help citizens recover from Hurricane Gustav. The attending delegates at the convention nominated Senator John McCain from Arizona for President and Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska for Vice President. 1,191 pledged delegates were necessary for candidates to win the respective nominations.|$|E
25|$|Further, income {{inequality}} {{can be measured}} both before-tax and after-tax, so the Bush tax cuts primarily impacted the latter measurements. President <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not take deliberate steps to address pre-tax inequality, which involves policies such as raising the minimum wage, strengthening collective bargaining power (unions), limiting executive pay, and protectionism. CBO reported that the top 1% paid an average total federal tax rate of 32.5% in 2000, 30.1% in 2004, and 28.2% in 2008. The top 1% paid an average federal income tax rate of 24.5% in 2000 and 20.4% in 2008.|$|E

25|$|By regulation, National Guard {{pilots were}} {{required}} to take and pass an annual physical {{in order to remain}} in flight status, in the three months prior to a pilot's birthday (in Bush's case, July 6). <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not take this mandatory physical examination in mid-1972. As a result of his failure to take his physical, his flight status was suspended by his commander on August 1, 1972, confirmed by Col Bobby Hodges on September 5, 1972, and confirmed again by a National Guard Bureau order on September 29, 1972, which meant he no longer was authorized to fly as a pilot.|$|E
25|$|Bin al-Shibh {{and four}} other captives {{classified}} as high value detainees (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, Ammar al-Baluchi and Walid Bin Attash) were charged in Guantanamo military commissions in Spring 2008. The men triggered controversy when they announced {{that they did not}} want US-appointed attorneys and they planned to boycott their commissions. The military commissions, as authorized by President George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>did</b> not permit suspects to forgo legal representation, to act as their own attorneys, or to boycott their commissions. The commissions authorized by the Military Commissions Act of 2006, did authorize suspects to serve as their own attorneys.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, of the 11 {{states in which}} {{amendments}} defining marriage were on the ballot, all passed handily. Bush won in nine, including Ohio. Interpretation of some exit polling suggests that the amendments may have brought out one million additional voters, most of which came {{out for the first}} time to cast their ballots for Bush. Notably, a vast majority of these states have not voted for a Democrat in many years. The two states that <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not win, Michigan and Oregon, still passed amendments limiting official recognition of marriage to one man one woman unions.|$|E

25|$|On March 25, 1999, Davis {{issued an}} {{executive}} order calling {{for the removal of}} MTBE (a toxic gasoline additive) from gasoline sold in the state. In 2001, in order for gas prices to remain reasonable in California while removing MTBE, Davis asked President George W. Bush to order the EPA to grant California a waiver on the federal minimum oxygen requirement. Without a waiver, California would have to import a much larger amount of ethanol per year and gas prices were projected to increase drastically. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not grant the waiver and in 2002, Davis issued {{an executive order}} reversing his earlier executive order.|$|E
25|$|McGreevey's {{decision}} {{to delay the}} effective date of his resignation until after September 3, 2004, avoided a special election in November to replace the governor. Doing so allowed the Democratic Party to retain control of the governorship for the rest (until January 2006) of the 4-year term. It avoided {{the prospect of a}} special election in tandem with the presidential election, which could have resulted in a Republican victory and helped George W. Bush capture New Jersey's electoral votes. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not win New Jersey's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election, but captured 46% of the statewide vote, compared to 40% in the 2000 race, and did win re-election.|$|E
25|$|During Bush's {{years in}} Miami, he was {{involved}} in many different entrepreneurial pursuits, including working for a mobile phone company, serving on the board of a Norwegian-owned company that sold fire equipment to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, becoming a minority owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars, buying a shoe company that sold footwear in Panama, and getting involved in a project selling water pumps in Nigeria. Miguel Recarey, who ran International Medical Centres (IMC), employed Bush as a real estate consultant and paid him a 75,000 fee for finding the company a new location, although the move never took place. <b>Bush</b> <b>did,</b> however, lobby the Reagan administration vigorously and successfully on behalf of Recarey and IMC.|$|E

25|$|As a batter, <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not hit {{for high}} batting average but was {{regularly}} {{among the major}} league leaders in drawing bases on balls, sacrifice hits, stolen bases, and runs scored. At {{the time of his}} retirement in 1923, Bush's 1,158 bases on balls ranked second in major league history. His 337 sacrifice hits still ranks fifth in major league history, and his 1909 total of 52 sacrifice hits is the fourth highest in major league history. He ranked among the American League leaders in stolen bases ten times, and, during the decade from 1910 to 1919, the only players to score more runs than Bush were Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, and Tris Speaker.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush {{had become}} {{increasingly}} unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around 30 percent. In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, but <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> {{not make a}} single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Gustav. Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed {{in an interview that he}} voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office.|$|E
25|$|While governor, Bush {{presided over}} a state {{government}} that reduced taxes by 19 billion and he vetoed 2 billion in new spending, according to The Wall Street Journal. An analysis conducted by economist Martin Sullivan, which eliminated {{the effects of the}} federal estate tax repeal (which did not require legislative action to go into effect) and inflation, estimated the cumulative reduction in taxes by the state at closer to 13 billion during Bush's tenure, resulting in tax savings by 2006 of 140 per person, per year. A substantial amount of the tax savings in the higher estimate came from the phasing out of the federal estate tax law implemented in 2001 under President George W. Bush, for a total tax savings of 848 million per year; Jeb <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> not push for a replacement with a state tax. The biggest reduction in taxes was due to the elimination of the state's Intangible Personal Property Tax, which applied to holdings of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and money market funds.|$|E
5000|$|Writing in The Advertiser, in {{a review}} of Saltbush Bill, J.P., and Other Verses, a {{reviewer}} states: [...] "The 'note of melancholy' which Marcus Clarke and other writers have found in the <b>bush</b> <b>does</b> not appeal to him Paterson, and he has set out his attitude in regard to the 'dismal' tribe in 'an answer to various bards,' which appears in this volume." ...|$|R
