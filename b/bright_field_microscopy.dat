25|$|Live {{cells in}} {{particular}} generally lack sufficient contrast {{to be studied}} successfully, since the internal structures of the cell are colorless and transparent. The most common way to increase contrast is to stain the different structures with selective dyes, but this often involves killing and fixing the sample. Staining may also introduce artifacts, which are apparent structural details that are caused by the processing of the specimen and are thus not legitimate features of the specimen. In general, these techniques make use of differences in the refractive index of cell structures. It is comparable to looking through a glass window: you (<b>bright</b> <b>field</b> <b>microscopy)</b> don't see the glass but merely the dirt on the glass. There is a difference, as glass is a denser material, and this creates a difference in phase of the light passing through. The human eye is not sensitive to this difference in phase, but clever optical solutions have been devised to change this difference in phase into a difference in amplitude (light intensity).|$|E

40|$|Diaminobenzidine photoconversion is a {{technique}} by which a fluorescent dye {{is transformed into a}} stably insoluble, brown, electrondense signal, thus enabling examination at both <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> light <b>microscopy</b> and transmission electron microscopy. In this work, a procedure is proposed for combining photoconversion and immunoelectron microscopy: in vitro cell cultures have been first submitted to photoconversion to analyse the intracellular fate of either fluorescent nanoparticles or photosensitizing molecules, then processed for transmission electron microscopy; different fixative solutions and embedding media have been used, and the ultrathin sections were finally submitted to post-embedding immunogold cytochemistry. Under all conditions the photoconversion reaction product and the target antigen were properly detected in the same section; Epon-embedded, osmicated samples required a pre-treatment with sodium metaperiodate to unmask the antigenic sites. This simple and reliable procedure exploits a single sample to simultaneously localise the photoconversion product and a variety of antigens allowing a specific identification of subcellular organelles at the ultrastructural level...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} cell cycle changes in choroidal endothelial cells treated with varying doses of bevacizumab in the presence of a range of con-centrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab, a drug widely used in the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neutralizes all isoforms of VEGF. However, the effect of intravitreal administration of bevacizumab on the choroidal endothelial cell cycle has not been established. Methods: Monkey choroidal endothelial (RF/ 6 A) cells were treated with VEGF 50 ng/mL and escalating doses of bevacizumab 0. 1 – 2 mg/mL for 72 hours. Cell cycle changes in response to bevacizumab were analyzed by flow cytometry and propidium iodide staining. Cell prolifera-tion was measured using the WST- 1 assay. Morphological changes were recorded by <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> cell <b>microscopy.</b> Results: Bevacizumab inhibited proliferation of choroidal endothelial cells by stabilization of the cell cycle in G 0 /G 1 phase.

30|$|Investigations by <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> and {{fluorescence}} <b>microscopy</b> {{were carried}} out to confirm that peptides were selectively attached to the active Au tip of VSNEA. Figure  3 b shows the scheme for the fluorescence analysis of the peptide-decorated Au-coated VSNEA. As shown in Figure  3 c, the vertical NWs are observed {{in the form of}} small dots in the <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> microscope image. Because this VSNEA specimen has not been treated with peptides, its fluorescence image did not reveal any sign of green fluorescence originating from the fluorescein molecules (Figure  3 d). In stark contrast, the VSNEA specimen treated with peptides shows bright green fluorescence light of fluorescein (Figure  3 e,f). Colocalization of dots in the upright microscopy images of VSNEA, as evidenced by a comparison between the <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> and the corresponding fluorescence images, strongly suggests a selective binding of the peptides to the Au tips of VSNEA without any nonspecific binding to other areas of the substrate (Figure  3 a,b). Calculations considering the volume of the peptide molecule and the surface area of Au show that multiple peptide molecules can be attached to a single Au tip. Such multiple additions of peptides onto Au-coated VSNEA are expected to be useful in exploring biological multivalent interactions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The Fluorescence Confocal Microscopy (FCM) is {{nowadays}} one of {{the most}} important tools in biomedical and pharmaceutic research. The main advantage of this technique over the traditional <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> optical <b>microscopy</b> is the fact that it allows the selection of a thin cross-section of the sample by rejecting the visual information coming from the out-of-focus planes. However, the small amount of energy radiated by the fluorophore and the huge light amplification performed by the photon detector to capture this visual information introduces a type of multiplicative noise described by a Poisson distribution. Additionally, the radiation efficiency of the fluorophore decreases with the time, an effect called photobleaching, leading to a decrease in the image intensity along the time. In this paper a reconstruction algorithm is proposed where the multiplicative noise and the photobleaching effect are modeled. The goal is to obtain the morphology and the intensity decay rate across the cell nucleus from a sequence of FCM images. The reconstruction algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem where a convex energy function is minimized. Tests using synthetic and real data are presented to illustrate the application of the algorithm and the effectiveness of the results.

40|$|Optical wide-field imaging of sub-diffraction limit {{nanostructures}} is {{of interest}} in {{a wide array of}} applications. In applications where the nanostructures to be visualized are well isolated, a high enough optical contrast is sufficient to detect these. Here we demonstrate a technique to visualize nanoscale features, such as grain boundaries in Chemical Vapor Deposited (CVD) single layer graphene, which are just a few atom length defects, using regular <b>bright</b> <b>field</b> optical <b>microscopy.</b> This remarkably low lateral length scale was imaged using of a special thin film structure consisting of a water-soluble thin film layer deposited on a metal substrate, which produces a strong color change {{as a function of the}} film thickness. Small local water transport differences in the graphene layer result in thickness variation of the underlying thin film due to its solubility in water and produces color contrast readily observable under a normal bright-field optical microscope with the naked eye. We demonstrate the use of this technique for direct optical visualization of grain boundaries in graphene as wide as 2 - 5 nm and sub- 100 nm photoresist lines. By using super-resolution image processing algorithms, we may be able to detect structure even smaller in size than currently achieved. We believe that this technique can be extended to single molecule detection...|$|R
