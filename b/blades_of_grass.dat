The Incas were among the best stonemasons {{the world has ever}} seen and many junctions in their masonry were so perfect that even <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> could not fit between the stones.|$|E
25|$|Seurat {{described}} {{one of the}} brush-stroke techniques {{he developed}} on this canvas as the balayé technique, wherein a flat brush is used to apply matte colours using strokes in a criss-crossing formation. These strokes become smaller as they approach the horizon. The balayé technique is not rolled out in a consistent manner across the painting, but is adapted where Seurat thought it appropriate. The foreground—for example—consists of a balayé network of strokes atop a more solid layer of underpaint, suggesting the flickering play of sunlight over the <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> This chunky, cross-hatched brushstroke pattern is {{in contrast with the}} nearly horizontal, much thinner strokes that are used to depict the water, and is in even greater contrast with the smoothly rendered skin of the figures.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{previous}} Chogye Trichen Rinpoches, Khyenrab Choje (1436–97), beheld the sustained vision of the female tantric deity Vajrayogini at Drak Yewa in central Tibet, and received extensive teachings and initiations directly from her. Two forms of Vajrayogini appeared out of {{the face of the}} rocks at Drak Yewa, one red in color and the other white, and they bestowed the Kālacakra initiation on Khyenrab Choje. When he asked if there was any proof of this, his attendant showed the master the kusha grass that Khyenrab Choje brought back with him from the initiation. It was unlike any kusha grass found in this world, with rainbow lights sparkling up and {{down the length of the}} dried <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> This direct lineage from Vajrayogini is the 'shortest', the most recent and direct, lineage of the Kālacakra empowerment and teachings that exists in this world. In addition to being known as the emanation of Manjushri, Khyenrab Choje had previously been born as many of the Kings of Shambhala as well as numerous Buddhist masters of India. These are some indications of his unique relationship to the Kālacakra tradition.|$|E

500|$|The nest {{is a large}} domed {{structure}} loosely woven from <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> bamboo {{or other}} leaves with a side entrance and is placed in a tree or under the eaves of a house. A study in southern India found the preferred nesting trees to be Toddalia asiatica, Gymnosporia montana and Acacia chundra, especially short and bushy ones in areas with low canopy cover. The nest opening is located to face downwind of the most frequent wind direction. In northern India, they preferred isolated Acacia nilotica in non-urban areas but used Thuja orientalis and Polyalthia longifolia in urban gardens.|$|E

Rihanna opened the performance singing an acappella version of [...] "Love The Way You Lie (Part II)". She was sitting on a stylized tree hovering above a field of sable-colored <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> Once she had finished the first frame of the song, she plummeted from the tree to the ground.

Rihanna then ended the performance after transitioning into [...] "Only Girl", which featured drummers and a background of fire for the finale.|$|E
500|$|Channelized blast zone, an {{intermediate}} zone, extended out to distances {{as far as}} [...] from the volcano, {{an area in which}} the flow flattened everything in its path and was channeled to some extent by topography. In this zone, the force and direction of the blast are strikingly demonstrated by the parallel alignment of toppled large trees, broken off {{at the base of the}} trunk as if they were <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> mown by a scythe. This zone was also known as the [...] "tree-down zone". Channeling and deflection of the blast caused strikingly varied local effects that still remained conspicuous after some decades. Where the blast struck open land directly, it scoured it, breaking trees off short and stripping vegetation and even topsoil, thereby delaying revegetation for many years. Where the blast was deflected so as to pass overhead by several metres, it left the topsoil and the seeds it contained, permitting faster revegetation with scrub and herbaceous plants, and later with saplings. Trees in the path of such higher-level blasts were broken off wholesale at various heights, whereas nearby stands in more sheltered positions recovered comparatively rapidly without conspicuous long-term harm.|$|E

500|$|Twenty of the game's on-disc {{songs are}} {{associated}} with [...] "dreamscape" [...] sequences {{in conjunction with the}} Abbey Road venue, representing the [...] in their later years. Animation sequences for songs linked with dreamscapes feature abstract or representative scenery. For example, the sequence for [...] "Octopus's Garden" [...] takes place in an underwater reef, while the sequence for [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] is reminiscent of the band's psychedelic performance of the song in the 1967 film Magical Mystery Tour. The concept of dreamscapes evolved from brainstorming sessions between Harmonix and Apple Corps.; as Rock Band was a game that celebrated the performance of music, simply portraying The Beatles performing in the Abbey Road studio was not enough, and the dreamscape sequences provided a way to surpass that. While the art team used existing materials as reference, the Apple Corps. shareholders encouraged the team to interpret the songs in new ways. For inspiration, Harmonix looked to Cirque du Soleil's approach in interpreting The Beatles catalogue for the Love stage show. Storyboards for these animated sequences were created using both hand-drawn and 2D computer-generated art. In some cases, the computer-generated elements used in storyboarding were kept as elements in the final venue, such as computer-generated <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> in the [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] sequence.|$|E

5000|$|This {{short and}} {{beautiful}} poem holds {{the key for}} leading a balanced life. It advises us to be humble and gentle yet strong. The song says, be humble like a <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> {{at the foot of}} the mountain and spread your fragrance like a gentle jasmine flower. The metaphor <b>of</b> gentle <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> {{at the foot of the}} mountain is very profound. When the rain pours over the mountains, when the mighty winds blow, the tall trees on the mountains may fall down, but the gentle <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> will bend and survive. The tall trees are [...] "too proud" [...] to bend and surrender to the winds, whereas the humble <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> will bend and surrender to the mighty wind. Thus this song imparts to us one of the secrets of life, which lies in learning how to survive by understanding the humbleness <b>of</b> the gentle <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass.</b> This poem says, do not always stand firm like a proud, tall tree, but bend like a gentle <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> when the winds blow. But, when fate brings its share of difficulties, be ready to face them like a rock. Become a solid rock and face all the difficulties in life. Be gentle and send your fragrance in all directions like the jasmine flower, but also learn to face the difficulties like a rock. Be strong, yet be compassionate to the poor, weak and down-trodden. Do all you can to help the poor and the needy. In the last line, this poem tells us to lead a harmonious life by becoming one with all people.|$|R
