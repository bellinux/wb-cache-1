[...] Fairman later stated of Ehrich's portrayal: [...] "Recently, the powers-that-be at Y chose to age Lauren and Michael’s tot of a son, Fenmore, to a teenager (another victim of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome) and with that comes new complex problems for the Baldwins, and as it appears “Fen” may be a chip off the old block ... sort to speak. [...] The talented Max Ehrich was cast as the new Fen, and since he has begun to air in the part he has received high marks, not only from his scene partners, but daytime fans, too."

Luke Kerr, also of Zap2it, wrote that he [...] "really likes" [...] Ehrich as Fenmore, stating: [...] "He has totally mastered the Baldwin/Fisher crazy behind-the-eyes element of early Michael and Kevin (Greg Rikaart)." [...] Jamey Giddens also wrote of the character's family storyline, saying: [...] "A father hellbent on preventing his son from going down the same unspeakable path he once traveled; a mother who refuses to believe her child could be guilty of the heinous crime he's being accused of committing.
