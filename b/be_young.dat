5|$|Little {{is known}} of the eruptive history of Mentolat, but it is thought to <b>be</b> <b>young,</b> with a {{possible}} eruption in the early 18th century that may have formed lava flows on the western slope. The earliest activity occurred during the Pleistocene, and Mentolat has had some major explosive eruptions during the Holocene.|$|E
5|$|Sellers's {{career on}} radio, film, {{television}} and record spanned from 1948 until his death. He made his radio debut on ShowTime in 1948, followed by appearances in Ray's a Laugh, Starlight Hour, The Gang Show, Henry Hall's Guest Night and It's Fine To <b>Be</b> <b>Young.</b> Along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, he {{took part in}} the radio series The Goon Show (1951–60). Throughout his career, Sellers made a number of television appearances, in character roles and for interviews and advertisements. His stage appearances were few, largely because he had been unhappy with the touring he had done as a child with his family. During his career he also released a number of albums containing sketches and comic songs; the songs were undertaken in a variety of comic characters.|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} the {{planetary}} orbit allowed {{the mass of the}} white dwarf star to be estimated as well, and theories of the formation of the planet suggested that the white dwarf should <b>be</b> <b>young</b> and hot. On July 10, 2003, the detection of the white dwarf and confirmation of its predicted properties were announced by a team led by Steinn Sigurdsson, using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. It was at a NASA press briefing that the name Methuselah was introduced, capturing press attention around the world.|$|E
5|$|Together with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned Lorraine Hansberry's {{unfinished}} play To <b>Be</b> <b>Young,</b> Gifted and Black into a {{civil rights}} song. Hansberry had been a personal friend whom Simone credited with cultivating her social and political consciousness. She performed the song live on the album Black Gold (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and renditions of the song have been recorded by Aretha Franklin (on her 1972 album Young, Gifted and Black) and by Donny Hathaway.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the rings}} of Uranus appear to <b>be</b> <b>young,</b> {{they must be}} {{continuously}} renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies. The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years. The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter. Therefore, all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck-sized satellites during the last four and half billion years. Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles, including dust. Eventually the majority of mass was lost, and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding. The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings. However, a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present. The maximum size of such moonlets is probably around 10km.|$|E

5|$|Two {{recordings}} of Bax as a pianist {{were made in}} 1929. With Lionel Tertis he recorded his own Viola Sonata for Columbia, and with May Harrison he recorded Delius's Violin Sonata No 1 for the rival HMV label. Of the symphonies, only the Third was recorded in the composer's lifetime; it was played by the Hallé under Barbirolli and released in 1944. The Viola Sonata, Nonet and Mater ora Filium were recorded {{under the auspices of}} the English Music Society in 1937 and 1938. The Phantasy Sonata for Viola and Harp, the Sonata for Two Pianos and a handful of the songs were recorded on 78 rpm discs. Of the tone poems, Eugene Goossens conducted the first recording of Tintagel, in 1928; twenty years later a set of The Garden of Fand with Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was released by HMV. By 1955 Bax on record was so scarce that The Record Guide listed only Tintagel, the Coronation March, the unaccompanied choral work What is it Like to <b>be</b> <b>Young</b> and Fair? and the solo piano piece Paean.|$|E
5|$|Well-established {{stars like}} Peter O'Toole and {{sporting}} legends like Stirling Moss took uncredited {{parts in the}} film {{just to be able}} to work with the other members of the cast. Stunt director Richard Talmadge employed Geraldine Chaplin to appear in a brief Keystone Cops insert. The film also proved to <b>be</b> <b>young</b> Anjelica Huston's first experience in the film industry as she was called upon by her father, John Huston, to cover the screen shots of Deborah Kerr's hands. The film also marks the debut of Dave Prowse, later the physical form of Darth Vader in the Star Wars series, as Frankenstein's monster, a role he would later play again in the Hammer films The Horror of Frankenstein and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell. John Le Mesurier features in the early scenes of the film as M's driver.|$|E

25|$|The devotions of many Sufi orders {{center on}} {{various forms of}} the dhikr, a {{ceremony}} at which music, body movements, and chants induce a state of ecstatic trance in the disciples.

25|$|On the outside, Victoria is a {{typically}} fragile lady of her era, frequently screaming {{when faced with}} the creatures the Doctor and his companions encounter in their travels, such as the Cybermen and the Yeti. However, this exterior hides an inner strength that crops up when needed. Victoria may <b>be</b> <b>young,</b> but she has an instinct for when she is being lied to, and her sensibility is a contrast to the recklessness of Jamie and the curiosity of the Doctor. Jamie, in particular, is very protective towards and fond of Victoria, and is heartbroken when she chooses to leave.|$|E
25|$|The true {{incidence}} of rectal prolapse is unknown, {{but it is}} thought to be uncommon. As most sufferers are elderly, the condition is generally under-reported. It may occur at any age, even in children, but there is peak onset in the fourth and seventh decades. Women over 50 are six times more likely to develop rectal prolapse than men. It is rare in men over 45 and in women under 20. When males are affected, they tend to <b>be</b> <b>young</b> and report significant bowel function symptoms, especially obstructed defecation, or have a predisposing disorder (e.g., congenital anal atresia). When children are affected, they are usually under the age of 3.|$|E
25|$|Beebe was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of the Revolution. One night he organized a public meeting at his house {{to talk about the}} Revolution. While he was addressing the people, gunfire was heard and fires were seen in the distance as if the British were coming. Beebe suspected this was a trick. So, he sent a small party by a back road to check it out and to cut off the retreat of this scouting party. They captured the culprits, who turned out to <b>be</b> <b>young</b> men from the town who had burned some cornstalks and were playing a joke on the people at the meeting to test their patriotism.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} found that R. romandi queens and workers differ in size and body shape, however these {{differences}} vary between colonies and are sometimes insignificant. If worker-queen dimorphism is present, the largest observable difference is between the metasome, with queens having larger metasoma, and longer and more reddish second metasomal segments. The most significant difference between queens and workers is between the developmental condition of their ovaries. Queens have ovaries in which all ovarioles have mature or semi mature oocytes, and they show sequential development of oocytes. Workers, on the other hand, have ovarioles that are filamentous or have only partially developed oocytes. Some individuals have ovaries that are between the queen and worker stages. These wasps are thought to be workers that become egg laying during swarming events, or they may <b>be</b> <b>young</b> uninseminated queens.|$|E
25|$|Roly {{was cast}} {{less than a}} week before the filming of EastEnders began. From the {{beginning}} it was decided that the occupants of The Queen Victoria pub, Den, Angie and Sharon Watts, were to have a German Shepherd named Prince. However, finding an Alsatian that was light enough in colour not to merge into the background of the set proved to be difficult. Eventually, the co-creator/producer of the show, Julia Smith, was contacted by a company named Janimals, who specialised in providing and training animals for television and films. They had found a seven-month-old Poodle, called Roly, who might still <b>be</b> <b>young</b> enough to be trained. Training was said to take three weeks, and as the Poodle was a similar size to an Alsatian, Roly got the part. Roly was made the property of the BBC, given an ID card, and taken to live with Julia Smith at her home in London. Roly and Willy the pug shared a dressing room at Elstree studios.|$|E
25|$|Hutton {{returned}} to England by boat; {{the rest of}} the team travelled by air. On his arrival, he was made an honorary member of the M.C.C., which changed its rules to allow a current professional to join the club. The selectors appointed him as England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, on the condition he reduced time wasting by the team. Usually, captains were appointed for one or two matches; the only other captain to be appointed for a whole summer was C. B. Fry in 1912. However, Hutton's form was uncertain at the start of the 1955 season. He captained M.C.C. against the tourists, but had to withdraw from the final day of the match with lumbago. With his health uncertain, he resigned from the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector. Hutton continued to play for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours. His last 100 runs came in an hour, a very fast rate of scoring, but this was his final first-class century. After the following match, his back became too painful to continue and he did not play again that season. That June, he was knighted for services to cricket. Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. At 39, he was considered at the time to <b>be</b> <b>young</b> to retire.|$|E
