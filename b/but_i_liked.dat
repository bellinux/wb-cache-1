500|$|Reviewer Peter Martin confided, [...] "The Warped Ones baffled and mystified me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> it very much." [...] J.R. Jones, for The Reader's Guide to Arts & Entertainment, {{found the}} film [...] "actually celebrates the values it's {{supposed}} to be condemning," [...] but recommended it for its kineticism and action. TV Guide and Allmovie did not recommended it, both gave it one star in their respective four and five star rating systems.|$|E
500|$|Dickinson {{attended}} {{primary school}} in a two-story building on Pleasant Street. Her education was [...] "ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl". Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to [...] "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> him better than none." ...|$|E

500|$|Gillian Anderson {{described}} [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] as [...] "one of {{the most}} repulsive scripts I ever shot", explaining {{that she could not}} watch scenes such as the doctor stabbing a patient. David Duchovny stated that [...] "I didn't understand the plot, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the script", noting that Carter and his team improved a weak teleplay and that director Kim Manners [...] "did an excellent job". Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] a [...] "B–", feeling that it was [...] "redeemed" [...] by the gore. However, they were [...] "worried" [...] by what they called the [...] "fourth consecutive phoned-in performance by Duchovny and Anderson". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was more negative, grading it a [...] "D". He felt that the episode was [...] "too much", and that the gore should have been suggested rather than shown directly. He also criticized the characterization of the characters (especially that of Scully), the [...] "predictable" [...] scares, the [...] "ludicrously bad" [...] dialogue, and a story that did not make much sense. Despite this, he did praise the [...] "strong" [...] guest acting. Sarah Stegall awarded [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] two stars out of five, and criticizing its reliance on gore. Ultimately, she found the conclusion wanting, because the [...] "good" [...] magic seemed useless; she wrote, [...] "Where's the logic in that?" [...] Ultimately, Stegall thought the episode's biggest flaw was its lack of logical writing, and that it required too much suspension of belief from the viewer.|$|E

[...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "I really liked this episode, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> it less than the [...] … it seems that someone took their foot off the gas just a {{fraction}} and the reduction in speed was notable. [...] Times James Poniewozik had mixed feelings for the flashbacks, but enjoyed Ben's character development. [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard [...] "enjoyed" [...] the [...] "interesting" [...] episode, although [...] "not nearly as much" [...] as the previous episode. [...] She rejoiced at the return of her [...] "favorite Other" [...] Tom (M.C. Gainey) and wrote that [...] "Locke {{used to be one}} of [...] favorite characters, but now he's a [...] ". [...] Digital Spy's Ben Rawson-Jones stated that [...] "the episode came together nicely in the end, with an expected twist and a snog, although for a great part it bordered on tedium. [...] Juliet is a character who simply isn't interesting enough to fully sustain one's attention over a flashback. [...] She's been so peripheral and irrelevant over this season, and it felt like a token gesture to foreground her at last. [...] There was a nice pay off though, with a long awaited smooch between her and Jack." [...] Daniel of TMZ graded the episode as a [...] "C+"; however, he wrote that [...] "the Ben/Locke scenes were great and Juliet in a bikini did not disappoint." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell [...] was [...] "not impressed with Jack and Juliet's chemistry" [...] and found their kiss [...] "unconvincing". [...] Martell commended Emerson's acting, Ben's one-liners and his [...] "too funny for words" [...] casual greeting to Hurley and Sawyer {{at the end of the}} episode after he is released from captivity. [...] The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought that [...] "this was another great episode [...] could have lived up to last week's episode, but there was still a lot of solid character development." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hill {{became a}} film fan {{at an early}} age, and the first film he remembers seeing was Song of the South (1948). He later {{described}} his taste as [...] "juvenile", stating: [...] "I liked adventure, westerns, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> everything. Musicals. But the general, I remember not liking kid movies... still don't, I think that's hung on." [...] His asthma receded when he was 15 {{and he began to}} think about becoming a writer. He worked in the oil fields as a roustabout on Signal Hill, California during high school and several more years while in college. During one summer, he ran an asbestos pipe-cutting machine and worked as a spray painter.|$|E

[...] "To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was {{fourteen}} {{and there was}} a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{had seen}} Russell Crowe in Romper Stomper {{and found him}} [...] "repulsive and scary, but captivating". The actor had read Ellroy's The Black Dahlia but not L.A. Confidential. When he read the script, Crowe was drawn to Bud White's [...] "self-righteous moral crusade". Crowe fit the visual preconception of Bud. Hanson put the actor on tape doing a few scenes from the script {{and showed it to}} the film's producers, who agreed to cast him as Bud. Guy Pearce auditioned like countless other actors, and Hanson felt that he [...] "was very much what I had in mind for Ed Exley." [...] The {{director}} purposely did not watch the actor in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, afraid that it might influence his decision. As he did with Crowe, Hanson taped Pearce and showed it to the producers, who agreed he should be cast as Ed. Pearce did not like Ed when he first read the screenplay and remarked, [...] "I was pretty quick to judge him and dislike him for being so self-righteous ... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> how honest he became about himself. I knew I could grow to respect and understand him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. I find it hard to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially {{if you are going to}} be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
