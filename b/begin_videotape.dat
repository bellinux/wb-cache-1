50|$|The Nine Network {{discarded}} {{copies of}} some of their programs, including the popular GTV-9 series In Melbourne Tonight hosted by Graham Kennedy. Though it ran five nights a week from 1957 to 1970, fewer than 100 episodes are known to survive, and many of the surviving episodes are edited prints made for rebroadcast across Australia. Early episodes of Hey Hey It's Saturday do not exist because the programme was broadcast live and did not <b>begin</b> <b>videotape</b> recordings until a number of years later.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s, while {{traveling}} across the U.S., Dean Evenson and Dudley Evenson <b>began</b> <b>videotaping</b> interviews with spiritual leaders and recording natural acoustics. They formally co-founded the Soundings of the Planet record label in 1979 in Tucson, Arizona. Since then, they have produced over 80 music albums and videos.|$|R

He eventually turns the camera to himself and his family. After 12 years of debilitating, painful dependence on methadone, Scott turns to ibogaine. Filmed in Scotland and England, and broadcast on BBC One as the third instalment in the documentary series One Life.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} time of Abu Zubaydah's capture in March 2002, the CIA <b>began</b> <b>videotaping</b> him at all times. Hundreds of hours of video on 92 tapes were {{eventually}} produced. The CIA stopped taping in late 2002, after Abu Zubaydah had been waterboarded. Originally the CIA claimed it taped the interrogations to protect agents from a wrongful death suit if Abu Zubaydah happened to succumb to the injuries he suffered during his capture.|$|R
50|$|After the {{legislative}} session ended, the conservatives continued {{to push the}} House to approve the Senate version of the bill. In June, a woman in The Woodlands was sexually violated when a biological male entered a women’s dressing room and <b>began</b> <b>videotaping</b> the woman while she tried on bathing suits.  Security cameras showed the store employees doing nothing to stop the predator. According to KTRK in Houston, the woman was emotionally damaged. Supporters of the bathroom bill cite this event to justify the legislation.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, {{he saw a}} {{building}} {{on the corner of}} Gansevoort and 9th Avenue in the Meat Packing District with a rental sign on the door. The price was right, and the dilapidated old duplex was soon the center of a unique, revolving universe of friends and scene-makers. It also became a hotel, way-station, and halfway house for people either visiting or moving to the city. Artists, musicians, and performers dropped by at all hours to hang out, and it was this feeling of an ongoing 24-hour salon that gave Sullivan the idea to <b>begin</b> <b>videotaping</b> his life. His best friend and constant companion was a black Labrador Retriever named Blackout.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, Mother Angelica began {{a series}} of {{community}} meetings on matters relevant to Catholicism and also began recording her talks for sale. Bishop Joseph Vath noticed her talent for communicating with the lay public and encouraged her to continue; she began taping a radio show for broadcast on Sunday mornings and published her first book in 1972. In the late 1970s she <b>began</b> <b>videotaping</b> her talks for television, which were broadcast on the satellite Christian Broadcasting Network. In 1981, after visiting a Chicago television studio and being impressed by its capability, she formed the non-profit EWTN corporation. Initially, she recorded her shows in a converted garage at the monastery's property.|$|R
5000|$|In 1992, Kennedy {{ruled that}} it was not a {{violation}} of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to sentence a defendant to six months in jail for failure to pay parking tickets. This ruling was overturned on appeal. [...] In 1995, he became the first judge in Manitoba to order the repossession of a convict's property under [...] "proceeds of crime" [...] legislation passed six years earlier. [...] The following year, he dismissed two statements a defendant had given to police on the grounds that the statements were made under duress. Partly as a result of this ruling, Winnipeg police <b>began</b> <b>videotaping</b> their talks with suspects the following year.|$|R

In 2010, Stroffolino is released his first solo album, Single-Sided Doubles, on Pop Snob Records, as a vinyl/CD hybrid. In 2013, his piano playing and singing {{caught the attention of}} American film director and screenwriter Jeff Feuerzeig. Feuerzeig <b>began</b> <b>videotaping</b> Stroffolino on the piano during [...] "street sessions" [...] while Stroffolino performed out of a van that he lives in. Feuerzeig also decided to make an [...] "instant record" [...] of Stroffolino performing, resulting in a 12-track album, [...] "The Piano Van Sessions". Feuerzeig's agent has heard Stroffolino's record and story, and is helping him get a publishing and label deal.|$|R
50|$|As society {{began to}} embrace technology, the League worked to {{incorporate}} this new field into its mission and services. In the 1980s, the League <b>began</b> <b>videotaping</b> final rounds {{as a means}} of preserving the history of the contest. As the Internet gained popularity in the 1990s, the League developed and refined its website to extend opportunities for students previously marginalized by geographic or fiscal constraints. In this vein, the League turned its attention toward engaging previously underserved communities. During the 1991-92 school year, Phillips Petroleum made a major gift to the League to promote speech education in rural and urban communities. A few years later, the National Junior Forensic League was established to serve junior high and middle schools. The Barbara Jordan Youth Debates, made possible by the Kaiser Family Foundation, were held for urban debaters. As a result of these and other National Forensic League outreach efforts, the 900,000th member was recorded in the mid-1990s.|$|R

25|$|Erin Kramp, {{a mother}} dying of breast cancer, {{appeared}} on the show in 1998. After realizing that her six-year-old daughter, Peyton, would have to grow up without her, Kramp <b>began</b> recording <b>videotapes</b> filled with motherly advice on everything from makeup tips to finding a husband. She also wrote letters and bought gifts for Peyton to open every Christmas and birthday she was gone. Kramp lost her battle with cancer on October 31, 1998. She had recorded over a hundred video and audiotapes for her daughter.|$|R
5000|$|With {{reasonable}} revenue being made, McMahon {{was able}} to secure television deals, and WWF was being shown across the United States. McMahon also <b>began</b> selling <b>videotapes</b> of WWF events outside the Northeast through his Coliseum Video distribution company, again angering other promoters.

5000|$|At 8:46 on 9/11, Dries and {{her roommate}} Megan were {{sleeping}} in at their New York University dormitory. They were awakened when American Airlines Flight 11 hit the North Tower. Dries <b>began</b> <b>videotaping</b> the crash {{scene with a}} camcorder she got about a week prior, while other dorm members came into the room. About fifteen minutes later, while zooming in on people jumping {{out of the building}} (which she thought was debris, specifically mentioning chairs in the tape), the South Tower was hit; Megan began screaming while Dries said [...] "Oh my God!" [...] repeatedly and questioning what to do when they realized it was a deliberate attack. Due to the camera initially being on the North Tower, the actual collision was not captured by her. Horrified, Megan began packing a few belongings in an attempt to flee the scene, with Dries following. When they got out of the building, they noticed that everyone else was equally confused. With no leads and not feeling safe, they went back to their dorm and watched the scene with their friends. As they were about to drink either apple juice or vodka, Megan (while the camera was on her) looked back at the tower and screamed again; Dries turned the camera back to show the South Tower collapsing. Everyone continued to remain in the room until after the North Tower collapsed.|$|R
50|$|The film <b>begins</b> with <b>videotape</b> footage Deur {{recorded}} in November 1990, when he nearly drowned while surfing Lake Superior near Whitefish Point. Deur {{had been caught}} in a rip current for about an hour, trying futilely to swim to shore, before being suddenly released by the current. Back on dry land, he pledged on camera that he would one day make a film about surfing the great lakes. Unsalted combines home movies of lake surfing going {{as far back as}} the 1960s with contemporary footage culled from 150 hours of filming, often with surfing professionals brought in from California.|$|R
50|$|The {{decline of}} VHS <b>videotape</b> <b>began</b> with the {{introduction}} to market of the DVD format in 1997.

50|$|Beginning in the mid-1970s, rival camera {{manufacturer}} Cinema Products {{began making}} lighter-weight 16mm film cameras using Auricon film movements and magnesium bodies, considerably easier to handle than the rugged solid-metal Auricons.

50|$|In March 1961, {{the newly}} created Venevisión and the American {{television}} network, ABC, signed two agreements: one for technical support {{and the other for}} the rights to broadcast each other's programs. Thanks to these agreement, Venevisión later <b>began</b> using the <b>videotape</b> system. In their first year of existence, Venevisión made approximately 800,000 bolívares a month in advertisements. By 1971, it began to bring its then black and white programs to viewers internationally via videotape, with the drama program Esmeralda as the first to do so. In the next year, the network officially took over the broadcasts of the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant, and it has been its home ever since.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{its entire}} thirty-five year run, Search for Tomorrows title {{sequence}} featured clouds {{passing through the}} sky.

In late 1981, the show <b>began</b> using a <b>videotaped</b> opening sequence with a shot of a seagull flying over the ocean, and a helicopter shot of the clouds in the midday sky. In the shows final months, the titles featured a montage of cast clips, bookended with sky shots and a redesign of the title to fit with the times.|$|R
50|$|In 1960, KTVU {{switched}} to the visually and technically superior videotape format for recording games for broadcast. One of Roller Derby's sponsors, a San Francisco auto dealer, got a Portland, Oregon TV station to broadcast an unedited tape of a match, {{in an attempt to}} advertise the dealership's new lot in the area. To his surprise, Jerry Seltzer received three hundred letters asking for Roller Derby to come to Portland, so he obliged and the Derby made an appearance before 9,000 fans. Realizing he had stumbled onto a promotional formula, he <b>began</b> syndicating <b>videotapes</b> of games to more independent TV stations, and followed up broadcasts with personal appearances of the Derby in each city. In 1961, forty stations carried Derby. Several years later, UHF TV stations, mostly independent and desperate to compete with older, network-dominated VHF counterparts, snatched up broadcasting rights for their areas. Although TV exposure was an important component of Roller Derby's revitalization, Seltzer didn't want to repeat the experience of mainstream professional sports organizations that had become dependent on TV; he used the medium only for exposure and publicity for the live matches, not a source of revenue for player salaries.|$|R
5000|$|From the 1940s to 1960s, {{broadcast}} {{television stations}} typically provided local news programs {{only one to}} two times each evening for 15 minutes (the normal length for many locally produced programs at the time); usually these programs aired as supplements to network-supplied evening news programs or leadouts for primetime programming. Reports featured on local and national television newscasts during this time were generally provided via film or still photography; eventually, <b>videotape</b> <b>began</b> {{to be used to}} provide live coverage of news events. The 1950s also saw the first use of airborne newsgathering; most notably, in 1958, Los Angeles television station KTLA began operating the [...] "Telecopter", a helicopter equipped for newsgathering use that was the most advanced airborne television broadcast device of its time.|$|R

On January 9, 1995, Dimond repeated Gutierrez's claims, while on a KABC-AM morning show, hosted by Roger Barley and Ken Minyard. The allegation was later proven untrue. Jackson subsequently filed a $100 million slander lawsuit against Dimond, Paramount Pictures Corp (producer of Hard Copy), and KABC-AM.

At {{the time that he}} won the Oscar for his film, Terms of Endearment, Brooks <b>began</b> receiving <b>videotapes</b> from Ullman's Los Angeles agent, hoping to get his attention. Ullman, who was already famous in her homeland, England, was already landing a variety of television deals and proposals in America, but none had panned out. These projects did not suit Ullman's interests. [...] "were shows with morals, where everyone learns something {{at the end of the}} show", related Ullman to a television critic for TV Guide in 1989, describing the television show ideas that were offered to her. Brooks was so taken by what he saw in Ullman that he decided to take the young actress under his wing and return to television. Brooks was determined to develop the right vehicle to showcase Ullman's talents [...] - [...] acting, dancing, and singing [...] - [...] and decided to create a sketch comedy show. Ullman had already had a successful music career in the early 1980s in the UK, and had a top 10 hit on the American charts with a cover of Kirsty MacColl's [...] "They Don't Know" [...] and her You Broke My Heart in 17 Places.|$|R

Clearly distressed by this discovery, she {{resolves}} to experiment on herself to test her new-found ability. During one scene, Claire <b>begins</b> to <b>videotape</b> herself as she is about to step in front of an oncoming train. By labeling it her [...] "seventh attempt", Claire is picking up where she had left off in [...] "Genesis", where she had initially halted her experimentation at attempt number six. However, she is saved from getting hit by the future Peter, who she confides in about Sylar's attack and asks him to train her in her powers. Peter merely states that he can't and teleports away, leaving her by herself on the hill. At home, Noah Bennet, greatly relieved to see her still alive, shows Claire some files on several of the Company's escaped villains, stating his knowledge of their abilities and capabilities. When Claire inquires about the possibility of being attacked by any of these villains at home, Noah tells her he had thought about that idea and then reveals that he and Sandra Bennet had called in Meredith Gordon (last seen in Season 1's [...] "Run!") to protect the family in Noah's absence.|$|R
50|$|A {{video tape}} {{recorder}} (VTR) is a tape recorder designed to record and playback video and audio material on magnetic tape. The early VTRs are open-reel devices which record on individual reels of 2-inch-wide (5.08 cm) magnetic tape. They were used in television studios, serving {{as a replacement for}} motion picture film stock and making recording for television applications cheaper and quicker. <b>Beginning</b> in 1963, <b>videotape</b> machines made instant replay during televised sporting events possible. Improved formats, in which the tape was contained inside a videocassette, were introduced around 1969; the machines which play them are called videocassette recorders. Agreement by Japanese manufacturers on a common standard recording format, so cassettes recorded on one manufacturer's machine would play on another's, made a consumer market possible, and the first consumer videocassette recorder was introduced by Sony in 1971.|$|R
