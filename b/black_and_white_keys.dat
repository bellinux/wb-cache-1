We {{sit with}} it in hand, running our fingers over the big staring letters, as over the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>keys</b> of a piano, {{drumming}} out of them a mild melody of perfect repose. With what delight do we disport us in the illimitable void of its nothingness, as who should swim in air! Here is nothing to startle-nothing to wound. The very atmosphere is saturated with [...] "the spirit of the rural press;" [...] and even our dog stands by, with pendant tail, slowly dropping the lids over his great eyes; and then, jerking them suddenly up again, tries {{to look as if}} he were not sleepy in the least. A pleasant smell of ploughed ground comes strong upon us. The tinkle of ghostly cow-bells falls drowsily upon the ear. Airy figures of phenomenal esculents float dreamily before our half-shut eyes, and vanish ere perfect vision can catch them. About and above are the drone of bees, and the muffled thunder of milk streams shooting into the foaming pail. The gabble of distant geese is faintly marked off by the bark of a distant dog. The city with its noises sinks away from our feet as from one in a balloon, and our senses are steeped in country languor. We slumber.|$|E

50|$|Zolani {{is known}} for the {{development}} of a new tuning technique for the santour, which is an ancient Iranian instrument. The traditional Iranian santour is a diatonic instrument, which is relative to playing a piano without the use of the black keys. Zolani enhanced the instrument by creating a chromatic santour, which essentially allows the use of both <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>keys.</b> Over the history of the Persian santour, unsuccessful attempts had been made to create a chromatic santour, but the enhanced instrument remained in experimental phases, never becoming functional. Zolani's change and enhancement of the santour was an historical first in the presentation and playing capabilities of the instrument. The transformation allowed for more chromatic and complex orchestral versatility.|$|E
25|$|In {{a letter}} of November 1937, to art {{historian}} Gunnar Jungmarker (1902–1983) at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Billman reveals {{that he is in}} an artistic crisis. The <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> woodcut restricts his expression - too brutal contrasts between <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> surfaces. It was not until 1940 he was able to present a woodcut with several grey tones, developed from the ordinary black printing ink. Gunnar Jungmarker called this type of woodcut: grisaille woodcut. A time-consuming printing process, exclusively for handprinting, with several grey-wood blocks (1-4) aside from the <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>key</b> block. These first free grisaille woodcuts (made before the work with Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment, in 1945) are based on self-perceived events for example from Billman's sailor years 1926-32, European travels 1936-39 and trips around Sweden during the war years. Some shining grisaille woodcuts are French Restaurant (1940), Artist Family (1941), Wilderness Kitchen (1942), Around a Guitar Player (1942), Stairway in the South (1942), Stormy Day, Dieppe sept. 1939 (1944) or Tropical Harbour (1945).|$|R
5000|$|At the {{simplest}} level, {{the song is}} about the ebony (<b>black)</b> <b>and</b> ivory (<b>white)</b> <b>keys</b> on a piano, but also deals with integration and racial harmony on a deeper, human level. The title was inspired by McCartney hearing Spike Milligan say [...] "black notes, <b>white</b> notes, <b>and</b> you need to play the two to make harmony, folks!". The figure of speech is much older. It was popularised by James Aggrey in the 1920s, inspiring {{the title of the}} pan-African journal The Keys, but was in use from at least the 1840s.|$|R
50|$|Almost every modern piano has 36 <b>black</b> <b>keys</b> <b>and</b> 52 <b>white</b> <b>keys</b> for a {{total of}} 88 keys (seven octaves plus a minor third, from A0 to C8).

50|$|Using {{knowledge}} of torpedoes gained {{from her first}} husband - munitions manufacturer Friedrich Mandl - Antheil and Lamarr developed {{the idea of using}} frequency hopping: in this case using a piano roll to randomly change the signal sent between the control-center and torpedo at short bursts within a range of 88 frequencies on the spectrum (there are 88 <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>keys</b> on a piano keyboard). The specific code for the sequence of frequencies would be held identically by the controlling ship and in the torpedo. This basically encrypted the signal, as it was impossible for the enemy to scan and jam all 88 frequencies because this would have required too much power. Antheil would control the frequency-hopping sequence using a player-piano mechanism, which he had earlier used to score his Ballet Mécanique.|$|E
50|$|The Continental {{and other}} Vox organs {{such as the}} Jaguar, the Continental II, Super Continental, and the Continental 300 share {{characteristic}} visual features including orange and black vinyl coverings, stands made of chromed steel tubing, and reversed <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>keys.</b> The English wood key single manual Continental (V301J) is increasingly collectable, although the wood key American-built (V301H) and plastic key Italian-built models (V301E, V301E/2 and V302E) also command premium prices. Jennings sold production rights for the Vox Continental organ to an Italian subsidiary of Thomas Organ in 1967. Under the new production agreement, the Continental was gradually and subtly altered in quality and sound, and reliability became questionable. For example, Ray Manzarek of The Doors had been using a Vox since 1966, but could no longer trust it during performances because {{of the problems in}} quality after 1967, and thus was forced to look elsewhere for an organ. He settled on the Gibson Kalamazoo, because it had a flat top like the Vox Continental, so it could accommodate the physical requirements of the Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, which was the bass instrument for The Doors in concert.|$|E
5000|$|Most modern pianos have {{a row of}} 88 <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white</b> <b>keys,</b> 52 white keys for {{the notes}} of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36 shorter black keys, which are raised above the white keys, and set further back on the keyboard. This means that the piano can play 88 {{different}} pitches (or [...] "notes"), going from the deepest bass range to the highest treble. The black keys are for the [...] "accidentals" [...] (F/G, G/A, A/B, C/D, and D/E), which are needed to play in all twelve keys. More rarely, some pianos have additional keys (which require additional strings). Most notes have three strings, except for the bass that graduates from one to two. The strings are sounded when keys are pressed or struck, and silenced by dampers when the hands are lifted from the keyboard. Although an acoustic piano has strings, it is usually classified as a percussion instrument {{rather than as a}} stringed instrument, because the strings are struck rather than plucked (as with a harpsichord or spinet); in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification, pianos are considered chordophones. There are two main types of piano: the grand piano and the upright piano. The grand piano is used for Classical solos, chamber music and art song and it is often used in jazz and pop concerts. The upright piano, which is more compact, is the most popular type, as they are a better size for use in private homes for domestic music-making and practice.|$|E

40|$|Abortion and {{violence}} are global issues, yet different culture might {{respond to the}} issues somewhat differently. This study aims to reveal the abortion {{and violence}} issues in Jane Martin’s Keely and Du in terms of pro-choice and pro life movements and see how Indonesian students reading the play respond to the issues. In the United States of America, the discussion of abortion issue can be grouped into two major categories: the pro-life and pro-choice. In Indonesia, {{the majority of people}} would be against abortion when it is not for medical reasons. The students reading Keely and Du find the play challenging their beliefs as religious people still keeping hold of eastern values.

40|$|Objective. To track within-individual {{change during}} late {{life in the}} sense of {{personal}} control and God-mediated con-trol (the belief that one can work collaboratively with God to achieve one’s goals and exercise control over life events) and to evaluate the hypothesis that this element of religion is related to declining personal control. Method. A longitudinal survey representative of older <b>White</b> <b>and</b> <b>Black</b> adults in the United States tracked changes in personal and God-mediated control in four waves over the course of 7  years. Results. Growth curve analysis found that the pattern of change differed by race. White adults had less sense of God-mediated control at younger ages, which increased among those who were highly religious but decreased among those who were less religious. Black adults had higher God-mediated control, which increased over time among those with low personal control. Discussion. These results indicate that God-mediated control generally increases during older adulthood, but that its relationships with personal control and religious commitment are complex <b>and</b> differ between <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> <b>White</b> adults. <b>Key</b> Words: Growth curve analysis—Religion—Sense of control.

40|$|Classical True Score Theory (Nunnally, 1978) {{would suggest}} that Cognitive Ability Test (CAT) Performance is a {{function}} of the sum of true cognitive ability and measurement error. In this paper, it is proposed that there are determinants in addition to ability and error that systematically affect test performance. The proposed determinants of CAT performance are evaluated in a causal framework using structural equation modeling techniques. The determinants include test-taker motivation, dispositions, reactions to the test, prior testing experience, and cognitive ability. In addition, the hypothesis that racial subgroup differences on CATs may be partially explained by the role of the proposed determinants on CAT performance was tested. ^ Multiple-groups structural equation modeling was used to analyze test and survey data from 241 <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> 607 <b>White</b> employees from a hi-tech manufacturing organization who took a computerized test battery as part of a concurrent test validation study. The results show that the latent distribution of cognitive ability does not differ by race <b>and</b> that <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Whites</b> do not differ significantly on the other variables tested in this study that have an effect on CAT performance. Therefore, it is not clear from this research that <b>Blacks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Whites</b> differ on <b>key</b> latent variables that cause differences in mean group cognitive test scores as was proposed. ^ The results of this study do show that factors other than true cognitive ability significantly affect the measurement of CAT performance for both groups either directly (e. g., test-taking anxiety) or indirectly (e. g., belief in testing and prior computer experience) through an intervening variable. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept for}} the game came to future {{director}} Makoto Shibata shortly after he finished work on Tecmo's Deception: Invitation to Darkness. The concept came to Shibata inspired by his own dreams and encounters with what he felt were supernatural occurrences. Development began when the PlayStation 2 hardware was first introduced to Tecmo, under the codename [...] "Project Zero". One {{of the things they}} drew inspiration from was the positive reception of polygon characters in the Silent Hill series, using this to go a step further and create the sense of seeing things off-screen. The ultimate goal was to create as frightening an atmosphere as possible. The staff included multiple developers from the Deception series. According to character designer and CGI director Jin Hasegawa, the game's key colors are <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white: <b>white</b> represented hope, while black represented fear. During early development, a large amount of effort went into adjusting the lighting and shading, with the most obvious in-game representation of the key colors and desired effect being Miku's torch piercing the darkness inside the mansion. In addition to <b>black</b> <b>and</b> <b>white,</b> a third <b>key</b> color represented through Miku's clothing was red, representing life. The composer and sound director was Shigekiyo Okuda. During the concept development, one of the main concepts was using stereophonic sound to reinforce the atmosphere. Due {{to the nature of the}} project, Okuda considered it important that they convey a three-dimensional feeling using sound projected from both left and right. After testing out multiple middleware and commercial sound tools, the team settled on Arnis Sound Technologies.|$|R
