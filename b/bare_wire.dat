25|$|Beginning in 1959, Harlow and his {{students}} began publishing their observations {{on the effects of}} partial and total social isolation. Partial isolation involved raising monkeys in <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> cages that allowed them to see, smell, and hear other monkeys, but provided no opportunity for physical contact. Total social isolation involved rearing monkeys in isolation chambers that precluded any and all contact with other monkeys.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{experiments}} would {{study the}} effects of total and partial isolation on the animals' mental health and interpersonal bonding using a stainless steel vertical chamber designed by Harlow, named the [...] "pit of despair", which was found to produce [...] "profound and prolonged depression" [...] in monkeys. Similarly, Harlow found that extended isolation in <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> cages left monkeys with [...] "profound behavioral abnormalities" [...] including [...] "self-clutching and rocking" [...] and later [...] "apathy and indifference to external stimulation". Harlow likened this behavior to catatonic schizophrenia.|$|E
50|$|The second die type, {{known as}} a {{pressure}} type die, relies on contact between the jacketing polymer and <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> inside the die. In this die type, a ring of polymer melt under pressure is forced around the <b>bare</b> <b>wire.</b> Due to the applied pressure of the melt, the opening around the inlet for the <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> must be very small, {{on the order of}} 0.05 mm. The size of the exit opening controls the thickness of the resulting coating. This type of die results in more intimate contact between the outer coating and the <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> than the jacketing die.|$|E

50|$|The first dye type is an annular, or tubing/jacketing, die that extrudes {{a tube of}} polymer that is {{initially}} not touching the <b>bare</b> <b>wire.</b> A vacuum is then applied to the still-molten polymer tube, causing it to be drawn onto and bond {{to the surface of}} the <b>bare</b> <b>wire.</b> This type of die is typically used to coat very thin wires with polymer jacketing that is highly viscous.|$|E
5000|$|The Rolling Stones' song {{has certain}} {{affinity}} to the 1967 {{recording of the}} same name by the Lords of London. The Knack, a relatively unknown LA based band, had issued a different song by that name on the B-side of their debut single in 1967. [...] "Time waits for no one" [...] is also a lyric from the Moody Blues song [...] "Driftwood". The phrase [...] "Time Waits For No Man" [...] - a variant that also appears in Jagger's lyrics - is used on John Mayall's <b>Bare</b> <b>Wires</b> album of 1968 (in the I Know Now part of the <b>Bare</b> <b>Wires</b> suite) to which Mick Taylor contributed both as guitar player and as composer.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, Heckstall-Smith {{became a}} member of guitarist-vocalist John Mayall's blues rock band, Bluesbreakers.

50|$|As a {{teenager}} Reeves learned orchestral double bass and played in local jazz-oriented groups (also sometimes the Wes Minster Five) with Colfes Grammar School, Lewisham schoolmates, Dave Greenslade and Jon Hiseman; Reeves and Hiseman would later record with John Mayall {{on the album}} <b>Bare</b> <b>Wires</b> {{and then go on}} to form Colosseum.|$|R
5000|$|Overjacketing {{extrusion}} is a coating process, {{in which}} individual <b>bare</b> <b>wires</b> or bundles of pre-coated wires are {{coated with a}} layer of insulating polymer. A wide variety of materials may be used, depending on the specific application. For many applications, such as [...] insulated cables, the polymer should be a good insulator, flexible, and wear resistant.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{non-metallic}} sheathed cables, such as (US and Canadian) Types NMB and NMC, {{consist of}} two to four wires covered with thermoplastic insulation, plus a <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> for grounding (bonding), surrounded by a flexible plastic jacket. Some versions wrap the individual conductors in paper before the plastic jacket is applied.|$|E
50|$|Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph said:The {{result is}} more urgent, less {{reassuringly}} structured than your typical Elbow record. Gone are the cross currents of texture, soaring melodies and matey glow. But it's exciting to hear Garvey {{out on a}} limb, his windblown voice often striking out alone across the <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> of a basic groove.|$|E
50|$|The tool {{is rapidly}} twisted. The {{result is that}} 1.5 to 2 turns of {{insulated}} wire are wrapped around the post, and above that, 7 to 9 turns of <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> are wrapped around the post. The post has room for three such connections, although usually {{only one or two}} are needed. This permits manual wire-wrapping to be used for repairs.|$|E
25|$|Taylor toured and {{recorded}} the album Crusade with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. From 1966 to 1969, Taylor developed a guitar style that is blues-based with Latin and jazz influences. He is the guitarist on the Bluesbreaker albums Diary of a Band, <b>Bare</b> <b>Wires,</b> and Blues from Laurel Canyon. Later {{on in his}} career, he further developed his skills as a slide guitarist.|$|R
50|$|A {{rat-tail}} splice, {{also known}} as a twist splice or a pig-tail splice, is a very basic electrical splice that can be done with both solid and stranded wire. It is made by taking two or more <b>bare</b> <b>wires</b> of the same diameter and wrapping them together symmetrically around the common axis of both <b>wires.</b> The <b>bare</b> splice can be insulated with electrical tape or other means.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Watchdog {{investigations}} showed that numerous accidents were caused when the electrical plugs on new electrical appliances were incorrectly wired. At the time, all new electrical goods were sold with <b>bare</b> <b>wires</b> and customers {{were expected to}} fit plugs themselves. These investigations led to a British law forcing all manufacturers selling electrical products in the UK to supply them with fitted plugs.|$|R

5000|$|Special {{feedthrough}} twist-on {{wire connectors}} differ from standard wire connectors {{in that they}} have an additional opening {{at the top of the}} insulated cap. This allows a single-conductor <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> to be pushed through the hole, forming a [...] "pigtail" [...] section which can be attached to a grounding screw. These feedthrough connectors are typically green, and are also called [...] "screw-on grounding connectors".|$|E
50|$|DWC {{produces}} less kerf and wasted materials {{compared to}} solid blades (slurry wire may be similar). On very expensive materials, this could save {{hundreds or thousands}} of dollars of waste. Unlike slurry saws that use <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> and contain the cutting material in the cutting fluid, DWC uses only water or some fluid to lubricate, cool the cut, and remove debris. On some materials DWC may not need water or cutting fluid, thus leaving a clean dry cut.|$|E
5000|$|Then Mick Taylor {{joined the}} group, and they {{recorded}} Crusade on 12 July 1967. Soon after, McVie joined Fleetwood Mac {{and was replaced}} by Tony Reeves for the album <b>Bare</b> <b>Wires,</b> which was their highest-charting UK album. Following a further album, Blues from Laurel Canyon,Taylor then left to join the Rolling Stones, and the name [...] "Bluesbreakers" [...] was dropped from John Mayall albums.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sustained}} {{high temperatures}} melted the Teflon insulation on the fan power supply wires {{and left them}} exposed. When the tank was refilled with oxygen, it became a bomb waiting to go off. During the [...] "cryo stir" [...] procedure, fan power passed through the <b>bare</b> <b>wires</b> which apparently shorted, producing sparks and igniting the Teflon. This in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it.|$|R
50|$|He soon {{moved to}} Ocean City, Maryland {{and set to}} work {{developing}} his own musical chops by playing local gigs with another Jersey boy, guitar player Joe Boris of the jam band One-Eyed Jack. The two started a band with bass player Andre Cholomondeley, from the Frank Zappa tribute band Project Object and veteran New Jersey drummer Bob Ramos. Nick's early band toured local venues along the East Coast and in California.Nick worked for 5 years with Jersey cover band <b>Bare</b> <b>Wires</b> featuring Dave DeSantis on Drums, Markus Barth on Bass and Jim Keegan on guitars. They performed {{up and down the}} east coast opening for Nick's Dad Clarence Clemons. Performing as the All Zeros Band, <b>Bare</b> <b>Wires</b> recorded with Nick and the first tracks, Downstream, Solid, Captain Corey and Now Worries were on their first EP release featuring dad Clarence on Sax for No Worries and Captain Corey. The songs were recorded at Ocean Way Studios in New Jersey and mixed and mastered at Granite Alps Recording Studios in Wayne, NJ. Mixed and mastered by Markus Barth.|$|R
50|$|A Fahnestock clip is {{an early}} type of spring clamp {{electrical}} terminal for connections to bare wires. It is still used in educational electronic kits and teaching laboratories in schools. It is designed to grip a <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> securely, yet release it with {{the push of a}} tab. The clip was patented February 26, 1907 by John Schade Jr., assigned to Fahnestock Electric Co. Less than 2 weeks after the patent was issued they filed for reissue.|$|E
5000|$|According to his {{obituary}} in the Daily Telegraph, Wooldridge {{was sent}} to Alaska to cover the 1,100-mile dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome, travelling with a photographer in a one-engine aircraft steered by an old bush pilot. [...] "You slept where you could," [...] Wooldridge later recalled. [...] "In trappers' huts with <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> bedsteads to sleep on, cooking up horsemeat over a fire... We stayed with Eskimo families, Indian families - there were no hotels." ...|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of dies used in overjacketing extrusion, both based on an overall {{crosshead}} design. Regardless of die type used, the polymer melt is often extruded at a rate less {{than the speed of}} the <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> that is drawn through the die, typically on the order of 1-4 times the speed of the melt. This causes the polymer jacket to extend, thin, and tighten around the central wire, increasing adhesion of the new layer.|$|E
50|$|K&T wiring was {{commonly}} insulated {{with cotton}} cloth and soft rubber, {{in addition to}} the porcelain standoffs. Although the actual wire covering may have degraded over the decades, the porcelain standoffs have a nearly unlimited lifespan and will keep any <b>bare</b> <b>wires</b> safely insulated. Today, porcelain standoffs are still commonly used with bare-wire electric fencing for livestock, and such porcelain standoffs carry far higher voltage surges without risk of shorting to ground.|$|R
5000|$|A lineman's handset {{typically}} connects via {{a pair of}} test leads, not the modular connector {{found on}} most consumer telephone equipment. The test leads will feature some combination of alligator clips (to connect to <b>bare</b> <b>wires),</b> a piercing spike or [...] "bed-of-nails" [...] (for insulated wires), and something designed to fit a punch block. Adapters designed to fit other punch block types, heat coil sockets, or modular jacks may also be used.|$|R
