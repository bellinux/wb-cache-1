5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such as the great horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. <b>Blowfly</b> larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} maggots such as <b>blowfly</b> larvae (gentles) and {{bluebottle}} larvae (casters) are bred commercially; they are sold as bait in angling, and as food for carnivorous animals (kept as pets, in zoos, or for research) such as some mammals, fishes, reptiles, and birds It {{has been suggested}} that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. However, consumers are opposed to the inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. <b>Blowfly</b> larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has been}} {{performed}} using synthetic trap baits instead of carcasses to capture <b>blowflies.</b> In a field test, dimethyl trisulfide {{was used in}} trap baits and C. loewi and other various <b>blowflies</b> were caught in these traps. <b>Blowflies</b> are attracted to decaying hosts due to the odors produced by bacterial decomposition. Dimethyl trisulphide is probably a decomposition product from bacterial decomposition and a major attractant for <b>blowflies</b> looking for hosts. Dimethyl disulfide has also been used in trap baits and for the suppression of other Calliphora sp.|$|R

40|$|During courtship, male <b>blowflies</b> perform {{aerobatic}} pursuits that {{rank among}} the fastest visual behaviours that {{can be observed in}} nature. The viewing strategies during pursuit behaviour of <b>blowflies</b> appear to be very similar to eye movements during pursuit in primates: a combination of smooth pursuit and catch-up saccades. Whereas in primates these two components of pursuit eye movements are thought to be controlled by distinct oculomotor subsystems, we present evidence that in <b>blowflies</b> both types of pursuit responses can be produced by a single control system. In numerical simulations of chasing behaviour the proposed control system generates qualitatively the same behaviour as with real <b>blowflies.</b> As a consequence of time constants in the control system...|$|R
40|$|Quantal {{response}} bioassays {{were conducted}} with cattle ticks and sheep <b>blowflies</b> with three different isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae and different methods of inoculation. Ticks were either topically dosed with 2 mu l or immersed in the conidial preparations. <b>Blowflies</b> were either topically dosed with 2 mu l of the conidial preparation or fed on conidia mixed with sugar. Probit analyses were carried out on the mortality data to compare the virulence of these isolates to ticks and <b>blowflies</b> and look for indications of different virulence mechanisms employed by M. anisopliae isolates when invading these hosts. One isolate (ARIM 16) showed high virulence to both hosts killing 95 % of ticks after 2 days and 88 (+/- 2) % of <b>blowflies</b> after 4 days. Strikingly different mortality patterns indicated that virulence is dependent on different mechanisms in ticks and <b>blowflies.</b> The pattern of mortality seen with ticks suggested {{that the number of}} conidia adhering per unit area of the cuticle was more important for rapid tick death than the total number of conidia contacting the entire tick surface. <b>Blowflies</b> fed conidia mixed with food died rapidly after an initial lag phase regardless of dose...|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to note the larval stage of the <b>blowfly,</b> due to its importance in forensics. The larvae have posterior spiracles, small openings on the back used for the intake of oxygen. Larvae are also equipped with mouth hooks used for the physical breakdown of proteins when feeding, while proteolytic enzymes are used for chemical breakdown of these proteins.|$|E
25|$|Nicrophorus beetles often {{carry on}} their bodies the mite Poecilochirus which feed on fly eggs. If they arrive at the corpse before any fly eggs hatch into maggots, the first eggs are eaten and maggot {{development}} is delayed. This may lead to incorrect PMI estimates. Nicrophorus beetles find the ammonia excretions of <b>blowfly</b> maggots toxic, and the Poecilochirus mites, by keeping the maggot population low, allow Nicrophorus to occupy the corpse.|$|E
25|$|The {{recognition}} of abuse {{is not always}} beyond doubt. Some usual symptoms of child abuse/neglect include malnutrition, bruises or abrasions, healing fractures, and repetitive or cumulative injuries upon examination of skin, soft tissues, and bones. In proven child and abuse cases, {{as determined by the}} aforementioned constraints, forensic entomology can be utilized in estimating the time since the abuse last occurred, and in fatal cases, the post-mortem interval (PMI). Furthermore, <b>blowfly</b> larvae and pupae can produce evidence that may determine the length of neglect.|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{reliable}} tools for species identification of necrophagous <b>blowflies</b> of the Middle East {{is a serious}} obstacle {{to the development of}} forensic entomology in the majority of countries of this region.

In response to this situation, a high-quality key to the adults of all species of forensically relevant <b>blowflies</b> of the Middle East has been prepared. Thanks to the modern technique of image-stack stereomicroscopy and high-quality entomological materials, this new key can be easily applied by investigators inexperienced in the taxonomy of <b>blowflies.</b> The major technical problems relating to the species identification of necrophagous <b>blowflies</b> of the Middle East are also discussed...|$|R

The adult <b>blowflies</b> deposit their eggs on the anurans' backs which hatch into larvae after a couple hours. The larvae then burrows into the skin and causes lesions. However, because of their rapid growth rate, the larvae leave the amphibian's body in less than 1 week and migrate into soil in order to pupate. Generally, it takes them nine days to pupate into adult <b>blowflies</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The flies {{also cause}} a huge {{economic}} problem in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas sun-drying {{is the major}} method of preserving fish, as ice is typically unaffordable. However, <b>blowfly</b> larvae tend to infect these sun-dried fish {{when the weather is}} warm and humid. In an experiment, 95% of the infecting flies were found to be C. megacephala. The flies can be controlled by using an odor that the flies are attracted to trap them. Insecticides are also used, although this results in the development of resistance.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of F. scalaris, when full grown, are 6 to 8mm in length, {{white or}} cream colored, and {{slightly}} flattened dorsally. They have long tubercles on every segment with the {{projections of the}} eighth segment longer than both the seventh and eighth segments put together. The protuberances are feathered due to their preferences for semi-liquid organic matter. They {{are similar to the}} hairy maggot <b>blowfly</b> in appearance but smaller in size. During the pupal stage, the puparium is brown in color and the same shape as the larvae.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{was used to}} eradicate Cochliomyia hominivorax screw-worm fly from the USA where the flies were endemic, and from Libya where {{there had been an}} accidental importation from South America. Although this species of <b>blowfly</b> under natural conditions has larvae of the obligate myiasis type, it is possible to colonize the entire life-cycle in large factory conditions. Massive numbers pupae are sterilized by irradiation. When released these flies mate with the wild flies and the matings produce no offspring. The reproductive rate of the wild flies can be reduced to the level of eradication. Eradication schemes are being extended in the Americas.|$|E
30|$|From Remark  5, Theorems  10 and 11, we {{can easily}} see that if c_i(t)< 1, i= 1, 2,...,n, then the continuous-time Nicholson’s <b>blowflies</b> models and the discrete-time {{analogue}} {{have the same}} dynamical behaviors.

50|$|They {{are also}} very {{important}} ecologically because they are decomposers. <b>Blowflies</b> are not only attracted to decomposing hosts but to some plants as well. C. loewi and other <b>blowflies</b> have been observed to be attracted to Phallus impudicus, the stinkhorn fungus, which tends to smell like carrion. The Stapelia flower, which smells like carrion and emits heat like that of decomposition, also attracts <b>blowflies.</b> The flower causes females to oviposit (deposit eggs from ovipositor) {{but it does not}} support past the 1st instars. Some other plants do support larvae through full development.|$|R

25|$|Although {{known as}} the Australian sheep <b>blowfly,</b> Lucilia cuprina {{can be found in}} other parts of the world {{including}} Africa and North America. These blow flies like warmer weather with soil temperatures above 15 degree Celsius, air temperatures above 17 degrees Celsius and below 40 degrees Celsius. They like low wind conditions with wind speeds below 30km/hr. Adapted perfectly to the southern region of the United States, this fly is well known because of its importance in forensic entomology. L. cuprina can fly up to ten miles looking for food, and can be found on anything ranging from carrion to decaying fruit. Larvae are often found in shaded regions of carrion, while the adults prefer bright, open areas.|$|E
25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The <b>blowfly</b> traps contain a liquid that smells like the rotting flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the synthetic pyrethroid that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E
25|$|The species Lucilia cuprina, {{formerly}} named Phaenicia cuprina, is {{more commonly}} known as the Australian sheep <b>blowfly.</b> It belongs to the blow-fly family Calliphoridae, and while some authorities combine the blow flies (Calliphoridae) and the flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) together into the Metopiidae family, distinguishable characteristics allow for the separation. Lucilia cuprina {{is a member of the}} order Diptera, has a pair of short but very strong membranous wings and a pair of hindwings reduced and modified to clublike balancers known as halteres. This adaptation distinguishes the true flies (Diptera) from the other orders with “fly” in their name, and serves as a sensory aid that acts as tiny gyroscopes or inertial navigation system. The mesothorax is much enlarged while the prothorax and metathorax are reduced. Blow flies are about the size of a house fly or a little larger, and though considered to be nuisances indoors are essential agents in the breakdown of organic matter. Most are metallic blue or green, and often have black gena, mostly white calypteres and orange yellow anterior thoracic spiracles.|$|E

25|$|Blow flies – Family Calliphoridae- Flies in {{this family}} are often {{metallic}} in appearance and between 10 and 14mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as blue bottle fly, cluster fly, greenbottles, or black <b>blowfly.</b> A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented antennae. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. Larvae have three stages of development (called instars); each stage is separated by a molting event. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the Neotropics, {{and a large number}} of species in Africa and Southern Europe. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of India, Japan, Central America, and in the southern United States. The typical habitat for blow-flies are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, damp soil and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first insect to come in contact with carrion because they have the ability to smell death from up to ten miles (16km) away.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with <b>blowfly</b> larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blowfly</b> strike, or flystrike is {{a serious}} welfare problem in the animal industry. This {{cutaneous}} myiasis or infestation not only causes severe discomfort or stress to the animal, but will also cause death when left untreated. Ewe lambs and female sheep are primarily affected and are struck predominately in the rear quadrant of the animal due to fecal staining. Due to the difficulty in controlling these flies, there are considerable losses in the sheep industry every year. Also, there is an increasing concern of the insecticidal use and the surgical procedures done to control L. cuprina, making this not only an animal welfare issue but also an economical one. The maggots of L. cuprina rapidly grow while eating the living flesh of the sheep while secreting ammonia, thus, poisoning the sheep. Sheep show signs of skin irritation by rubbing and biting the affected areas {{during the first few}} days after the eggs have been laid. This causes an inflammatory response in the sheep resulting in severe irritation and pyrexia. Once a flystrike has started other flies are attracted to the site. Although treatment is available, the delayed response time due to symptoms allows wool breakage in the affected area and fleece to be tender overall. There are many predispositions to the flystrike that make a host more favorable, including an infection with dermatophilosis and footrot, both of which can be treated and prevented. In some animals a weak resistance can develop, but this immune response is often associated with a decrease in productivity which is an undesirable trait.|$|E
