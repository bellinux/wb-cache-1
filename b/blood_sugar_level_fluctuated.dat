40|$|Abstract Athletes {{diagnosed}} with diabetes {{may have difficulty}} with their <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels</b> <b>fluctuating</b> during intense exercise. Considerations for athletes with insulin concerns may range anywhere from exercise rehabilitation {{to the use of}} an automatic insulin pump. The automatic insulin pump is a small battery-operated device {{about the size of a}} pager. The pump continuously delivers small doses of insulin to the body. It can be conveniently clipped to a belt, waistband, or carried in a pocket. Many athletes have used this machine to assist with insulin control. Medical people believe that those who use the insulin pump will experience better insulin control.   Insulin pumps should be padded during rough physical activity, such as football, because subjects have a needle inserted in the side of their abdomen. The insulin pump regulates <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> before and after practice to ensure insulin levels are appropriate. Checking insulin levels, while participating in physical activities, is a requirement to prevent further injuries.

40|$|Under {{contract}} with the University Medical Centre, Utrecht, TNO Human Factors has conducted research to investigate the effect of diabetes on driving behaviour. In a driving simulator experiment, patients with diabetes and non-diabetics were confronted with various trafßc situations. The subject groups always drove the conditions twice. In this, the patient groups drove the route once with euglycaemia (a normal <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level)</b> and once with hypoglycaemia Gow <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level).</b> The non-patient group drove the route twice with a normal <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level.</b> Subjects did not know in what condition their <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> would be decreased {{to the level of}} hypoglycaemia. In the analysis of the diabetic group, difference was made between people who were aware of their <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> being low {{and those who did not}} notice the status of hypoglycaemia. Ninety subjects participated in a driving simulator experiment. Subjects drove on the motorway, a rural road and a city road. During normal driving situations, some critical incidents were encountered (e. g. braking lead vehicle, deciding who has the right of way, coping with curves). During driving, behavioural variables were measured. These variables were Time-to-Line-Crossing, Time-To-Collision, crossing road markings, response times to critical situations and responses to a secondary task. By comparing driving performance between non-patients and patients, and between a normal <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> and hypoglycaemia, the effects of diabetes on (kiving performance and traffic safety were established. The results showed that in case of a low <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>level</b> in Type II diabetics (non-insulin dependent), there is a clear decrease in performance, although some of the effects are also present in that type of diabetics with normal <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels.</b> Type I (insulin dependent diabetics) diabetics did not show any decreased driving performance, not even with low <b>blood</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
