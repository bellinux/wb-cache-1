5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} electronic organs, the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than electronic organs, because the sound is produced <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E
5|$|One {{strategy}} is to minimise actual motion, as when predators such as tigers stalk prey <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> very slowly and stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids the need to camouflage motion.|$|E

The energy-impulse radiated <b>by</b> a <b>moving</b> charged particle is shown to be not an invariant 4 -tensor, for this reason calculation methods based on change of reference frame are not correct.

5|$|Tics are sudden, repetitive, nonrhythmic {{movements}} (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) {{that involve}} discrete muscle groups. Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> air through the nose, mouth, or throat.|$|E
5|$|After the British were defeated, more French Creole {{families}} evaded Anglo-American rule <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> to the Spanish-controlled land on {{the west}} bank, including wealthy merchants Charles Gratiot, Sr. and Gabriel Cerre. Both the Gratiot and Cerre families intermarried with the Chouteau family to create a Creole-dominated society in the 1780s and 1790s. The families also had marital ties to Spanish government officials, including the lieutenant governors Piernas and Cruzat.|$|E
5|$|Ahidjo {{stepped down}} on 4 November 1982 and left power to his {{constitutional}} successor, Paul Biya. However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of}} the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> toward a more democratic government, but a failed coup d'Ã©tat nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{a million}} slaves in French West Africa {{responded to this}} <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> away from their masters and {{settling}} elsewhere. The French supported these efforts by creating settlements around the Niger River and digging wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear attack. As a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|As Emperor, Domitian quickly {{dispensed}} {{with the republican}} facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign. <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a divine monarchy with himself as the benevolent despot at its head.|$|E

5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary incontinence can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>moving</b> the pan-tilt {{units of}} the laser range finders, it is also {{possible}} to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of engine cowling latches.|$|E

5|$|His {{practice}} of dividing {{his time between}} Britain and America caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident. After lengthy negotiations the matter was settled, but the Wodehouses decided to change their residential status beyond doubt <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> to France, where they bought a house near Le Touquet in northern France.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Huntsman began {{shifting}} campaign {{resources from}} Florida to New Hampshire; <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> staffers, Huntsman {{had the largest}} operational staff there at the time.

Elion was replaced by Sarah Crawford Stewart, who had served as state-director of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty's New Hampshire campaign before he suspended his bid after the Ames Straw Poll.|$|E

5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature.

5|$|Pong is a {{two-dimensional}} sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle <b>by</b> <b>moving</b> it vertically across {{the left or}} right side of the screen. They can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.|$|E
