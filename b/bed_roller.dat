Therefore, when the construction of seadikes is planned, the effective heightof seadikes {{and the depth of}} scouring have to be determined under careful considera-tion. This paper presents the experimental result of scour due to waves. In this paper, first, it is cleared that the wave action of scouring at the toe ofseadikes is divided into two parts: occurrence of <b>bed</b> <b>roller</b> and sand movement alongthe bed, and four types of scour behaviours by the location of seadikes are revealed. Furthermore, it is found that the maximum depth of scour is approximately equal tothe wave height in deep water and the location of seadikes where the maximum scouroccurs is related to the depth of breaking of incident waves. In addition, the scours at the toe of seadikes along Mie Coast due to Typhoon No. 13 and Isewan Typhoon are discussed based on this experimental result...|$|E

A high-power laser is used to fuse small particles of metal powders into a mass that has a desired three-dimensional shape. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections of the part on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top via an additional supply <b>bed</b> and <b>roller</b> and the process is repeated until the part is completed.|$|R

In this fishery, night collections are conducted over seagrass <b>beds</b> with <b>roller</b> beam trawls to capture live shrimp, primarily pink shrimp, Penaeus duorarum. These shrimp are culled from the catch on sorting tables and placed in onboard aerated “live” wells. Beds of turtlegrass, Thalassia testudinum, a species that has highest growth rates and biomass during summer and lowest during the winter (Fonseca et al., 1996) are predominant areas for live-bait shrimp trawling (Tabb and Kenny, 1969). Our study objectives were 1) to determine effects of a roller beam trawl on turtlegrass biomass and morphometrics during intensive (up to 18 trawls over a turtlegrass bed), short-term (3 -hour duration) use and 2) to examine the mortality of bycatch finfish following capture by a trawl...|$|R

Thus it is imperative to develop cost effective and scalable process for the production of vaccines so as to make them affordable for mass use. In this study, performance of a novel disposable iCELLis fixed bed bioreactor system was investigated for the production of some viral vaccines like Rabies, Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya vaccines in comparison to conventional systems like the commercially available packed <b>bed</b> system and <b>roller</b> bottle system. Vero and MRC- 5 cell substrates were evaluated for growth parameters in all the three systems maintaining similar seeding density, multiplicity of infection (MOI) and media components. It was observed that Vero cells showed similar growth in all the three bioreactors whereas MRC- 5 cells showed better growth in iCELLis Nano system and roller bottle system. Subsequently, the virus infection and antigen production studies also revealed that for Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya iCELLis Nano bioreactor system was better to the commercial packed <b>bed</b> bioreactor and <b>roller</b> bottle systems. Although for rabies antigen production commercially available packed bed bioreactor system was found to be better. This study shows that different bioreactor platforms may be employed for viral vaccine production and iCELLis Nano is one of such new convenient and a stable platform for production of human viral vaccines.|$|R

40|$|A {{consolidation}} work, {{which may}} be called a submerged sill, is constructed across a river channelin order to prevent the river bed from being lowered due to a dam construction. The stability of itsfoundation should not be threatened by the local scour downstream of the sill. In this study, char-acteristics of the scouring process downstream of a consolidation work are discussed experimentallyand analytically, using a simplified flow model. The flow downstream of a submerged sill has towpatterns; submerged jet and undular jump. In the state of submerged jet, the main flow is deflecteddownwards and sweeps along the <b>bed</b> with a <b>roller</b> near the water surface. On the other hand, in thestate of undular jump, the main flow is shifted to the water surface and a roller is formed near thescour hole bed. These two flow patterns appear alternately in the scouring process. Modifyingthese two flow patterns under some assumptions based on the experimental facts, the distribution ofthe bed shear stress in the scour hole is estimated and the variation of the scour depth with time andplace is simulated by solving numerically the equation of continuity of the bed sand under the non-equilibrium state of sand discharge...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Iran {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{producers}} of almonds. According to the statistics released by FAO (2011), Iran with more than 110000 tons of almonds is the third in rank throughout the world. However, most Iranian almonds are presented as an unsorted and unpackaged product. Some producers sort their products by hand which is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. So, there is an essential need for suitable grading and packaging machines especially for the export of almond kernels. Grading, which is sometimes called sorting, is basically separating the material in different homogenous groups according to its specific characteristics like size, shape, color and on the basis of quality. Weighing {{is one of the}} best methods for grading agricultural products based on size, but due to its high cost and complexity of operations, usage of weigh size sorting machines is practically limited. So, sizing of most agricultural products is accomplished based on their dimensional attributes such as diameter, length, thickness or a combination of them. Field study shows that recently vibrating sizing machines are used for grading almond kernels. This type of sizing machine is huge, expensive, noisy and it consumes a lot of energy. Thus, the main objective of the present study was the design, development and evaluation of a new prototype of an almond kernel sizing machine. Materials and methods: It is important that the machine could resolve defects of existing vibrating machines. It should provide efficient and cost effective sizing for a wide range of kernel sizes and shapes. Furthermore, it should be of simple construction and be able to accept manual feeding. Previously conducted experiments showed that the thickness of the kernel is the most appropriate dimension for its sizing. Among the different types of dimensional sizing machines, the divergent roller grader which grades the products based on their thickness is considered to be one of the simplest options. So, a divergent roller grader was developed and built in this research. The prototype consisted of two diverging rotating rollers which were made of mild steel with an outside diameter of 95 mm and a length of 700 mm. They were mounted to provide an adjustable slope towards the wide opening end. These <b>roller</b> <b>beds</b> were fixed on a box shaped frame of size 500 × 1000 × 1200 mm. The slope and counter-rotating action of the rollers encouraged the kernels to continue moving toward the end where the gap between the rollers was the widest. A tray was fixed at the feeding end of the machine for feeding the kernels. A provision was given to adjust the gap from a minimum to a maximum level. Based on the required activate torques of the rollers, an electric 74 W motor was selected to drive the machine. The power transmission mechanism consists of two pulleys 150 and 250 mm diameters and a V belt type A with a length of 1448 mm. The center distance of the pulleys is calculated to be 410 mm. Standard criterions of weighted sorting error index (C ̅_R), weighted sorting efficiencies index (EW) and operation capacity (Q) were used to evaluate the machine. Practical analysis showed that the machine’s performance is influenced mainly by the slope of the rollers, the rotation speed of the rollers, and the feeding rate of the product. In order to evaluate the performance of the prototype, a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with three replications for each test was done. The performance evaluation was carried out for three levels of feeding rates (600, 1000, and 1400 kg 8 h- 1, three levels of slopes (2, 7, and 12 degree), and three rotation speeds of rollers (50, 80, and 110 rpm). Spreadsheet software MSTATC and SPSS were used to analyze the data and the Duncan's multiple range tests were used to compare the means. Results and discussion: Analysis of variance showed that all three studied factors have significant effects on evaluating standard criterions of C ̅_R, EW, and Q at the 1...|$|R
