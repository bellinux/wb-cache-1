5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars) are broad and long, extending {{to the front}} margins of the first upper molar (M1). Wilfredomys has even longer incisive foramina, extending between the molars, but the foramina are shorter in J.ossitenuis and J.pictipes. The palate itself is wide and short, with its <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> between the M3s. Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates, extending beyond the third molars. Fine openings (foramina) are present on the palate. The <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the palate is squared; J.anoblepas lacks a spine {{in the middle of}} the <b>back</b> <b>margin,</b> as is present in Rhipidomys. Wilfredomys has the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> U-shaped instead and has a longer palate, with the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> behind the M3s.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long and line-shaped. The central groove in the nasal depression {{is relatively}} narrow. The frontal bones are slightly rounded and bear a prominent sagittal crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, not flat as in M.aelleni and M.manavi. At the palate's <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> is a long, thin posterior palatal spine.|$|E

50|$|Acropora digitifera is {{a species}} of acroporid coral found in the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, the {{southwest}} and northern Indian Ocean, Australia, southeast Asia, the central Indo-Pacific, Japan, the west Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea. It is found in shallow areas of tropical reefs in the <b>back</b> <b>margins,</b> from depths of 0 to 12 m. It was described by Dana in 1846.|$|R
50|$|The underwings are crpytically {{coloured}} in lighter greyish brown. A darker band arches {{between the}} forward and <b>back</b> <b>margins</b> of the hindwing, {{which has a}} prominent silvery sheen also found in closely related species of Erebia and conspicuous at a distance when these butterflies fly around in the sun. The reddish patches and the eyespots of the forewing also occur on the underwings, those of the hindwings usually do not.|$|R
50|$|Pelictosuchus {{was once}} {{classified}} in the family Nanictidopidae. Pelictosuchus and other therocephalians traditionally classified as nanictidopids have thin postorbital bars forming the <b>back</b> <b>margins</b> of the eye sockets and parietal bones that form a low sagittal crest {{at the top of}} the skull. They were thought to be closely related to another family of therocephalians called Scaloposauridae, although they differed from scaloposaurids in having higher, narrower skulls. Pelictosuchus is no longer classified as a nanictidopid, and is instead considered a member of Akidnognathidae.|$|R
5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest {{to the front and}} is flanked by {{well-developed}} beads at its margins. The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid process, a process at the back, is well developed and the capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the incisive foramen (an {{opening in the}} palate) is about {{at the same level}} as the front of M1, and the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E
5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} at the front tip. They end in a V shape at the front margin and in a narrow point at the <b>back</b> <b>margin.</b> Inside each premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E
50|$|The {{folds of}} the {{sections}} were normally sewn together per the custom of the time. This book did not follow this custom however. The body of the book was cut with four small eye holes through the sides along its <b>back</b> <b>margins.</b> Through these holes were threaded four rawhide strings to hold the book together tightly with the cover boards which also had the four eye holes. The cover boards were even with {{the edges of the}} paper in the book.|$|R

5000|$|To motivate {{intermediaries}} {{the firm}} can use positive actions, such as offering higher margins to the intermediary, special deals, premiums and allowances for advertising or display. [...] On the other hand, negative actions may be necessary, such as {{threatening to cut}} <b>back</b> on <b>margin,</b> or hold <b>back</b> delivery of product.|$|R
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine, Pennatomys {{is known}} {{from a number}} of skeletal remains, many of which are fragmentary. Both skull and postcranial bones are represented. Although there are no unusual adaptations in the known material, the animal possesses a combination of characteristics that distinguish it from all other known oryzomyines. The skull is known only from fragments. The nasal bones extend back to a point before or slightly behind the point where the maxillary, frontal, and lacrimal bones meet, and have a blunt <b>back</b> <b>margin.</b> The nasals extend slightly further back than the premaxillaries. The lacrimals articulate with both the frontals and the maxillaries, a trait that distinguishes Pennatomys from its closest relatives (which have lacrimals articulating mainly with the frontals). The interorbital region of the skull bears weak crests at its sides. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, is broad and its <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> is located in front of the first upper molar (M1). The incisive foramina, openings in the bony palate, extend back to a point next to the front root of M1. The palate itself is long and flat, extending beyond the third upper molars (M3). In the mandible (lower jaw), there is a capsular process—a protuberance at the back of the jawbone that houses the root of the lower incisor. Below the molars, the upper and lower masseteric ridges (crests which support some of the chewing muscles) are sometimes conjoined towards the front, and they extend forward to a point below the first lower molar (m1). The conjoined crests are one of the synapomorphic (shared-derived) characters of the Nectomys subclade.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The <b>back</b> <b>margins</b> of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|R
5|$|Wear facets {{are areas}} of a tooth that show {{evidence}} {{of contact with}} a tooth in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as occlusion). Flynn and colleagues identified two wear facets at the front and <b>back</b> <b>margins</b> of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear facets suggest {{the presence of a}} protocone (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars. In a 2005 paper on Asfaltomylos, a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear facets within the talonid basin in Ambondro and instead identified wear facets on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on the rims, not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone.|$|R
50|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The <b>back</b> <b>margins</b> of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates.

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} (the lowered {{area at the}} nose) is relatively broad in comparison to M.manavi. The frontal bones (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed sagittal crest (a crest that provides support for muscles of the head). Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis, but unlike in M.aelleni and M.manavi, which have a flat palate. At the palate's <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> is a long, robust posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the large, V-shaped nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) are well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed sagittal crest on its roof. The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E
5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) {{has four}} main, {{transversely}} placed crests; {{the description of}} S.bolligeri mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest. De Bruijn interpreted the four main crests as the anteroloph, protoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph {{from front to back}} and wrote that these crests are not connected {{on the sides of the}} tooth. Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the tooth. In Muscardinus, the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in Muscardinus sansaniensis to two in M.pliocaenicus and the living hazel dormouse, but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of the tooth. P4 is two-rooted in S.alpinus and three-rooted in S.bolligeri.|$|E
5|$|The front root {{is larger}} than the back one. In side view, the upper and <b>back</b> <b>margins</b> are straight, but the front margin is convex. There are eight cusps {{arranged}} in a row on the upper margin, the first of which is located about one third of the tooth's length from the front margin. Only the last is slightly worn, indicating that the tooth is from a young animal. Long ridges extend from the cusps diagonally toward the front on both the lingual and labial (outer) sides of the tooth. The first seven ridges on both sides are connected to the respective cusps, but the eighth ridges do not quite reach their cusp. On both sides of the tooth, there is also a small ridge behind the eighth ridge that extends to the back margin; these ridges are called the posterolabial and posterolingual ridge. An even smaller ridge is located below the ridge on the lingual side.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} colorless {{but has a}} dark median stripe visible {{internally}} in preservation. C. crucis is the smallest species of Colobodesmus. Males are 14 mm long and 4 mm wide, while the largest female is 16 mm in length and 5 mm in width. Their labrum and clypeus have 20 setae which go in series. The frontal area that is behind the series have more setae than the back part does. Their first segment is subrectangular, while the anterior part is almost squared. The fourth segment is narrow sided, with the fifth segment is under segment 4 and 6. The posterior margins are almost parallel with the rounded outer one. The gonopods are greatly diverged and are separated by a triangular lobe that comes out from the apex. The opening {{at the base of}} the gonopods is almost straight in front and across, while its rim is raised; the sides and <b>back</b> <b>margins</b> are curved.|$|R
50|$|The Conservative Party {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election, placing the Labour Party back in opposition, which served to push the Liberals <b>back</b> into the <b>margins.</b>|$|R
5|$|The molar is {{plane and}} hypsodont: the crowns are {{relatively}} {{high and the}} main cusps are about {{as high as the}} other parts of the crown, as they are in Holochilus. Most other oryzomyines have bunodont and brachydont molars, in which the crowns are lower and the cusps are higher {{than the rest of the}} crown. As in closely related species, the front part of the molar is relatively simple, lacking an anteroloph, an additional ridge that is well-developed in most oryzomyines. A shallow anteromedian flexus is present, superficially dividing the front cusp (anterocone). Uniquely, the anterior mure, which connects the anterocone to the rest of the crown, is absent; although this structure is sometimes missing in young individuals of other oryzomyines, it usually develops as a result of wear in adults. The two cusps on the middle part of the molar, the paracone and the protocone, are broadly connected. The median mure, which connects the middle to the back pair of cusps, is attached to the back of the paracone. A complete mesoloph is present, descending from the median mure slightly behind the paracone. The configuration of the paracone–median mure–mesoloph complex is unique to Carletonomys. The two posterior cusps, the hypocone and the metacone, are connected at the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the molar. Unlike in most oryzomyines, no posteroflexus is present, so that the metacone is situated directly at the <b>back</b> <b>margin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} upper tooth of Indraloris is an M3, YGSP 46009. It is broken {{at the back}} labial corner. The main cusp is protocone; among the other two cusps, the paracone is higher but the metacone larger. There is a spur {{at the back of}} the protocone, {{suggesting}} a rudimentary hypocone. The protocone is connected to the paracone by a protoloph, which lacks a small cusp (the paraconule). No crest connects the protocone to the metacone, but there is a cingulum at the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the tooth. The tooth bears a strong parastyle (accessory cusp at the front labial corner) and has three roots.|$|E
5|$|The single known {{example of}} Argentodites is a blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4). It has {{a length of}} 4.15mm, height of 2.10mm, and width of 1.35mm. The crown is nearly complete, but the roots are largely missing. Kielan-Jaworowska {{considered}} two possible orientations of the tooth—one with the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> nearly vertically, {{and the other with}} the margin inclined backwards—but preferred the former, which made for a more natural placement of the roots. Although the left and right sides of the tooth are almost identical, they believed the tooth is most likely a left p4, as this would make the lingual (inner) side the more convex one, as is usual in the p4 of cimolodontan multituberculates with a large p4.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, McClendon was {{notified}} that his shares {{were no longer}} valuable enough to <b>back</b> a <b>margin</b> loan with Goldman Sachs and other banks. In response, McClendon was forced to sell a majority of his 31.5 million shares, comprising 94% of his stake in Chesapeake and 6% of the company. The following year, Chesapeake offered McClendon a five-year retention contract, including a $75 million bonus.|$|R

50|$|The {{game was}} no {{different}} in the second half. Carlton kicked five of the first six goals {{of the third quarter}} to extend the lead to twelve goals before two goals in time-on brought the <b>margin</b> <b>back</b> to 59 points at three quarter time, and key Geelong playmaker Peter Riccardi tore his hamstring early in the third term. By time-on in the final quarter, Carlton had extended the margin to a game-high 84 points, before late goals brought the final <b>margin</b> <b>back</b> to 61 points. It was the second successive year that Geelong had been blown out in the grand final, after losing to West Coast the previous year by 80 points.|$|R
5|$|The {{wings are}} brown, but lighter {{than those of}} M.mystacinus. The plagiopatagium (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is {{attached}} to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1mm beyond the <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the uropatagium (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The calcar, a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip (except in one Croatian specimen). The baculum (penis bone) is about 0.5mm long. The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes M.alcathoe from M.brandtii as well as M.ikonnikovi.|$|E
5|$|With a {{body mass}} of , Drymoreomys is a {{medium-sized}} rodent with long fur that is orange to reddish-buff above and grayish with several white patches below. The pads on the hindfeet {{are very well}} developed and there is brown fur on the upper sides of the feet. The tail is brown above and below. The front part of the skull is relatively long and the ridges on the braincase are weak. The palate is short, with its <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> between the third molars. Several traits of the genitals are not seen in any other oryzomyine rodent.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{zygomatic}} plates (plates of bone at {{the side}} of the skull) are variable, their size is generally intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight to a little concave. The zygomatic notches, projections at the front of the plates, are better developed than in A.caenosus and A.sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of the palate. The <b>back</b> <b>margin</b> of the palate is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind the palate, the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A.sylvanus, A.simulator, and A.budini but broader than in A.caenosus.|$|E
