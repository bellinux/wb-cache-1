5|$|Among Kefalas' top {{priorities}} is restoring and expanding Colorado's {{earned income tax}} credit, a move which met with resistance from legislative leaders in 2007 due to budget constraints. Kefalas introduced a <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2008 session to restore Colorado's EITC at {{ten percent of the}} federal credit, but the bill was defeated in a House committee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, Rangel {{advocated}} continued funding of anti-poverty efforts, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Child care and development block grant. Rangel {{also had an}} unproductive relationship with Ways and Means chairman Bill Thomas, leading to an incident in which Thomas called the United States Capitol Police on Rangel for having his members read a <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> library, an action Thomas apologized for.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, the Philippine Senate {{passed a}} bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the {{national}} flower alongside Sampaguita. A similar <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, the bill would become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Prince finally {{succumbed to}} {{syphilis}} on 30 October 1713, sparking a succession crisis. Cosimo III deposited a <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tuscan senate, the nominal legislature, provisioning {{for a male}} line succession failure by making the Electress Palatine Gian Gastone's heiress. It passed and was disseminated to chancelleries across Europe. Austria refused to sanction it, fearing that Tuscany would fall into the Bourbons' hands. However, France and England did.|$|E

5|$|The Office of the Special Prosecutor {{was founded}} {{with the passage}} of a <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Icelandic {{parliament}} 10 December 2008. The aim was to investigate suspected criminal conduct leading up to, in connection with or {{in the wake of the}} banking crisis, whether these relate to the activities of financial undertakings, other legal entities or individuals, and, as appropriate, to follow up these investigations by bringing charges in court against those concerned.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} seen as entirely {{innocuous}} when it was introduced on January 16, 1956. It enjoyed bipartisan support, and on January 18 it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. It then fell to the Senate to consider the equivalent <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on February 20.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, the United States National Helium Reserve {{accounted}} for 30 {{percent of the}} world's helium. The reserve was expected {{to run out of}} helium in 2018. Despite that, a proposed <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were not expected to ease the shortage.|$|E

5|$|In August 2006, Union Cabinet of India assented to {{the demands}} of the Uttaranchal state {{assembly}} and leading members of the Uttarakhand statehood movement to rename Uttaranchal state as Uttarakhand. Legislation to that effect was passed by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly in October 2006, and the Union Cabinet brought in the <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter session of Parliament. The bill was passed by Parliament and signed into law by then President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam in December 2006, and since January 1, 2007 the state has been known as Uttarakhand.|$|E
5|$|Lord Grey's first {{announcement}} as Prime Minister was {{a pledge}} to carry out parliamentary reform. On 1 March 1831, Lord John Russell brought forward the Reform <b>Bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons on the government's behalf. The bill disfranchised 60 of the smallest boroughs, and reduced the representation of 47 others. Some seats were completely abolished, while others were redistributed to the London suburbs, to large cities, to the counties, and to Scotland and Ireland. Furthermore, the bill standardised and expanded the borough franchise, increasing {{the size of the}} electorate (according to one estimate) by half a million voters.|$|E
5|$|Other public bills {{could no}} longer be vetoed; instead, they could be delayed for up to two years. This two-year period meant that {{legislation}} introduced in the fourth or fifth years of a parliament could be delayed until after the next election, which could prove an effective measure to prevent it being passed. Specifically, two years had to elapse between the second reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the passing of the <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons in the third session. The Speaker has to also certify that the conditions of the bill had been complied with. Significant restrictions on amendments are made to ensure that it is the same bill that has been rejected twice. The 1911 Act made clear that the life of a parliament could not be extended without the consent of the Lords.|$|E

5|$|The Butler Stand {{roof was}} blown {{off in a}} storm in January 1976. The ground damage meant the club's next home game against Middlesbrough had to be played at Vale Park, the home of local rivals Port Vale. The repair <b>bill,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region of £250,000, put the club in {{financial}} trouble, which was eased by the sale of Alan Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff for a combined sum of £440,000. With the team depleted, relegation proved inevitable in the 1976–77 season. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} synopsis {{for both}} films {{was published in}} The Moving Picture World on January 14, 1911. The first film, Everybody Saves Father is focused on Jennie Gear, a young woman whose affections are sought by many men. Jennie's father thinks his daughter is {{too young to be}} married and drives off four of her suitors. One of the men, John, concocts a plan to save his life to win the man's approval. The plan is heard by another suitor, George, who decides to hire a rowboat to save the old man himself. This is over heard by George who concocts his own rescue to foil George. The plans go through without failure as each successive suitor's plan works to the actions of the other, and Henry wins the approval of Jennie's father. However, Jennie had already married <b>Bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mean time.|$|E
5|$|Various {{advocacy}} groups have given Biden scores or grades {{as to how}} well his votes align with the positions of each group. The American Civil Liberties Union gives him an 80 percent lifetime score, with a 91 percent score for the 110th Congress. Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources. Biden believes action must be taken on global warming. He co-sponsored the Sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United States {{to be a part}} of the United Nations climate negotiations and the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate. Biden was given an 85percent lifetime approval rating from AFL-CIO, and he voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).|$|E

5|$|A {{report that}} King Charles was very sick sent the Yorks back to England post-haste. They feared the King's eldest illegitimate son, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and {{commander}} of England's armed forces, might usurp the crown if Charles died in their absence. The matter {{was compounded by}} the fact that Monmouth enjoyed the support of the Exclusionists, who held a majority in the House of Commons of England. Charles survived but, feeling the Yorks returned to court too soon, sent James and Mary to Edinburgh, where they stayed on-and-off for the next three years. Lodging in Holyrood Palace, the Yorks had to make do without Ladies Anne and Isabella, who stayed in London on Charles's orders. The Yorks were recalled to London in February 1680, only to return again to Edinburgh that autumn; this time they went on a more honourable footing: James was created King's Commissioner to Scotland. Separated from Lady Isabella once again, Mary sank into a state of sadness, exacerbated by the passing of the Exclusion <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commons. Lady Isabella, thus far the only one of Mary's children to survive infancy, died in February 1681. Isabella's death plunged Mary into a religious mania, worrying her physician. At the same time as news reached Holyrood of Isabella's death, Mary's mother was falsely accused of offering £10,000 for the murder of the King. The accuser, a pamphleteer, was executed by order of the King.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives {{in an effort to}} resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the <b>bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E
5|$|Bill (W. Earl Brown) is a {{survivor}} who lives just outside Boston, {{and is a}} business partner of Joel and Tess. A paranoid, aggressive and distrustful {{man in his late}} forties, Bill lives alone in a heavily fortified town, laden with booby traps that include some captured Infected. During the game, Joel finds <b>Bill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope that he will pay off a debt by fixing up a car for them to drive to Tommy's, but Bill insists that the only working car battery is in the unexplored part of town. After fighting their way to the local high school, Bill discovers the battery he was going to use is missing. They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find themselves in an abandoned house, where Bill discovers his partner, Frank, has committed suicide by hanging there, and it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off, and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave the town.|$|E
