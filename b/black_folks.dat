500|$|Angelou {{was one of}} {{over two}} hundred Black American expatriates living in Accra at the time. [...] She {{was able to find}} a small group of expatriates, humorously dubbed [...] "the Revolutionary Returnees", who became her main source of support as she {{struggled}} with her place in African culture—"the conflicting feelings of being 'home' yet simultaneously being 'homeless,' cut off from America without tangible roots in their adopted black nation". For many Black Americans, {{it was the first time}} they were able to positively identify with Africa. [...] Angelou describes the group of Black American expatriates as [...] "a little group of <b>Black</b> <b>folks,</b> looking for a home". [...] Reviewer Jackie Gropman has stated that Angelou presents her readers with [...] "a wealth of information and penetrating impressions of the proud, optimistic new country of Ghana". [...] Angelou also presents a [...] "romanticized" [...] view of Africa. [...] She [...] "falls in love" [...] with Ghana and wishes to settle into her new home [...] "as a baby nuzzles in a mother's arms".|$|E
500|$|In {{the lyrics}} of [...] "KKK Bitch," [...] Ice-T {{describes}} a sexual encounter {{with a woman who}} he soon learns is the daughter of the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The lyrics go on to describe a scenario in which members of Body Count [...] "crash" [...] a Klan meeting to [...] "get buck wild with the white freaks". Ice-T makes humorous reference to [...] " [...] in love with Tipper Gore's two 12-year-old nieces", and ponders the possibility of the Grand Wizard coming after him [...] "when his grandson's named little Ice-T." [...] In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that [...] "'KKK Bitch' was ironic because the sentiments were true. We'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the South and the girls would always come backstage and tell us how their brothers and fathers didn't like <b>black</b> <b>folks.</b> [...] We knew that 'KKK Bitch' would totally piss off the Ku Klux Klan. There's humor in the song, but it fucks with them. It's on a punk tip." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Remember Paul?" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by David Grossman. It marked the debut of Vanessa Williams as Renee Perry, an old college rival of Lynette Scavo. The addition of Williams to the cast was announced after {{the close of the}} series' sixth season, as well as the finale of the ABC series Ugly Betty, in which Williams starred as Wilhelmina Slater. The character, who was originally named Renee Filmore-Jones, was conceived as a trouble-making vixen, similar to the Edie Britt character (Nicollette Sheridan), who appeared on the series until the fifth season. Following the casting announcement, Williams admitted to having been a fan of the series during its first year, but stopped watching because of the racially insensitive second season mystery storyline. It focused on Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), the series' first black main character. Williams explained to Entertainment Weekly, [...] " [...] had her son in chains in the basement. It was like, 'Really? Do we have to go there with our first Black character?' I honestly fell off the show after that. I think it was just so implausible and just an image that <b>Black</b> <b>folks</b> don't want to see their child chained and shackled in the basement." [...] Cast member Felicity Huffman commented on Williams' addition to the cast, saying [...] "She's such a great dash of vinegar to Wisteria Lane! It's going brilliantlyshe's a wonderful woman, she's really smart, she's really strong, a real team player. She's a great addition." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the racial}} makeup of Burning Man {{attendees}} in 2014, about 87 {{percent of them}} identified themselves as white, 6 percent as Hispanic/Latino, 6 percent as Asian, and 1 percent as black. When interviewed by The Guardian about these figures, Harvey replied, [...] "I don't think <b>black</b> <b>folks</b> like to camp as much as white folks ... We're not going to set racial quotas ...

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{saved by the}} {{financial}} intervention of prominent black Americans, some of whom appear in the film: Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Janet Jackson, Prince, and Peggy Cooper Cafritz, founder of the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. [...] Their contributions were made as donations; as Lee noted: [...] "This is not a loan. They are not investing in the film. These are <b>black</b> <b>folks</b> with some money {{who came to the}} rescue of the movie. As a result, this film will be my version. Not the bond company's version, not Warner Brothers'. I will do the film the way it ought to be, and it will be over three hours." [...] The actions of such prominent members of the African American community giving their money helped finish the project as Lee envisioned it.|$|E

AllMusic editor Andy Kellman praised its [...] "existential rhymes" [...] and found its ideas [...] "grave and penetrating". James Lachno from The Daily Telegraph was highly impressed by its music and how The Roots avoid [...] "over-moralising or glorification". Los Angeles Times writer Ernest Hardy said the record offers [...] "a psychological depth and complexity rarely afforded <b>black</b> <b>folks</b> in modern pop culture, including (or especially) the borough of contemporary hip-hop." [...] Jon Pareles, writing in The New York Times, {{said it is}} [...] "complete in itself ... made brief to be listened to as a whole." [...] In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot cited Undun as The Roots' best work and called it [...] "both chilling and beautiful at once". At the end of 2011, Kot named it the year's second best album, while Ann Powers from NPR Music ranked it tenth on her year-end list.|$|E

2500|$|... "Abolitionist" [...] {{had several}} {{meanings}} at the time. The followers of William Lloyd Garrison, including Wendell Phillips and Frederick Douglass, demanded the [...] "immediate abolition of slavery", hence the name. A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, like Theodore Weld and Arthur Tappan, wanted immediate action, but that action {{might well be}} a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage. [...] "Antislavery men", like John Quincy Adams, did what they could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but {{were not part of}} any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841 Adams represented the Amistad African slaves in the Supreme Court of the United States and argued that they should be set free. In the last years before the war, [...] "antislavery" [...] could mean the Northern majority, like Abraham Lincoln, who opposed expansion of slavery or its influence, as by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, or the Fugitive Slave Act. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians. James M. McPherson explains the abolitionists' deep beliefs: [...] "All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of <b>black</b> <b>folks</b> were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution." ...|$|E
