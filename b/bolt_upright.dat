500|$|Tippett {{began at}} the RCM in the summer term of 1923, when he was 18 years old. At the time, his biographer Meirion Bowen records, [...] "his {{aspirations}} were Olympian, though his knowledge rudimentary". Life in London widened his musical awareness, especially the Proms at the Queen's Hall, opera at Covent Garden (where he saw Dame Nellie Melba's farewell performance in La bohème) and the Diaghilev Ballet. He [...] heard Chaliapin sing, and attended concerts conducted by, among others, Stravinsky and Ravel—the last-named [...] "a tiny man who stood <b>bolt</b> <b>upright</b> and conducted with what to me looked like a pencil". Tippett overcame his initial ignorance of early music by attending Palestrina masses at Westminster Cathedral, following the music {{with the help of}} a borrowed score.|$|E

About {{one or two of the}} clock afternoon begins the play, in this sort, after a cry made both parties draw to into some plain, all first stripped bare saving a light pair of breeches, bare-headed, bare-bodied, bare legs and feet....The foot company thus meeting, there is a round ball prepared of a reasonable quantity so as a man may hold it in his hand and no more, this ball is of some massy wood as box, yew, crab or holly tree and should be boiled in tallow for m make it slippery and hard to hold. This ball is called cnapan and is by one of the company hurling <b>bolt</b> <b>upright</b> into the air, and at the fall he that catches it hurls it towards the country he plays for, for goal or appointed place there is none neither needs any, for the play is not given over until the cnapan be so far carried that there is no hope to return it back that night, for the carrying of it a mile or two miles from the first place is no losing of the honour so it be still followed by the company and the play still maintained, it is oftentimes seen the chase to follow two miles and more..." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of steel storage racks in the cross-aisle direction is typically ensured by cold-formed steel <b>bolted</b> <b>upright</b> frames. Sensitive to second-order effects, accurately determining the shear stiffness of these frames {{is essential for}} seismic design and for ensuring the {{stability of}} the rack, especially for high-bay racks and racks supporting the building enclosure, where the outer rack frames must withstand cross-aisle horizontal actions due to wind loading. The main international racking specifications adopt different approaches to determining the shear stiffness of cold-formed steel storage rack upright frames. The Rack Manufacturers Institute (RMI) specification conservatively uses Timoshenko and Gere's theory. The European Specification EN 15512 recommends testing, however {{it is not clear whether}} the shear stiffness obtained using the recommended test procedure is correct. The newly revised Australian Standard AS 4084 adopted the European approach but also introduced an alternative test method for determining the combined bending and shear stiffness of upright frames in the transverse direction. This paper reviews and analyses the factors influencing the shear deformation of cold-formed steel <b>bolted</b> <b>upright</b> frames and introduces the alternative test set-up adopted in the revised Australian Standard. 36 upright frames have been tested using the two test methods, and experimental results are presented, discussed and compared with finite element analysis results. Recommendations on how to use the test outcomes in design are also provided. Based on these recommendations, the paper shows that the two test methods are not equivalent and yield different results for the transverse shear stiffness of upright frames.

He listens to his father’s voice get louder, the words harsher. Suddenly, his father bursts into the room and drags him and his younger brother out of their beds. Then they are in a car, speeding toward their Uncle Rocky’s house. Once they are inside, everything becomes a blur. There is blood on the couch and all over the living room floor and his father is screaming at his uncle, and again Tony does not know why. His brother starts screaming, too, and Tony wants to tell him it will be alright but his lips won’t form the words. Tony <b>bolts</b> <b>upright</b> in bed, covered in sweat, his heart pounding.

40|$|The {{stability}} of steel storage racks, {{which are often}} unbraced, may depend solely on the pallet beam to upright connector and on the stiffness of the base plate to floor connection. This paper presents experimental results from cyclic tests performed on portal beam to <b>upright</b> <b>bolted</b> moment connections intended for cold-formed steel drive-in and drive-through storage racks. In storage racks, portal beams are typically connected to uprights by "tab connectors", which are costly to manufacture and experience initial looseness. By simply bolting the portal beams to the <b>uprights,</b> <b>bolted</b> moment connections may represent a cost-effective alternative to "tab connectors". A literature review shows that bolted moment connections between cold-formed steel members are economical and feasible. However, experimental results show {{a significant amount of}} looseness in the connection after an initial high moment-rotational stiffness. Being slender structures, storage racks are sensitive to the second-order P-? effect, and international racking specifications require the initial looseness of the tab connectors to be considered when analysing the {{stability of}} the rack in the down-aisle direction (sway motion). The non-linear cyclic behaviour of bolted moment connections is presented and explained herein. Based on finite element results, it is shown that, for drive-in and drive-through racks, the looseness in bolted moment connections can be ignored in ultimate limit states design. Finally, the paper concludes with proposing two methods, with different degree of complexity, for the design of drive-in and drive-through racks with bolted portal beam to <b>upright</b> <b>bolted</b> moment connections.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the stiffness and strength of steel storage rack base plate assemblies. Base plate assemblies are usually <b>bolted</b> to an <b>upright</b> and to a concrete floor, and {{they are used to}} provide resistance against the flexural buckling of the upright and/or the overall down-aisle buckling of the frame. The semi-rigid stiffness is usually determined by means of a test of two pre-loaded uprights connected to a concrete block in a dual-actuator set-up. Guidance for conducting the test is provided in the European Standard EN 15512. However, several aspects of the test need clarification, notably the test set-up and the transducer arrangement for measuring the rotations of the base plate. This paper provides recommendations for how best to conduct the test, and proposes an alternative test method to that given in the EN 15512 Specification. The paper also identifies the contributions to the deformations of base plate assemblies, including the deformations of the supporting floor, the base plate assembly itself and the upright, and proposes simple expressions for calculating the stiffness associated with each contributing deformation where applicable. Furthermore, the paper proposes a deformation criterion for determining the ultimate design moment for base plate tests which do not attain a peak moment.
