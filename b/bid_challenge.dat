In the view of the author, even though Hong Kong has a relatively small procurement market, it combines the features of a clean and effective government and a highly internationalised procurement market, and thus makes an interesting subject of study. In this article, the author examines the efforts made by the Hong Kong Government to implement its obligation under the GPA to provide challenge procedures. The article starts by reviewing Hong Kong 2 ̆ 7 s participation in the government procurement agreements under the GATT and WTO, and then sets out the general background to the Review Body for Bid Challenges of Hong Kong. In the next section, the article discusses in detail the <b>bid</b> <b>challenge</b> procedures and how such procedural rules have been applied and elaborated through the cases that came before the Review Body. The article concludes by noting that the <b>bid</b> <b>challenge</b> system in Hong Kong generally conforms to its GPA obligations...|$|E

The saga of Modern Wo’Er Trading Company Ltd. v The Ministry of Finance of the People’s Republic of China raises compelling questions about the relationship of China’s 1999 Tender and Bidding Law and China’s 2002 Government Procurement Law, the nature of administrative power in China, and the ability of Chinese public procurement law to offer justice to aggrieved supplier...|$|E

In order to implement the Free Trade Agreement and the provisions of Chapter 13, the Canadian federal government created a new administrative agency, the Procurement Review Board of Canada (the Board), to adjudicate government procurement disputes. The Board is the focus of this article. Because the Board is charged with adjudicating contract disputes arising under Chapter 13 of the FTA, its decisions provide an insight into whether Chapter 13 is creating 2 ̆ 2 for Canada an international undertaking to provide an equitable (i. e. procedurally fair), transparent (i. e. all details known at outset) and effective <b>bid</b> <b>challenge</b> system. 2 ̆...|$|E

40|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} of mobile communication technologies and increased capabilities of smart terminals, the multimedia service {{has become one}} of the most attractive applications in mobile Internet. And the combination of social-based mobile multimedia and mobile peer-to-peer (P 2 P) network has attracted increasing research interests in recent years. However, how to deploy large scale P 2 P-based social multimedia applications over MANETs has become a <b>bid</b> <b>challenge.</b> In this paper, we propose a Propagation-based Content Dissemination solution for Social Interactive Multimedia services over MANETs (PSIM). In PSIM, the video content propagation problem is formulated as an Epidemic Information Dissemination (SIR) model. Based on the chunk-based dissemination model and analysis, a novel Propagation-based Video Chunk Demands Estimation Algorithm and a Stability-based Cooperative Carrier Selection Mechanism are proposed to estimate the video chunk demands and choose stable cooperative cache nodes, respectively. Simulation results show how PSIM achieves better performance in comparison with another state-of-art solution...|$|E
40|$|As {{one of the}} {{original}} contracting parties to the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) since the Tokyo Round, Hong Kong also participated actively in the negotiations to improve the GPA during the Uruguay Round and joined the new GPA shortly after it entered into force in 1996. In order to ensure effective enforcement of the obligations, the new GPA explicitly requires Members to establish a challenge procedure and this has been praised as “arguably the most innovative aspect” of the GPA. 1 As explained by Arrowsmith: “[i]n providing for a detailed system of supplier remedies the GPA marks a departure from the approach of most other WTO agreements. In general, these do not require affected private parties to be given a right to enforce WTO rules, but rely mainly on inter-governmental enforcement. Private challenge procedures are required under some of these provisions, but *P. P. L. R. 212 none go as far as the GPA. In particular, their procedural requirements and obligations on remedies are not as detailed or stringent as those of the GPA and they generally give greater deference to states' own national traditions of review in the particular area concerned. ” 2 While there has been an extensive literature on the challenge procedure of the GPA in general, 3 as well as excellent country studies on the operation of the national challenge procedures of several key GPA Members, 4 no such study has been conducted for Hong Kong yet.

In such an environment, the question arises of how the nearly universally documented phenomenon of loss aversion affects the adaptive dynamics.

Our experimental results suggest that individual learning dynamics are highly heterogeneous and affected by loss aversion to different degrees. Apart from that, the experiment shows that loss aversion is not specific to rare decision-making. ...|$|R
