The label had a number of female singers signed up including Peggy Lee, Ella Mae Morse, Jo Stafford and Margaret Whiting, so it was hard to find her a niche of her own. In 1948 when the American Federation of Musicians was threatening a strike, Capitol wanted to have each of its singers record a <b>back</b> <b>list</b> for future release. Being junior to all these other artists meant that every song Starr wanted to sing was taken by her rivals on the label, leaving her a list of old songs which nobody else wanted to record.|$|E

There are many possible occupational hazards, but this review is intended to concentrate on common hazards and safety con-cerns.

Suggestions are made regarding how to identify potential hazards and avoid them.

40|$|Please {{join us for}} {{a special}} session at ACRL 2013 in Indianapolis to learn about three {{different}} library-led publishing programs – digital monographs at Utah State University, undergraduate journals and conferences at Illinois Wesleyan University, and technical reports at Purdue University – and the impact they have had on each university’s broader mission. By lowering barriers and creating opportunities to publish across the entire continuum of scholarly content, these libraries have found new ways to support faculty research, the student experience, and the public university’s role in the state. At Utah State, the library has enhanced its University Press by bringing new visibility to <b>back</b> <b>list</b> books, and has supported new faculty research with a platform for digitally-native open access monographs and experiments in new digital formats. At Illinois Wesleyan, the library helps the university deliver high-impact learning practices by giving students the tools of scholarly publishing. And at Purdue University, the library publishes an extensive series of technical reports {{in partnership with the}} State of Indiana, bringing professional publishing services and much greater visibility to state-funded research. Speakers will reflect on how they have made the case for their publishing program to the university as a whole, including the quantitative and qualitative metrics that they’ve used to articulate the impact of their programs. As library-led publishing programs grow, many librarians need ways to articulate the value and impact of these programs to their universities, and we hope that this panel will provide a variety of models and ideas...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} stage history of six plays and three seasons of Shakespeare at the Old Vic as they are related to one man: Sir John Gielgud. Through the {{assembly}} of various sorts of evidence ranging from promptbooks, sound-recordings, reviews, programmes, interviews, correspondence, designer's blue-prints, I have attempted to reconstruct the performances and the productions in order to assess Gielgud's contribution as a Shakespearean actor and director. The plays looked at are Richard II, Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing, King Lear and The Tempest, the Old Vic seasons those from 1929 to 1931. Each chapter, except for the first on the Old Vic which considers a repertory of productions of different plays performed by the same company, examines a series of separate productions of one play in chronological sequence to highlight developments in Gielgud's technique over the years and his response to the more widespread changes {{in the tradition of the}} stage interpretation of Shakespeare. So the selection of roles and productions was governed by the idea of examining trends and to set Gielgud's work in the context of the accumulating tradition of the play's interpretation in performance, not to look at single productions only. The resulting selection focuses on Gielgud, the actor and director, at various points throughout his entire career. The earliest production considered is in 1929, the latest in 1974. The conclusion then attempts to draw Gielgud's involvement with Richard II, Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing, King Lear and The Tempest together to establish an overall view of their relationship in the light of the principal currents of change in the theatre from the early part of this century to the present day. The appendices at the <b>back</b> <b>list</b> the full range of Gielgud's Shakespeare, including his film appearances, and the dates of openings with complete casts of the productions concentrated on in the text. ...|$|E
