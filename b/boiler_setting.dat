The feel of manual controls such as knobs, sliders, and buttons becomes critical when those controls are used in certain settings. Appropriate feel enables designers to create consistent control behaviors that lead to improved usability and safety. For example, a heavy knob with stiff detents for a power plant <b>boiler</b> <b>setting</b> may afford better feedback and safer operations, whereas subtle detents in an automobile radio volume knob may afford improved ergonomics and driver attention to the road. To assess {{the quality of our}} identification method we compared previously reported automated model captures for five real mechanical reference knobs with captures by novice and expert human participants who were asked to adjust four parameters of a rendered knob model to match the feel of each reference knob. Participants indicated their satisfaction with the matches their renderings produced. We observed similar relative inertia, friction, detent strength, and detent spacing parameterizations by human experts and our automatic estimation methods. Qualitative results provided insight on users ʼ strategies and confidence. While experts (but not novices) were better able to ascertain an underlying model in the presence of un-modeled dynamics, the objective algorithm outperformed all humans when an appropriate physical model was used. Our studies demonstrate that automated model identification can capture knob dynamics as perceived by a human, and they also establish limits to that ability; they comprise a step towards pragmatic design guidelines for embedded physical interfaces in which methodological expedience is informed by human perceptual requirements...|$|E

50|$|A typical large {{stationary}} engine {{of this time}} used a number of lancashire <b>boilers,</b> <b>set</b> in brickwork surrounds. These took a considerable time to build their masonry, let alone install the equipment. The vertical cross-tube boilers used for small portable machinery such as steam cranes had much less steam generation capacity and could only run at full power intermittently. Locomotive boilers though, as used here, had greater capacity and could provide a mechanical plant that could run continuously for long periods. Robey also built some examples, around 1886, with launch-type boilers.|$|R

Magnolia's crew exploded one of her <b>boilers,</b> <b>set</b> her afire, and attempted to escape; but South Carolina captured the Southerner's boats, boarded the flaming steamer, and put out the fire. In March, South Carolina received orders to return to Boston where she was decommissioned on 8 April for badly needed repairs.|$|R

500|$|The batch was {{constructed}} at Ashford works and incorporated several refinements based upon operational experience with No.822 and were given <b>boilers</b> <b>set</b> at [...] The other change was the discontinuation of the Holcroft valve gear {{because of the}} difficulty experienced in acquiring suitable spare parts for the prototype. The Southern Railway had also upgraded the permanent way on many of the former SECR routes by 1929, removing many of the weight restrictions that inspired the use of the Holcroft gear in the first place. Maunsell was therefore free to use three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear driven by the centre driving wheels and the crank axle, a system that was easier to maintain due to the wide availability of parts.|$|R

50|$|A pressuretrol is {{a control}} {{used to control}} a steam <b>boiler,</b> by <b>setting</b> when the <b>boiler</b> should begin and end firing based on steam pressure.

25|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of the side-lever engine were {{that it was}} large and heavy, and for inland waterway and coastal service, it was soon replaced by lighter and more efficient designs. It remained the dominant engine type for oceangoing service {{through much of the}} first half of the 19th century however, due to its relatively low centre of gravity which gave ships more stability in heavy seas. It was also a common early engine type for warships, since its relatively low height made it less susceptible to battle damage. From the first Royal Navy steam vessel in 1820 until 1840, 70 steam vessels entered service, the majority with side-lever engines, using <b>boilers</b> <b>set</b> to 4psi maximum pressure. The low steam pressures dictated the large cylinder sizes for the side-lever engines, though the effective pressure on the piston was the difference between the boiler pressure and the vacuum in the condenser.|$|R

[...] The <b>boilers</b> were <b>set</b> to produce only 120 pounds of steam, rather than the 180 pounds to be carried in service. [...] The stern-wheel was also revolved more slowly, at 21 revolutions per minute rather than the 30 turns a minute when the boat was under full speed.

50|$|After this treatment, {{the water}} had to be {{pre-heated}} {{before moving on to}} the boilers in order to increase the combustion’s thermal output. For this, the steam recovered from the turbines was used inside the heating tanks, thereby provoking a thermal exchange and obtaining a temperature of 130°C. At this temperature, the only thing that remained was to get the water to a certain pressure before directing it to the <b>boilers.</b> The <b>set</b> of pumps in the Water Room guaranteed it would travel, since it placed the water at a pressure of 52kg/cm2, enough to overcome the opposing pressure in the boilers’ steam drums.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} plumbing in the UK, the space-heating <b>boiler</b> is <b>set</b> up to heat {{a separate}} {{hot water cylinder}} or water heater for potable hot water. Such water heaters are often fitted with an auxiliary electrical immersion heater for use if the boiler is out of action for a time. Heat from the space-heating boiler is transferred to the water heater vessel/container {{by means of a}} heat exchanger, and the boiler operates at a higher temperature than the potable hot water supply. Most potable water heaters in North America are completely separate from the space heating units, due to the popularity of HVAC/forced air systems in North America.|$|R

The station's reactors were supplied by the National Nuclear Corporation, and the station's generating sets by the General Electric Company.Some fourteen years into construction, {{the first of the}} station's two units were commissioned in 1983, the other in 1985.The station first generated electricity commercially on 1 August 1983.|$|R
5000|$|The Péchot-Bourdon {{locomotive}} was {{the final}} development of the Fairlie type. The Péchot-Bourdon was developed by Captain Péchot of the French artillery to operate on [...] gauge railways associated with field artillery and fortresses. The design was chosen {{with the belief that}} if one <b>boiler</b> or <b>set</b> of valve gear was damaged by enemy fire, the loco could continue to operate. The primary difference between a Fairlie and the Péchot-Bourdon is that the latter only had one steam dome. Only one design was constructed, a 0-4-4-0. About fifty examples were constructed in 1906, and a further 280 were constructed during World War I, some by the American Baldwin Locomotive Works.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{they were}} too heavy for use on light track, the fourth batch version of the {{rebalanced}} locomotives was reclassified to Class 14CM, with the [...] "M" [...] indicating mainline service.

The <b>boiler</b> pressure <b>setting</b> of rebalanced locomotives of the fourth batch was not altered and remained at [...] It is not clear which of these reboilering and rebalancing modifications were carried out first, one, the other, either one or together, but in whichever order, all twelve rebalanced locomotives were eventually also reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14CRM.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{the first}} British warship to be powered by {{vertical}} compound engines, carrying cylindrical high-pressure boilers with a working pressure of , as compared to rectangular boilers working at [...] pressure mounted in earlier ships. Twelve <b>boilers</b> were <b>set</b> back to back {{on either side of}} a longitudinal bulkhead; each engine drove an outward rotating screw of some 21 ft in diameter. A pair of auxiliary engines, each of , were fitted to turn the screws while the ship was proceeding under sail. These engines could, if required, propel the ship at a speed of 14.5 kn. At the time of her completion Alexandra was the fastest battleship afloat.|$|R
