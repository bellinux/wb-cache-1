By 1975, AMD entered the microprocessor market with the Am9080, a reverse-engineered clone of the Intel 8080, and the Am2900 <b>bit-slice</b> microprocessor family.

25|$|The Nord-100 was {{introduced}} in 1979, which was specialized at flexibility and focused on administrative applications. When Digital launched their VAX-11 in 1977, Norsk Data had the Nord-5 32-bit computer ready for CERN. As the VAX-11 was 32-bit and regarded as a superminicomputer, Norsk Data did not initially {{see it as a}} competitor since the Nord-5 had much better processing power. Nord-50 had similar processing power to the Nord-5, but was not a general-purpose computer. The 32 bit computer used a Nord-10 front processor that ran the SINTRAN III operating system. Development of the ND-500 started in 1978 and had so fundamental changes to the system architecture (was not made from <b>bit-slice</b> components but microprammed with a new instruction set) that all software had to be rewritten - except for the SINTRAN. The computer was launched in 1981, but with fundamental shortcomings imposed by the OS It was much faster than the VAX, but did not meet the general customers' expectation of being a multi-purpose computer. Later models improved the performance and tweaking of the system allowed it to become a multipurpose system.at the performance of a special purpose super computer as sold by Cray. A major contract with the ND-500 was the Joint European Torus project, which took delivery of twenty-seven ND-100 and -500 units. Development of the ND-5000 started before the ND-500 was completed. The design was changed to become more modular; this increased the development costs, but reduced production costs and increased scalability. On the ND5000, components were placed in cards that were interconnected, initially to simplify cooling but also to enable the high clock frequency If an electric current is switched at a clock frequency of 1GHz, it travel about one foot per cycle, so 10cm is a delay of a clock cycle at 3GHz. The ND-500 computers had timing problems caused by wire-distance, and going faster just required everything to be close.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bit-slicing</b> is a non-conventional {{implementation}} {{technique for}} cryptographic software where an n-bit processor is {{considered as a}} collection of n 1 -bit execution units operating in SIMD mode. Particularly when implementing symmetric ciphers, the <b>bit-slicing</b> approach has several advantages over more conventional alternatives: it often allows one to reduce memory footprint by eliminating large look-up tables, and it permits more predictable performance characteristics that can foil time based side-channel attacks. Both features are attractive for mobile and embedded processors, but the performance overhead that results from <b>bit-sliced</b> implementation often represents a significant disadvantage. In this paper we describe a set of light-weight Instruction Set Extensions (ISEs) that can improve said performance while retaining all advantages of <b>bit-sliced</b> implementation. Contrary to other crypto-ISE, our design is generic and allows for a high degree of algorithm agility: we demonstrate applicability to several well-known cryptographic primitives including four block ciphers (DES, Serpent, AES, and PRESENT), a hash function (SHA- 1), as well as multiplication of ternary polynomials...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the {{availability}} of <b>bit-slice</b> and 16-bit microprocessors started to revolutionize high-resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent, semi-standalone and standalone workstations. Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and mini-computers. Typical of the early move to high-resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from Bell-Northern Research, and led by David Pearson, an early workstation pioneer. The Orca 3000 was based on Motorola 68000 and AMD <b>bit-slice</b> processors and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector. Artists and graphic designers {{began to see the}} personal computer, particularly the Commodore Amiga and Macintosh, as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods. [...] The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use graphical user interfaces (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of multimedia technology.|$|E
