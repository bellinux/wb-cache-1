6000|$|... "It was indeed, sir. At {{one time}} they fairly drove us back, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should have beaten them {{even if you}} had not brought help to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{thought we}} heard musketry," [...] the colonel replied, [...] "but {{it might have}} been only fancy. There is such a hullabaloo in the city that we might not have heard the fire of small-arms, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must have heard artillery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stickly-Prickly,' said Tortoise after breakfast, 'I am {{not what}} <b>I</b> was yesterday; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may yet amuse Painted Jaguar.|$|R
60|$|Be it so. I {{hope it is}} so. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not so}} easy {{to believe}} it as we fancy.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How many? There were five, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> fellow {{down there}} sold one; <b>but</b> then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he bought another. I {{know he did}} something.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, sir. Since we had {{our recent}} {{conversation}} I fancy I have found what may prove a solution. I {{do not wish to}} appear to be taking a liberty, sir, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have overlooked his grace's potentialities as a source of revenue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} the {{coincidence}} must indeed be an extraordinary one. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall succeed {{in establishing a}} connection after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as one of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton, but his wife as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a little}} plot of our own, aunt," [...] Netta said. [...] "We {{are trying to get}} on Walter's track in our own way, and to be for a time amateur detectives. So far we have not found any decisive clew, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are searching in the right direction. Please trust us entirely, and we hope some day we shall have the triumph of {{bringing}} Walter back, safe and sound." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Ferris {{remained}} silently troubled. [...] "I don't {{know how}} to answer you, Henry; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you're judging him narrowly and harshly." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. COADE (undoubtedly hopeful). We mustn't be too sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is it. (Primly.) What is {{it exactly}} that you want, Mr. Coade? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{when they}} see the {{regiment}} marching along, and hear the bugles, they will clear out fast enough of their own accord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The wail hath fallen in, {{the stair}} is blocked, {{and the fire}} still rages below. By Saint Paul! friends, we have fought a very honorable fight, and may say in all humbleness {{that we have done}} our devoir, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may now go back to the Lady Tiphaine and say our orisons, for we have played our parts in this world, and it is time that we made ready for another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sara, I {{have been}} dreaming since then, and I thought that when my people got to {{understand}} me a little more, to trust me and believe in me, I would go to them and say 'I am {{going to give you}} a Queen. Only I am a man as you are men, and I must choose as you have chosen, the one woman who has my heart.' And, Sara, there might have been difficulties, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should have smoothed them away----" ...|$|E
60|$|Well--it {{is not for}} us {{to judge}} any one, {{especially}} if {{they live in a}} part of the world in which we have not been ourselves. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know, and that they ought to have known, enough about earthquakes to have been more prudent than they have been for many a year. At least we will hope that, though they would not learn their lesson till this year, they will learn it now, and will listen to the message which I think Madam How has brought them, spoken in a voice of thunder, and written in letters of flame.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{you asked}} me to stay, I was very pleased to do so, and always should be; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> now <b>I</b> will wish you good-bye.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} about what you said about the garrison of Turin. I have been talking it over with Paolo, and have come to offer to do my best to deliver a letter from you to the garrison if you will do me the great honour to entrust the mission to me. We both think that two boys would be much more likely to succeed than men. No one would regard them with suspicion; and they could creep and crawl more easily. I do not say that we should succeed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should have some chance of doing so. At any rate I am willing to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am convinced," [...] he said, [...] "that if unaided from within, {{the ships}} {{will have no}} chance {{whatever}} of taking this fortress; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may help them. The upper fort, which contains the magazine, commands {{the whole of the}} interior. But its guns do not bear upon the ships where they are anchored. Probably the place, at present, is almost deserted. As no one pays any attention to us, I propose, with Tim Kelly and the ten English sailors, to seize it. We can close the gate, and discharge the guns upon the defenders of the sea face. We could not, of course, defend it for five minutes if they attacked us; but we would threaten to blow up the magazine, if they did so.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you have}} said such hard things! How are we to stay? You speak of Felix {{as though he were}} all bad.' She looked at him hoping to get from him some contradiction of this, some retractation, some kindly word; but it was what he did think, and he had nothing to say. She could bear much. She was not {{delicate}} as to censure implied, or even expressed. She had endured rough usage before, and was prepared to endure more. Had he found fault with herself, or with Henrietta, she would have put up with it, for the sake of benefits to come,--would have forgiven it the more easily because perhaps it might not have been deserved. But for her son she was prepared to fight. If she did not defend him, who would? 'I am grieved, Roger, that we should have troubled you with our visit, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had better go. You are very harsh, and it crushes me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They would {{certainly}} be useless as daggers, Matteo, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> with care they will act as saws. Break off a length of about a foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well,--yes. I don't {{know the}} young lady, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> upon the whole I do like it. It's quite time, you know, {{that he got}} married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Amos," [...] said De Catinat, [...] "I {{have spent}} my life among brave men, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{this is the}} bravest man that I have ever met!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was not remiss {{in telling}} himself all this. He did draw the {{comparison}} ruthlessly between the character {{which he had}} intended {{to make his own}} and that which he now had justly earned. He did not excuse himself. We are told to love others as ourselves, and it is hard to do so. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> never hate others, never despise others, as we are sometimes compelled by our own convictions and self-judgment to hate and to despise ourselves. Harry, as he walked home on this evening, was lost in disgust at his own conduct. He could almost have hit his head against the walls, or thrown himself beneath the wagons as he passed them, so thoroughly was he ashamed of his own life. Even now, on this evening, he had escaped from Onslow Crescent--basely escaped--without having declared any purpose. Twice on this day he had escaped, almost by subterfuges; once from Burton's office, and now again from Cecilia's presence. How long was this to go on, or how could life be endurable to him under such circumstances? ...|$|E
60|$|Those {{of us who}} are not in the asylum, and not demonstrably due there, are {{nevertheless}} {{no doubt}} insane in one or two particulars--I think we must admit this; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are otherwise healthy-minded. I think that when we all see one thing alike, it is evidence that as regards that one thing, our minds are perfectly sound. Now there are really several things which we do all see alike; things which we all accept, and about which we do not dispute. For instance, we who are outside of the asylum all agree that water seeks its level; that the sun gives light and heat; that fire consumes; that fog is damp; that 6 times 6 are thirty-six; that 2 from 10 leave eight; that 8 and 7 are fifteen. These are perhaps the only things we are agreed about; but although they are so few, they are of inestimable value, because they make an infallible standard of sanity. Whosoever accepts them we know to be substantially sane; sufficiently sane; in the working essentials, sane. Whoever disputes a single one of them we know to be wholly insane, and qualified for the asylum.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like this}} newer way of taking your photograph, against a mere grey background; just {{the head of}} you. One should always beware of the {{property}} furniture of the photographer. In the seventies they were great at such aids--a pedestal, a cork rustic stile, wide landscape in the distance, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are at least getting beyond that now. People in those days must have been afraid {{to be left alone}} before a camera, or they wanted it to seem that they were taken unawares, quite against their modesty--did not know what the camera was, and were just looking at it. A very favourite pose for girls was a graceful droop over a sofa, chin on elegant hand. When I was at Dribblebridge--I was a bright young fellow then--I collected a number of local photographs, ladies chiefly, and the thing was very noticeable when I put them in a row over my mantleshelf. The local 'artist' was intensely fond of that pose. But fancy the local leader finding her cook drooping over the same sofa as herself! Nowadays, I see, you get merely the heads of your girls, with their hair flossed up, intense light from above, and faces in shadow. I think it is infinitely better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Edith," [...] he had said, [...] "you {{know that}} I am unwilling to oppose you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in this your {{feelings}} are carrying you too far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so. Of course, I didn't get a {{very good}} look at him--I had my hands full with the horse. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is the man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Frank to his neighbour, [...] "it may be {{very well}} once in a way; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> on the whole Dr Thorne is right." ...|$|R
6000|$|The rest of {{the things}} in the casino I shall pass over, as also those in the coffee-house,--an edifice which stands a hundred yards or more from the casino, with an {{ornamental}} garden, laid out in walks and flower-plats between. The coffee-house has a semicircular sweep of porch with a good many statues and busts beneath it, chiefly of distinguished Romans. In this building, as in the casino, there are curious mosaics, large vases of rare marble, and many other things worth long pauses of admiration; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were all happier when we had done with the works of art, and were at leisure to ramble about the grounds. The Villa Albani itself is an edifice separate from both the coffee-house and casino, and is not opened to strangers. It rises, palace-like, {{in the midst of the}} garden, and, it is to be hoped, has some possibility of comfort amidst its splendors.--Comfort, however, would be thrown away upon it; for besides that the site shares the curse that has fallen upon every pleasant place in the vicinity of Rome, [...] . it really has no occupant except the servants who take care of it. The Count of Castelbarco, its present proprietor, resides at Milan. The grounds are laid out in the old fashion of straight paths, with borders of box, which form hedges of great height and density, and as even as a brick wall at the top and sides. There are also alleys forming long vistas between the trunks and beneath the boughs of oaks, ilexes, and olives; and there are shrubberies and tangled wildernesses of palm, cactus, rhododendron, and I know not what; and a profusion of roses that bloom and wither with nobody to pluck and few to look at them. They climb about the sculpture of fountains, rear themselves against pillars and porticos, run brimming over the walls, and strew the path with their falling leaves. We stole a few, and feel that we have wronged our consciences in not stealing more. In one part of the grounds we saw a field actually ablaze with scarlet poppies. There are great lagunas; fountains presided over by naiads, who squirt their little jets into basins; sunny lawns; a temple, so artificially ruined that we half believed it a veritable antique; and at its base a reservoir of water, in which stone swans seemed positively to float; groves of cypress; balustrades and broad flights of stone stairs, descending to lower levels of the garden; beauty, peace, sunshine, and antique repose on every side; and far in the distance the blue hills that encircle the campagna of Rome. The day was very fine for our purpose; cheerful, but not too bright, and tempered by a breeze that seemed even a little too cool when we sat long in the shade. We enjoyed it till three o'clock.

6000|$|The {{analytic}} tendency {{seems to}} have increased with him as his work has gone on. Some of the earlier tales were very dramatic: [...] "A Passionate Pilgrim," [...] which I should rank above all his other short stories, and for certain rich poetical qualities, above everything else that he has done, is eminently dramatic. But I do not find much that I should call dramatic in [...] "The Portrait of a Lady," [...] while I do find in it an amount of analysis which I should call superabundance {{if it were not}} all such good literature. The novelist's main business is to possess his reader with a due conception of his characters and the situations in which they find themselves. If he does more or less than this he equally fails. I have sometimes thought that Mr. James's danger was to do more, but when I have been ready to declare this excess an error of his method I have hesitated. Could anything be superfluous that had given me so much pleasure as I read? Certainly from only one point of view, and this a rather narrow, technical one. It seems to me that an enlightened criticism will recognize in Mr. James's fiction a metaphysical genius working to aesthetic results, and will not be disposed to deny it any method it chooses to employ. No other novelist, except George Eliot, has dealt so largely in analysis of motive, has so fully explained and commented upon the springs of action in the persons of the drama, {{both before and after the}} facts. These novelists are more alike than any others in their processes, but with George Eliot an ethical purpose is dominant, and with Mr. James an artistic purpose. I do not know just how it should be stated of two such noble and generous types of character as Dorothea and Isabel Archer, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> sympathize with the former in grand aims that chiefly concern others, and with the latter in beautiful dreams that primarily concern herself. Both are unselfish and devoted women, sublimely true to a mistaken ideal in their marriages; but, though they come to this common martyrdom, the original difference in them remains. Isabel has her great weaknesses, as Dorothea had, but these seem to me, on the whole, the most nobly imagined and the most nobly intentioned women in modern fiction; and I think Isabel is the more subtly divined of the two. If we speak of mere characterization, we must not fail to acknowledge the perfection of Gilbert Osmond. It was a profound stroke to make him an American by birth. No European could realize so fully in his own life the ideal of a European dilettante in all the meaning of that cheapened word; as no European could so deeply and tenderly feel the sweetness and loveliness of the English past as the sick American, Searle, in [...] "The Passionate Pilgrim." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{rave reviews}} and an {{excellent}} reputation as a live band, plus a growing fanbase, the band's career was set back by Bickers's refusal to tour America following an incident on the band's first American tour in which the band was caught in crossfire during a gun battle between police and a criminal gang. This led to tension between Bickers and the other members, culminating in Bickers departing the band, acrimoniously, in 1993. Bickers famously quit Levitation onstage during a London concert, announcing [...] "We've lost it, haven't we?" [...] Bic Hayes would later comment [...] "It had happened a few times before that last gig <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> all knew very early on at (that) one {{that there was no}} going back again." [...] Years later, Bickers would speak about his departure with regret and shame, but claim that his mounting depression had {{had much to do with}} the manner of his departure.|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. 'I can't quite remember, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{is why she}} didn't take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> Billy boy is to be there, my love.' ...|$|R
