5|$|Boron carbide and cubic <b>boron</b> <b>nitride</b> powders {{are widely}} used as abrasives. <b>Boron</b> <b>nitride</b> is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive.

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} boron on {{microstructure}} and creep deformation behavior {{has been investigated}} for a tempered martensitic 9 Cr- 3 WVNb steel with emphasis {{on the role of}} boron free from <b>boron</b> <b>nitrides.</b> Creep tests were carried out at 650 o C for up to about 3 x 10 4 h, using specimens of 10 mm in gauge diameter and 50 mm in gauge length. The addition of boron in combination with no nitrogen addition effectively reduces the coarsening rate of M 23 C 6 carbides by an enrichment of boron in M 23 C 6 particles in the vicinity of prior austenite grain boundaries during creep at 650 o C. This stabilizes martensitic microstructure during creep and retards the onset of acceleration creep, resulting in a decrease in minimum creep rate and an increase in creep life.

30|$|Thus, one can {{conclude}} that surface reconstruction in <b>boron</b> <b>nitrides</b> with layered (both flat and tubular) structures involves splitting the surface atomic layer into two, upper and lower, sublayers, which consist of atoms with negative and positive effective charges, respectively.

The atom-ion ratio {{was related to the}} final boron concentration as determined by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS), and to the bonding structure explored by infrared (IR) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopies. IR and XANES revealed that N-rich <b>boron</b> <b>nitrides</b> had a graphite-like structure with embedded nitrogen molecules, while B-rich <b>boron</b> <b>nitrides</b> consisted of different ratios of B 13 N 2 /h-BN phases. Our spectroscopic results indicate that this B 13 N 2 structure is made of B 12 icosahedral units linked by N-B-N linear chains. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. We are indebted to A.

40|$|AbstractThe {{boundary}} and sub-boundary hardening {{is shown}} {{to be the most}} important strengthening mechanism in creep of 9 Cr steel. The soluble boron reduces the coarsening rate of M 23 C 6 carbides along boundaries near prior austenite grain boundaries during creep, enhancing the boundary and sub-boundary hardening for up to long times. The enhancement of boundary and sub-boundary hardening retards the onset of acceleration creep, which decreases the minimum creep rate and improves the creep life.

5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic <b>boron</b> <b>nitride</b> is {{produced}} by treating hexagonal <b>boron</b> <b>nitride</b> at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond {{is produced}} from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal <b>boron</b> <b>nitride</b> to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|The boron {{nitrides}} are {{notable for}} {{the variety of}} structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic <b>boron</b> <b>nitride</b> (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds {{can be viewed as}} a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic <b>boron</b> <b>nitride,</b> among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal <b>boron</b> <b>nitride</b> (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.|$|E
40|$|The pressure-induced {{transformation}} of diatomic nitrogen into non-molecular polymeric phases may produce potentially useful high-energy-density materials. We combine first-principles calculations with structure searching to predict {{a new class}} of nitrogen-rich <b>boron</b> <b>nitrides</b> with a stoichiometry of B 3 N 5 that are stable or metastable relative to solid N 2 and h-BN at ambient pressure. The most stable phase at ambient pressure has a layered structure (h-B 3 N 5) containing hexagonal B 3 N 3 layers sandwiched with intercalated freely rotating N 2 molecules. At 15 GPa, a three-dimensional C 2221 structure with single N-N bonds becomes the most stable. This pressure is much lower than that required for triple-to-single bond transformation in pure solid nitrogen (110 GPa). More importantly, C 2221 -B 3 N 5 is metastable, and can be recovered under ambient conditions. Its energy density of 3. 44 kJ/g makes it a potential high-energy-density material. In addition, stress-strain calculations estimate a Vickers hardness of 44 GPa. Structure searching reveals a new clathrate sodalite-like BN structure that is metastable under ambient conditions.

40|$|The DV-Xa {{molecular}} orbital (MO) calculation method {{was applied to}} the B K–V x-ray emission spectra of hexagonal (h-), cubic (c-) and wurtzite (w-) type <b>boron</b> <b>nitrides</b> (BN). The calculated B 2 p density of states (DOS) was in good agreement with the B K–V x-ray emission. The main peaks and low-energy satellite peaks in the B K–V x-ray emission spectra are due to the B 2 p and the B 2 p hybridized with N 2 s, respectively. The high-energy satellite peak in the B K–V x-ray emission spectra clearly corresponds to the p sub-band of the B 2 p DOS in h-BN. However, the high-energy satellite peak observed in w-BN is not in agreement with the B 2 p DOS. It is considered that the high-energy satellite peaks are due to less than four-coordinated B atoms such as have dangling bonds and defects in w-BN. In the B K–V x-ray emission spectra of h-BN, the synthesizing p and s sub-bands of B 2 p DOS could explain the polarized emission spectra very well. Copyright Ó 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

However, before the clinical application, it is very necessary and important for biomaterials of BN to investigate biosafety in vivo and in vitro. Biosafety investigations include toxicity in vivo and cytotoxicity in vitro; to clarify toxicity in vivo, it was essential a prerequisite to research its behavior and fate in the living things. Unfortunately, so far no one has explored the detailed investigations about behavior and toxicity of BN in vivo.|$|R

By changing the synthesis temperatures, the textures of obtained porous microbelts are adjustable.
