50|$|First {{designated}} as a species of Special Concern by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) in April 1985, its status was re-examined and confirmed in May 2001. The <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> is now listed in Canada under the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). As well, the federal Fisheries Act prohibits destruction of fish habitat. The <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> {{is also one of}} many species covered by the Sydenham River Recovery strategy. The Sydenham River Recovery Strategy, completed in 2003, was the first recovery strategy in Canada to use an ecosystem approach for aquatic species. The <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> is now being protected {{as part of a larger}} plan to return the Sydenham River’s ecosystem to health.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow,</b> Fundulus notatus, {{is small}} {{freshwater}} {{fish in the}} family Fundulidae, found in central North America.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> {{is found}} in Canada along a roughly 60 {{kilometre}} stretch of Ontario’s Sydenham River. In the United States, it occupies {{other parts of the}} southern drainage of lakes Erie and Michigan and also the Mississippi drainage basin between Illinois and the Gulf of Mexico. The entire Canadian population of this small freshwater fish lives along a roughly 60 kilometre stretch of the Sydenham River in southwestern Ontario. Discovered only in 1972, the <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> is a fairly hardy fish although its greatest threats come from changes to its habitat due to human activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blackstripe</b> <b>topminnows</b> {{live for}} two to three years. They are usually found in slow-moving water where {{vegetation}} along the river bank provides a good amount of edge cover. They tend to stay near the surface in summer and feed on insects. They also eat insect larvae in the water, as well as tiny molluscs, spiders and crustaceans. In the winter, they retreat to deeper water. Spawning occurs between May and August. Females lay 20 to 30 eggs; these are fertilized and tucked away in underwater vegetation one at a time by the males.|$|R
50|$|Due to the North Fork's {{variety of}} stream bed {{substrates}} and gradients, {{there is a}} wider variety of fish species than may be found in other streams in the region. Several species of Darters (genus Etheostoma and Percina) are common. Minnows include sand shiners, steelcolor shiners, silverjaw minnows and brook silversides. <b>Blackstripe</b> <b>topminnows</b> and mosquitofish are very common along the margins. Madtoms, bullhead and channel catfish are also common. Several sunfish species including long-eared sunfish, crappie, largemouth bass and spotted bass are also found. Non-game fish such as white suckers, common carp, and long-nosed and short-nosed gar are numerous.|$|R
5000|$|Although this {{population}} in Canada {{seems to have}} remained stable in recent years, it faces several environmental risks. These fish depend on vegetation, both in-stream and along the banks, especially {{as a source for}} the insects they eat. Livestock can threaten this vegetation by destroying or eating it. As well, when wetlands are drained, the flow of creeks and streams can change, potentially affecting the size and health of <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> populations. Taking water from streams to irrigate farmland could leave this fish especially at risk in times of low water or drought. Oil seepage from equipment and vehicles could harm the <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> because of its habit of feeding at {{the surface of the water}} where slicks occur.|$|E
50|$|The {{sperm and}} eggs are {{released}} into the water in spring and summer, the eggs of the line topminnow being 1.6 mm. While swimming close to the water's surface, the species eat vegetation, crustaceans, and larvae. The northern water snake preys on this fish, as well as another species from the genus, the <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> {{gets its}} name from the {{horizontal}} black stripe that runs the length of its body along its sides. The fish has a small mouth that turns slightly upward, and has a flat-topped head with a multi-coloured spot on it. The average length of this fish is between 5 and 7 cm. The males and females look distinct from one another. Males have dark vertical bars above and below their stripes, yellow-hued fins, and their dorsal and anal fins are longer and more pointed. Females have no bars, white fins and shorter, more rounded dorsal and anal fins.|$|E
50|$|The blackspotted topminnow has an {{elongate}} body up to 9.7 centimeters long. It is brownish {{yellow to}} olive green on its upper side {{and has a}} wide, dark lateral band and distinct dark spots. The male has longer fins than the female and the fins of the male may take on a yellowish color during breeding. This species {{is very similar to}} the <b>blackstripe</b> <b>topminnow</b> (Fundulus notatus), which also has a dark lateral band. It can be distinguished from F. notatus by its darker, more numerous spots. The two may hybridize. In Fundulus olivaceus, the gill slit extends the dorsal to the uppermost pectoral fin ray. The distance from the origin of the dorsal fin {{to the end of the}} hypural plate is less than the distance from the origin of the dorsal fin to the preopercle or occasionally about equal to that distance. The mouth is sightly supraterminal.|$|E
