50|$|This {{version is}} {{essentially}} the same weapon, with the same operation, but adapted to machine gun size. The knobs are replaced by a stock with a lower removable tip and pistol grip with wooden grips and a trigger. The tripod is eliminated and replaced by a bipod attached to the <b>barrel</b> <b>holder</b> sleeve.|$|E
50|$|The weapon {{had many}} {{features}} that {{will then be}} taken in the machine gun Breda Mod. 30. The barrel was quick change and, through a handle in asbestos, was pulled away, with a half rotation, from the <b>barrel</b> <b>holder</b> sleeve. The functioning was blowback operation of the barrel with locking of the bolt through wing and with oil lubrication of bullets. Shooting with bolt closed. The rear of the receiver ended with two knobs with the firing button and a false wooden stock. The feeding was through a magazine on the right side, front-hinged. For charging, it was front rotated, you could insert the plate with 20 rounds, then this was withdrown leaving the rounds in the magazine, which was then closed by rotating to the rear. The iron sights was elevated through a cursor. To be fired the weapon necessitated for a 2,860 kg tripod, which doubled as a saddle for the transport of the weapon.|$|E
50|$|At this time, {{fountain}} pens were almost all filled by unscrewing {{a portion of}} the hollow <b>barrel</b> or <b>holder</b> and inserting the ink by means of an eyedropper - a slow and messy procedure. Pens also tended to leak inside their caps and at the joint where the barrel opened for filling. Now that the materials' problems had been overcome and the flow of ink while writing had been regulated, the next problems to be solved were the creation of a simple, convenient self-filler and the problem of leakage. In 1890, W. B. Purvis became the first African-American to patent a self-filler. Self-fillers began to arrive {{around the turn of the}} century; the most successful of these was probably the Conklin crescent-filler, followed by A. A. Waterman's twist-filler. The tipping point, however, was the runaway success of Walter A. Sheaffer's lever-filler, introduced in 1912, paralleled by Parker's roughly contemporary button-filler.|$|R
30|$|Ball milling of the MgH 2 powder (Goldschmidt) was {{performed}} under argon atmosphere in a Retsch PM 400 planetary ball mill using hardened steel balls and vials. The powder was milled for 80 h at a ball-to-powder mass ratio of 10 : 1 at a milling intensity of 200 revolutions per minute. All sample handling {{was carried out}} in a glove box under purified argon atmosphere (oxygen and water levels less than 1 ppm). The MgH 2 powder was distributed on a TEM copper grid supported with a thin and holey amorphous carbon film. The TEM grid was placed in a TEM vacuum transfer holder inside the glove box, where the specimen tip was retracted in the <b>barrel</b> of the <b>holder.</b> The holder was opened only during the loading cycle into the TEM under vacuum.|$|R
40|$|The large Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICC) {{designed}} for the magnet coils in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), are composed of Nb/sub 3 /Sn strand bundles in a Stainless Steel (SS) or Incoloy conduit. Both, the thermal contraction of the strand composite and the conduit material, define the final pre-strain after cooling down and thus affect the strand critical current (I/sub c/). The transverse forces, introduced when charging a coil, in addition affect the overall strain state due to bending and pinching of strands. Recently, periodic bending tests were applied on strand samples without additional axial compressive pre-strain. Here we explore the method of swaging a SS-tube around a strand to imitate the cool-down strain effect of the conduit. The experimental results of the I/sub c/ measurements at 12 T and 4. 2 K are presented for a Nb/sub 3 /Sn PIT strand with and without swaged SS tube on both Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and SS standard ITER sample <b>holder</b> (<b>barrels).</b> The effect of gluing the sample to the barrel is also investigated. The intrinsic strain state of the samples is verified by measurement of the I/sub c/ versus applied strain with the Pacman spring...|$|R
40|$|The 30 {{strands of}} an outer cable for the Superconductor Super Collider (SSC) magnets were studied. For each strand {{at least one}} {{complete}} V-I measurement was made at 5. 6 tesla magnetic field and 4. 2 K. The results then were analysed to determine Jc, and n-values. The second derivative of the V(I) curves was also calculated to get an Ic distribution within an individual strand. In order to get an accurate Jc for each strand, the Cu/SC ratio was measured for all the strands. The result shows most of samples have a Cu/SC ratio from 1. 66 to 1. 7. The experimental results found no obvious relation between Jc and n * values. N- values were plotted out {{as a function of}} both current, I, and voltage, V. The n(V) curve is found to be a constant in the range between the measuring system resolution limitation (0. 3 microvolt) and 90 microvolts in this experiment when using stainless steel <b>barrels</b> as sample <b>holders.</b> The real current passing through the superconducting filaments can be obtained using a correction method developed in chapter 3. By using this method with the four different resistivity sample holders (fiber glass, stainless steel, brass and copper), the I...|$|R
