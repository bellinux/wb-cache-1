40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) encephalitis {{in adult}} nonimmunosuppressed patients {{has rarely been}} reported. We have diagnosed HCMV encephalitis in an anti-HCMV immunoglobulin G-negative, nonimmunosuppressed young woman by HCMV DNA PCR and virus isolation from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At the same time, HCMV antigen and HCMV DNA could be demonstrated in peripheral blood leukocytes, and the virus was isolated in fibroblast cultures. After 22 days of acute illness, the virus disappeared from the CSF. Remarkably, the patient did not generate detectable anti-HCMV antibodies within 5 months after the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>illness.</b> To investigate the significance of HCMV DNA detection in CSF, samples of CSF, blood cells, and serum from 35 nonimmunosuppressed patients with various neurological disorders (but no herpes simplex virus central nervous system [CNS] disease) were tested for HCMV DNA, antigen, and antibodies.

40|$|Introduction. Primary Epstein-Barr virus {{infection}} (EBVI) {{in children}} is usually asymptomatic with seroconversion. If primary infection occurs in adolescents or in adulthood, {{the most common}} manifestation is acute infectious mononucleosis. The diagnosis of acute infectious mononucleosis is made by virus and serologic tests. The most important evidence of primary EBV infection includes IgM class antibodies detected by using EBV virus-capsidantigen (EBV VCA) which appears at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> and usually lasts 1 to 2 months. Paul Bunnell Davidson test, although non-specific, is still in use today in diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis and for detection of heterophile antibodies. Case report. Acute hepatitis with icterus is a rare clinical manifestation in primary EBV infection. However, sometimes {{it is the only}} manifestation of the disease. This is a case report of a patient with EBV hepatitis and icterus associated with long-lasting fever without pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy, which are characteristics of infectious mononucleosis. The etiologic diagnosis was confirmed by positive Paul Bunnell Davidson test and by detection of specific antibodies (class IgM) to EBV VCA in patient's serum. Discussion. The pathogenetic mechanism which causes destruction of hepatic cells and provokes cholestasis during EBV infection, has not been cleared yet. It is supposed that EBV has no direct cytocide effects on hepatic cells, yet destruction of these cells is caused by toxic action of free radicals through lipid peroxidation. Patients with infectious mononucleosis have autoantibodies directed against enzyme superoxide-dismutase which neutralizes enzyme's antioxidant action. As a result of this action, free radicals accumulate in hepatic cells and cause their damage. Conclusion. Icteric forms of EBV infection are rare. In differential diagnosis of icterus caused by infectious agents, one should not forget EBV. ...|$|E

A case control study was conducted at the Institute of Respiratory Medicine, Kuala Lumpur Hospital, in September to October 1998. The objective is to identify factors influencing non-adherence among TB patients treated under the TB Control Program. A total of 78 respondent who have been non-adherent to treatment selected by" simple random sampling {{from a list of}} cases reported in 1997. Based on sex and age, 78 patients who have completed treatment randomly selected as control. Results showed that distance from home to place of treatment and occupation was found to have significant difference (p < 0. 05) for the occurrence of non-adherence. Patients' belief and knowledge regarding TB were also found to have significant difference (p < 0. 05) for non-adherence. These include acceptance of disease at <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>illness,</b> complexity of treatment and opinion regarding traditional or alternative treatment. On the other hand, {{there was no significant difference}} for non-adherence with adverse reaction while on treatment. Generally, there is a positive response towards perception on services offered. However, it was found that there is significant difference (p < 0. 05) for non-adherence with services provided by the staff and waiting time before being seen by a doctor. From logistic regression analysis, result showed that status of disease, problem related to occupation, acceptance of illness, opinion regarding traditional treatment, support from relatives for traditional treatment, perceptions on waiting time and lack of house visits was the main factors influencing non- adherence. With such predictors the probability of a patient to develop non-adherence towards treatment is 98. 9 %. In general, factors involving non acceptance by the patients, unsatisfactory services such as prolonged waiting time and lack of house visits has important role in the occurrence of non-adherence towards treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{delta antigen}} (HDAg) and anti-delta antibody (anti-HD) was analyzed in 22 acute delta hepatitis infections (11 coinfections and 11 superinfections), with an enzyme immunoassay developed by Organon Teknika and with two commercially available assays: Deltassay, {{a test for}} HDAg from Noctech and Abbott anti-delta enzyme immunoassay, a test for anti-HD from Abbott Laboratories. In seven cases, HDAg was detected with the Organon assay but not with Deltassay. These discrepancies were {{not related to the}} type of hepatitis delta virus infection. All samples from these patients taken beyond week 4 of illness were found anti-HD positive with both the Organon and Abbott anti-HD assays. These data reflect the lack of sensitivity of Deltassay. In no instance were HDAg and anti-HD present simultaneously when tested with the Organon assays. On the contrary, 10 sera among the 28 that were HDAg positive with the Organon assay also were found anti-HD positive with the Abbott test. We suspected that the test procedure recommended by Abbott (a one-step competitive assay) may have yielded false-positive anti-HD results when HDAg present in the sera reacted with peroxidase-labeled anti-HD of the kit. To determine the specificity of the simultaneous presence of HDAg and anti-HD, these 10 sera were retested with the Abbott anti-HD assay, but by a modified two-step procedure that avoided contact between sera and labeled antibody. For six sera a negative result was obtained with the second procedure, suggesting that a false anti-HD reaction occurred with the standard test procedure. For four sera a positive result with both procedures was indicative of the simultaneous presence of HDAg and anti-HD. In conclusion, assay for HDAg was found very convenient for the early diagnosis of acute hepatitis delta virus infections. Seroconversion to anti-HD could be used for a late diagnosis 2 to 5 weeks after the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>illness.</b> However, anti-HD results obtained with one-step competitive assays have to be interpreted carefully in HDAg-positive sera...|$|E

40|$|A {{problem of}} {{importance}} {{in the study and}} control of yellow fever is the period during which a patient may be a source of infection through the bites of mosquitoes. Work on this question was initiated by members of the American Commission in Cuba (Reed, Carroll, Agramonte and Lazear (1)) who carried the disease from person to person by AMes aegypti which originally became engorged on the first to third days of a patient's illness. Similarly, the French Commission in Brazil (Marchoux, Salimbeni and Simond (2) and Marchoux and Simond (3)) found that yellow fever could be transmitted to volunteers by mosquitoes fed on the first, second and third days of disease and by blood or serum from a patient in the same period. More recently, several workers have been able to study the question of blood infectivity in human cases by the use of Macacus rhesus as the experimental host. Bauer and Hudson (4) report that a lot of A. aegypti fed on a human case 12 hours after onset of illness transmitted yellow fever to monkeys, while a lot fed 36 hours after onset and the same period before death failed to transmit it, although blood coincidentally withdrawn and injected into another monkey induced a fatal attack. Mathis, Sellards and Laigret (5) infected monkeys by means of the bites of mosquitoes which had been fed upon a patient {{at the end of the}} first day of acute illness, and also by the injection of blood withdrawn at the same time. AragAo (6) records the results of injecting monkeys with patients ' blood during the recent epidemic in Rio de Janeiro. He was able to infect 8 n~mals fatally with blood procured at v~rious times up to 72 hours after the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>illness,</b> but not later; nor could he transmit the disease by the inoculation of blood and organ emulsions obtained at necropsy. The foregoing observations indicate a general agreement on the infectivity of blood in human cases during the first three days of illness.

The urine incontinency symptom was determined only for three patients in the last stage of research {{and it is not}} demonstrated in the picture thoroughly. Fatigue was the most frequently indicated and most intensive symptom (82. 1 % - 89. 3 %) of patients in the research group throughout all three stages of research. It tended to be increasing the entire nine months period since the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>illness.</b> Figure 3.

The average intensity of fatigue symptom was statistically significant (p< 0. 05) throughout all stages of research. The patients of research group complained with major fatigue level comparing to lay-people population complains throughout the continuing research process (Figure 4). The patient satisfaction with sexual function was evaluated by particular question included from the questionnaire of the QLI. It was determined that the satisfaction with sexual function was decreasing throughout the continuing research process, accordingly, 3. 76 points (SD – 1. 63) in the first stage, 3. 38 points (SD – 1. 74) in the second stage and 3. 38 points (SD – 1. 69) in the third stage. The intensity of fatigue was increasing after five and nine months since the diagnosis of prostate cancer and was statistically major comparing to the indicated intensity of fatigue after a month of diagnosis (p< 0. 05). The intensive urinating was predominantly indicated during the first (p< 0. 001) and fifth (p< 0. 001) month since the diagnosis of illness. The functional condition of the patients with major level of Gleason differentiation (r=- 0. 24; p< 0. 05) was deteriorative in nine months since the diagnosis of illness. A month after the disclosure of diagnosis 94. 0 % of patients indicated good quality functional condition (80 - 100 points). Using the precise probability comparison test we determined that likelihood of ill-health condition was 11. 2 proc., p< 0. 001. at the first stage of the research, the lower most score of indicator of functional condition of ill-patients was 40 (in the scale 0 – 100). This minimum value did not decrease during the continuing research process. Self-assessed as good functional condition was more prevalent among patients with higher education background (p< 0. 05) and patients with secondary or high education background (p< 0. 05) comparing to those with primary education background. The nine months after the disclosure of diagnosis, those patients who lived together with a partner indicated the better functional condition significantly (p< 0. 01). The coefficient of determination (Negelkerke R 2) ranged from 0. 66 up to 0. 69. The average sums of rating showed that the difference of satisfaction with energy for daily activity as well as with ability to fend for oneself was statistically significant comparing those patients who reported their functional condition as good and those who reported it as miserable. Respectively, it was determined the significance p< 0. 001 after a month, p< 0. 05 after five months after diagnosis disclosure as well as p< 0. 001 after nine months in research groups. The nine months after the disclosure of diagnosis, the functional condition of patients who have died in 12 – 24 months, was significantly worse comparing to those who have survived in the same period (p= 0. 01). It was determined the particular combinations of symptoms that had the influence for the QOL in the subscale of physical health. A month after the disclosure of diagnosis, it was determined the impact of the combination of fatigue and sense of coherence symptoms for physical health. The most significant correlation was between physical health and the intensity of fatigue (p< 0. 001). Similarly, the prognostic indicator of physical health was correlated with the low sense of coherence value (β=- 2. 07; CI= 3. 97 - 0. 17; p= 0. 033) if including the moderate fatigue level (β= 4. 3; CI= 2. 57 - 6. 06; p= 0. 001).

A month after the disclosure of prostate cancer diagnosis, physical health was highly correlated with fatigue (p< 0. 0001). Respectively, the correlation between higher physical health assessment of patients and the absence of pain (β= 2. 82; CI= 0. 13 - 5. 5; p= 0. 04) and the absence of fatigue (β= 3. 77; CI= 1. 99 - 5. 54; p= 0. 001) or moderate fatigue as well as conversely – lower physical health correlation with pain and intensive fatigue – was statistically relevant. It was determined that the quality of sleeping was worse if patients suffered from more frequent urinating (p< 0. 01). The five months after the disclosure of prostate diagnosis, the combination of pain and fatigue was correlated with physical health. Same as in the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>illness,</b> physical health was significantly correlated with the higher intensity of fatigue (p< 0. 001). Physical health was generally depended on the association of patients’ pain and the different intensity of fatigue (β= 3. 69; CI= 1. 43 - 5. 95; p= 0. 002.). Table 4.

The indicator R 2 used to be growing as if including frequent urinating or sense of coherence factors, yet the statistical reliability was not sufficient in both of these cases. The research showed that physical health in the nine months after the disclosure of diagnosis, was associated with the combination of fatigue, pain and frequent urinating symptoms insomuch as every one separately.

40|$|Dengue virus causes an {{estimated}} 50 million dengue cases and approximately 500, 000 life-threatening complications annually. New tools {{are needed to}} distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses. In addition, {{the natural history of}} pediatric dengue early in illness in a community-based setting has not been well-defined. Here, we describe the clinical spectrum of pediatric dengue over the course <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> in a community setting by using five years of data from an ongoing prospective cohort study of children in Managua, Nicaragua. Day-by-day analysis of clinical signs and symptoms together with longitudinal statistical analysis showed significant associations with testing dengue-positive and important differences during the early phase <b>of</b> <b>illness</b> compared to the entire course <b>of</b> <b>illness.</b> These findings are important for clinical practice since outside of the hospital setting, clinicians may see dengue patients toward the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> their <b>illness</b> and utilize that information to decide whether their patient has dengue or another febrile <b>illness.</b> The results <b>of</b> these models should be extended for the development of prediction algorithms to aid clinicians in diagnosing suspected dengue...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Findings on brain {{structural}} abnormalities {{in patients}} with bipolar disorder (BP) are inconsistent and {{little is known about}} their changes over time. We employed a cross-sectional case-control study to compare structural age-related brain trajectories {{in patients with}} BP and healthy control subjects (HC) over a time period of about 50 years. The primary aim was to understand whether white (WM) and gray matter (GM) changes are present form the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>illness</b> and how they change over time. Methods: Seventy-eight patients with BP and 78 HC matched one by one for age, gender and educational level underwent a high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging scan protocol. A voxel-based-morphometry (VBM) analysis was used to capture GM and WM differences in BP patients and HC. Factorial analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare brain volume alterations at different ages between groups. Results: We found an age-related atrophy in GM and WM volumes both in patients and HC. A main effect of diagnosis emerged in the posterior cingulate cortex bilaterally, in the right thalamus, in the cerebellum bilaterally and in left posterior limb of the internal capsule. No interaction between diagnosis and age emerged, indicating that the volumes of these areas were permanently reduced in BP patients along the entire age range investigated. Conclusions: Brain alterations in BP patients are present from the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>illness</b> and remain stable over time. All the affected areas are involved in mood and psychomotor control process. This suggests a possible neurodevelopmental involvement in the mechanism of BP...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Pain is {{a common}} symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD), and is often related to the illness itself. Objective: To prospectively {{establish}} the ocurrence of pain in PD patients. Method: This study was conducted within a population composed of 50 patients with PD to evaluate the presence of pain. Results: Twenty-eight patients reported pain; comparing the group with pain and the group without pain, {{there were no differences}} related to the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>illness</b> and the motor symptoms of PD. However, many patients related an improvement of pain when antiparkinsonian therapy was initiated or adjusted. Conclusion: The use of techniques for analgesia and the adjustment of PD medication contribute to improve the manifestations of pain and the life quality of patients with PD...|$|R

50|$|RT-PCR {{testing of}} serum and tissue samples {{can be used}} to detect the {{presence}} of the Zika virus. However, the RT-PCR test with serum is only helpful while the virus is still in the blood which is generally within the first week <b>of</b> the <b>illness.</b> After this period other methods should be used to determine if the virus is still present in the body. A test for IgM antibodies has seen to be effective over longer periods of time, as these antibodies can be present starting 4 days after the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the <b>illness</b> and up to 12 weeks after that. However, it is suggested that a PRINT test be performed following a test for IgM antibodies to help eliminate false positives resulting from other flaviviruses. The PRINT test looks for viral-specific neutralizing antibodies. However, this test can still produce false positive results, for Zika, in individuals who have received immunization for or had previously been exposed to other flaviviruses.|$|R
