For years, workers were reluctant to complain about the illness for fear of losing their jobs. The mills exerted great economic power including owing an adjoining town, Bibb City, owned by Bibb Manufacturing Company. When the series was released, many of the newspaper's street boxes were looted of their copies. The series led to the Georgia legislature enacting laws to allow workers with <b>byssinosis</b> to file workers' compensation claims for the first time. The reportage also garnered several awards including an Associated Press Newswriting Award - Public Service.|$|E

5000|$|In {{regards to}} workmen’s compensation, various {{measures}} were introduced by Morrison to improve provisions for injured workers, meeting the requests {{of the miners}} {{for the inclusion of}} pneumoconiosis and the cotton trade unions for the inclusion of <b>byssinosis</b> within the scope of the Compensation Acts. A long-standing issue was the case of long-standing injury in which a man was compensated under the old Acts, and at a very different standard of wages than had ruled in his industry since. Morrison tackled this problem by carrying an Act through Parliament in 1943 that helped such cases “by providing that pre-accident earnings were to be reviewed, if and when a change occurs, after the date of the accident, in the rate of remuneration in the class of employment in which the injured man had been employed.” This applied dating as far back as 1924, and many long standing cases had thus derived “substantial benefits resulting from war-time increases the rates of pay of their trade.” By this means, partial disability cases were significantly safeguarded from a reduction in compensation when rises in wage rates were given in their pre-injury employment. The Act also included a provision enabling the Court “in deciding dependency to disregard the earnings of the widow from work to which she had been directed, or which she had taken up during the war,” thereby safeguarding widows whose work could end with the war, and who “might then be dependent on compensation for her late husband’s accident.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{development}} of textile industry in Indonesia can potentially increase some occupational diseases that caused by waste products. One of those waste products from textile industry is cotton dust, {{which can cause}} <b>byssinosis.</b> There {{are several ways to}} reduce cotton dust exposure, such as using face mask. This research aim to describe the relationship between employee's knowledge  about <b>byssinosis</b> with face mask utilization in spinning department of a textile factory. This research is a descriptive study with cross sectional approach. The subjects of this research are employees working on Spinning Department. Data gathered using questionnaire about <b>byssinosis</b> and the habit of using face mask. The result of this research shows that 52 (78. 79 %) of 66 respondents have excellent knowledge about <b>byssinosis,</b> meanwhile the other 14 (21. 21 %) show just enough knowledge. Almost all wear a face mask during working hour (92. 42 %).

40|$|Previous {{epidemiological}} {{surveys of}} flax <b>byssinosis</b> may have underestimated {{the incidence of}} permanent pulmonary disability by failing to reach those who have had to leave work.

40|$|<b>Byssinosis,</b> {{a chronic}} lung disease of cotton mill workers, is {{characterized}} by repeated episodes of reversible airway obstruction, {{which can lead to}} permanent alterations of lung function. When this occurs in Quebec the worker must be removed from further exposure in accordance with the provincial compensation rules. The current Quebec Occupational Safety and Health Regulation has a permissible exposure limit of 500 [*]μg/m 3, resulting in a prevalence rate of <b>byssinosis</b> of 2 % to 5 % in cotton workers. In this study the incidence of new respiratory disorders in persons employed in Quebec cotton mills from 1980 to 1995 was assessed and factors that identified <b>byssinosis</b> cases were analyzed. Incidence of the disease was assessed on the basis of cases referred to the Commission de Santé & Sécurité au travail du Québec (Quebec Workers’ Compensation Board) from all Quebec textile plants. Analyses of age, years of employment, job description, smoking history, bronchial reactivity and lung function before and at work were used for diagnostic purposes. Incidence of new <b>byssinosis</b> cases from 1990 to 1995 was 2. 8 cases per year per 5000 workers, slightly above the incidence from 1980 to 1989, at 1. 7 cases per year. The incidence of chronic cases was stable at 1. 5 cases per year, whereas that of early cases increased from 0. 3 cases per year (1980 to 1989) to 1. 25 cases per year (1990 to 1995). In comparison with chronic <b>byssinosis</b> cases, the average time of work before symptom appearance was 17 ± 4 versus 32 ± 1 years, P< 0. 001. Bronchial reactivity to methacholine (PC 20) at work was below 2 [*]mg/mL in 100 % of <b>byssinosis</b> cases versus 14 % in subjects not diagnosed with <b>byssinosis.</b> Decreases in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) at work averaged 30 % in the <b>byssinosis</b> and 6 % in the nonbyssinosis subjects; peak flow rates were not different between those with and those without <b>byssinosis.</b> Early <b>byssinosis</b> cases were from three distinct plants in different townships, and 45 % of cases worked in cardroom occupations. PC 20 equal to or less than 2 [*]mg/mL at work was strongly associated with the decrease in FEV 1 during a work shift. In conclusion, current cotton processing work in Quebec is associated with a significant incidence of <b>byssinosis.</b> PC 20 of 2 [*]mg/mL or less at work was closely associated with airflow limitation at work...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} between serum concentrations of total IgE and <b>byssinosis</b> and other respiratory symptoms was evaluated in 352 textile workers (90 men, 262 women) at a cotton mill in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. The subjects were aged from 20 to 61 (mean 44) {{and the mean}} duration of employment was 20 years. One hundred and eight subjects (30 · 7 %) were smokers. Only 2 % had a positive history of atopy. A standardised questionnaire showed chronic bronchitis in 96 textile workers (27 · 3 %) and <b>byssinosis</b> in 63 (17 · 9 %). The prevalence of respiratory disorders was the same {{for men and women}} but was higher in the carding room than in other work areas. Total serum IgE concentrations (RIST, Phadebas) were analysed after log transformation. The geometric mean was 192 · 7 IU/ml, with {{no significant difference between the}} two sexes. This mean concentration of IgE is much higher than that reported internationally for non-atopic subjects, but similar to values found in the Italian population. The IgE concentrations of the workers in the main departments (carding, spinning, and weaving) showed no significant difference. The geometric means were not different in subsamples stratified according to respiratory diseases (cases of pure and cases of mixed forms of chronic bronchitis and <b>byssinosis).</b> A negative result was obtained when IgE concentrations of 289 subjects without <b>byssinosis</b> (¯x = 188 · 4 IU/ml) and 63 with <b>byssinosis</b> (¯x = 212 · 6 IU/ml) were compared; there was also no trend when the results were analysed by clinical grade of <b>byssinosis.</b> The same negative pattern occured when the serum IgE concentrations were examined in patients with <b>byssinosis</b> with different grades of chronic change in FEV 1.

40|$|An {{epidemiological}} {{investigation in}} 11 ginneries representing the ginning industry in Egypt demonstrated {{the existence of}} <b>byssinosis</b> among 38 · 4 % of the workers. Studies of two pressing plants and two card-rooms in Alexandria showed a prevalence of <b>byssinosis</b> of 52 · 6 % and 26 · 6 % respectively. The ages of those exposed and the duration of exposure {{were considered in relation}} to the prevalence of <b>byssinosis,</b> and it appears that a short duration of exposure in ginning may result in early manifestations of <b>byssinosis</b> at a relatively young age. The interruption of exposure due to seasonal activity in ginning and partially in pressing resulted in a higher proportion of workers with {{the early stages of the}} disease. This contrasted with results in carding where exposure is continuous, and a higher proportion of workers have later stages of the disease. This suggests a delay in the progress of the disease due to periodic interruption of exposure...|$|E
