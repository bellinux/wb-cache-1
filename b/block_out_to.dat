5000|$|On 23 Dec 1842 David Thorburn {{wrote to}} the Commissioner of Crown Lands saying his friend Mr. McMicking of Chippawa has shown Thorburn {{a letter from the}} Commissioner informing that the license of {{occupation}} which he held under date of 24 Apr 1835 for Lots No. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 in the Township of Willoughby had been cancelled. If the Executive Council could reconsider their decision, Thorburn felt confident that Mr. McMicking has strong claims upon the Government relative to his being allowed to use those lands for a longer period. First the ground on which he obtained them were to procure fuel to a steam flouring mill, no water mill being {{in that part of the}} country for a great distance to enable the inhabitants of the five townships composing the fourth riding of Lincoln to gey funding with the exception of two which were far from the steam mill and they only by the spring and fall freshet did grinding for a few weeks in the year. The steam mill was erected at great expense and without the advantage of the wood from those uncultivated lands in its vicinity the erection would not have answered the purpose. But unfortunately the mill has been totally consumed during our recent trouble by two incendianis (sic incendiaries) who came from the American side expressly to destroy them. One of the incendianis was afterwards apprehended and remained in our gaol for over one year and was discharged on his giving information relative to the plot. The loss to Mr. McMicking was three thousand five hundred pounds which has nearly ruined him. Another reason is that roads in that township are of the very worst kind. Indeed, there is scarcely a road in it and on that account he has done much and still is opening new roads much to the advantage of the interior settler. He has leased the <b>Block</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a few poor Germans in fifty acre parcels for a few years. (Willoughby Township Papers 0273) ...|$|E

He has without failure, given me the strength to carry on. My sincere thanks to the Department of Criminology, University of South Africa, for affording me the opportunity to complete this study. I am indebted to my supervisor Professor Herman Conradie, for his insightful comments that opened up new perspectives that allowed me to explore avenues I would not have considered; and for his undying encouragement. To my husband, Mbongiseni Tshabalala, for taking the time to read various versions and offer valuable comments. I would not have completed this study without his support, his encouragement, and his dedication to the family. To all the respondents, for agreeing to be part of this research and for allowing themselves to re-live through some of the experiences they would rather <b>block</b> <b>out.</b> <b>To</b> my sisters and my mother, who stepped into my maternal role whenever I needed them. They remain a source of strength and security when I stand on shifting ground. To Rear Admiral Green, for allowing me to complete the work and still be sane. To my best friends, Ms Nonhlanhla Makhanda and Ms. Brigid Litchfield whose prayers and support kept me going. Finally, to my congregation at Meadowlands Baptist Church in Soweto and my Christian family at Resurrection Community Church in Kagiso for their prayers. ii...|$|E

5000|$|The new {{lighthouse}} {{was designed}} by William Douglass and built {{under the supervision of}} James Kavanagh.

As well as these blocks, weighing 4,300 tons in total and with a volume of , a further [...] of granite was used to fill the inside of the tower up {{to the level of the}} entrance floor 58 ft above high-water mark.

5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Dave Grohl.

The eyes of both the baby and the dog are <b>blocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> show they represent people in need everywhere. The camera follows the man throughout the video, with his face never being shown. It is presented in a continuous [...] "long take" [...] format, although actual transitional cuts are disguised by smoke. During shots inside the building, the band is seen performing the song, seemingly unconcerned about the chaos around them. It is the only Foo Fighters video to feature guitarist Franz Stahl, who replaced Pat Smear (Stahl did {{not appear in the}} video for the next and last single from the album, 1998's [...] "Walking After You", as it featured only Grohl).|$|R

50|$|Unlike the Washington Street Elevated {{which was}} built as the same time with a similar design, the Charlestown El was located very near Boston Harbor and the Mystic River tidal estuary, and was thus {{continually}} exposed to accelerated corrosion caused by salt air. The elevated was also unpopular with many local residents, as it was noisy and <b>blocked</b> <b>out</b> sunlight <b>to</b> Main Street.

30|$|Despite these {{contributions}} discussed above, {{the convenience}} sample of 50 archived 911 homicide calls downloaded from the Internet represents a limited dataset. The size of the current dataset was restricted {{by the number of}} publicly available deceptive calls for which ground truth could be established. Furthermore, the 911 calls were taken from the Internet, not the original source. As a result, some information—such as names—may have been <b>blocked</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> protect the privacy of the caller when the 911 call was released to the public. An additional limitation arises from the fact that we did not control the chain of custody over the 911 calls. Thus, we are not able to establish whether or to what degree the 911 calls had been edited. Moreover, only certain states currently release 911 calls to the public, so the geographic origin of the calls could be skewed. Finally, the calls were restricted to those placed by English-speaking callers located in the U.S. To counter these limitations in the future, audio files and/or transcripts should be collected directly from law enforcement in subsequent research to validate our results, and sampling from diverse geographical locations should be carried out.|$|R

5000|$|In 1994, <b>Block</b> <b>Out</b> {{released}} {{their debut}} album Crno, belo i srebrno (Black, White and Silver). The {{first half of}} the album consisted of <b>Block</b> <b>Outs</b> earliest hard rock-oriented tracks, and the second part of darker songs written by Vranjković. In the songs like the ironically titled [...] "Rođendanska pesma" [...] ("Birthday Song"), Vranjkovićs poetic lyrics deal with depression, hopelessness and misery caused by the crisis, war and total degradation of society in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia. At that time, inspired by various diverse bands such as Soundgarden, Pink Floyd, Slayer, Discharge and some older Serbian bands as Ekatarina Velika and Luna, under Vranjkovićs songwriting the early hard rock concept of <b>Block</b> <b>Out</b> started <b>to</b> move towards a darker, heavier atmosphere and sound. The band would go further in this direction on the following releases. The album was promoted on their first independent concert, held at Belgrades SKC, featuring guest appearances by Aleksandar Balać on guitar and Leontina Vukomanović and Madame Piano on backing vocals. The album was pronounced the best rock record of the year 1996 according to the Belgrade town assembly.|$|R
