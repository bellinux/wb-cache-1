40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of rye flour extraction rate on the protein amino acids content and protein quality indexes (chemical score, CS, protein efficiency ratio, PER) of traditional rye bread and ginger cake and to compare them with conventional wheat <b>bread.</b> <b>Rye</b> flour with extraction rates of 1000 g/kg and 920 g/kg (F- 1000 and F- 920, respectively), were used. Amino acid content was determined by HPLC and protein quality indexes were calculated. The results showed that contents of non-essential amino acids (NEAA) were not much affected by flour extraction rate in rye bread and ginger cake since only Asp and Ser were higher in F- 1000 rye bread and Arg and Pro in F- 1000 ginger cake. In regard to essential amino acids (EAA), only Thr and Val content was significantly higher (P¿ 0. 05) in F- 1000 rye bread, on dry weight basis. In addition, rye bread formulated with whole rye flour exhibited a higher content of total EAA than wheat bread (P¿ 0. 05). Regarding protein quality indexes, CS values were quite low in breads and ginger cakes, being Lys the limiting amino acid. However, estimated PER values were similar among wheat and rye breads, and slightly lower for ginger cakes. Hence, whole rye flour should be considered as an approach to improve the nutritional quality of traditional rye-based products.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{structure}} of whole grain cereals is maintained {{to varying degrees}} during processing and preparation of foods. Food structure can influence metabolism, including perceived hunger and satiety. A diet that enhances satiety per calorie may help to prevent excessive calorie intake. The objective of this work was to compare subjective appetite ratings after consumption of intact and milled rye kernels. Methods Two studies were performed using a randomized, cross-over design. Ratings for appetite (hunger, satiety and desire to eat) were registered during an 8 -h period after consumption of whole and milled rye kernels prepared as breads (study 1, n = 24) and porridges (study 2, n = 20). Sifted wheat bread was used as reference in both study parts and the products were eaten in iso-caloric portions with standardized additional breakfast foods. Breads and porridges were analyzed to determine whether structure (whole vs. milled kernels) effected dietary fibre content and composition after preparation of the products. Statistical evaluation of the appetite ratings after intake of the different breakfasts was done by paired t-tests for morning and afternoon ratings separately, with subjects as random effect and type of breakfast and time points as fixed effects. Results All rye breakfasts resulted in higher satiety ratings {{in the morning and}} afternoon compared with the iso-caloric reference breakfast with sifted wheat <b>bread.</b> <b>Rye</b> bread with milled or whole kernels affected appetite equally, so no effect of structure was observed. In contrast, after consumption of the rye kernel breakfast, satiety was increased and hunger suppressed in the afternoon compared with the milled rye kernel porridge breakfast. This effect could be related to structural differences alone, because the products were equal in nutritional content including dietary fibre content and composition. Conclusions The study demonstrates that small changes in diet composition such as cereal grain structure have the potential to effect feelings of hunger and satiety.

40|$|The satiating {{capacity}} of foods and meals {{is affected by}} caloric content, but also varies with several aspects of food composition (e. g. macronutrient composition, energy density, fibre content and food structure). Rye is a cereal that possesses interesting characteristics {{with the potential to}} increase satiety. There are currently public health threats related to overweight and obesity, conditions that result from energy intake exceeding energy output. Excessive energy intake can be avoided by diets based on foods that prolong the feeling of fullness per calorie. This work aimed to study the effects of rye foods on subjective appetite. Ratings of satiety, hunger and desire to eat were recorded during 8 h after intake of wellcharacterised rye foods, compared with iso-caloric refined wheat bread, served as parts of breakfast meals in cross-over design studies. The effect of rye processing (sifting and milling) on perceived appetite was investigated by comparing rye kernels and whole-grain rye flour in breads and porridges. The effect of regular consumption of whole-grain rye porridge compared with refined wheat bread was investigated during three weeks, along with self-reported food intake and oro-caecal transit-time. Apparent small intestine absorption of macronutrients in response to diets supplemented with high-fibre rye or with low fibre wheat bread was studied in an ileostomy model. All rye products (whole-grain porridges made from flour, flakes or kernels and breads including whole-grain flour, kernels or milling fractions) improved satiety and decreased hunger for up to 8 h after intake, in contrast to refined wheat <b>bread.</b> <b>Rye</b> bran as bread ingredient resulted in improved satiety compared with other rye fractions. The effect of milling was demonstrated as rye kernel intake resulted in higher satiety ratings appearing 4 h after intake and remained at a higher level during the following 4 h, compared with bread with the same material milled to flour. At regular consumption of whole-grain rye porridge for three weeks, the post-meal satiety was constant and remained at a higher level compared with refined wheat bread. Replacement of low-fibre wheat bread with high-fibre rye bread in a standardised diet resulted in higher amounts of all macronutrients being excreted from the terminal ileum in ileostomy subjects, showing lowered small intestine absorption of the high-fibre diet. A range of rye products was shown to improve satiety up to 8 h after intake and inclusion of rye foods into a healthy diet may thereby potentially prevent body weight gain...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundGrains {{are high}} in FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols) and often {{considered}} as triggers of IBS symptoms. AimTo evaluate if <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> low in FODMAPs would be better tolerated than regular <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> in subjects with IBS. MethodsThe study was conducted as a randomised double blind controlled cross-over study (n= 87). Participants were supplied with both regular <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> and low-FODMAP <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> for 4 weeks. Symptoms were measured with a symptom severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) assessments of individual symptoms. Quality of life was monitored. Colonic fermentation {{was measured by the}} breath hydrogen test and dietary intake by food diaries. ResultsDietary fibre intake increased during both study periods compared to baseline. Many signs of IBS i. e. flatulence, abdominal pain, cramps and stomach rumbling were milder on the low-FODMAP <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> (P-values: 0. 04; 0. 049; 0. 01 and 0. 001). The mean of VAS measurements was favourable towards LF bread [- 3 (95 % CI) : - 6 to - 1, P= 0. 02] but no differences were detected in IBS-SSS or quality of life. The AUC of breath hydrogen values was significantly lower during the low-FODMAP bread period (median 52. 9 vs. 72. 6; P= 0. 01). ConclusionsLow-FODMAP <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> helps IBS patients to control their symptoms and reduces gastrointestinal gas accumulation. However, replacing regular <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> by low-FODMAP bread without concomitant broader dietary changes does not improve quality of life or IBS-SSS. Nonetheless, inclusion of low-FODMAP <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> in diet might be one way that IBS patients could increase their fibre intake...|$|R
40|$|Meeting {{the needs}} of both present and future generations forms the {{foundation}} of sustainable development. Concern about food demand is increasing alongside the continuously growing population. In the pursuit of food security preventing food waste is one solution avoiding the negative environmental impacts that result from producing food unnecessarily. Packages offer one answer to preventing food waste, as they 1) preserve and protect food, 2) introduce the user to the correct way to handle and use the food and package and 3) allow the user to consume the food in its entirety. This thesis aims to enhance the sustainability of food packages by giving special emphasis to preventing food waste. The focus of this thesis is to assist the packaging designer {{in being able to}} take into account the requirements for the sustainability of food packages and to be able to integrate these requirements into the product development process. In addition, life cycle methods that can be used as a tool in the packaging design process or in assessing the sustainability of finished food-packaging combinations are evaluated. The methods of life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle working environment (LCWE) are briefly discussed. The method of life cycle assessment (LCA) is examined more thoroughly through the lens of the literature review of food-package LCA case studies published in the 21 st century in three relevant journals. Based on this review and on experiences learned from conducting LCAs, recommendations are given as to how the LCA practitioner should conduct a food packaging study to make most of the results. Two case studies are presented in this thesis. The first case study relates the results of a life cycle assessment conducted for three food items (cold cut (ham), sliced dark <b>bread</b> (<b>rye)</b> and Soygurt drink) and the alternative packaging options of each. Results of this study show that the packaging constitutes only 1 – 12 % of the total environmental impacts of the food-packaging combination. The greatest effect is derived from the food itself and the wasted food. Even just a small percentage of wasted food causes more environmental impacts than does the packaging. The second case study presents the results of LCC and LCWE analysis done for fruit and vegetable transport packages. In this thesis, the specific results of the study itself are not the focus, but rather the study methods and scope are analysed based on how these complement the sustainability assessment of food packages. This thesis presents reasons why prevention of food waste should be more thoroughly taken into account in food packaging design. In addition, the task of the packaging designer is facilitated by the requirements of sustainable food packaging, by the methods and step-by-step guidance on how to integrate sustainability issues into the design process, and by the recommendations on how to assess the sustainability of food packages. The intention of this thesis is to express the issues that are important in the field of the food packaging industry. Having recognised and implemented these issues, businesses can better manage the risks that could follow from neglecting these sustainability aspects...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to discuss {{the role of the}} {{relationship}} type and communication in two Finnish food chains, namely the pig meat-to-sausage (pig meat chain) and the cereal-to-rye <b>bread</b> (<b>rye</b> chain) chains. Furthermore, the objective is to examine those factors influencing the choice of a relationship type and the sustainability of a business relationship. Altogether 1808 questionnaires were sent to producers, processors and retailers operating in these two chains of which 224 usable questionnaires were returned (the response rate being 12. 4 %). The great majority of the respondents (98. 7 %) were small businesses employing less than 50 people. Almost 70 per cent of the respondents were farmers. In both chains, formal contracts were stated {{to be the most important}} relationship type used with business partners. Although for many businesses written contracts are a common business practice, the essential role of the contracts was the security they provide regarding the demand/supply and quality issues. Relative to the choice of the relationship types, the main difference between the two chains emerged especially with the prevalence of spot markets and financial participation arrangements. The usage of spot markets was significantly more common in the rye chain when compared to the pig meat chain, while, on the other hand, financial participation arrangements were much more common among the businesses in the pig meat chain than in the rye chain. Furthermore, the analysis showed that most of the businesses in the pig meat chain claimed not to be free to choose the relationship type they use. Especially membership in a co-operative and practices of a business partner were mentioned as the reasons limiting this freedom of choice. The main business relations in both chains were described as having a long-term orientation and being based on formal written contracts. Typical for the main business relationships was also that they are not based on the existence of the key persons only; the relationship would remain even if the key people left the business. The quality of these relationships was satisfactory in both chains and across all the stakeholder groups, though the downstream processors and the retailers had a slightly more positive view on their main business partners than the farmers and the upstream processors. The businesses operating in the pig meat chain seemed also to be more dependent on their main business relations when compared to the businesses in the rye chain. Although the communication means were rather similar in both chains (the phone being the most important), there was some variation between the chains concerning the communication frequency necessary to maintain the relationship with the main business partner. In short, the businesses in the pig meat chain seemed to appreciate more frequent communication with their main business partners when compared to the businesses in the rye chain. Personal meetings with the main business partners were quite rare in both chains. All the respondent groups were, however, fairly satisfied with the communication frequency and information quality between them and the main business partner. The business cultures could be argued to be rather hegemonic among the businesses both in the pig meat and rye chains. Avoidance of uncertainty, appreciation of long-term orientation and independence were considered important factors in the business cultures. Furthermore, trust, commitment and satisfaction in business partners were thought to be essential elements of business operations in all the respondent groups. In order to investigate which factors have an effect on the choice of a relationship type, several hypotheses were tested by using binary and multinomial logit analyses. According to these analyses it could be argued that avoidance of uncertainty and risk has a certain effect on the relationship type chosen, i. e. the willingness to avoid uncertainty increases the probability to choose stable relationships, like repeated market transactions and formal written contracts, but not necessary those, which require high financial commitment (like financial participation arrangements). The probability of engaging in financial participation arrangements seemed to increase with long-term orientation. The hypotheses concerning the sustainability of the economic relations were tested by using structural equation model (SEM). In the model, five variables were found to have a positive and statistically significant impact on the sustainable economic relationship construct. Ordered relative to their importance, those factors are: (i) communication quality, (ii) personal bonds, (iii) equal power distribution, (iv) local embeddedness and (v) competition...|$|E

40|$|Background: Various botanical and {{structural}} characteristics of starchy food modify the postprandial glucose and insulin responses in humans. Objective: We investigated what factors in grain products affect human glucose and insulin responses and elucidated the mediat-ing mechanisms. Design: Ten men and 10 women [mean age: 28 ± 1 y; mean {{body mass index}} (in kg/m 2) : 22. 9 ± 0. 7] with normal glucose tolerance were recruited. The test products were whole-kernel <b>rye</b> <b>bread,</b> whole-meal <b>rye</b> <b>bread</b> containing oat -glucan concentrate, dark durum wheat pasta, and wheat bread made from white wheat flour.

Each product provided 50 g available carbohydrate and was served in random order with breakfast (except for the -glucan <b>rye</b> <b>bread,</b> which was served at the last visit). Fasting and 8 postprandial blood samples were collected at intervals of 15 – 30 min for 3 h to determine plasma glucose, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1), serum insulin, and paraceta-mol concentrations. The in vitro starch hydrolysis, the structural characteristics (by light microscopy), and the molecular weight of -glucan in the test products were analyzed.
