500|$|... "Burn Black" [...] and [...] "Dicknail" [...] also feature {{aggressive}} {{language and}} themes alluding to child molestation and incest. [...] "Beautiful Son", written and recorded in 1992, features a more mellow guitar riff, and its lyrics make references to crossdressing. Love said the songwriting process {{on the track}} {{was an attempt to}} [...] "be a little dumber. I was always trying to write a very complex song without ever having learned to write an easy Beatles song," [...] noted in a 1994 interview. [...] "It just had a riff. It wasn't super smart <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> good and that's when I started learning things don't have to have lots and lots of notes. That the best songs are carried by simple lines and simple melodies." [...] This illustrates the band's turning point from their noise rock beginnings to more mellow, accessible sounds.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{pressure}} to replace the lyrics, producer Mike Thorne thought that [...] "it didn't matter any {{to the impact of}} the song itself", and the band eventually changed the gender of the love interest. At the beginning, 'Til Tuesday and Thorne were undecided between [...] "Love in a Vacuum" [...] and [...] "Looking over My Shoulder" [...] to be released as the first single, but ultimately Epic's A executive Dick Wingate chose [...] "Voices Carry", because it [...] "define precisely the band and its style". According to Thorne, his contract stated that he had the right {{to be the first to}} remix the song for the 7" [...] single release. He was then told that it had been remixed by Bob Clearmountain; about this he commented, [...] "not what the rules were [...] <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> pretty good, as well it might coming from one of the finest American engineer/producers".|$|E
500|$|The Kinks' next single, [...] "Waterloo Sunset", was {{released}} in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to {{have been inspired by}} the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, [...] "It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world {{and they were going to}} emigrate and go to another country." [...] Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for [...] "Waterloo Sunset" [...] lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: [...] "We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while." [...] The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Makers chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it [...] "the most beautiful song in the English language", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as [...] "possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era".|$|E

500|$|With 20 seconds {{remaining}} in the Lone Star Showdown versus the Aggies, McCoy was injured by a [...] "vicious, stadium-hushing tackle" [...] as Aggie defensive end Michael Bennett connected with his helmet against McCoy's upper body after McCoy had thrown an incomplete pass. Replays showed both {{on television and in}} the stadium revealed the hit might have included [...] "helmet-to-helmet" [...] contact which is illegal in NCAA football only if done intentionally, but no flag was thrown. When the replay was shown in the stadium, the Longhorn fans erupted in boos before lapsing back into silence as McCoy lay on the ground writhing for ten minutes before being taken off the field on a cart. Mack Brown said after the game [...] "I didn't see it, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> like 88,000 (fans) thought it was dirty". Fellow Longhorn Selvin Young said he thought the hit was a clean [...] "textbook" [...] hit. McCoy was taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge where he spent more than three hours undergoing an evaluation that included an X-Ray, MRI, and a CAT scan. Longhorns trainer Kenny Boyd said the injury was a severe pinched nerve in McCoy's neck. Boyd said that McCoy was expected to make a full recovery, but no timetable was set for McCoy to return to play. The injury to McCoy came one game-clock minute after an A player, #91 Kellen Heard had been ejected from the game for vicious blindside block on McCoy after he threw an interception, which was ruled excessive. An X-Ray, MRI exam and CT scan showed [...] "no structural damage to McCoy's neck or shoulder".|$|E
2500|$|The {{identity}} of the trumpeter was not public knowledge until 1994, when jazz musician and journalist Ron Simmonds revealed {{that it was the}} Surrey musician Ronnie Hunt. He added, [...] "an attempt was made in later years to re-record that solo, using Stan Roderick, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> too good, and they reverted to the old one." [...] In 2004, the Manchester Evening News published a contradictory story that a young musician from Wilmslow called David Browning played the trumpet on both the original recording of the theme in 1960 and a re-recording in 1964, for a one-off payment of £36. In June 2009, the Mail on Sunday resolved the matter. Browning conceded that Hunt recorded the original in 1960, but believed that his own re-recording in 1964 or 1972 had been used since that date. ITV then confirmed to the Mail that a second version had been recorded in the 1970s, but was only used for a very short while before reverting to Hunt's 1960 recording. In the 1980s the same version was converted to stereo.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Kelly {{was working}} on 14 songs for Under the Sun, which were {{recorded}} as demos. Kelly's wife Kaarin Fairfax was recording scenes {{for her role in}} the movie Young Einstein (1988). Her fellow actress Lulu Pinkus was married to the film's director, Yahoo Serious, who was looking for material for its soundtrack. A tape copy of the demo tracks was handed to Serious with Kelly's instructions [...] "See if there's anything that fits. They're just roughs. We're going back into the studio next month to record them properly". Kelly expected to work further on the tracks: [...] "I'd made notes to adjust a few of them. 'Dumb Things', for one, was too fast. I'd wanted it to have more of a grind <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> a little ahead of itself". When Serious used the demo version for a scene in Young Einstein Kelly was unable to change its tempo while recording the studio version. The group were [...] "playing along to our demo pumping through the speakers... We even mimicked ... the way the original track sped up and slowed down".|$|E

6000|$|Miss Milray sat {{looking at}} her. [...] "I don't know about such things; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> sensible--like {{everything}} about you, my dear. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> queer, perhaps because you're talking {{of such a}} White Mountain scheme here in Venice." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Maddox Brothers and Rose were at [...] "the {{leading edge}} of rockabilly with the slapped bass that Fred Maddox had developed". Maddox said, [...] "You've got to have somethin' they can tap their foot, or dance to, or to make 'em feel it." [...] After World War II the band shifted into higher gear leaning more toward a {{whimsical}} honky-tonk feel, with a heavy, manic bottom end - the slap bass of Fred Maddox. [...] "They played hillbilly music <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> real hot. They played real loud for that time, too ..." [...] The Maddoxes were also known for their lively [...] "antics and stuff." [...] "We always {{put on a show}} ... I mean it just wasn't us up there pickin' and singing. There was something going on all the time." [...] "... the demonstrative Maddoxes, helped release white bodies from traditional motions of decorum... more and more younger white artists began to behave on stage like the lively Maddoxes." [...] Others believe that they were not only at the leading edge, but were one of the first Rockabilly groups, if not the first.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 July, Butler {{exited the}} {{sessions}} leaving Dog Man Star {{some distance from}} completion. Anderson had recorded {{little more than a}} string of guide vocals; several songs did not have titles; much of the music was still to be embossed with overdubs. One notable song, [...] "The Power" [...] did not feature the guitarist and had to be played by a session guitarist instead. Anderson and Buller admitted that the song suffers from his absence. Buller and the remaining members succeeded in taking the record to its conclusion. Butler did finish some of his guitar parts, however he refused to do it at Master Rock and instead used another studio where he could work on his own. This is where he made a contractual contribution to [...] "Black or Blue". Anderson discovered a covert backing vocal on the song, which he recalled: [...] "I can't remember the exact words <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> vaguely threatening." [...] Among the post-Butler additions was a reworked ending to [...] "The Wild Ones", replacing the four minute extended outro; an orchestral coda on [...] "Still Life" [...] and an electric guitar part, copied directly from Butler's original demo of [...] "The Power", which he strongly criticised. Butler became a harsh critic of the album, not just from a production standpoint, but the overall musicianship.|$|E
2500|$|With 20seconds {{remaining}} in the game, McCoy was injured by a [...] "vicious, stadium hushing tackle" [...] as Aggies defensive end Michael Bennett connected with his helmet under McCoy's jaw just as McCoy released a pass.
