25|$|Blackford quickly {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for <b>being</b> <b>fair</b> and impartial and is {{regarded as one of}} the most influential and pivotal members in the court's history. According to Chief Justice Randall Shepherd, he was the most important justice to have ever served on the state courts and was responsible for laying the legal foundation of the state. During his time on the three member court he wrote the majority opinion on 845 of the nearly 2300 cases he presided over. That was more than twice as many decisions authored by any other justice in the court's history and remains a record. Seven other men served with him on the court, including James Scott, Jesse Holman, Stephen Stevens, John McKinney, Jeremiah Sullivan, Charles Dewey, Samuel Perkins, and Thomas Smith.|$|E

500|$|If the {{copyright}} infringer {{can show that}} their use falls within {{one of the three}} categories, they must then show that the dealing was [...] "fair". This takes into account a number of things, and due to the freedom of speech provisions under the Human Rights Act 1998 is deliberately intended not to be based on rigid and inflexible tests. Instead, as in Ashdown v Telegraph Group Ltd, the courts [...] "bear in mind that considerations of public interest are paramount". Because of this, there are many different things which enhance or detract from the [...] "fair" [...] nature of the dealing. If {{the copyright}}ed work had not been [...] "made available to the public" [...] at the time, this will count against the use <b>being</b> <b>fair,</b> and makes the defence on the grounds of criticism and review [...] "unavailable". The courts will give different weight to different kinds of documents; a series of private letters which have not been published will detract more from the fairness of the infringement than unpublished official reports which discuss matters of public interest.|$|E
500|$|When Howard J. Savage of the Carnegie Foundation issued [...] "Bulletin 33" [...] in January 1930 criticizing {{recruitment}} and subsidization of athletes, Aigler challenged {{the fairness of}} the report. Aigler charged that Savage had [...] "no intention of <b>being</b> <b>fair</b> and accurate" [...] and accused Savage of questionable tactics in sending Michigan's president a report of conditions different from the report in the bulletin. Aigler also accused Savage of removing letters from the files of the athletic department to which he was allowed full access. He also argued that the report reflected eastern bias: [...] "In a number of places in the Bulletin the so-called Western Conference (now the Big Nine) is referred to and, curiously, almost always with a sort of half veiled sneer. The truth apparently is that the Bulletin was written {{from the point of view}} of the Eastern athletic man who has it pretty firmly fixed in mind that, athletically, things are pretty raw in the territory generally West of the Alleghenies." [...] Aigler later issued a 31-page report on athletic conditions at Michigan, charging the Carnegie Foundation with [...] "muck-raking." ...|$|E

He then pressed Duke for an apology and when Duke protested that Robinson was not <b>being</b> <b>fair</b> to him, Robinson replied that he didn't think Duke was being honest.

2500|$|False {{compromise}} {{refers to}} the claim, made by some Israeli advocates and by some Palestinian advocates, that {{their side of the}} conflict is morally right and the other side is morally wrong and, therefore, attempts to balance the presentation of both viewpoints wrongfully suggests that both sides are morally equivalent. [...] In the words of journalist Bret Stephens, [...] "Moral clarity is a term that doesn't get much traction these days, least of all among journalists, who prefer 'objectivity' and 'balance.' Yet good journalism is more than about separating fact from opinion and <b>being</b> <b>fair.</b> Good journalism is about fine analysis and making distinctions, and this applies as much to moral distinctions as to any others. Because too many reporters today refuse to make moral distinctions, we are left with a journalism whose narrative and analytical failings have become ever more glaring".|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, {{branches}} of the public library in Brevard County, Florida, removed copies of Fifty Shades of Grey from their shelves, with an official stating {{that it did not}} meet the selection criteria for the library and that reviews for the book had been poor. A representative for the library stated that it was due to the book's sexual content and that other libraries had declined to purchase copies for their branches. Deborah Caldwell-Stone of the American Library Association commented that [...] "If the only reason you don't select a book is that you disapprove of its content, but there is demand for it, there's a question of whether you're <b>being</b> <b>fair.</b> In a public library there is usually very little that would prevent a book from being on the shelf if there is a demand for the information." [...] Brevard County public libraries later made their copies available to their patrons due to public demand.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the above findings the Barr Tribunal was particularly critical of the Irish media. This is worthy of note, {{despite the fact that}} the media organisations concerned did not accentuate this aspect of the report. Judge Barr found the RTÉ's Five Seven Live radio show was particularly irresponsible in naming John Carthy and Barr adjudged that [...] "the facts and circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of John Carthy as specified in the Tribunal’s Terms of Reference include matters which add to or could have potential for aggravating the deceased’s apparently serious mental distress which became progressively more severe as the episode at Abbeylara continued (vide the evidence of Dr. John Sheehan and other psychiatrists given at the Tribunal), and in consequence the potential for undermining the possibility of successful dialogue between the Garda negotiator and John Carthy which might have avoided the circumstances that gave rise to his death." [...] In {{addition to}} RTÉ, the Sunday Independent was also strongly criticised, particularly an article entitled Dramatic New Evidence in Abbeylara Case with beneath it a subsidiary headline [...] "Abbeylara family row over land may have affected siege victim Carthy’s state of mind prior to his death". That article was published on 31 October 2004 and Justice Barr found it to be slanderous to the Carthy family. The Barr Tribunal was particularly riled that the Sunday Independent journalist in question, Maeve Sheehan, was more concerned with defending the Garda position at any cost than <b>being</b> <b>fair</b> to the Carthy family. The report noted that her [...] "article also contained other information apparently favourable to the Garda case that the connection between the deceased and his sister, Marie, was not the close caring relationship indicated in evidence by various witnesses". [...] The Tribunal noted that the Carthy family had sued that particular newspaper for the article in question, and that the Sunday Independent had settled out of court before the trial.|$|E
2500|$|The {{establishment}} of a duty of care is usually broken up into a three-step test. The first case to establish a general duty of care was Donoghue v Stevenson. Famously, Mrs Donoghue claimed compensation for illness, after she consumed a ginger beer containing a decomposed snail, in a public house in Paisley, Scotland. The bottle was opaque so Mrs Donoghue, nor the shopkeeper, could see a snail, {{and at the time}} she could not sue the shopkeeper for breach of contract or consumer rights. The House of Lords, by a majority held that the manufacturer, Mr Stevenson, was liable in tort. Lord Atkin held liability was [...] "based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay" [...] and people [...] "must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour." [...] By contrast, Lord Macmillan suggested that the law should protect Mrs Donoghue by incremental analogy to previous cases. Nevertheless, Lord Atkin's speech was widely followed, and understood to contain three main points for establishing a duty of care. Firstly, the concept of reasonable foreseeability of harm; secondly, the claimant and the defendant being in a relationship of proximity; and thirdly, and more loosely, it <b>being</b> <b>fair,</b> just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for his careless actions. This three step scheme (also known as the tripartite or threefold test) [...] however, did not crystallise until the case of Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman. A company called Caparo took over another company, by buying up a majority of its shares. It did this because it sneakily obtained word from a company audit that the target was financially sound. The audit was prepared by a group of accountants (Dickman) and was intended for shareholders, not outsiders. Once Caparo owned the company it found that the finances were in fact pretty shoddy, and so it sued the accountants for being negligent in its audit preparation. The House of Lords found against Caparo, and established the current threefold test. Although it was [...] "reasonably foreseeable" [...] that outsiders might learn of the carelessly prepared information, it was not the case that Caparo and Dickman were in a relationship of [...] "proximity". This the court used as a term of art (note, this is different from the American use of the word), to say that it should not be the case that absolutely anyone hearing something said that was stupid and acted on it can sue. The court was reacting to its concern that to allow a claim here might open the floodgates of litigation. The third element, whether liability would be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] was an extra hurdle added, as a catch all discretionary measure for the judiciary to block further claims.|$|E
