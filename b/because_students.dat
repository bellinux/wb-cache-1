5|$|The boys take Marvin to an all-you-can-eat buffet, {{where he}} is shocked by how much food the townsfolk consume {{compared}} to his home country, and by how wasteful Cartman is with his food. Back at school, Mr. Garrison announces the food drive is a failure <b>because</b> <b>students</b> have brought {{in only a few}} cans of creamed corn. The boys present Marvin to the class during show and tell, after which Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria tell the boys they will have to call Red Cross and send Marvin home. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephisto shows Chef that the turkey DNA is growing so rapidly that the turkeys might take over the world if they are not stopped.|$|E
5|$|This {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the largest set of renovations to be undertaken since the expansions conducted under the Mamluk Sultanate. Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda was appointed katkhuda (head of the Janissaries) in 1749 and embarked on several projects throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar. Under his direction, three new gates were built: the Bab al-Muzayinīn (the Gate of the Barbers), so named <b>because</b> <b>students</b> would have their heads shaved outside of the gate, which eventually became the main entrance to the mosque; the Bab al-Sa'ayida (the Gate of the Sa'idis), named for the Sa'idi people of Upper Egypt; and, several years later, the Bab al-Shurba (the Soup Gate), from which food, often rice soup, would be served to the students. A prayer hall was added to the south of the original one, doubling the size of the available prayer space. Katkhuda also refurbished or rebuilt several of the riwaqs that surrounded the mosque. Katkhuda was buried in a mausoleum he himself had built in Al-Azhar; in 1776, he became the first person (and the last) to be interred within the mosque since Nafissa al-Bakriyya, a female mystic who had died around 1588.|$|E

50|$|Vittana was a {{non-governmental}} organization that allowed people to lend money via the Internet {{to students in}} the developing world. It was a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization headquartered in Seattle. Vittana focused on <b>student</b> loans <b>because</b> <b>student</b> loans are nearly unavailable in developing countries.|$|R
50|$|In {{the prior}} example, T would {{represent}} a table such that every <b>Student</b> (<b>because</b> <b>Student</b> is the unique key / attribute of the Completed table) is combined with every given Task. So Eugene, for instance, would have two rows, Eugene &rarr; Database1 and Eugene &rarr; Database2 in T.|$|R
25|$|Many {{schools do}} not allow chewing gum <b>because</b> <b>students</b> often dispose of it inappropriately (leaving it under desks and chairs, behind vending machines, etc.). The chewing may also pose a {{distraction}} to class, and the gum might carry diseases or bacteria from other students.|$|E
25|$|Prior to that, {{he worked}} for HSBC Private Bank in London. During his studies he was nicknamed 'Ed' <b>because</b> <b>students</b> {{preferred}} this to Mohamed or Mahbub. He eventually returned to the UK and moved outside Tower Hamlets, living in Redbridge, and then in Essex. He now lives in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Ja'mie and {{her friends}} go on to form a student {{representative}} council and organise a Year 11 formal. Ja'mie plans to have it at a popular nightclub with an expensive DJ, but at $450 a ticket, the student council faces cancelling the event <b>because</b> <b>students</b> can't afford tickets. Instead, Ja'mie arranges a day {{to raise money for}} AIDS in Africa, which is enough to cover formal expenses. The Head of Senior School learns that the reason for this fundraiser is actually to fund the expensive formal. As a compromise, Ja'mie is offered to hold the formal in the school's staff room, with no DJ and cheap hand-made decorations. She invites lesbian student Tamsin to the formal to make a big impression, but when Tamsin finds out that Ja'mie is not lesbian, she declines by SMS, forcing Ja'mie to take Sebastian; they stay together this time, although she still checks his phone messages.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{previous}} research (Hayati and Shariatifar 2009;Razi 2010;Vianty 2007), {{we hypothesized that}} self-reports of pragmatic strategy use would predominate over reports of analytic strategy use for Indian <b>students</b> <b>because</b> these <b>students</b> used English in their academic work, which is not their native language.|$|R

50|$|In some fields, {{research}} {{positions are}} more coveted than teaching positions <b>because</b> <b>student</b> researchers are typically paid {{to work on}} the dissertation they are required to complete anyway, while teaching is generally considered a distraction from one's work. Research positions are more typical of science disciplines; they are relatively uncommon in humanities disciplines, and where they exist, they rarely allow the student {{to work on the}}ir own research.|$|R
25|$|Like acceleration, {{colloquium}} provides {{advanced material}} {{for high school}} students. In colloquium, students take Advanced Placement courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes <b>because</b> <b>students</b> are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes {{in a different way}} than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from The Scarlet Letter in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take Advanced Placement courses in math and science and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|The CFS is also criticised {{for being}} ineffective, with one student stating that [...] "They don’t put enough {{emphasis}} on focused lobbying of elected officials, {{and continue to}} prefer the protests and sit-ins." [...] This is important <b>because</b> <b>students</b> pay about $14 a year in membership fees to the CFS.|$|E
2500|$|The Stanford MSx was {{previously}} called the Stanford Sloan Master's Program, <b>because</b> <b>students</b> {{in the program}} are known as Stanford Sloan Fellows. The Stanford MSx {{is one of the}} three Sloan Fellows programs, sharing a similar format with the others at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the London Business School. These programs were initially supported by Alfred P. Sloan, Chairman of General Motors from 1937 to 1956, who envisioned the Sloan Fellowship as a means of developing the [...] "ideal manager".|$|E

50|$|Educators {{in primary}} and {{secondary}} education often associate proper behavior with school spirit, especially {{in the context of}} situations when students are outside the school itself. <b>Because</b> <b>student</b> behavior reflects on the school, representing it well shows a degree of student investment in their institution's good name. This definition of school spirit is closely associated with good sportsmanship among students and their families at sporting events and is loosely based upon encouraging each other.|$|R
2500|$|A {{university}} student {{involved in an}} exchange program can choose to live [...] on campus or off campus. Living off campus is a popular choice, <b>because</b> <b>students</b> are more independent and {{learn more about the}} new culture when they are on their own. Universities that host exchange students will offer assistance in obtaining accommodation. Universities in Asia have on-campus housing for international students on exchange or studying full-time. Temporary options include hostels, hotels, or renting. Homestays, paid accommodation with a host family, are available in some countries.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{at noon on}} May 15, about 3,000 people {{appeared}} in Sproul Plaza at nearby UC Berkeley for a rally, the original purpose of which was to discuss the Arab–Israeli conflict. Several people spoke; then, Michael Lerner ceded the Free Speech platform to ASUC Student Body President Dan Siegel <b>because</b> <b>students</b> {{were concerned about the}} fencing-off and destruction of the park. Siegel said later that he never intended to precipitate a riot; however, when he shouted [...] "Let's take the park!," [...] police turned off the sound system. The crowd responded spontaneously, moving down Telegraph Avenue toward People's Park chanting, [...] "We want the park!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Italian actuaries {{also receive}} their {{training}} through university plus a single examination {{given by the}} state (Esame di Stato). The studies usually take {{a total of five}} years to complete, three (Triennale) plus two (Magistrale), <b>because</b> <b>students</b> need to pass at least 30 exams (the exact number depends on the university and curriculum), many with both written and oral components on actuarial and economic topics. After university, to become qualified to sign statements of actuarial opinion, students must pass the Esame di Stato, which is offered twice a year in Rome and Trieste; the Esame di Stato consists of two written sections, a practical portion, and an oral exam. The association of qualified actuaries is called [...] "Ordine degli Attuari" [...] ("Order of Actuaries").|$|E
50|$|Work {{continued}} {{on the building}} until late 1965. The one-story 18000 sq ft structure consisted of five classrooms, four laboratory areas, five instructor offices, two administrative offices, three shop areas, a boiler room, and a coal storage area. The building, appraised at $120,000 when completed, was constructed {{at a cost of}} $70,000, principally <b>because</b> <b>student</b> labor helped keep expenses down. Jackson County Industrial Education Center was born as a satellite of Asheville-Buncombe Technical College.|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{described}} the committee's findings as a whitewash. A speaker {{for the student}} group Columbians for Academic Freedom, called the committee's finding that statements made were not anti-Semitic [...] "deeply insulting", not because he believed it to be false but <b>because</b> <b>student</b> complaints were about intimidation, rather than racism. Some had previously complained that the committee contained members who, in their opinion, had [...] "anti-Israel views" [...] and personal connections to Massad.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{the video}} games, have become {{recognized}} as rich learning contents for <b>students,</b> <b>because</b> the <b>students</b> can improve they cognitive development.

2500|$|According to Sansone and Morgan, when {{students}} are already motivated to engage in an activity for their own personal pleasure and then a teacher provides the student with feedback, the type of feedback given can change the way that student views the activity and can even undermine their intrinsic motivation. [...] Maclellan also looked at the relationship between tutors and students and in particular, {{and the type of}} feedback the tutor would give to the student. Maclellan’s results showed that praise or criticism directed towards the student generated a feeling of “fixed intelligence” while praise and criticism directed towards the effort and strategy used by the student generated a feeling of “malleable intelligence” [...] [...] In other words, feedback concerning effort and strategy leaves students knowing that there is room for growth. This is important because {{when students}} believe their intelligence is “fixed”, their mindset can prevent skill development <b>because</b> <b>students</b> will believe that they only have a “certain amount” of understanding on a particular subject matter and might not even try.Therefore, it’s crucial that a teacher is aware of how the feedback they give to their students can both positively and negatively impact the student’s engagement and motivation [...]|$|E
2500|$|Catharine Bond Hill, {{president}} of Vassar College argued that, [...] "many {{of us in}} higher education dislike popular college rankings such as the annual academic beauty pageant from US News & World Report. But expecting them to go away is naive, and attempting to undermine them is unwise since students and families could perceive that as petulant and paternalistic. Worse, it could seem as if {{we have something to}} hide." [...] Rather than not sending in the reputation survey, she argued, it would be of value to focus on, [...] "a third-party non-profit or foundation", sending them [...] "the same data that we already submit to US News and other rating organizations." [...] On this point, she argues, [...] "a one-size ranking does not fit all, <b>because</b> <b>students</b> and families care about different things [...] What if a school doesn't use the SAT in making admissions decisions and therefore doesn't collect or report these data? In a new system, that school couldn't be ranked if a student chose a positive weight for the SATs. Students would know that the school doesn't value that piece of information. They could then run the rankings with other information (maybe class rank and other indicators of academic achievement), excluding the SAT, and see what those rankings look like. Alternatively, they could decide they actually do care about the average SATs of the student body and decide to look at other schools. Fair enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruner {{has said}} that school shootings in the United States occur <b>because</b> <b>students</b> are being taught the science of evolution. Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a {{religious}} philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. I believe there was a Great Flood. How do YOU explain fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How do you explain the Grand Canyon? You are very naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon. I believe it took a lot more water than that to carve out the Grand Canyon and other land and rock formations formed by water erosion. You can call me ignorant or intolerant or whatever you want, but I did not make fun of YOUR religion." ...|$|E
30|$|Unemployment {{rates for}} {{students}} are somewhat higher than are those for non-students in both Greece and the UK. However, this has {{little effect on}} the overall unemployment rate in Greece <b>because</b> relatively few <b>students</b> are involved in the labour market. Similar observations can be made about Portugal and Spain, which have relatively high student unemployment rates that have little impact on the overall youth unemployment rate <b>because</b> <b>student</b> participation in the labour market is limited. Overall, students account for nearly double the share of employment (24.4 %) in northern European countries – Sweden, the UK, Ireland, France and Germany – than they do in the southern countries – Greece, Spain and Portugal (12.5 %).|$|R
