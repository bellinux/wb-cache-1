40|$|Bitterness {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to be the main}} reason for the limited palatability of several vegetables. Vegetable acceptance has been associated with preparation method. However, the taste intensity of a variety of vegetables prepared by different methods has not been studied yet. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the intensity of the five basic tastes and fattiness of ten vegetables commonly consumed in the Netherlands prepared by different methods using the modified Spectrum method. Intensities of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, umami, saltiness and fattiness were assessed for ten vegetables (cauliflower, <b>broccoli,</b> <b>leek,</b> carrot, onion, red bell pepper, French beans, tomato, cucumber and iceberg lettuce) by a panel (n = 9) trained in a modified Spectrum method. Each vegetable was assessed prepared by different methods (raw, cooked, mashed and as a cold pressed juice). Spectrum based reference solutions were available with fixed reference points at 13. 3 mm (R 1), 33. 3 mm (R 2) and 66. 7 mm (R 3) for each taste modality on a 100 mm line scale. For saltiness, R 1 and R 3 differed (16. 7 mm and 56. 7 mm). Mean intensities of all taste modalities and fattiness for all vegetables were mostly below R 1 (13. 3 mm). Significant differences (p </p...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{concern has}} lead to {{legislation}} on fertilization to reduce nutrient losses to the environment. Reducing N input may be inadequate for crops {{that have a}} high N content in their residues. Reducing N input will negatively affect yield, but the residues remain. Management of crop residues may then be a more effective strategy to reduce N losses, notably nitrate leaching. Two experiments were carried out in 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 to study all emission routes of N from crop residues of <b>broccoli,</b> <b>leek</b> and sugar beet, and to determine the contribution of N from the residues to nitrate in groundwater. Crop residues were surface applied or rototilled, and compared with a blank and application of fertilizer N. About 11 to 16 % of the N-content was lost to the air. Total N-losses to the air as ammonia and through denitrification were little affected by tillage, but partitioning was. When residues were left on the soil surface, most N was lost as ammonia, when the residues were rototilled, most N was lost through denitrification. Year strongly affected N leaching from crop residues, and the fraction of N from crop residues that was leached was twice as high in 2006 - 07 than in 2007 - 08. Tillage increased N leaching from broccoli, but had little effect with leek or sugar beet. Between 20 and 60 % of the N content of residues of leek and broccoli was leached. Removal of residues after harvest will therefore contribute to reduce N leaching. However, options for treatment and re-use of the residues need to be studied {{as well as the}} effects on nitrate leaching and gaseous losses to assess the effects of the system as a whol...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{systems can}} lose {{substantial}} amounts of nitrogen (N). To protect the environment, the European Union (EU) has adopted several directives that set goals to limit N losses. National Emission Ceilings (NEC) are prescribed in the NEC directive for nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Crop residues may contribute to ammonia volatilization, but sufficient information on their contribution to the national ammonia volatilization is lacking. Experiments were carried out with the aim to assess the ammonia volatilization of crop residues left on the soil surface or incorporated into the soil under the conditions met in practice in the Netherlands during late autumn and winter. Ammonia emission from residues of <b>broccoli,</b> <b>leek,</b> sugar beet, cut grass, fodder radish (fresh and frozen) and yellow mustard (frozen) was studied during two winter seasons using volatilization chambers. Residues were either placed on top of soil or mixed with soil. Mixing residues with soil gave insignificant ammonia volatilization, whereas volatilization was 5 – 16 percent of the N content of residues when placed on top of soil. Ammonia volatilization started after at least 4 days. Total ammonia volatilization was related to C/N-ratio and N concentration of the plant material. After 37 days, cumulative ammonia volatilization was negligible from plant material with N concentration below 2 percent, and was 10 percent of the N content of plant material with 4 percent N. These observations {{can be explained by}} decomposition of plant material by micro-organisms. After an initial built up of the microbial population, NH 4 + that is not needed for their own growth is released and can easily emit as NH 3 at the soil surface. The results of the experiments were used to estimate the contribution of crop residues to ammonia volatilization in the Netherlands. Crop residues of arable crops and residues of pasture topping may contribute more than 3 million kg NH 3 –N to the national ammonia volatilization of the Netherlands, being more than 3 percent of the national emissions in 2005. This contribution should therefore be considered when focusing on the national ceilings for ammonia emissions...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the polyphenol content (total phenols, flavonoids, nonflavonoids, anthocyanins) and antioxidant capacity in selected fruits (apple, ‘Idared’; apricot, ‘Madjarska najbolja’; blueberry, ‘Bluecrop’; mandarin, ‘Kuno’; orange, unknown; sour cherry, ‘Marasca’; strawberry, ‘Maya’ and peach, ‘Redhaven’) and vegetables (broccoli, ‘Belstar’ -flower and steam; cauliflower, ‘Favola’; kale, ‘Melissa’ and leek-leaf and root -unknown) commonly consumed in the Croatian diet. Total phenols, flavonoids and nonflavonoids were measured calorimetrically by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with gallic acid as the standard; anthocyanins were determined using bisulphite bleaching method using cyanidin- 3 -diglucoside as standard, whereas antioxidant capacity was measured using DPPH method. The highest total polyphenols were observed in sour cherry as 2560 mg GAE/kg fresh weight (FW), followed by blueberry, orange, mandarin, strawberry, apple, apricot, and peach. Among vegetables the highest concentration of total polyphenols was determined in kale (1039 mg GAE/kg FW) followed by broccoli flower, <b>broccoli</b> steam, <b>leek</b> leaf, leek root and cauliflower. In all investigated fruits, as well as vegetables, total flavonoids were predominant polyphenols. Total nonflavonoids were present in low concentration especially in <b>leek</b> leaf, <b>broccoli</b> flower and <b>leek</b> root. The highest antioxidant capacity in fruit and vegetables was determined in samples with higher concentration of flavonoids. In selected fruits, there was a distinct correlation between total phenols or flavonoids and antioxidant capacity, while in vegetable the correlation was not observed...|$|R
40|$|One hundred {{nineteen}} isolates from {{a commercial}} zucchini purée stored at 4, 10, and 20 to 25 °C were fingerprinted using repetitive sequence-based PCR (REP-PCR) and classified into 35 REP types. One representative isolate of each REP type was subsequently identified by API 50 CHB/ 20 E profile and partial rrs gene sequence analysis. Nine REP types were misidentified by the API system. Strains were misidentified {{as being in}} the Bacillus circulans (group 2) API taxon or in taxa with a low number of positive API characters such as Brevibacillus brevis. A phylogenetic analysis pointed to one new species of Bacillus and three new species of Paenibacillus among the misidentified REP types. Bacterial components in zucchini purée were compared phenotypically with those obtained in previous work on <b>broccoli,</b> carrot, <b>leek,</b> potato, and split pea purées, based on simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group method with averages cluster analysis. Out of 254 strains, 69 strains previously identified as B. circulans (group 2) or B. circulans/B. macerans/B. polymyxa were assigned to a new Paenibacillus taxon phylogenetically related to P. azotofixans. Storage conditions at 4 °C favored the development of “B. macroides/B. maroccanus” and Paenibacillus spp. in zucchini purées and Paenibacillus spp. in other purées. Storage conditions at 20 to 25 °C favored the development of B. subtilis group (B. licheniformis and B. subtilis) and B. cereus group strains. At 10 °C, Paenibacillus spp. were always present at high frequencies, whereas the occurrence of B. macroides/B. maroccanus (in zucchini purées), B. cereus, and B. pumilus varied with the experiment...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a more}} {{detailed}} Executive Summary {{at the top of}} the attached document, which is the final report for Defra Project OF 0177. The project aimed to examine the organic extension of a simple mechanistically-based growth and competition model, calibrated to data originally gained from conventional vegetable production. Essentially the model simulation follows the growth of each crop and weed plant as they compete for space and light during and after canopy closure. The growth and competition model has been modified to simulate crop and weed growth of multiple cohorts so that the onset of crop weed competition can be predicted. This onset of competition marks the point when it is essential to remove weeds (i. e. critical weeding time); otherwise, there will be a penalty to crop yield. The model can be applied to determine the onset of competition between competing species (i. e. crop and weed). In organic crops this would be the time when physical removal of the weeds (either by means of mechanical or hand weeding methods) was essential to prevent yield loss. To test the ability of the model to identify critical weeding times, model predictions were compared with historical experimental data. The inputs to the model are starting plant weights and the numbers of individuals per unit area of the crop and weed species for each cohort at each day of the simulation. Solar radiation was used to drive the model. All the growth parameters were species specific and where a number of weed species are competing with the crop in a mixed population, then a general set of parameters representing the mean of a range of parameterised weed species were used. Repeatedly running the simulation with different starting inputs from a range of historical data sets indicated that the observed critical weeding time was described well by the model. To examine the applicability of the principle of the growth model to an organic cropping situation, the predicted optimum timing of weed removal simulated by the model was incorporated as a treatment into an existing organic carrot trial. The aim was to see whether the weeding time simulated by the model achieved comparable or better results than the weeding by the unaided judgement of the grower. The results demonstrated that there was certainly no disadvantage to using the model in that year to aid in the decision making process. A small-scale trial was made in year 3, incluing cabbage plus three previously unparameterised crops; <b>broccoli,</b> cauliflower and <b>leeks.</b> The crop parameters for cabbage were used to drive the cauliflower and broccoli simulations and onion parameters for leeks. Three treatments were; weeding once as recommended by advisors at HDRA, weeding once as predicted by the model and left weedy throughout to test the competitive level of the weed flora. Inputs into the model were solar radiation, crop transplant weights and numbers, and weed weights and numbers during the early weeks of crop growth. Adjustment of the model using the final crop weights was related to the different relative growth rates of the crops in organic soils, compared with the higher N levels in conventional soils from where the parameters had been originally derived. After recalibration, the model re-confirmed the mid-August onset of competition, but tended to over predict the degree of weed competition. The notable exception was the leek crop which was more sensitive to competition than its brassica counterparts and gave a good illustration of the potential power of the model. As part of the project several presentations have been made to growers during the final year, which have allowed a dialogue and awareness to develop highlighting the practical and scientific implications of the model...|$|R
