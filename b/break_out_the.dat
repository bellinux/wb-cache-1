5|$|Captain Renaudin, of Généreux, and Joseph Allemand, of Ville de Marseille, {{were both}} honourably acquitted during the {{automatic}} court-martial {{for the loss}} of their ships. The French Navy made no further efforts to reach Malta, and all subsequent efforts by French warships to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> port were met by the blockade, only one frigate breaking through and reaching France. Without the supplies carried on Perrée's convoy, starvation and disease spread throughout the garrison {{and by the end of}} August 1800, French soldiers were dying at a rate of 100 a day. On 4 September, Vaubois finally capitulated, turning the island over to the British, who retained it for the next 164 years.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{competition}} {{there were six}} English teams and six Italian teams. These teams were split into three groups consisting of two English and two Italian teams each, with two points being awarded for a win, one point for a draw, and a point for each goal scored. The final was contested between the best team from each country, and Swindon played Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 28 May 1970. Swindon were 3–0 up after 63 minutes, when violence started to <b>break</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> match had to be abandoned after 79 minutes, with Swindon being declared as the first winners of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} {{proceeded to}} Egypt, arriving on 2 December {{and after a}} period of training it took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, where it went ashore as part of the second wave. Shortly after the landing the 2nd Brigade was transferred from Anzac Cove to Cape Helles to assist in the attack on Krithia. During the unsuccessful attack, the 6th Battalion suffered heavy casualties, losing 133 men killed or died of wounds. Afterwards, they returned to Anzac Cove, arriving there on 17 May, to take part in defending the beachhead that had been established. In August, when the Allies attempted a <b>break</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> battalion took part in the attack on Lone Pine. In September they were withdrawn for a period of rest to Lemnos. They returned in November and resumed defensive duties. By that time, due to the failure of August Offensive, the campaign evolved into a stalemate. They remained in the line December, when the Allies carried out a successful evacuation. During the campaign they lost 22 officers and 398 other ranks killed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 November 1942, the Eighth Army {{attacked}} again in the north, with 2nd New Zealand Division in the lead. Freyberg placed 151 Brigade {{on the right and}} 152 Brigade on the left. The aim was to attack directly westwards across the Rahman track, with the infantry leading the night assault and 9th Armoured Brigade (now commanded by Brigadier John C. Currie) again passing through to break the enemy gun line and allow X Corps to <b>break</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> assault went to plan except that opposition on the left was heavier than expected which slowed the advance. As a result, the advancing tanks were highlighted against the dawn sky in the east and began to be picked off by Axis anti-tank fire. The Regiment was in the centre of the 9th Armoured Brigade, and the CO lost touch with both his artillery support and close anti-tank support. In the growing light, the B squadron commander (Major M.StJ.V.Gibbs) realised that he was in a ring of enemy anti-tank guns, ahead and to both flanks. He gave the order to 'Charge' and B Squadron overran the anti-tank positions, losing some vehicles but destroying the enemy gun line. Meanwhile, the 21st Panzer Division was counter-attacking A and C Squadrons and at 4pm the Regiment (now down to four tanks) was withdrawn. The 1st Armoured Division from X Corps were just behind the 9th Armoured Brigade but there were no liaison officers between the units and 1st Armoured did not take the opportunity to push on through the broken Axis gun-line.|$|E

25|$|Racial {{tensions}} in Cleveland were exacerbated {{as the city}} began busing African American children to all-white schools in order to racially desegregate its schools and to reduce overcrowding in minority-majority elementary schools. Black parents were outraged when they discovered that their children were not eligible to participate in arts, sports, and after-hours activities at these schools. In January 1964, the United Freedom Movement, a coalition of black civil rights groups, decided to march on the Murray Hill School in the city's Little Italy neighborhood. When city leaders learned that local white residents intended to stop the march, they feared a riot would <b>break</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> black civil rights groups were persuaded to cancel their protest. But the white mob still formed, and throughout the day on January 30, 1964, white citizens threw rocks and bottles and assaulted any African American person they found on the streets. The Cleveland Police made no arrests.|$|E
25|$|Held in a {{prisoner}} of war camp, Clifton soon managed to escape and made his way as far as the Swiss border before being recaptured. Transferred to a punishment camp at Gavi, he made three further escape attempts, the last of which was in September 1943 and involved the digging of a tunnel with 60 other prisoners. Detected before they could <b>break</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> prisoners were moved to a camp in Germany. While en route, Clifton jumped from the train transporting them through Germany. His escape was short lived and while hiding in a bush near the train tracks, he was shot in the leg and stomach by a guard. Other prisoners, under guard, retrieved him and dressed his wounds. Taken to a hospital, he was treated for his wounds; the bullet, which had lodged in his stomach, was later given to him as a souvenir. In March 1944, after recuperating for four months, he was placed in a camp near Hadamar which was specially designated for recidivist escapees.|$|E
25|$|Alfonso XI {{launched}} his expedition in August 1349, having made extensive preparations {{to ensure that}} he would not face the problems that had doomed his 1333 attempt. He raised money through three extraordinary levies, obtaining shares of ecclesiastical income granted by the Pope (who had endorsed Alfonso's campaigns as crusades), selling royal lands and having the crown jewels melted down and sold. He also had much tighter control of his nobles than in 1333, with many of the great nobles of Castile accompanying the expedition. He set up his base in the area of La Línea de la Concepción, north of Gibraltar, with an army of some 20,000 men. The Castilians made no attempt to storm Gibraltar but settled down for a long siege and dug defensive ditches across the isthmus to block Moorish attempts to <b>break</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> camp was more like a town than a temporary camp, with barracks constructed for the army. Alfonso even brought along most of his family by his mistress Leonora de Guzman – four boys and a girl – with his legitimate son Peter remaining in Seville. The siege was supported by primitive cannon in what was to be the first use of gunpowder weapons against Gibraltar's fortifications.|$|E

25|$|On 30 April, after {{receiving}} news of Hitler's suicide, orders were issued {{that those who}} could do so were to <b>break</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> plan was to escape from Berlin to the Allies {{on the western side}} of the Elbe or to the German Army to the North. Prior to the breakout, Mohnke briefed all commanders (who could be reached) within the Zitadelle sector about the events as to Hitler's death and the planned break out. They split up into ten main groups on 1 May 1945. Mohnke's group included: secretary Traudl Junge, secretary Gerda Christian, secretary Else Krüger, Hitler's dietician, Constanze Manziarly, Ernst-Günther Schenck, Walther Hewel and various others. Mohnke planned to break out towards the German Army which was positioned in Prinzenallee. The group headed along the subway but their route was blocked so they went aboveground and later joined hundreds of other Germans civilians and military personnel who had sought refuge at the Schultheiss-Patzenhofer Brewery on Prinzenallee. On 2 May 1945, General Weidling issued an order calling for the complete surrender of all German forces still in Berlin. Knowing they could not get through the Soviet rings, Mohnke decided to surrender to the Red Army. However, several of Mohnke's group (including some of the SS personnel) opted to commit suicide.|$|E

On 20 June [...] arrived off Japan's northern islands {{under the command of}} Commander Gene Fluckey. For this patrol the submarine had been fitted with an experimental [...] rocket launcher intended for shore bombardments. Shortly after midnight on 22 June the submarine fired 12 rockets at the town of Shari in north-east Hokkaido. Barb then proceeded north, and on 2 July bombarded the town of Kaiyo in south-east Sakhalin with its deck gun. This attack destroyed three sampans docked in the town, damaged a seal rookery and caused several fires to <b>break</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> next day the submarine fired more rockets at the town of Shisuka. A party of eight men from Barb was landed on the east coast of Sakhalin on 23 July and planted demolition charges on a railroad track. Shortly after the men began rowing back to the submarine the charges were triggered by a passing train; 150 people, including civilians, were killed. On 24 July, Barb fired 32 rockets at the town of Shiritori and 12 rockets at Kashiho. As the submarine returned to base it shelled the towns of Chiri on 25 July and Shibertoro the next day. The attack on Shibertoro targeted a shipyard building sampans, and destroyed 35 newly built vessels.|$|E
