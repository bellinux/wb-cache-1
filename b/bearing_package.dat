40|$|A new {{fluid film}} <b>bearing</b> <b>package</b> {{has been tested}} in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump (HPOTP). This fluid film element {{functions}} as both the pump end bearing and the preburner pump rear wear ring seal.

The design and predicted performance of the turbopump are reviewed. Results are presented for measured pump and bearing performance during testing on the NASA Technology Test Bed (TTB) Engine located at MSFC. The most significant results were obtained from proximity probes located in the bearing bore which revealed large subsynchronous precession at ten percent of shaft speed during engine start which subsided prior to mainstage power levels and reappeared during engine shutdown at equivalent power levels below 65 % of nominal. This phenomenon has been attributed to rotating stall in the diffuser. The proximity probes also revealed the location of the bearing in the bore for different operating speeds. Pump vibration characteristics were improved as compared to pumps tested with ball bearings. After seven starts and more than 700 seconds of testing, the pump showed no signs of performance degradation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRotating {{floating}} {{rings in}} the rotor bearings {{are widely used}} for decrease of rotor vibrations in small rotor machines. Such bearings are named two-film, because have two lubricant films. Dynamics of the rotor with floating ring bearings is investigated in details in [1 – 3]. The charging system also use non-rotating floating rings in turbochargers of internal combustion engines [4]. In some combinations of design and condition parameters of the rotor bearing system, the dimension of rotor and rings motion trajectory can essentially increase, though it is still limited [1 – 3]. To decrease journal and ring oscillation amplitudes and loadings affecting the bearing, the design with three lubricant films can be used. It is achieved through installation of the floating ring package into a rotor machine case.

40|$|This Low Friction (High Efficiency Roller Bearing) Engine (LFE) report {{presents}} {{the work done}} by The Timken Company to conduct a technology demonstration {{of the benefits of}} replacing hydrodynamic bearings with roller bearings in the crankshaft and camshaft assemblies of an internal combustion engine for the purpose of collecting data sufficient to prove merit. The engines in the present study have been more extensively converted to roller bearings than any previous studies (40 needle roller bearings per engine) to gain understanding of the full potential of application of bearing technology. The project plan called for comparative testing of a production vehicle which was already respected for having demonstrated low engine friction levels with a rollerized version of that engine. Testing was to include industry standard tests for friction, emissions and fuel efficiency conducted on instrumented dynamometers. Additional tests for fuel efficiency, cold start resistance and other measures of performance were {{to be made in the}} actual vehicle. Comparative measurements of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), were planned, although any work to mitigate the suspected higher NVH level in the rollerized engine was beyond the scope of this project. Timken selected the Toyota Avalon with a 3. 5 L V- 6 engine as the test vehicle. In an attempt to minimize cost and fabrication time, a ‘made-from’ approach was proposed in which as many parts as possible would be used or modified from production parts to create the rollerized engine. Timken commissioned its test partner, FEV Engine Technology, to do a feasibility study in which they confirmed that using such an approach was possible to meet the required dimensional restrictions and tolerances. In designing the roller bearing systems for the crank and cam trains, Timken utilized as many production engine parts as possible. The crankshafts were produced from production line forgings, which use Timken steel, modified with special machining and heat treatment. Timken designed and manufactured all of the roller bearing related components such as the thrust <b>bearing</b> <b>package.</b> The production connecting rods and camshafts could not be used for the roller bearing engine, so new ones were produced according to the team’s designs using Timken steel. The remaining miscellaneous components were designed and procured by FEV. Timken prepared a display version of the crankshaft portion of the production engine without connecting rods which could be driven by a motor through a cogged-belt and electrically actuated clutch arrangement. A modified version was also made in which the engine was outfitted with roller bearings on the main bearing positions. Preliminary tests showed that the rollerized engine was running with 1 / 3 less friction than the standard display engine. Additional friction testing and noise characterization was cut short because of shipping damage to the rollerized engine display and because of other project priorities. The team did successfully demonstrate the ability to package roller bearings satisfactorily in numerous locations in a typical automotive engine. The scope of this project did not include durability demonstration and that subject would have to be addressed in any follow-on work. In the actual test phase, the rollerized engine did show significantly less friction in motored dynamometer tests compared to its production equivalent. The 5 - 10 % improvement measured in this study was about half that seen in other studies. However, the fired test results did not show a reduction in friction which did not match prior experience or expectations. Subsequent teardown and inspection of the rollerized engine revealed potential sources of excessive friction in the experimental application. These features would be eliminated in a design not based on modification of production parts. The team is confident (based on experience) that friction reduction would be realized with proper modifications...|$|E

40|$|QA bearing {{technologies}} Ltd. (hereafter QA) is {{a custom}} manufacturer of bearings {{in a variety}} of types and sizes. This research concerns one of the processes in QA’s bearing manufacturing in which the individual bearings, once assembled, are packaged to prevent corrosion and attack from any environmental influence. QA currently employs a manual process, which is time-consuming and significantly limits QA’s productivity. This greatly raises a need to improve this process through the design of an automated process for <b>bearing</b> <b>packaging.</b> Various kinds of packaging machine are available in the market for this application. However, most of them are designed for general packaging purpose and simply combining them may result in the functional overlap as applied to the packaging process. This research aims to design an automatic <b>bearing</b> <b>packaging</b> system (ABPS) based on an advanced design theory, i. e., Axiomatic Design Theory (ADT). In {{the first part of this}} research, a set of general functional requirements (FRs) and constraints (CONs) were defined specifically based on the needs from the customers. All FRs were maintained independent to each other such that the following design wouldn’t result in functional overlap. Then, design parameters (DPs) in general level were created to satisfy the defined FRs, each being a functionally independent subsystem consists of both custom-design components and products existing in the market. The second part of the research was to decompose the FRs and DPs based on independent axiom of ADT into further levels until the conceptual design was accomplished. In this process, acceptable alternatives in different hierarchies were proposed for comparison in the decision making process. Also, the relationship between FRs and DPs in the same level was always maintained one-to-one, which allows readily for modification in future, if needed. In the third part of this research, the information axiom of ADT was utilized to find the best solution from alternatives. For this, each alternative was evaluated in terms of the information content that reflects the possibility of satisfying the objective FR. The one with least information content was determined as the best alternative. As a result of this research, two solutions with different degree of automation were recommended for the <b>bearing</b> <b>packaging</b> system. The first solution is featured with higher degree of automation and capable of <b>packaging</b> <b>bearings</b> with limited human interface and as result, the total cost for its implementation is relatively high. The second solution integrates semi-automated machines and simplified sealing strategy and as such, the cost for its implementation is significantly reduced. After the conceptual design is complete, ADT is further applied in the detailed design level for oiling system with custom-designed components and mechanism. For the design of certain DPs, the design process applying ADT is used to compare with conventional methods, proved to be more efficient and simplified. Eventually, the final solution proposed for the detailed design of oiling system is consistent with independent axiom of ADT...|$|R

Currently, the most efficient means of producing HD vectors involves coinfecting 293 cells expressing Cre with the HD vector and a helper virus <b>bearing</b> a <b>packaging</b> signal flanked by loxP sites. Cre-mediated packaging signal excision renders the helper virus genome unpackageable but still able to replicate and provide helper functions for HD vector propagation. Typically, helper virus contamination is ≤ 1 % pre- and ≤ 0. 1 % postpurification by CsCl banding. While these contamination levels are low, further reduction is desirable. However, this objective {{has not been realized}} since the Cre/loxP system was first developed. This lack of progress is due, at least in part, to our lack of understanding of the origins of the contaminating helper virus, thus rendering its reduction or elimination difficult to achieve. This study was designed to investigate the possible sources of contaminating helper virus persisting during HD vector amplification. The results revealed that Cre is limiting in helper virus-infected Cre-expressing 293 cells, thereby permitting helper viruses to escape packaging signal excision and propagate. The results of this study should provide a foundation for developing rational strategies to further reduce or possibly eliminate the contaminating helper virus...|$|R

40|$|The tobacco industry’s {{archives}} {{suggest that}} the global campaign for the plain packaging of tobacco products originated in 1986, when the Canadian Medical Association passed a resolution calling for cigarettes to be sold in <b>packages</b> <b>bearing</b> only a brand name and the health message ‘this product is injurious to your health’. In most jurisdictions, regulations requiring the apposition of health warnings to cigarette packs have been in force for decades. Proposals for plain packaging aim to go further, and eliminate the visual and tactile features that turn cigarette packs into ‘badge’ wrappers, and which express the subliminal messages that diminish or subvert the effect {{of even the most}} uncompromising health messages. Given that effective plain packaging regulations would severely restrict the tobacco companies’ ability to exploit their trademarks or rights in trade dress, the question of the domestic or international ‘constitutionality’ of such restrictions has become an essential ground for the industry’s contestation of plain packaging measures. When it passed the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act of 2011, which came into force on December 1 2012, Australia became the first nation in the world to impose a mandatory scheme of plain packaging, and, in the process, the first jurisdiction to adjudicate on the constitutionality of plain packaging. Plain packaging legislation raises a number of engaging theoretical and practical questions: about the legal qualities of the intellectual property rights that articulate branding strategies, about the relationship between the regimes of international trade law and world health policy, and about the history of regulatory initiatives to address the public health implications of smoking. Here, I am interested questions about the communicative agency of the mass media: what does the example of Australia’s plain packaging laws tell us about the role played by the surfaces of material wrappers and packages in branding practices?; how do brands articulate with the other strands of the mass media...|$|R

In July 1923 the business was re-formed with threeowners, Dora Lauraine Clayton, Minnie Probert and Harriett Delany, with joint managers Mr. Probert and Mr. Delany, and in that year the company first showed a profit. They registered their trademark [...] "Vincent's APC" [...] on 21 July 1930, and invested heavily in advertising: £2575 in 1931, £3367 in 1932 and £4703 in 1933, in which year they made a profit of £18,400. The trademark design changed little from this time: [...] "VINCENT'S" [...] in white lettering on a blue rectangle, with [...] "A•P•C" [...] in white on a blue semicircle attached directly below, and [...] "GENUINE (PINK)" [...] in blue on a yellow semicircle attached above.|$|R
