40|$|Purpose The paper {{analyses}} how leisure <b>boat</b> <b>tourism</b> impacts are perceive {{by local}} communities in coastal areas. For this purpose {{a review of}} the literature on nautical and leisure <b>boat</b> <b>tourism,</b> together with residents’ attitudes is presented. On that basis, authors consider economic, socio-cultural and environmental impacts, together with general development and future policies of nautical tourism and cluster the coastal community according to their attitudes toward leisure <b>boat</b> <b>tourism.</b> Design/methodology/approach Primary data is collected among residents of coastal municipalities in the north part of the Adriatic Sea. Within the theoretical framework of social representation, a cluster analysis is performed on 233 valid questionnaires, collected during winter 2013. Findings Interviewed residents believe that leisure boating has a long tradition and has offered improvements to the municipalities as tourism destinations. They consider leisure <b>boat</b> <b>tourism</b> as a catalyst for tourism development and international tourists’ attraction. The cluster analysis reveals the existence of three homogeneous groups of residents labelled as: supporters (51 %), cautious (29 %) and sceptics (20 %). Practical implications Practical implications are derived for destination managers and DMO in addressing internal marketing and larger advertisement of the positive impacts leisure <b>boat</b> <b>tourism</b> has over the local community. Originality/value The paper enriches the discussion on residents’ perceptions on nautical tourism and specifically on leisure <b>boat</b> <b>tourism</b> in coastal areas. Limitations are linked to the exploratory nature of the research paper, the sample and the geographical connotation of the study area. Further research will enlarge the data collection to a wider number of coastal communities and integrate results with qualitative analysis...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the project is to restore some of the ancient inland waterways in the Danube River Basin and Adriatic River Basin to help implement a sustainable <b>boat</b> <b>tourism</b> in order to connect societies in borderlands, improve their socio-economic future and consequently help improve water management and {{the environment of the}} river basins, reduce cross border water pollution, promote natural heritage and support local organic farming. The project takes into consideration the needs of the incoming tourist, that will come to these areas for boat adventures and fulfil expectations of local communities in borderlands, and the low water table and the ecological perspective, which call for the use of smaller boats with basic facilities. The final outcome of the project will be a spatial plan proposal for local and/or national authorities in study areas...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{database}} driven approach for managing and visualizing 3 D urban city models and related multimedia content. Such a 3 D database is a core component of a 3 D Cadastre system (Coors 2002 a). In the TellMaris project (IST 2000 - 28249, www. tellmaris. com), we will {{make use of the}} 3 D database to generate 3 D maps. The objective of TellMaris is the development of a generic 3 D-map interface to tourist information on mobile computers. The interface provides a new concept for creating value added information services on mobile computers for the European citizens related to geographical information. The interface is in the project used for accessing tourist information relevant for <b>boat</b> <b>tourism</b> in the Baltic Sea and Aegean Sea area in the Mediterranean.

40|$|For highly social {{animals such as}} {{bottlenose}} dolphins, survival likely {{depends on}} the strength and stability of social bonds. Previous research demonstrated the impact of boat-based tourism and provisioning on Shark Bay dolphin behavior and ranging, but no studies have examined how social bonds and structure are affected. Using 2068 hours of focal follow data, we constructed ego networks for 31 adult female bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. aduncus) in the impacted area over 4 consecutive time periods (pre-tour vessels [T 0], 1 tour vessel [T 1 & T 4], 2 tour vessels [T 3]) spanning 23 years. Results indicate that with increasing tour boat activity, the ego network size tended to decrease (LMM, t=- 1. 784, p= 0. 079), while bond strength and network density increased (strength: t= 2. 296, p= 0. 025; density: t= 2. 459, p= 0. 017). Seven of {{the subjects in the}} study visit a beach daily to be fed fish by tourists (managed by the Department of Environment and Conservation). With increasing <b>boat</b> <b>tourism,</b> these provisioned dolphins increased their homophily with each other (t= 5. 481, p< 0. 001), suggesting greater segregation from the remaining population. Comparison networks were constructed using survey data (1500 sightings) for the highly trafficked “impact” area and an adjacent sparsely trafficked “control” area over each of the four time periods. We compared metrics between 75 adult females in each area and under each impact level. Lower values for eigenvector centrality were obtained (permutation-based ANOVA, p= 0. 008) with increasing exposure to tour vessels in the highly trafficked area. We further explored changes in network structure over time by comparing the expected variation in community structure to the actual variation using cluster results from a dynamic community detection algorithm. These results demonstrate that even low levels of tour vessel activity can {{have a significant effect on}} social network structure for bottlenose dolphins, especially for already at-risk individuals such as provisioned animals...|$|E
40|$|Kosterhavet National Park, {{a marine}} {{protected}} area on the Swedish west coast, is a popular destination for tourists and attracts over half a million visitors annually. Many of the tourists arrive by boat, and the natural harbours are frequently visited. Boat presence may affect bottom substrates through anchoring, and pollution could also occur {{in the form of}} leaching antifouling paints, fuel residue (PAHs) and litter. This thesis set out to investigate if there are any lingering impacts resulting from <b>boat</b> <b>tourism</b> in Kosterhavet and suggests management efforts in those cases there are. Through studies using a video sledge, data from two consecutive years revealed visible anchor traces on soft un-vegetated bottoms, and number of traces were also linked to number of bottom anchoring boats. Furthermore, it was found that visitors engage in bottom anchoring at locations where sensitive habitats like eelgrass and oyster beds are located, which may result in harm to both habitat types. Sediment samples taken in both natural harbours and small marinas unexpectedly showed presence of long since banned antifouling products like TBT, but also more recently prohibited biocides like irgarol and diuron. This suggests that they are still in use. Moreover, water samples from the area show that the currently used antifouling compound copper, is likely to exceed threshold values set by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SwAM) during peak boat season. Concentrations of PAHs were found to be below threshold values for water, but they are also known to have low water solubility {{and are more likely to}} be bound to particles. From the video data, occurrence of seafloor litter was also obtained and data on beach litter from reference sites on the Swedish west coast was downloaded from the OSPAR beach litter database. Seafloor litter, in contradiction to beach litter, was at a much higher degree found to have an origin related to recreational activities. This suggest that beach litter stem from other activities in the park, or are brought to the area by currents. A threat analysis based on the leisure boat related threats; anchoring, antifouling, PAHs and litter were performed. The threats were analysed with respect to their potential impact on three soft bottom values; eelgrass, oysters and blue mussels. The sum of these threats showed that eelgrass was highly impacted by anchoring, but oysters were more severely affected when all threats were considered. This type of threat analysis can be of great value to park managers, as they need to make prioritizations regarding how to use their often limited resources. Based on these finding, it is, among others, suggested that bottom anchoring should not be allowed at locations where eelgrass and oyster beds occur, and that bottom friendly mooring solutions should be made available to avoid negative impact on these habitats. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} {{increase of}} <b>boat</b> <b>tourism</b> {{and the consequent}} development of marina activities {{gives rise to a}} series of problems related to safeguarding the natural environment. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} appropriate monitoring of port facilities and water quality, as well as the development of new technologies dealing with yachting activities, suitable to minimizing their impact on biological communities. The peculiar ecological characteristics of marinas for their mono-functionality allow the accurate assessment of the different effects of specific contaminants on marine organisms. In fact, marinas constitute a valuable observation point from which pollution can be assessed on the basis of the responses of natural populations and communities, and make easier the control of the various pollutants, such as waste fuels, sewage discharges from craft and municipal waters and release of biocide from antifouling coatings. In particular, these paints are one of the main causes of concern and require careful assessment, in order to avoid deleterious effects on the natural environment. Biocide-based antifouling paints are a significant localized source of trace elements (in particular copper and zinc) and organic biocide in the water. In industrial ports the effects of antifouling paints on the biological component can be hardly distinguished from other sources of biocides, such as those generated by industrial activities, commercial shipping and agriculture. Therefore, taking advantage of marinas’ peculiarities in order to assess the effects of the different antifouling paints on marine organisms is an intriguing task. The need to use antifouling coatings is due to the occurrence of fouling organisms, such as algae, barnacles, and tube worms, which recruit and grow on any submerged surface, greatly increasing drag and reducing speed and fuel economy of boats. In the last decades, many biocides, such as tributyltin (TBT) copper- and zinc-based compounds, were introduced in order to restrict the recruitment and growth of fouling organisms on ship and boat hulls. TBT has been referred to as perhaps the most effective antifouling biocide. Nevertheless, due to its negative effects on non-target organisms, it was banned from 2001 onwards, according to the decisions taken by the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Antifouling Systems on Ships, adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Subsequently, the removal of over-coating of TBT antifouling paints became mandatory from 2008 (IMO, 2001). However, due to the high level of effectiveness of TBT paints, the risk of illegal use is present, even though it should be of minor concern in marinas with respect to commercial and industrial ports. Copper in the form of cuprous oxide continues to be a mainstay antifouling biocide but not necessarily the most effective. It remains the most commonly used biocide in antifouling paints for recreational vessels. Schiff et al. (2004) demonstrated that these paints, which may have 20 – 76 % of copper content (such as cuprous oxide), leach approximately 4. 0 g per cm 2 per day or roughly 25 g per month for a typical 9 m power boat. This is a non-negligible quantity that can heavily affect biological communities. Recent studies dealing with the chemical monitoring of sediments showed the occurrence of high concentrations of dissolved copper. Species react to this chemical on the basis of their degree of adaptability giving rise to populations capable to live in waters with high concentration of cupric ions, by modulating the responses of detoxification systems at transcriptional and translational levels. The knowledge of these mechanisms and the structure of port biological communities can be of considerable aid in assessing the degree of pollution and its consequences on the environmental quality of adjacent areas. The biological response occurs at different levels of biological organisation, from cellular to community level. Molecular techniques may offer a powerful approach to assess contaminant-induced changes in the genetic architecture of populations and species. Direct surveys of genetic adaptation can be very effective in the assessment the deleterious population-level effects of contaminant exposure, even though often they are difficult to accomplish with most field-exposed organisms. There is the need, therefore, to identify suitable target organisms for this kind of analysis. Other analyses include the response to contaminant exposure at cellular and individual (biomarker) or community levels. The array of these analyses may offer an effective toolbox to assess marinas’ sustainability and monitor the effects of their impact on biological communities. On the basis of this knowledge, in recent years, attention was paid to new non-toxic antifouling systems in order to find replacement solutions overcoming the biocide-based technology. New technologies based on substances that make the surface smoother have been developed in order to obtain a low degree of bioadhesion. Non-stick, fouling-release coatings are an attempt to prevent the adhesion of fouling organisms by providing a low-friction, ultra-smooth surface, on which organisms have great difficulties in settling (Yebra et al., 2004). Many studies carried out to elucidate the properties that a coating should possess to counteract adhesion, pointed out that these properties are mainly possessed by two families of materials: fluoropolymers and silicones (Brady and Singer, 2000). Fluoropolymers form non-porous, very low surface-free energy surfaces with good non-stick characteristics (Brady and Singer, 2000). Silicones, which are applied in thick (6 mm) layers, markedly improved the non-stick efficiency of fluoropolymers. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) -based fouling-release coatings are the most widely used today due to their low surface energy, low microroughness, high elastic modulus and low glass transition temperature (Yebra et al., 2004). These surfaces present “moving targets” to the functional groups of marine adhesives, due to their conformationally mobile surfaces (Brady and Singer, 2000). The mechanical locking of biological glues is minimised and slippage and fouling-release are enhanced. Polysiloxanes substituted by fluorine can be considered attractive candidates for surfaces with low bioadhesion. In the Mediterranean many marinas are located in proximity to aquaculture plants or even included within the borders of marine reserves. The simultaneous presence of activities with contrasting effects on natural environment needs monitoring in order to minimize the impacts and to plan appropriate prevention measures. On the other hand, recreational harbouring assumes great importance in the context of the functionality of multiuse marine protected areas; hence, marinas should be favoured for both tourism and scientific control, taking all possible care, in order to minimise their impact on the natural environment. Therefore, the research on non-toxic antifouling coatings should be stimulated, implemented and refined. These new technologies may provide a valuable contribution to a sustainable coexistence of productive activities and nature conservation...|$|E

50|$|The final episode {{focuses on}} the {{environmental}} problems facing the South Pacific. Climate change threatens many islands, because they are low-lying and could be engulfed by rising seas. On Tuvalu, seawater bubbles up through the ground at high tides, making evacuation a realistic possibility. Oceans absorb half of all atmospheric CO2, but this turns them acidic, preventing sea creatures from building calciferous shells. The most immediate threat is overfishing. Reef damage by <b>boats</b> and <b>tourism</b> affects fish populations, but coral gardeners in Fiji have a solution. They harvest and grow corals artificially, then transplant them back to damaged reefs. Different fishing methods are compared, from sustainable pole and line fishing practised by Solomon Islanders to long-line fishing, which has endangered albatross populations across the region. Commercial fishing vessels lay huge purse seine nets, large enough to catch 150 tonnes at a time. Cameras follow the action inside the net as a haul of yellowfin and skipjack tuna are brought to the surface. Greenpeace's flagship Esperanza patrols the high seas, unprotected pockets of ocean where fishing is unregulated. Less than 1% of the Pacific is protected, and yet up to 90% of its large predatory fish may have been lost already. A Fijian community reef is proof that protection could yet work. Tourism benefits from divers prepared to pay for close encounters with bull and tiger sharks, and fishermen benefit from increased stocks. An international conservation effort also helped save humpback whales, as numbers have recovered since the whaling ban.|$|R

In accordance with the informations of the General Immigration Coordination (Coordenação Geral de Imigração) of the Ministry of Labour and Employment (Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego), the foreign investment, together with work authorizations granted to foreigners and as individual investors has been increasing in the country. Between 2008 and 2009, the highest amounts of investments, in Brazil, were reserved to the states of Sao Paulo, Bahia, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte and Rio de Janeiro, and proceeded from Italy, Spain, Portugal, USA and China. With regard to the profile of immigrants, the requests of work visa were mainly granted, between 2005 the 2009, for the state of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, for occupations in <b>tourism</b> <b>boats</b> and work on board or foreign platform, respectively.

Those who arrive in the state of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro normally are natural from the USA, United Kingdom and Philippines, while in northeastern states the provenance belongs to Italians, Portuguese and Spaniards, with higher education...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} performance of cultural heritage by female dancers on tour boats in Goa, India, at the Goa <b>Boat</b> Center (GBC). <b>Tourism</b> is the most rapidly growing industry in the former Portuguese enclave of Goa, which continues to attract {{an increasing number of}} visitors each year and has recently witnessed an influx of migrants, many of whom end up working in the tourism sector. Although the tourism industry has not yet fully capitalized on cultural tourism, government-affiliated institutions such as the GBC have begun to strategically market Goan traditions as heritage. These efforts have resulted in struggles over both the significance of Goan culture and the status of female performers in this regard. This dissertation reveals how tourism in Goa thus functions as a site for the reconfiguration of narratives on Goa, female sexuality, and womanhood more generally, both on an individual and an institutional level. ​While public discourse in India tends to depict the nation and its people as traditional, Goa is typically presented as a state characterized by a “modern” cultural openness and moral looseness, qualities that are attributed to the long-lasting Portuguese colonial influence (1510 - 1961). Using discourse analysis, I trace how these ideas are given new currency in popular media such as tourism advertisements and Bollywood films, which I argue help to portray travel to Goa as a rite of passage allowing young domestic tourists to explore their modern selfhood. I also show how these media, which I consider as travel narratives, have helped to engender the idea that women in Goa are sexually promiscuous, an image that strongly contrasts with the notion of female respectability central to Indian traditional modernity. This impression greatly impacts how the female tour boat dancers are perceived by visitors from elsewhere in India and by Goan society. The morally ambiguous status of the tour boat dancers is {{compounded by the fact that}} in India, lower-caste female performers have tended to be associated with prostitution. ​While the state-supported tourism industry strongly relies on the image of Goa as a pleasure periphery, the Goan government has also felt compelled to appease citizens who disapprove of this image, for example by imposing restrictions on nightlife, especially amidst an increase in sexual violence. Through ethnography, I examine how the GBC negotiates narratives on Goa and domestic tourists’ expectations in its staging of Goan culture. I argue that the GBC performances aim to strike a careful balance by presenting Goan culture as rooted in a morally guided past, while at the same time reinforcing the image of Goa as a party destination. Finally, I analyze the ways in which the female tour boat dancers navigate this complex web of meaning, as they rely on the traditional nature and heritage status of the GBC shows to emphasize their respectability as performers. I show how the GBC performances and dance clubs the women attend in their free time provide a liminal space in which they can participate in an embodied modernity. This way, I argue, the women use dance to explore gendered subjectivities that challenge patriarchal codes of womanhood...|$|R
