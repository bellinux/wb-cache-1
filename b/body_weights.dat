5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower <b>body</b> <b>weights,</b> combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|<b>Body</b> <b>weight</b> {{stability}} may imply active regulation {{towards a}} certain physiological condition, a <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> setpoint. This interpretation is ill {{at odds with}} the world-wide increase in overweight and obesity. Until now, a <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> setpoint has remained elusive and the setpoint theory did not provide practical clues for <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> reduction interventions. For this an alternative theoretical model is necessary, which is available as the settling point model.

40|$|Introduction: Objectives: The {{prevalence}} of obesity is highest in older persons and a correct self-perception of <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> status is necessary for optimal weight control. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine self-perception of, and satisfaction with, <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> status, and to compare current versus ideal body image in a large, nationally representative sample of older people. Furthermore, determinants of misperception were explored. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), conducted in a population-based sample in the Netherlands. Participants: 1295 men and women aged 60 – 96 years. Measurements: <b>Body</b> <b>weight</b> status was assessed using measured weight and height. Self-perceived <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> status, satisfaction with <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> and current and ideal body image were also assessed. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association of age, educational level and objectively measured BMI with underestimation of <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> status. Results: The {{prevalence of}} obesity was 19. 9 % in men and 29. 3 % in women. The agreement between objective and self-perceived <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> status was low (Kappa 99 % of obese participants desired to be thinner (ideal body image < current image).
