The Tanami bioregion is made up primarily of sandplains vegetated with <b>bootlace</b> oak (Hakea lorea), desert bloodwoods (Corymbia species), acacias and grevilleas, together with spinifex grasslands. The Sturt Plateau bioregion also includes spinifex grasslands, but with a canopy of bloodwood trees.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the answers}} on the show have been disputed and shown to be incorrect. For example, in Series A, the show claimed that the longest animal {{in the world was}} the lion's mane jellyfish, but this was later {{corrected}} in Series C, saying that the longest animal in the world is the <b>bootlace</b> worm.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} {{prosecution}} witnesses to testify was the bus conductor, Charles Reville, who testified {{that a young}} girl matching Mona's description had boarded his bus {{in the company of}} a man whom he positively identified as Frederick Nodder, and that Nodder had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl. Also to testify at this second trial was Sir Bernard Spilsbury, who testified that Mona had been strangled from behind with a <b>bootlace</b> or a cord of similar diameter.|$|E

500|$|Clarke was inventive {{as well as}} frugal. While at flight {{school in}} Reading, and without any money to fund his recreation, he built [...] "an {{apparatus}} composed of a <b>bootlace,</b> a lanyard and some straps off my valise, by which I am enabled to turn out the light without getting out of bed".|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{made his}} debut {{with the band}} on Friday, 18 October 1957 at a Conservative Club social held at the New Clubmoor Hall in the Norris Green section of Liverpool. Lennon and McCartney wore cream-coloured sports jackets, which were {{paid for by the}} whole group—Walley {{collected}} half a crown per week from each member until they were paid for—and the others wore white shirts with tassels and black <b>bootlace</b> ties. To the irritation of the other group members, McCartney endlessly practised the lead guitar intro to [...] "Raunchy" [...] (by saxophonist Bill Justis) and a solo from [...] "Guitar Boogie Shuffle", for days before the engagement, but on the night (after being specially introduced by Lennon as a new member of the group) he missed his cue on [...] "Raunchy", played all the wrong notes, and stepped back in embarrassment between Hanton and Garry. Everyone expected Lennon to say something sarcastic, but the sight of the always overconfident McCartney looking so crestfallen made Lennon laugh out loud so much that he [...] "almost pissed himself".|$|E
2500|$|In {{an episode}} of the {{television}} program Seinfeld called [...] "The Understudy," [...] when Seinfeld's date, a performer, takes the stage, she {{has a problem with}} the laces on her boot and, in an act reminiscent of Harding's <b>bootlace</b> incident, tearfully asks that she be allowed to start over.|$|E

[...] "Nothing has more individuality, save perhaps watches and <b>bootlaces.</b> The indications here, however, are neither very marked nor very important.

2500|$|Worms [...] {{are many}} {{different}} distantly related animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube-like body and no limbs. Worms vary in size from microscopic to over [...] in length for marine polychaete worms (bristle worms), [...] for the African giant earthworm, Microchaetus, and [...] for the marine nemertean worm (<b>bootlace</b> worm), Lineus longissimus. [...] Various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches, living inside the bodies of other animals. Free-living worm species do not live on land, but instead live in marine or freshwater environments, or underground by burrowing.|$|E
2500|$|This Test {{marked the}} first time Campese would oppose All Black winger Jonah Lomu. Former Australian fullback Matthew Burke recalls in Matthew Burke: A Football Life that: [...] "Jonah was just devastating, the real killer among the game's ball-runners at the time. The only chance of {{stopping}} a man of his power is to take him low – and it was in that Test that David Campese... chopped Lomu down with a <b>bootlace</b> tackle. It was a dead-set one in a million event. Other times, Lomu ran around or over his rival winger. But on this occasion Campo felled him first time, later making the point coolly that it wasn't so difficult to stop the big fella." ...|$|E

50|$|One of the committee's first {{activities}} was {{to appeal}} for public donations of various items {{that could be}} dispatched to soldiers overseas in time for Christmas.

Some illustrations shows that she frequently fails to tie her <b>bootlaces</b> and the colour ones that her uniform sash is red.

She remembers: [...] "Mildred is based on myself when I had plaits so long that I could sit on them!" ...|$|R
50|$|Sheffield United {{opened the}} scoring {{early in the}} second half with a goal from Alf Common. United {{appeared}} to be on the way to victory when, with two minutes to play, Saints' captain Harry Wood equalised. Wood was in an offside position tying up his <b>bootlaces</b> when the ball reached him. After consultation between the referee and his linesman, the officials decided that the ball had struck a United defender thus playing Wood onside.|$|R

60|$|To {{the eyes}} of Mr. Chalk and his wife Biddlecombe {{appeared}} to have put on holiday attire for the occasion. With smiling satisfaction they {{led the way to}} the ferry, Mrs. Chalk’s costume exciting so much attention that the remainder of the party hung behind to watch Edward Tredgold fasten his <b>bootlace.</b> It took two boats to convey the luggage to the schooner, and the cargo of the smaller craft shifting in mid-stream, the boatman pulled the remainder of the way with a large portion of it in his lap. Unfortunately, his mouth was free.|$|E

60|$|It was one {{of those}} queer little shops so {{constantly}} seen in the side streets of London, which must be called toy-shops only because toys upon the whole predominate; for the remainder of goods seem to consist of almost everything else in the world--tobacco, exercise-books, sweet-stuff, novelettes, halfpenny paper clips, halfpenny pencil sharpeners, <b>bootlaces,</b> and cheap fireworks. It also sold newspapers, and a row of dirty-looking posters hung along the front of it.|$|R
60|$|The search at Bymouth {{obtained}} {{no further}} assistance from Sam. For the remainder of their stay there he hardly moved from the ship, preferring to smoke his pipe in peace on board to meeting certain jocular spirits ashore who wanted to buy <b>bootlaces.</b> Conversation with Dick and the boy he declined altogether, {{and it was not}} until they had reached Cocklemouth that he deigned to accept a pipe of tobacco from the cook’s box.|$|R

60|$|But {{they should}} not have talked so loudly, for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been {{gathering}} skeleton leaves, from which the little people weave their summer curtains, and after that Tony was a marked boy. They loosened the rails before he sat on them, so that down he came {{on the back of his}} head; they tripped him up by catching his <b>bootlace</b> and bribed the ducks to sink his boat. Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you, and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them.|$|E
60|$|For a {{whole week}} the brain {{concealed}} in Mr. Grummit's bullet-shaped head worked in vain, and his temper got correspondingly bad. The day after the Evans' arrival he had found his yard littered with tins which he recognized as old acquaintances, and since that time they had travelled backwards and forwards with monotonous regularity. They sometimes made {{as many as three}} journeys a day, and on one occasion the heavens opened to drop a battered tin bucket on the back of Mr. Grummit as he was tying his <b>bootlace.</b> Five minutes later he spoke of the outrage to Mr. Evans, who had come out to admire the sunset.|$|E

50|$|Wellesley {{sent out}} The Bug to race {{five times in}} Ireland in 1945. He was unplaced {{in his first two}} starts and was {{strongly}} supported in the betting when finishing second in his next race. Late in the season he won two minor races. The Bug was never an easy horse to manage: on one occasion he escaped from the stables and ran loose around the local countryside until he was led home by a police officer who used his <b>bootlaces</b> to fashion a makeshift head collar.|$|R
60|$|Nor {{was this}} all that Peter did to pin the {{powerful}} old fellow's good will. You {{must know that}} Solomon {{had no intention of}} remaining in office all his life. He looked forward to retiring by-and-by, and devoting his green old age to a life of pleasure on a certain yew-stump in the Figs which had taken his fancy, and for years he had been quietly filling his stocking. It was a stocking belonging to some bathing person which had been cast upon the island, and at the time I speak of it contained a hundred and eighty crumbs, thirty-four nuts, sixteen crusts, a pen-wiper and a <b>bootlace.</b> When his stocking was full, Solomon calculated that {{he would be able to}} retire on a competency. Peter now gave him a pound. He cut it off his bank-note with a sharp stick.|$|E
6000|$|Then did Elspeth {{see what}} a wicked girl she had been, and when next the two were {{observed}} by the curious (it was on the cemetery road), they were once more looking cheerful. At the smallest provocation they exchanged notes of admiration, such as, [...] "Oh, Tommy, what a bonny barrel!" [...] or [...] "Oh, Elspeth, I tell yer that's a dyke, and there's just walls in London," [...] but sometimes Elspeth would stoop hastily, pretending {{that she wanted to}} tie her <b>bootlace,</b> but really to brush away a tear, and there were moments when Tommy hung very limp. Each was trying to deceive the other for the other's sake, {{and one of them was}} never good at deception. They saw through each other, yet kept up the chilly game, because they could think of nothing better, and perhaps the game was worth playing, for love invented it.|$|E
6000|$|BLOOM: (Bloom trickleaps to the {{curbstone}} and halts again. He brushes a mudflake {{from his}} cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in track or <b>bootlace</b> in a cog. Day {{the wheel of}} the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow! ...|$|E
50|$|Toxicocalamus is a genus {{of snakes}} {{in the family}} Elapidae. Most species are {{relatively}} small, the largest specimen known being the holotype of the recently described Toxicocalamus ernstmayri, which measures 1.1 m snout to vent (SVL) and 1.2 m in total length (TTL), with the second longest the holotype of T. grandis (880 mm SVL, 980 mm TTL). Most species are under 800 mm in length and several are the thickness of <b>bootlaces.</b> In general females have longer bodies than males, but much shorter tails.|$|R
5000|$|In {{interviews}} with journalists, Manning would {{remind them of}} his appearance with Dean Martin in Las Vegas and meeting the Queen. He {{claimed to be a}} great believer in family values who never swore in front of his mother, stating: [...] "I dragged myself up by my <b>bootlaces.</b> I don't drink or smoke, I don't take drugs. I have never been a womaniser. I was brought up right with good parents and I have never been in trouble or harmed no-one. And I love my family." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sykes {{graduated}} from Cambridge University in 1847 with a Bachelor of Arts degree; this was automatically {{converted to a}} Master of Arts in 1850. His subsequent career is in parts unclear. He was vicar of Dorrington, Lincolnshire from 1862 to 1886, but the directory of Cambridge University alumni states that he then [...] "fell upon evil times, being employed selling <b>bootlaces</b> in London streets c 1902". He died {{at one of the}} Rowton Houses for destitute people at Vauxhall in London in 1915, aged 91.|$|R
