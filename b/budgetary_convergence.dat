5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} to adopt the euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and <b>budgetary</b> <b>convergence</b> criteria, although not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to observe the {{different}} bearings of the European Union contributions to the economic regional integration in subsaharan Africa. As the European Union is itself a regional integration, it can be of some help in a debate dominated by the World Bank. The European Union gives more importance to the financement of projects with regional charachteristic than any others partners and doing so gives a full dimension to the support of the European developpement for regional inegration. The support perspectives to regional inegration seem to go towards an important commitment for regional programs, such as the project of <b>budgetary</b> <b>convergence</b> in West Africa...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the economic implications of fiscal policy coordination in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) {{in the light}} of the January 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc. Diverging tax, tariff, and budgetary politics are identified and it is argued that the resulting fiscal externalities have prevented the zone from reaping the full benefits of a monetary union. The paper shows that the devaluation makes it more desirable than ever to have a closer policy coordination to prevent such detrimental fiscal externalities. Recent efforts in this field are reviewed and evaluated. Finally, the paper offers some recommendations with respect to the optimal design of tax and tariff rate structures, and the choice of <b>budgetary</b> <b>convergence</b> criteria. ...|$|E
40|$|The 27 {{member of}} the European Union benefit from the {{possibility}} to chose their own fiscal policy therefore there are 27 different fiscal systems in the European Union. The harmonization of the fiscal policies is a desideratum especially for the companies that activate in many states, considering that the harmonized fiscal systems {{will lead to a}} growth of the economic convergence and the erasing of discrepancies at continental level. On the other hand, the right fiscal policies can contribute to the encouragement of direct foreign investments, an increased competitiveness and a better allocation of resources. The paper’s purpose is an analysis of the fiscal policies having for starting point the progresses made in regard to the harmonization of the Europe fiscal systems and the impact the extreme differences of taxation have on the different types of taxes between the member states. fiscal policy, <b>Budgetary</b> deficit, <b>convergence,</b> fiscal competition, fiscal harmonization. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{moment of}} EU {{extension}} {{to the east}} at the 1 st of January 2007 is extremely important in the recent Romanian history. A feeling of self satisfaction has unfortunately come upon Romania like the one specific for a person who can rest in peace until the destination after hardly catching an important train. For Romania, a country behind the present times, the only chance is a long term economic growth, approached in an European context, by focusing the economic, monetary, currency and fiscal policies towards the achievement of a lasting economic growth. The Union works for the durable development of Europe, based on a balanced economic growth and prices' stability, on a highly competitive market economy, which targets the employment of the entire workforce and the social progress, {{as well as for}} a high level of environment protection and quality improvement[ [...] ]. This promotes the economic, social and territorial cohesion but also the solidarity between the member states as the article n. 2 of the Treaty concerning the creation of the European Community stipulates.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{the design of the}} surveillance, and, in particular, the fiscal criteria in the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) with the view to ensuring they are consistent with internal and external sustainability. This consistency is important within a monetary union because fiscal policy is the primary instrument through which national governments can influence macroeconomic performance. We comment on how surveillance might be improved by broadening the region''s current criteria through alternative fiscal indicators, some focus on the scope and nature of external shocks, and attention to the consistency of policies in assuring the viability of the union and its fixed exchange rate regime.

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{literature}} on monetary integration to discover the economic rationale of the Maastricht convergence requirements. The traditional theory of optimum currency areas is silent {{on the need to}} have Maastricht-type convergence requirements. The new view of monetary integration based on models incorporating credibility concepts can be used to justify the <b>budgetary</b> <b>convergence</b> requirements. It cannot easily be used to justify the nominal convergence requirements. The paper argues that the dynamics of the convergence requirements will almost certainly lead to a `Great Divide' of the European Union which endangers the level of integration achieved today. We therefore conclude that less emphasis should be put on prior convergence conditions and more on strengthening the functioning of the future monetary institutions of the Union. Monetary Integration...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Belgium is on {{the cusp}} of its next defence reform. While the {{security}} landscape throughout Europe’s neighbourhood and beyond deteriorates, the armed forces face numerous challenges. Most importantly, the next defence plan needs to recalibrate the force structure in function of political ambitions and budgetary realities. This Policy Brief argues that Belgium must embrace a nimble but broad-spectrum force. Any future structure must encompass agile land forces as well as a modern combat air force, without neglecting the need to safeguard a sizeable navy and invest in cyber capabilities. European cooperation should be pursued wherever possible while recognising that this necessitates <b>budgetary</b> <b>convergence.</b> For Belgium this means the investment budget needs to grow significantly in order to acquire interoperable but self-owned assets. Such a choice can be justified on the recognition that defence is not just about expeditionary operations, but also economic stimulus, intergenerational solidarity and strategic insurance: maintaining the ability to respond to whatever the future may bring...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{tries to}} {{understand}} the phenomenon of Entrapment, which is an outcome of (a) security discourses that prioritize pre-emptive community strategies; (b) the ongoing military initiative of the Global War of Terror (GWOT); and (c) and the increased <b>budgetary</b> <b>convergence</b> of state agencies of the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the military, impacting the legal and court processes that indict “homegrown” terrorists. We offer a critical discourse analysis {{of the events that}} led to the arrest and trial of Mohamed Osman Mohamud, covered in local newspapers The Oregonian and The Willamette Week, after he was held for the intent to use {{a weapon of mass destruction}} during a customary Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in downtown Portland, Oregon on November 26, 2010. The press and defense lawyers call this a case of FBI entrapment. Entrapments pose a serious threat to community peace and to contemporary understandings of multiculturalism. The coverage of Mohamud’s story does not create a critical shift in the tenor of public debate, which harshly judges any event that has overtones of an act of terror. Our high alert status regarding domestic terrorism, post 9 / 11, does not allow us, as the consumers of media, to act as a fair and compassionate jury, nor does it instill within us the alarm that might otherwise surround a judicial system that sentences race-d youth of little means to maximum life imprisonment...|$|E
