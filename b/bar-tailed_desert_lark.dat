5000|$|The bar-tailed lark, or <b>bar-tailed</b> <b>desert</b> <b>lark,</b> (Ammomanes cinctura) is {{a species}} of lark in the family Alaudidae. Two other species, the rufous-tailed lark and the Cape clapper lark are both also {{sometimes}} referred to using the name bar-tailed lark. It is found from Morocco to Pakistan. Its natural habitat is hot deserts. This is in many places a common species, but elsewhere rather less common. It has a very wide distribution and faces no obvious threats, but surveys have shown that it is slowly decreasing in numbers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E

A <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Desert</b> <b>Lark</b> {{was found}} in the {{lighthouse}} garden at Cap Salines, Mallorca on 24 th March 1994 and was seen there until 26 th March 1994. The bird was photographed and this note details the description and identification features separating this species from Desert Lark. This, if accepted by Comité Ibérico de Rarezas, SEO,would be the first record for the Balearic Islands, the second for Spain and the eleventh for Europe...|$|E

40|$|A common {{perception}} is that desert birds experience greater extremes of heat and aridity than their mammalian counterparts, in part, because birds do not use burrows as a refuge from the desert environment. We report observations of Dunn's <b>Larks</b> (Eremalauda dunni), <b>Bar-tailed</b> <b>Desert</b> <b>Larks</b> (Ammomanes cincturus), Black-crowned Finch Larks (Eremoprerix nigriceps), and Hoopoe Larks (Alaemon alaudipes) using burrows of the large herbivorous lizard Uromastyx aegypticus as thermal refugia during hot summer days in the Arabian Desert. Continuous recordings of shade air temperature (T-a), soil surface temperature (T-surface), burrow air temperature (Ta-burrow), and burrow substrate temperature (T-substrate) showed that T-surface exceeded 60 degrees C on most days. T-a typically exceeded 45 degrees C, whereas Ta-burrow was around 41 degrees C during midday. Calculations of total evaporative water loss at different temperatures indicated that Hoopoe Larks can potentially reduce their water loss {{by as much as}} 81 % by sheltering in Uromastyx burrows during the hottest periods of the summer day...|$|R

50|$|The bar-tailed lark {{has a large}} {{distribution}} across North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East {{and western}} Asia. Its range includes Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Cape Verde, Chad, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Western Sahara and Yemen. Its typical habitat is sandy or stony desert or semi desert, with low scrubby vegetation. It is generally shier than the <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> and has a preference for level ground whereas the <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> tends to frequent rocky slopes and hillsides.|$|R

50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> is {{not very}} sociable and does not form large flocks, being mainly {{encountered}} in small groups or as single birds. They are territorial when breeding, nesting on the ground under the shelter of a tussock or stone in a shallow scrape lined with plant material and having a rim of pebbles, which may surround the nest or be on the more exposed side of the nest. The clutch is 1-5 eggs and these are laid at different times {{in various parts of}} its range, e.g. January-February in the south and March-April in the north. The <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> eats seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.|$|R
50|$|The long-billed pipit's {{flight is}} strong and direct, and it gives a {{characteristic}} chupp call, similar to <b>desert</b> <b>lark.</b> Its song is {{like that of the}} tawny pipit, but slower and more varied, sri...churr...sri...churr…sri..churr. Like its relatives, long-billed pipit eats seeds and insects.|$|R
50|$|The greater hoopoe-lark (Alaemon alaudipes), is a {{passerine}} bird {{which is}} a breeding resident of arid, desert and semi-desert regions from the Cape Verde Islands across much of northern Africa, through the Arabian peninsula, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. It was {{formerly known as the}} bifasciated lark and sometimes as the large <b>desert</b> <b>lark.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gray's lark was {{originally}} {{described as a}} species within the genus Alauda. It was then placed in the sister genus Ammomanes until re-classified in 2009 by the IOC into the monotypic genus Ammomanopsis. Some authorities still consider the species as Ammomanes grayi. Alternately, it has been named Gray's <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> or Gray's sand lark.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> (Ammomanes deserti) breeds in deserts and semi-deserts from Morocco {{to western}} India. It {{has a very}} wide {{distribution}} and faces no obvious threats, and surveys have shown that it is slowly increasing in numbers as it expands its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
50|$|In {{the coastal}} belt, bird species {{recorded}} are American flamingo on the beaches, and also many birds of prey. Migratory birds pass through Libya, and are seen mostly along the coastline. The most notable ones are the flamingo, Kentish plover in the Bengazi Reserve. Houbara bustard and the European white stork {{are reported in}} the Kouf National Park and in the beaches and lagoons. In the oases, <b>desert</b> <b>larks,</b> <b>desert</b> sparrows, and spotted sandgrouse have been reported. Other notable species reported are Aquila chrysaetos, Alectoris barbara, Pterocles spp. and Chlamydotis undulata with herons, ducks, waders, Ciconia nigra, Ciconia ciconia, and Milvus milvus (red kite) from the brackish lagoons.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include red-crested pochards, pygmy cormorants, saker falcons, common coots, common cranes, pale-backed pigeons, pallid scops-owls, Egyptian nightjars, white-winged woodpeckers, brown-necked ravens, great tits, <b>desert</b> <b>larks,</b> streaked scrub-warblers, Sykes's warblers, Asian desert warblers, saxaul sparrows and desert finches.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{passerine}} birds breed in the deserts, salt flats, plains, dunes and mountains. Twelve species of wheatear have been recorded in the country as well as warblers, babblers, rollers, bulbuls, the <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> and many others. The sooty falcon overwinters in Madagascar and breeds in the United Arab Emirates. Other than this, {{there are only a}} small number of raptor species; Bonelli's eagle, barbary falcon, short-toed snake eagle, long-legged buzzard and lappet-faced vulture.|$|R
50|$|The bar-tailed lark {{is similar}} to the <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> in appearance, but at 14 to 15 cm, is {{slightly}} smaller, with a smaller, more domed head, a smaller beak, thinner legs and a shorter tail. The upper parts are sandy-buff washed with grey, while the underparts are whitish with little if any streaking, and the breast and flanks washed with buff. The rufous wings have dark trailing edges and the rufous tail has a terminal black band.|$|R
50|$|A 1150 km2 {{tract of}} land {{encompassing}} the reservoir and its surrounds {{has been identified as}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include mallards, pygmy cormorants, saker falcons, cinereous vultures, great bustards, houbara bustards, common cranes, pale-backed pigeons, pallid scops-owls, Egyptian nightjars, European rollers, white-winged woodpeckers, great tits, <b>desert</b> <b>larks,</b> streaked scrub-warblers, Sykes's warblers, Asian desert warblers, saxaul sparrows and desert finches.|$|R
50|$|The <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> is a medium-sized, big-headed and long-billed lark, {{growing to}} {{a length of}} 16 to 17 cm. The sexes are alike, but there is {{considerable}} geographical variation. It has a rather dull plumage which can vary from quite pale to rather dark. Plumage may vary between subspecies but individuals within populations can be variable too. It is similar in appearance to the bar-tailed lark but is slightly larger, has a less-domed head, a larger broader beak, stouter legs and a longer tail. The upper parts of the many subspecies vary in colour; most are pale greyish brown, but some races are very washed out and others are quite a deep colour. Some have some rufous colour on wings and tail, similar to the bar-tailed lark, but the underparts are a pale pinkish grey and have much more streaking than that species, and the <b>desert</b> <b>lark</b> lacks the clearly defined terminal black band on the tail of that species, although it may have a rather diffuse dark patch. The colour variation seems to mainly match the habitat, so sandy-coloured birds are commoner in sandy areas, greyer birds in rocky areas and the darkest birds in desert dominated by basalt.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Desert</b> horned <b>lark</b> (E. a. leucolaema) - Coues, 1874: Also {{known as}} the pallid horned lark. Found from {{southern}} Alberta (south-western Canada) through north-central and central USA ...|$|R
50|$|Small rodents {{are their}} primary prey, with records from Africa {{including}} spiny mice, jirds, gerbils, jerboas, and young of cape hare. They {{have also been}} observed to hunt small birds like greater hoopoe <b>lark,</b> <b>desert</b> <b>lark,</b> and consume reptiles such as small desert monitors, fringe-toed lizards, sandfish, short-fingered gecko, horned and sand vipers, and insects. They are capable of satisfying their moisture requirements from their prey but drink readily if water is available.They can dig rapidly to extract their prey {{from the ground and}} bury prey remains in the sand for later consumption.|$|R
40|$|Because deserts are {{characterized}} by low food availability, high ambient temperature extremes, and absence of drinking water, one might expect that birds that live in these conditions exhibit a lower basal metabolic rate (BMR), reduced total evaporative water loss (TEWL), and greater {{ability to cope with}} high air temperatures than their mesic counterparts. To minimize confounding effects of phylogeny, we compared the physiological performance of four species of larks at ambient temperatures (T-a's) ranging from 0 degrees to 50 degreesC: hoopoe larks (Alaemon alaudipes) and Dunn's larks (Eremalauda dunni) live in hot and dry deserts, whereas skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and woodlarks (Lullula arborea) occur in temperate mesic areas. Mass-adjusted BMR and TEWL were indistinguishable between hoopoe lark and Dunn's lark and between skylark and woodlark. When grouping the data of the two <b>desert</b> <b>larks</b> in one set and the data of the two mesic <b>larks</b> in another, <b>desert</b> <b>larks</b> are shown to have 43 % lower BMR levels and 27 % lower TEWL values than the mesic species. Their body temperatures (T-b's) were 1. 1 degreesC lower, and the minimal dry heat transfer coefficients (h) were 26 % below values for the mesic larks. When T a exceeded T-b, the h of hoopoe larks and Dunn's larks was high and indistinguishable from h at 40 degreesC, in contrast to the prediction that h should be decreased to minimize heat gain through conductance, convection, or radiation from the environment when T-a exceeds T-b...|$|R
