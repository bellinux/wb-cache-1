40|$|The {{burrowing}} nematode Radopholus similis {{is the most}} damaging <b>banana</b> <b>nematode.</b> To minimize nematicide applications, cropping systems based on fallow, crop rotation, and using clean planting material have been developed in the French West Indies. The survivorship of R. similis in water and soil was evaluated to optimize the collapse of its populations during the intercropping period and {{to better understand the}} risk of dissemination of nematodes by run-off water. In both Andosols and Nitisols, survivorship was significantly higher for males than for females. After 180 days, 21. 7 % of males and 9. 8 % of females were still alive, whereas no juveniles survived after 150 days. Survivorship was much lower in water and soil solution than in soil. The mean half-life of males was 8. 8 days and only 6. 2 days for females, but the difference between sexes was less after 1 month: 8 % of both males and females in the initial population survived after 35 days. These results suggest that resource allocation for males was directed towards reproduction, whereas females expend energy foraging and laying eggs, and are thus disadvantaged in the absence of host plants. The relatively long survivorship of males of R. similis enables them to fecundate females without competing for food after becoming adults. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

In the current study, non-pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum strains originating from banana (Musa spp.) in Kenya (4 MOC 321 and 11 SR 23) and Uganda (V 5 w 2) were evaluated for their efficacy against P. goodeyi in tissue culture-derived plantlets (cv.

Pratylenchus goodeyi densities were 47 - 60 % lower in endophyte-inoculated relative to non-inoculated plants and root necrosis damage was reduced by > 30 %. Endophyte treatment had no effect on plant growth parameters compared with untreated control plants.

Even if {{there have been many}} changes in the management of <b>banana</b> <b>nematodes</b> in large commercial banana plantations, chemical control still remains most often the last resort method to manage the nematodes, although the number of registered products is definitely declining. Therefore, nematode control though genetic improvement is gaining new interest worldwide. In this study, 55 banana accessions mostly diploids from the Musa acuminata genome group (AA) but including some triploid accessions (AAA), some diploids of the Musa balbisiana genome group (BB) and some interspecific hybrids (AAB, AB) were evaluated for resistance to four nematode species R. similis, P. coffeae, Meloidogyne incognita and M. arenaria. These experiments were conducted in a growth chamber under controlled conditions. All banana accessions were susceptible to nematode species, although many different levels of susceptibility were detected. This study confirmed the good resistance status to R. similis of some cultivars from the Pisang jari buaya and Pisang batuau subgroups and the partial resistance of 17 diploid accessions significantly different from the susceptible reference cv. Grande Naine. This study also showed that 12 diploid accessions exhibited a partial resistance to P. coffeae, including some usual or potential genitors belonging to the wild diploids subspecies burmannica (cvs. Long Tavoy 1 and 2) and burmannicoides (cv. Calcutta 4). No source of resistance to Meloidogyne spp. was found.

Here we tested the nematicidal activity of the sisal residue, fresh or fermented, on R. similis in banana plants. We measured immobility and mortality effects by nematode immersion in an aqueous solution of sisal residue for 24 and 48  h. Nematode control was also evaluated in the Grand Naine banana plants under greenhouse conditions using soil amendments of residues. We measured plant growth, pseudostem diameter, the number of leaves, and the dry weight of the aerial parts, corm and roots, as well as factors related to nematode control such as the level of damage, the population of R. similis in roots and soil, and nematode reproduction factors. Our results show that the sisal residue efficiently controlled R. similis in vitro, displaying mortality rates of 99. 2  % for the fresh residue. The damage caused by R. similis on plants was similar for the treatment with the sisal residue at a concentration of 25  % and with the nematicide.

We explored the effects of plant community composition and soil properties on the soil nematode community, with a particular interest in the regulation of <b>banana</b> plant-parasitic <b>nematodes</b> (PPN). We monitored banana phytometers (Cavendish Grande Naine cultivar) in 85 plots distributed along a plant richness gradient. Plant community composition, soil properties, abundance of bacterivorous, fungivorous and proportion of predaceous soil free-living nematodes, and abundance and damage of PPN (Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus coffeae, Helicotylenchus multicinctus, and Meloidogyne spp.) in phytometer roots were measured. We used structural equation modeling to investigate ecological processes leading to PPN regulation. Low-stratum plant species richness, but not high-stratum, was positively related to microbivore nematode abundances, supposedly because it promoted qualitative diversity of organic inputs and micro-climatic effects supporting more soil microorganisms. Musa genotype and low-stratum plant species richness induced associational susceptibility because of differential susceptibility of Musa genotypes to PPN and because of polyphagia of PPN spreading outside the Musa family, respectively. We found no regulation of PPN by predaceous nematodes, probably because food web complexity prevented trophic cascades from propagating. Ultimately, fungivorous nematode abundance was negatively related to PPN abundance, suggesting apparent competition or increased regulation by antagonistic fungi. Our results suggest that, when facing generalist pests, cropped plant communities should be diversified to promote pest regulation but must be carefully assembled to limit pest susceptibility heterogeneity among crop genotypes and to exclude alternative host plant species.

The presence of the burrowing nematode was more consistently found within three families, the Euphorbiaceae, Poaceae and Solanaceae. In some weed species such as Caladium bicolor, Commelina diffusa, Echinochloa colona and Phenax sonneratii, the levels of nematodes recovered were similar to, or greater than the numbers recovered from Musa roots.

The availability and nature of carbon substrates in soil drive the structure, dynamics, and activities of soil food webs and may alter the way they function in the ecosystem. In this study, we assessed the effects on nematode communities of incorporating litter from three cover crops with contrasting biochemical characteristics into soil taken from a banana field. The litter type influenced nematode taxa and functional guilds during the 90 -day assay. The cellulose- and hemicellulose-rich litters of Crotalaria zanzibarica and Paspalum notatum induced similar nematode successions, causing bacterivorous and fungivorous nematode populations to increase early in the study period and promoting a fungal decomposition pathway {{at the end of}} the trial. These two litters were the most effective at decreasing the soil's nematode infective potential with regard to major <b>banana</b> plant-parasitic <b>nematodes,</b> such as Pratylenchus coffeae, Helicotylenchus multicinctus, and Rotylenchulus reniformis. C. zanzibarica showed good potential as a green manure plant, as it increased the soil mineral nitrogen content during the 45 days following incorporation of litter. By contrast, litter from Acacia auriculiformis, which had high lignin content, induced immobilization of soil nitrogen and did not significantly increase microbivorous nematodes before day 45. This treatment failed to reduce the soil's nematode infective potential for H. multicinctus and R. reniformis populations. Our study also showed that the dynamics of nitrogen mineralisation in soil were related to the C:N ratio of litters but not to the decomposition pathway. The biochemical characteristics of litters appear to be critical drivers of nematode ecological successions and decomposition pathways following plant litter amendments to soil taken from a banana field.

This study evaluated the effects on plantain bunch fresh yield of factorial combinations of a simple physical sanitation method, paring, followed by five different treatments (control, ash-coating, hot-water treatment, boiling-water treatment and nematicide application). Paring reduced plantain establishment, had no effect on fresh bunch yields but reduced uprooting and improved root health status. Without previous paring, bunch yields after traditional ash-coating (5. 7 Mg ha- 1) and nematicide application (6. 3 Mg ha- 1) were not different from control (4. 6 Mg ha- 1).

40|$|AbstractMuch of the worlds’ annual harvest loss to {{pests and}} {{diseases}} occurs {{as a consequence}} of crops grown in monocultures, or cultivated varieties with uniform resistance. This uniform resistance is met by the continuing evolution of new races of pests and pathogens that are able to overcome resistance genes introduced by modern breeding, creating the phenomenon of boom and bust cycles. One of the few assets available to small-scale farmers in developing countries to reduce pests and diseases damage is their local crop varietal diversity, together with the knowledge to manage and deploy this diversity appropriately. Local crop varietal diversity of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was measured at the community and household levels within farmers’ fields in four agro-ecological areas of Uganda. Resistance of traditional and modern varieties of P. vulgaris to anthracnose, angular leaf spot, and bean fly and of traditional and modern varieties of Musa spp. to black sigatoka, <b>banana</b> weevils and <b>nematodes</b> was assessed from participatory diagnostics of farmer knowledge and cross-site on-farm and on-station trials. By performing cross-site on-farm experiments, it was possible to identify traditional varieties with higher resistance to pest and diseases when grown outside their home sites. Increased diversity of crop varieties, measured by number of varieties (richness) and their evenness of distribution, corresponded to a decrease in the average damage levels across sites and to a reduction of variance of disease damage. In sites with higher disease incidence, households with higher levels of diversity in their production systems had less damage to their standing crop in the field compared to sites with lower disease incidence. The results support what might be expected of a risk-minimizing strategy for use of diversity to reduce pest and disease damage...|$|R

Cavendish) in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), R. similis, Pratylenchus coffeae and Helicotylenchus multicinctus. Results showed that damages caused by plant-feeding nematodes were lowered {{in the presence of the}} earthworm P. corethrurus; the population of plant-feeding nematodes did not decrease whereas root damage induced by nematodes was significantly reduced (50 % reduction of root necrosis in the presence of earthworms). Moreover, in the presence of P. corethrurus, we observed a change of soil porosity. On the one hand, the burrowing activity of earthworms destroyed most of the initial structural porosity (mesobiotic pores, 3 - 300 mu m) and on the other hand, they increased the volume of the finest structural pores diameter class (microbiotic pores, 0. 3 - 3 mu m). P. corethrurus also stimulated phosphorus mineralization. Soil bioturbation carried out by P. corethrurus could have enhanced the efficiency of microbial community that is involved in phosphorus bioavailability. This observation was corroborated by a higher phosphorus availability in earthworm casts (1386 +/- 38 mg 13 kg(- 1) of dry matter in cast versus 778 +/- 61 mg P kg(- 1) of dry matter in the soil compartment not influenced by earthworm activity), and a better plant phosphorus nutrition in the presence of earthworms. Phosphorus uptake resulted in a better plant nutrition and a better tolerance to plant-feeding nematodes.

Mature banana plantations were subjected to no-till, tillage using a hoe, and tillage using a forked hoe. The latter was to test whether the fork would cause less damage to the root systems than conventional tillage. Immediately after tillage, hand hoe tillage reduced the root biomass by 85 % on average in the top 10 cm compared to no-till plots, with no significant differences between tillage methods. There was no effect of tillage below this depth. Both in terms of length and biomass, roots recovered within 2 to 3 months to levels similar to no-till plots in a radius of 45 cm around the tree. Nematode infection rates were similar across treatments. Pseudo-stem volume of the banana trees did not differ significantly between tilled and no-till plots during the trial period. Hand hoe and fork affected at the same level the banana root system in the top 10 cm. We conclude that tillage strongly, but temporarily, damages the banana root system in the top 10 cm, which represents 24 - 50 % of the total root biomass between 0 and 20 cm depth. The decrease in root length and biomass in the topsoil may have adverse effects on the banana productivity, but longer term monitoring is required to quantify these effects on yield.
