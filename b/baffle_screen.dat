50|$|Intake {{manifold}} vacuum {{is applied to}} the crankcase via the PCV valve, drawing fresh air into the crankcase via the breather. The airflow through the crankcase and engine interior sweeps away combustion byproduct gases, including a large amount of water vapour which includes dissolved chemical combustion byproducts. This mixture of air and crankcase gases then exits, often via another simple <b>baffle,</b> <b>screen,</b> or mesh to exclude oil droplets, through the PCV valve and into the intake manifold. On some PCV systems, this oil baffling takes place in a discrete replaceable part called the 'oil separator'.|$|E
40|$|The nuclear heating of the {{propellant}} {{in all of}} {{the four}} baseline RNS configurations studied was much lower than that of the nuclear flight module configuration with the 5000 -MW NERVA analyzed previously. Although the nuclear heating has been reduced, the effect of nuclear heating on the propellant as well as the effect of nuclear heating on internal structures such as antivortex <b>baffles,</b> <b>screens,</b> and sump components cannot be neglected. In addition, {{it was found that the}} present analytical precedures were not able to predict boundary layer initiation and breakoff points with the accuracy necessary to predict propellant thermodynamic nonequilibrium (stratification) and/or mixing...|$|R

Also during that time, the design continued to evolve, with significant improvements to the mirror support system, stray-light <b>baffles,</b> wind <b>screen,</b> and calibration screen.|$|R
40|$|Sputtering and {{deposition}} {{rates have}} been measured for discharge chamber components of a 30 -cm diameter mercury ion thruster. It was found that sputtering rates of the screen grid and cathode baffle were strongly affected by geometry of the baffle holder. Sputtering rates of the <b>baffle</b> and <b>screen</b> grid were reduced to 80 and 125 A/hr, respectively, by combination of appropriate geometry and materials selections. Sputtering rates such as these are commensurate with thruster lifetimes of 15, 000 hours or more. A semiempirical sputtering model showed good agreement with the measured values...|$|R
40|$|Predictions of a CFD program calculating a fluid-free {{surface shape}} and motion as a {{function}} of imposed acceleration are validated against the drop-tower test data collected to support design and performance assessments of the Saturn S-IVB stage liquid-hydrogen tank. The drop-tower facility, experimental package, and experiment procedures are outlined, and the program is described. It is noted that the validation analysis confirms the program's suitability for predicting low-g fluid slosh behavior, and that a similar analysis could examine the effect of incorporating <b>baffles</b> and <b>screens</b> to impede initiation of any unwanted side loads due to slosh. It is concluded that in actual vehicle applications, the engine thrust tailoff profile should be included in computer simulations if the precise interface versus time definition is needed...|$|R
500|$|The {{ground floor}} houses a 300-seat {{auditorium}} which {{also serves as}} a reading space when not in use for performances. Library CEO Judith Hare stated that the space would complement a recording studio, geared toward young people, planned elsewhere in the library: [...] "people can make their own music... but also they’ll have a place to perform as well." [...] In 2012 the auditorium was named Paul O’Regan Hall following a $1 million donation by the O’Regan family in honour of the late businessman and philanthropist. Government funding only covered the cost of the building, so donations will go toward expanding the book collection and purchasing new computers and special equipment. The hall is fitted with stowable seats, acoustic ceiling <b>baffles,</b> a video <b>screen,</b> and professional sound and lighting installations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Solar shading devices can {{significantly}} reduce cooling loads, improve thermal comfort and reduce potential glare problems in commercial buildings. However, measured data or tools {{to facilitate a}} comparison among various shading devices have previously not been available to designers. The Solar Shading Project at Lund University was initiated in 1997 to increase the knowledge on shading devices. This paper describes results from an extensive measurement program and recent developments of the software tool ParaSol v 2. 0. The total solar energy transmittance (g-value) of various shading devices has been estimated by means of measurements in a real climate using a double hot-box arrangement. Monitored results are shown for external products (awnings, Italian awnings, venetian blinds, horizontal slatted <b>baffle,</b> fabric <b>screens,</b> solar control films), interpane (between panes) and internal products (pleated curtains, roller blinds, venetian blinds, solar control films). The software tool ParaSol has been further developed to include all these types of products. In general, external shading devices are the best in reducing cooling loads, internal products are the worst, while interpane products fall between these two. Further, internal products must have a high reflectance in order to yield a low g-value. The monitored average g-value within each group (g-sunshade) was 0. 3 for external products, 0. 5 for interpane products and 0. 6 for internal products. On average, external products are twice as good a...|$|R

40|$|Asbestos is {{a mineral}} {{belonging}} {{to the group of}} fibrous silicates. Due to its remarkable resistance to high temperatures, its conformation in fibers and its very low cost, it was used until 1991 to produce materials able of withstanding high temperatures. The silicates of asbestos in the solid matrix were widely used in construction, in engineering, in plumbing, in panels and sheets for ceilings, in plaster and as sound-absorbing material. Asbestos was also widely used in the manufacturing of household equipment, such as thermal insulation for high and low temperatures, flame retardant ducts, for the production of appliances with use of high temperatures (stoves, hair dryer, etc.), in the clutches brakes, in the <b>baffle</b> plate display <b>screens</b> in the seals, in the production of clothing protecting from heat (gloves, fireproof suits) and in furnishing resistant to elevated temperatures. The exposure to atmosphere containing asbestos can be the cause of several diseases such as pulmonary asbestosis, mesothelioma and lung cancer. The amphiboles are the most dangerous forms of asbestos, and the crocidolite among these is the one with the most neoplastic potential. However, the diagnosis of asbestos related occupational diseases is neither simple nor automatic, as a number of criteria are to be met, such as the study of immunohistochemical markers, and of biological and environmental monitoring, to assess an effective causal relationship. The knowledge about asbestos-related diseases and the diagnostic criteria have evolved over time, but it is still difficult to examine patients who have experienced clinically disease only in recent times, after 10 - 20 years from the last assumed exposure, due to the latency of the disease, particularly cancer. We present here two case reports of malignant mesothelioma, of assumed asbestos-related occupational origin: their aetiology is debated in the light of literary overview. We analyzed all scientific knowledge about the relationship between human health and exposure to asbestos, since the beginning of its industrial use to the present day. The leading scientific databases (Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, Tripdatabase) were surveyed to reconstruct how and when knowledge on the health hazards of asbestos exposure were published: a total of 13, 551 publications were scrutinized. The key topics surveyed were: "Asbestos and health damage ", "Asbestos and Malignant Mesothelioma". The findings learned through our research were applied to the two cases under examination. We found that diagnosis of the malignant mesothelioma attributed to the two patients is not certain because the diagnostic criteria suggested by international literature have not been strictly applied, both from the clinical point of view and from the histopathological and immuno-chemical level...|$|R
