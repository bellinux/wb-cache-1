In {{the present}} work we report the {{investigation}} of heat exchange processes at stationary boiling regime of magnetic fluid on a horizontal surface under magnetic field H ≤ 4. 2 kA/m.

The mechanism of magnetic field influence on heat exchange intensity in boiling magnetic fluid has been developed and explained.

Whether those be fangs, claws, horns, pincers, tentacles, spikes, magical attacks (like breath weapons), or whatever else. These are surprisingly ineffective, however, as the chaos beast can rarely attack more than twice before changing again, and never has time to coordinate attacks. The main weapon of the chaos beast is its touch which apparently transfers the chaos energy to the victim, turning him/her into an amorphous mass that, if unable to be healed, <b>bubbles,</b> <b>boils,</b> writhes, and shifts. The victim is unable to act coherently, has difficulty hitting a target, and eventually becomes a chaos beast forever.

50|$|A zeotropic mixture, or non-azeotropic mixture, is {{a mixture}} with {{components}} that have different boiling points. For example, nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, and isobutane constitute a zeotropic mixture. Individual substances within the mixture do not evaporate or condense at the same temperature as one substance. In other words, the mixture has a temperature glide, as the phase change occurs in a temperature range of about four to seven degrees Celsius, rather than at a constant temperature. On temperature-composition graphs, this temperature glide {{can be seen as}} the temperature difference between the bubble point and dew point. For zeotropic mixtures, the temperatures on the <b>bubble</b> (<b>boiling)</b> curve are between the individual component's boiling temperatures. When a zeotropic mixture is boiled or condensed, the composition of the liquid and the vapor changes according to the mixtures's temperature-composition diagram.|$|R
40|$|Loss of plasma {{confinement}} causes surface and structural damage to plasma-facing materials (PFMs) and remains {{a major obstacle}} for tokamak reactors. The deposited plasma energy results in surface erosion and structural failure. The surface erosion consists of vaporization, spallation, and liquid splatter of metallic materials, while the structural damage includes large temperature increases in structural materials and at the interfaces between surface coatings and structural members. Comprehensive models (contained in the HEIGHTS computer simulation package) are being used self-consistently to evaluate material damage. Splashing mechanisms occur {{as a result of}} volume <b>bubble</b> <b>boiling</b> and liquid hydrodynamic instabilities and brittle destruction mechanisms of nonmelting materials.

40|$|We {{consider}} an isolated <b>bubble</b> <b>boiling</b> regime in which vapour bubbles are intermittently produced at a prearranged set of nucleation site on an upward facing overheated wall plane. In this <b>boiling</b> regime, the <b>bubbles</b> {{depart from the}} wall and move as separate entities. Except in the matter of rise velocity, the bubbles do not interfere and are independent of one another. However, the rise velocity is dependent on bubble volume concentration in the bulk. Heat transfer properties specific to this regime cannot be described without bubble detachment size, and we apply our previously developed dynamic theory of vapour bubble growth and detachment to determine this size. Bubble growth is presumed to be thermally controlled. Two limiting cases of bubble evolution are considered: the one in which buoyancy prevails in promoting bubble detachment and the one in which surface tension prevails. We prove termination of the isolated regime of pool nucleate boiling to result from one of the four possible causes, depending on relevant parameters values. The first cause consists {{in the fact that the}} upward flow of rising bubbles hampers the downward liquid flow, and under certain conditions, prevents the liquid from coming to the wall in an amount that would be sufficient to compensate for vapour removal from the wall. The second cause is due to the lateral coalescence of growing bubbles that are attached to their corresponding nucleation sites, with ensuing generation of larger bubbles and extended vapour patches near the wall. The other two causes involve longitudinal coalescence either 1) immediately in the wall vicinity, accompanied by the establishment of the multiple <b>bubble</b> <b>boiling</b> regime, or 2) in the bulk, with the formation of vapour columns. The longitudinal coalescence in the bulk is shown to be the most important cause. The critical wall temperature and the heat flux density associated with isolated bubble regime termination are found to be functions of the physical and operating parameters and are discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|Surface and {{structural}} damage to plasma-facing components (PFCs) {{due to the}} frequent loss of plasma confinement remains a serious problem for the tokamak reactor concept.

40|$|Accidental melting of {{metallic}} plasma-facing {{materials in}} future fusion devices poses serious issues regarding the material lifetime and power-handling capabilities {{as well as}} core plasma performances. The behaviour of aluminium (as a proxy for beryllium) and tungsten materials was investigated in the Pilot-PSI linear plasma device to study the melt-layer motion and droplet ejection under ITER-relevant plasma conditions. Heat fluxes of up to 50 MW m- 2 raised the surface temperature to values up to 5000 K. The melt-layer rotation was found {{to depend on the}} magnetic field (up to 1. 6 T) strength and target potential and is attributed to J × B forces caused by radial currents in the plasma. The amount of droplets ejected from the molten surface depends on the material—more droplets ejected from aluminium than from tungsten—and the heat flux to the target. The average droplet velocity was determined to be around 60 m s- 1 for both materials with droplets being ejected mainly in the axial direction. Droplet ejection is only observed during helium discharges, no ejection can be observed with hydrogen plasmas despite similar heat fluxes. <b>Bubble</b> <b>boiling</b> appears to be the main mechanism contributing to the observed droplet ejection...|$|R

5000|$|The {{variants}} Borus ~ Borvo ~ Bormo ~ Bormanus seem to {{be based}} on a root *boru-. This root in turn is thought to be a variant of the Proto-Celtic root *beru- ‘boil’ and may have meant ‘to bubble.’ Cognate with the names is the Welsh berw ‘boiling.’ and the Goidelic bruich, ‘boil, cook’. The words are variants of a Proto-Indo-European base *bhreue- ‘to <b>bubble,</b> <b>boil,</b> effervesce’ (cf. Skt. Bhurnih ‘violent, passionate,’ Gk. Phrear ‘well, spring,’ L. fervere ‘to boil, foam,’ Thracian Gk. Brytos ‘fermented liquor made from barley;’ O.E. beorma ‘yeast;’ O.H.G. brato ‘roast meat’ [...] ) from which the English word brew also derives. The Proto-Celtic forms of the name variants most probably were *Boru-s, *Borwon-, *Borumāno-s and *Borumān-iko-s and the names most probably meant the ‘Bubbler.’ The base of these names is furthermore the source of the name of the River Barrow. In Irish, the river is called Bearú, the ‘Boiling, Bubbling’ and in Irish mythology it was Dian Cecht, a great healer of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who first caused the river to ‘boil’. *Borvo- is the stem Macbain reconstructs for the Irish borbhan, ‘a purling sound,’ and which he also relates to the Welsh berw, ‘seethe,’ French Bourbon and the Latin fervo, ‘boil’.|$|R
