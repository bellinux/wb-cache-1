Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced <b>basic</b> <b>properties.</b> Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting the <b>basic</b> <b>properties</b> of ZnO, fine {{particles}} of the oxide have deodorizing and antibacterial properties {{and for that}} reason are added into materials including cotton fabric, rubber, oral care products, and food packaging. Enhanced antibacterial action of {{fine particles}} compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is observed for other materials, such as silver. This property results from the increased surface area of the fine particles.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's <b>basic</b> <b>properties</b> will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E

Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium's <b>basic</b> <b>properties</b> will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|The Eta Carinae {{star system}} is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most massive that can be studied in great detail. Until recently Eta Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from Eta Carinae A and <b>basic</b> <b>properties</b> such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as dust from the great eruption finally clears.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Ehlers {{collaborated with}} Felix Pirani and Alfred Schild on a constructive-axiomatic {{approach}} to general relativity: {{a way of}} deriving the theory from a minimal set of elementary objects {{and a set of}} axioms specifying these objects' properties. The basic ingredients of their approach are primitive concepts such as event, light ray, particle and freely falling particle. At the outset, spacetime is a mere set of events, without any further structure. They postulated the <b>basic</b> <b>properties</b> of light and freely falling particles as axioms, and with their help constructed the differential topology, conformal structure and, finally, the metric structure of spacetime, that is: the notion of when two events are close to each other, the role of light rays in linking up events, and a notion of distance between events. Key steps of the construction correspond to idealized measurements, such the standard range finding used in radar. The final step derived Einstein's equations from the weakest possible set of additional axioms. The result is a formulation that clearly identifies the assumptions underlying general relativity.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{the first}} transactinide element and the second member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are {{similar to that of}} hafnium and very different from that of lead. Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium's <b>basic</b> <b>properties</b> will resemble those of other group 4 elements, below titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state. In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state. The standard reduction potential of the Rf4+/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than −1.7V.|$|E
