Simulations were performed for both the static and dynamic controllers in the regulation of a typical <b>buck</b> <b>current</b> regulator and the systems ’ start-up waveforms, line and load transient responses were analyzed. Simulation results indicate that both the static and dynamic controller achieve to regulate the output current of the regulator to the desired equilibrium value and present high robustness while sudden line and load transients occur and that the dynamic controller applied case has better overall performance with soft-start scheme to alleviate the startup overshoot problem.

The nonlinear current control is analyzed and designed using a systematic approach.

Conventional VSI and CSI support only <b>current</b> <b>buck</b> DC-AC power conversion and need a relatively complex modulator. The limitations of VSI and CSI are overcome by Z-source inverter. The Z-source inverter system employs a unique LC network in the DC link and a small capacitor on the AC side of the diode front end.

By concentrating on Chinese-language sources, the thesis re-privileges the community's internal discourses and highlights the prevalence of nationalist rhetoric across the Sino-Russian border. It also sites the Chinese community's use of nationalist language {{within the context of the}} global diaspora, for which questions of national weakness and revival were also pressing. Going further, the thesis postulates the presence of "Chinese nationalism with Russian characteristics", in which the issues surrounding Chinese nationalism as a whole were heightened. It shows that the rhetoric of ânational humiliation" and victimhood were particularly immediate to the community in the Russian Far East, since it was located at one of the epicentres of imperial contestation. In practice, this led to a modus vivendi with the Reds and a decisive turn against the Whites. Furthermore, the chaos of the revolutions and Civil War imbued this nationalism with an opportunistic quality. The collapse of Russian state power became the "opportunity of a thousand years" for China to redress past wrongs. This allowed the overseas community to work closely with local authorities and the Beijing government to achieve shared goals. New civil society organisations with community-wide aims were formed. Beijing extended its diplomatic reach in the form of new Far Eastern consulates. Finally, common nationalist rhetoric underpinned China's successful attempt to re-establish its civilian and military presence on the Amur River. "Chinese nationalism with Russian characteristics" could be effectively harnessed to secure multi-level and cross-border cooperation. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{integrated}} buck- flyback converter {{as a good}} solution for implementing low- cost high-power-factor ac-dc converters with fast output regulation. It will be shown that, when both buck and flyback semistages are operated in discontinuous conduction mode, the voltage across the bulk capacitor, {{which is used to}} store energy at low frequency, is independent of the output power. This makes it possible to maintain the bulk capacitor voltage at a low value within the whole line voltage range. This project implements a buck converter for the first stage and flyback converter for output stage. These topologies are very good solution for fast output dynamics. Another advantage of this integrated buck-flyback converter, is that switch handles the highest of <b>buck</b> or flyback <b>current</b> not addition of both currents. The remaining current is handled by the diodes of the integrated switch, which gives lower losses. The buck capacitor voltage is independent of load, duty cycle, and switching frequency and it only depends on the ac input voltage and the ratio of the two buck and flyback inductance. This is an important feature of the integrated converter operating in discontinuous mode, which allows them to provide fast output voltage regulation. The simulation has been performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed LED lamp driver...|$|R
