500|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{was first}} {{released}} on 5 March 2001 in North America. Advertisements {{for the game}} were featured in adult magazines such as Playboy, and video commercials were geared towards an adult audience. As Nintendo was known for its family-friendly games like Mario and Pokémon, the game {{was the subject of}} controversy. According to Rare, [...] "Nintendo initially had concerns regarding this issue, <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> might confuse the product as being aimed at them, but I'm sure you'll agree if you've seen the box that Nintendo is making sure nobody makes that mistake." [...] Nintendo of America declined to acknowledge the game in its Nintendo Power magazine and KB Toys, which specialised in toys and video games for children, decided not to sell the game. In Europe, the game was published and distributed by THQ on 6 April 2001, after Nintendo of Europe declined to publish it.|$|E
500|$|Michael Slezak of TVLine complimented [...] "Max Adler's {{surprisingly}} nuanced performance" [...] as Karofsky in [...] "Born This Way": [...] "The complex play {{of emotions}} in Karofsky's eyes when Santana simultaneously {{came out to}} him, threatened to out him, predicted his sad future as a closeted state senator or deacon, and offered him a quick-fix solution by pretending to be his beard, was tremendous." [...] He added, [...] "Adler is bringing a terrific amount of depth to Karofsky." [...] VanDerWerff referred to Karofsky's parallel journey with Santana, who is also closeted, in his comments about the episode {{and the next one}} where the character appears, [...] "Prom Queen". He said in his review of the latter, [...] "the characters I'm most interested in at this point are Karofsky and Santana. They're both people {{trying to do the right}} thing, but they're also both people who are defeated by their own weakest impulses. ... They're both hemmed in by the decisions they've made and their inability to be true to themselves". Meghan Brown of The Atlantic praised Karofsky's [...] "tearful apology to Kurt" [...] in that episode as being [...] "painful and poignant", and Slezak went further: Whatever awards Chris Colfer and Max Adler get nominated for in the next six months, they earned 'em during this conversation, where Kurt wondered if maybe, just maybe, he wasn't getting bullied <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> were indifferent to him being gay, not because Karofsky was serving as his security detail. ... ou could see in Kurt's eyes the decision to start treating Karofsky not as a former tormentor, but as a terrified kid struggling with his sexual orientation. And Karofsky's break—his first true apology for bullying Kurt, and his first tentative step toward admitting the root cause of his anger—had me reaching for the Kleenex. Tell me I'm not the only one hoping Glee will keep journeying down Karofsky's difficult road toward self-acceptance.|$|E

50|$|Frehley {{stated in}} various {{interviews}} that Kiss {{was becoming a}} youth-oriented band.

5000|$|Marcos Curiel {{noted that}} {{censorship}} {{of the video}} came into play due to Viacom: [...] "We had a girl sitting {{on the hood of}} the car going down the highway trying to be free-spirited, you know? ...

50|$|Depending on who was playing, the pit {{would become}} a mass of sweaty skinheads, punks, metalheads, goth kids and the {{occasional}} hippie slamming into each other. In the late 1980s, shows would be stopped <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> were getting too violent. The bouncers had a notorious reputation of brutality, and there certainly {{were a number of}} incidents where this was the case.|$|E

3000|$|... “Leadership I suppose is {{one really}} big thing. <b>Because</b> the <b>kids</b> {{see what the}} parents do let alone the {{grandparents}} that they’re staying with and finding that we’re always broke {{and we have to}} wait until next fortnight. Then they get annoyed with their parents or the people that are spending the money in their families and so the relationships start to crumble”.|$|R
50|$|Between 1930 through 1970, about 10% of {{children}} from Chijgam attended the only {{high school in the}} district: the Dahyabhai Sunderji & Bhagwanji Bhimbhai School in Khara Abrama. It is a commute of 8 miles from Chijgam to the DS&BB school. Lalbhai Patel started primary school around 1930's in Chijgam <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> had really hard time to go to Panaar which was only 3 miles commute but through muddy waterway.|$|E
5000|$|... "A woman {{saw someone}} {{wearing one of}} our shirts, I think she is a schoolteacher, and she just caused this big stink about it.

We can't play 'Born in a Casket' but can play 'Dismembered and Molested'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leinart {{was born}} in Santa Ana, California, with {{strabismus}} (commonly known as [...] "crossed eyes"); his left eye was not aligned correctly with his right. He underwent surgery when he {{was three years old}} and was fitted with special glasses to correct the problem, but the eyewear combined with Leinart's already-overweight frame made him an easy target for other children's ridicule. [...] "I used to get made fun of for being cross-eyed. It's just a terrible thing <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> are so cruel to the fat kid, to the kid with the glasses. So I turned to sports," [...] he would later say.|$|E
5000|$|First Kiss {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 61, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 9 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said, [...] "It's a bit bumpy and sometimes sleepy but it finds old Bob Ritchie settling into his comfort zone, knowing that he's {{in it for}} the long haul." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone said, [...] "First Kiss presents few surprises, mostly <b>because</b> <b>Kid</b> Rock's journey from abrasive rap metal to unreconstructed heartland rock has landed him in a sweet spot: big guitars, big drums, big choruses and gravelly vocals." [...] Richard Bienstock of Billboard said, [...] "First Kiss is hardly his most adventurous project, but it is perhaps his most easygoing, tuneful one. The production is crisp and clean, the guitars are sparkling, the vibe is rollicking but relaxed. He sounds better here than he has in a long time." ...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the main}} opposers to year-round {{schooling}} come from an agricultural background. This is <b>because</b> the <b>kids</b> would have to attend school in the summer, which is {{when most of the}} farm work is done. The families' livelihood depends on some children being able to help out on the farm. This is one {{of the main}} reasons most schools do not have year-round classes.|$|R

5000|$|Attention {{disorders}} and depression may develop. [...] "It's a problem <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> who don't get nature-time seem {{more prone to}} anxiety, depression and attention-deficit problems". Louv suggests that going outside and being in the quiet and calm place can help greatly. [...] According to a University of Illinois study, interaction with nature has proven to reduce symptoms of ADD in children. According to research, [...] "Overall, our findings indicate that exposure to ordinary natural settings {{in the course of}} common after-school and weekend activities may be widely effective in reducing attention deficit symptoms in children". Attention Restoration Theory develops this idea further, both in short term restoration of one's abilities, and the long term ability to cope with stress and adversity.|$|E

The tour has grown from having 8 tournaments to 85 tournaments per year. The most unusual aspect of the TJGT is that it offers tournaments throughout the fall and winter months. College coaches like this <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> show their love and desire for the game when playing in the cold and rainy months. Of the 85 tournaments offered, 5 of them are elite invitational tournaments and 11 major tournaments. These provide even greater competition for the junior golfers.

5000|$|Probably Funmate's most {{well-known}} offering {{was a series}} of Ford vehicles sealed in plastic to the sides of Procter & Gamble detergent packages for 1971 and 1972 (The Accelerator, 2008).

When not in use, the handle could be placed in another hole to the back right of the bumper. The handle was usually molded in the same color as the car. The car shot across the floor when a small black lever was depressed. Some of the later cars were made with a launching [...] "pad" [...] mechanism that the car rested on top of, probably <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> could get jabbed in the eye if the original rod wasn't held firmly. It could spring backwards as the original label on the bottom of the car warned.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked why}} the {{campaign}} resonated so well with teens, Gabriel Sunday said [...] "I think the reason this whole IAmAnArchie campaign started is <b>because</b> <b>kids</b> in the festival circuit would be like, “Oh, that’s me. Archie is me.” There are so many ways you can connect with that character and kids always connect with him, no matter what place or what country they’re in. They feel that sh** that he’s going through, and they’re living it. So they started giving that feedback and saying [...] "I’m an Archie because I’m depressed and I hate my family, or I’m creative and I love making art but people don’t understand it." [...] I’ve been connected {{to the issue of}} suicide for six or seven years, and I know that what kids need to hear more than anything is that they’re not alone. That ended up being our message with IAmAnArchie: “Yeah, I’m scared, I’m depressed, I’m obsessed, I’m whatever, but I’m also an Archie because there’s a million Archies and they’re all going through crazy s***.” ...|$|E
