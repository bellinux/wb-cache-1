5000|$|The {{heightened}} {{level of}} misogyny {{has also been}} expressed <b>by</b> journalists, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the viewpoint of coarse and crude male domination — constantly minimizing {{the conscience of the}} feminine sex — that oozes from (reggaeton) lyrics, is simply degrading." ...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{discipline}} of economics began, its practitioners have tried to infer laws, tendencies, causal relationships and associations about the real world. These claims are made {{through the construction of}} models – mathematical, statistical, verbal or a mix of all three. This note examines the methodological issues faced by models {{in the context of the}} Indian economy. It concludes <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> economists need to be more cautious while using models to intervene in the Indian economy. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{issue of}} control over the {{northern}} branch of the Silk Road by the Caliphate has been suggested as a further motive for the conflict, but G. Mako disputes this claim <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> warfare declined at precisely the period of the greatest expansion of traffic along the Silk Road, i.e. after the middle of the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|Others counter {{these claims}} <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> bathhouses {{are a major}} source of safer sex informationthey provide {{pamphlets}} and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room {{as well as in the}} common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises. In cities with larger gay populations, STD and HIV testing and counseling may be offered on-site for no charge.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{has responded}} to these accusations <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Lillee {{had been out of}} cricket for 21 months {{suffering}} from a serious back complaint and that Thomson had not played in Tests for 23 months before the 1974–5 Ashes series, since an unsuccessful debut Test against Pakistan (Thomson's match figures were 0–110). Furthermore, he was dismissed for 99 in the first innings against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1973–74 and scored 112 in the second, followed by a career-best 261 not out against a West Indies Board President's XI. All of these teams included Roberts, with a young Holding representing the Board XI.|$|E
5|$|Treadgold's {{claim that}} Diocletian {{increased}} the army's numbers by over 50% is considered implausible <b>by</b> Heather, who <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> even 33% {{would have required}} a Herculean effort.|$|R

50|$|After {{a period}} of {{uncertainty}} as to {{the outcome of the}} first attempt, Kaliayev returns, saying he could not throw the bomb at the carriage, as it contained the Grand Duke's nephew and niece. Stepan is disgusted <b>by</b> this, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> thousands of Russian children have {{died as a result of}} Tsarist oppression, but the others take Kaliayev's side, as killing children would harm their cause.|$|R
5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
5|$|On one occasion, the two {{scientists}} {{had gone on}} a fossil-collecting expedition to Cope's marl pits in New Jersey, where William Parker Foulke had discovered the holotype specimen of Hadrosaurus foulkii, described by the paleontologist Joseph Leidy (under whom Cope had studied comparative anatomy); {{this was one of}} the first American dinosaur finds, and the pits were still rich with fossils. Though the two parted amicably, Marsh secretly bribed the pit operators to divert future fossil finds to him, instead of Cope. The two began attacking each other in papers and publications, and their personal relations deteriorated. Marsh humiliated Cope <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> his reconstruction of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus was flawed, with the head placed where the tail should have been (or so he claimed, 20 years later; it was Leidy who published the correction shortly afterwards). Cope, in turn, began collecting in what Marsh considered his private bone-hunting turf in Kansas and Wyoming, further damaging their relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} did {{not find}} anyone guilty of negligence or misconduct, but Lieutenant Admiral Bär, commander of Nyckeln, and Lieutenant Admiral Christer Boije, who had run aground on Äpplet, were never again given a command in the navy. Lieutenant Admiral Hans Clerck, commander of Solen, went through the process unscathed, and was promoted to full Admiral by the King before the commission even presented its verdict. Creutz has quite consistently been blamed {{for the loss of}} his ship by historians, and has been described as an incompetent sea officer and sailor who more or less single-handedly brought about the sinking through lack of naval experience. Military historians Lars Ericson Wolke and Olof Sjöblom have attempted to nuance the picture <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Creutz's task was akin to that of an administrator rather than a military commander. The practical issues of ship maneuvering should have been the responsibility of his subordinates, who had experience in naval matters.|$|E

5000|$|This nominal has {{priority}} over E. carinognathus, {{and therefore the}} latter is a junior synonym of T. australis. Later studies of the holotype <b>by</b> Kear <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> this species is distinct enough from the type species of Tuarangisaurus to be placed in its own genus. Eromangasaurus was the only available name for the new combination Eromangasaurus australis. E. australis is widely accepted today as the correct name for QM F11050.|$|R
5000|$|From 1987 to 1988, William Quandt was President of the Middle East Studies Association, {{a learned}} society. He joined the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia in 1994, where {{he holds the}} {{departmental}} Edward R. Stettinius chair. He teaches courses on the Middle East and American Foreign Policy. From 2000 to 2003, he also served as their Vice Provost for International Affairs. In 2004, {{he was elected to}} the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. After the fall semester of 2012, Quandt will retire from his teaching career at UVa. Professor Schulhofer-Wohl, his replacement, commended his legacy <b>by</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> [...] "more than 200 students take class every year, and that's clearly due in no small part to Dr. Quandt and what he brings to it. It's an amazing opportunity for me to be able to work so closely with such a distinguished scholar in this way. I don't think many people have that kind of chance." ...|$|R
5|$|With {{the score}} tied 10–10, Buccaneer linebacker Cal Peterson {{suffered}} a career-ending injury untouched when his knee gave out while running in an interception {{for what would}} have been a touchdown. Lee Roy Selmon also suffered a season-ending knee injury. After taking a 13–10 lead on a Dave Green field goal, the injury-riddled Buccaneers were doomed by an 18½ minute span in which the Broncos scored 38 points. Coach McKay accused Broncos coach John Ralston of running up the score and stormed off of the field, refusing to shake hands with him after the game. He later referred to Ralston as a “horse’s ass” and said, “I don’t like any part of him. His day is coming”. Ralston responded <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> most of the Broncos points came on fumble recoveries and interceptions. McKay later revealed his thoughts on the team’s likely high draft position, saying “This team needs a catalyst. Ricky Bell can run through a wall”.|$|E
5|$|The {{case for}} Hess's defence was {{presented}} from 22–26 March by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl. He noted that while Hess accepted {{responsibility for the}} many decrees he had signed, he said these matters {{were part of the}} internal workings of a sovereign state and thus outside the purview of a war crimes trial. He called to the stand Ernst Wilhelm Bohle, the man who had been head of the NSDAP/AO, to testify on Hess's behalf. When Griffith-Jones presented questions about the organisation's spying in several countries, Bohle testified that any warlike activities such as espionage had been done without his permission or knowledge. Seidl called two other witnesses, former mayor of Stuttgart Karl Strölin and Hess's brother Alfred, both of whom refuted the allegations that the NSDAP/AO had been spying and fomenting war. Seidl presented a summation of the defence's case on 25 July, in which he attempted to refute the charge of conspiracy <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Hitler alone had made all the important decisions. He noted that Hess could not be held responsible for any events that took place after he left Germany in May 1941. Meanwhile, Hess mentally detached himself from what was happening, declining visits from his family and refusing to read the newspapers.|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge <b>by</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{presentation}} describing use of similar phases in software engineering {{was held by}} Herbert D. Benington at Symposium on advanced programming methods for digital computers on 29 June 1956. This presentation was {{about the development of}} software for SAGE. In 1983 the paper was republished with a foreword <b>by</b> Benington <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the process was not in fact performed in a strict top-down fashion, but depended on a prototype.|$|R
50|$|In July 2010, Milton {{suggested}} that doctors should describe obese patients as 'fat' {{to encourage them}} {{to take responsibility for their}} condition.

5000|$|That Echeverría did not {{publish the}} story because he feared {{assassination}} even in Uruguay was denied <b>by</b> Cabañas, who <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Echeverría did publish other works which, he claimed, were equally offensive. [...] Rather, the story {{did not fit}} Echeverría's aesthetic sensibility.|$|R

25|$|The mass {{suicide of}} the People's Temple has helped embed {{the idea that}} all New Religious Movements are {{destructive}} in the public mind.
