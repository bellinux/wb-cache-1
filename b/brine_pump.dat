As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the <b>brine</b> <b>pump</b> had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir.

Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|E

30|$|A {{traditional}} way of geothermal energy production implies hot brine extraction from the reservoir to a surface facility. This method is economically profitable only for high enthalpy reservoirs associated with shallow depths and high temperatures. The low enthalpy geothermal (LEG) projects are out of consideration due to {{the high cost of}} produced electric power related to expensive drilling, cost of the binary cycle system, and long term installation cost. This paper presents a new zero mass extraction method utilizing downhole heat exchanger (DHE) with no geo-fluid production to the surface. The well design stays as a single horizontal well with coupled production and injection sections. The <b>brine</b> <b>pump</b> is located between the sections providing hot brine circulation through the DHE. The coupled fluid flow and heat transfer mathematical model was developed and simulated using nodal analysis method. The LEG reservoir prototype located in South Louisiana was used to study several cases of the DHE lengths, inclination angles, reservoir permeabilities, and flow rates optimization. According to the analysis, the power unit is able to provide 160  kW of net electric power with CO 2 working fluid circulating inside a single lateral well. Increasing the reservoir temperature and the number of laterals, the available power production rises up to 600  kW with an attractive electricity cost of $ 21.84 /MWh at 7000  m well depth. This methods opens a new prospective for the depleted petroleum wells converting them to the electricity production units.|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} that the {{analyses}} contained in this volume were performed, the avoided energy costs of California's regulated electric utilities were at historic highs and were projected to continue to increase at double-digit annual rates. Since that time, oil prices have slipped, the general rate of inflation has abated, domestic electric power consumption has fallen short of expectations, {{and a host of other}} economic elements have shifted in directions which have resulted in substantial reductions in current California avoided energy costs. The question of whether these changes are merely short-term aberrations or represent a fundamental shift in the long-term energy supply and demand balance is beyond the scope of this report. Although the present depressed avoided electric energy prices are not consistent with the projections on which this report's analyses are based, a fact which results in significant discrepancies between the absolute financial returns predicted and those achievable under current circumstances, the comparative results of the study remain valid. The basic thrust of the studies represented in this report was to compare the overall economics of the Gravity Head system with that of optimized conventional binary generating plants. The study is site-specific to the East Mesa geothermal reservoir. It begins with an analysis of optimum individual well production based on the known characteristics of the reservoir. The limiting factors at East Mesa are reservoir drawdown and maximum practical <b>brine</b> <b>pump</b> impeller setting depth. The individual-well production limit is achieved when brine pressure at the pump inlet is reduced to the point at which CO{sub 2 } starts to come out of solution, and fouling and impeller cavitation become imminent. The optimum pumping rate was found to be 1300 gpm (at 360 F density) and required that the Gravity Head pump impeller be set 2, 033 feet below grade. The required conventional plant pump setting was 1, 887 feet below grade, a depth which is probably at the practical limit for shaft-driven conventional pumps. Using the 1300 gpm, 360 F resource as a starting point, detailed cost estimates and performance calculations were made for the Gravity Head and various conventional alternative well-head systems. The most cost effective of the conventional alternatives was found to be a 700 psi cycle using R 114 as the working fluid (actually optimized at 682 psi). That system produced 3, 805 kW busbar net vs. 4, 995 kW busbar net for the Gravity Head unit. Since both the Gravity Head and conventional binary plant cost estimates for commercially mature units came out roughly equal, it was obvious that the Gravity Head system would produce more attractive financial returns [...] it became a question of degree. The study is in two parts. In Part I, emphasis is placed on the economic sensitivities of the compared systems to variations in capital cost, O&M cost, avoided energy inflation rates, and brine cost. In Part II, a somewhat more rigorous attempt is made to derive the actual economic performance of the systems under more realistic circumstances with contingencies, cost penalties, and multiple-unit developments added...|$|E

50|$|The Warmingham {{area has}} a long history of salt extraction.

Natural (uncontrolled) <b>brine</b> <b>pumping</b> at nearby Elworth, Ettiley Heath, Wheelock and elsewhere in the Sandbach area occurred from the 19th century, increasing sharply after the First World War, and was associated with subsidence in Warmingham and the adjacent parish of Moston from the 1890s. The Sandbach Flashes - pools formed by subsidence from the underlying salt dissolving, accelerated by salt extraction - first appeared in the early 1920s and were still expanding in the 1950s. Natural <b>brine</b> <b>pumping</b> ceased in the area in the early 1970s, and British Salt started to extract brine by the controlled pumping method, which prevents subsidence, at a site near Hill Top Farm in the early 1980s.|$|R

40|$|This work is {{the first}} in a series of {{articles}} addressing the energy optimization in ice hockey halls. Here we adopt an analytical method, called functional optimization, to find which design and operating conditions maximize the Coefficient Of Performance of the entire cooling system (<b>brine</b> <b>pumps</b> and cooling tower), which we call COP_sys. This is addressed as a function of several variables, like electric consumption and brine physical properties. By maximizing such function, the best configuration and brine choices for the system can thus be determined accurately and rigorously. We investigate the importance of pipe diameter, depth and brine type (ethylene glycol and ammonia) for average-sized ice rinks. An optimal brine density is found, and we compute the weight of the electric consumption of the <b>brine</b> <b>pumps</b> on COP_sys. Our formulas are validated with heat flow measurement data obtained at an ice hockey hall in Finland. They are also confronted with technical and cost-related constraints, and implemented by simulations with the program COMSOL Multiphysics.

Such natural or wild <b>brine</b> <b>pumping</b> differs from controlled <b>brine</b> <b>pumping,</b> where water is pumped underground into rock to dissolve rock salt deposits. The process has historically been associated with subsidence, {{which has been a}} major problem in the Northwich area. The brine was purified by treatment with sodium carbonate and lime, and the salt extracted using a closed-pan partial vacuum evaporation method. The technique was adapted from the sugar industry, and had first been applied to salt extraction in 1887 in Silver Springs, New York. First tried commercially in the UK as early as 1901, several British manufacturers started up vacuum evaporator plants using a small Mirlees-type evaporator in parallel with their open-pan operations after the First World War. James Stubbs had learned about the method of vacuum evaporation in Michigan in 1905, and the New Cheshire Works was one of the early companies to adopt the vacuum evaporation method, importing an evaporator in the 1930s. Described as [...] "magnificent" [...] by journalist Mark Kurlansky, the company's first evaporator had three chambers; it had an Art Deco design, and was decorated with stripes in dark and pale wood, with brass fittings. The company updated the evaporator in the 1950s and the 1990s. In the 2000s, the works was using a small Svenson system with three evaporator chambers (termed [...] "effects").|$|R
