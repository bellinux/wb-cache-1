50|$|The three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculatus) is a Central American {{migratory bird}} of the cotinga family. The sexes are very dis-similar in appearance. The male has a white head and throat and the {{remaining}} plumage is chestnut brown. From {{the base of his}} beak dangle three long, slender, <b>black</b> <b>wattles</b> that he uses in display. The female has olive plumage with yellowish streaked underparts and a yellow vent area.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Black</b> <b>wattles,</b> {{along with}} gums, native box, native hop form the {{framework}} vegetation on so-called [...] "hill-topping" [...] sites. They are often isolated remnant pockets of native vegetation amongst a lower sea of exotic pasture. These [...] "hill topping" [...] sites are critical habitat for male butterflies to attract females for mating, which then {{lay their eggs}} under the wattle's bark elsewhere but still within close proximity. It's the only acceptable mating site {{in the area for}} these butterflies.|$|R
25|$|Acacia mearnsii is a fast-growing, {{extremely}} invasive leguminous tree {{native to}} Australia. Common names for it include <b>black</b> <b>wattle,</b> Acácia-negra (Portuguese), Australian acacia, Australische Akazie (German), Swartwattel (Afrikaans), Uwatela (Zulu). This plant {{is now known}} as one of the worst invasive species in the world.|$|E
25|$|<b>Black</b> <b>wattle</b> flowers provide very {{nitrogen}} rich pollen with no nectar. They attract pollen-feeding birds such as wattlebirds, yellow-throated honeyeaters and New Holland honeyeaters. The protein rich nectar in {{the leaf}} axials is very sustaining for nurturing {{the growth of}} juvenile nestlings and young invertebrates, e.g. ants.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{intensive}} {{conservation efforts}} the Table Mountain range {{has the highest}} concentration of threatened species of any continental area of equivalent size in the world. The non-urban areas of the Cape Peninsula (mainly on the mountains and mountain slopes) have suffered particularly under a massive onslaught of invasive alien plants {{for well over a}} century, with perhaps the worst invader being the cluster pine, partly because it was planted in extensive commercial plantations along the eastern slopes of the mountains, north of Muizenberg. Considerable efforts have been made to control the rapid spread of these invasive alien trees. Other invasive plants include <b>black</b> <b>wattle,</b> blackwood, Port Jackson and rooikrans (All Australian members of the acacia family), as well as several Hakea species and bramble.|$|E
5000|$|Like other cotingas, {{the bearded}} bellbird has a broad hooked-tipped bill, rounded wings, strong legs and a {{striking}} appearance. The male is approx 28 cm 11 in long, and weighs 180 g. His plumage is white or greyish-white {{apart from the}} black wings and warm brown head. He sports a grotesque [...] "beard" [...] of un-feathered, <b>black</b> stringy <b>wattles.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Karaknath is an Indian {{breed of}} chicken local to the Madhya Pradesh area, {{where it is}} known as [...] "Kali masi" [...] ("fowl having black flesh"). The Kadaknath is popular mainly for its adaptability, and the good-tasting black meat, which is {{believed}} to infuse vigor. Its color stems from the deposition of melanin pigment. [...] The birds are completely black: black plumage with a greenish iridescence, black legs and toe nails, black beak and tongue, <b>black</b> comb and <b>wattles,</b> <b>black</b> meat and bones and even dark organs.|$|R
6000|$|John assented, {{observing that}} the puff-adders were brutes, {{and that he}} must have some pigs turned in to destroy them, which the pigs effect by munching them up, {{apparently}} without unpleasant consequences to themselves. Then he departed on his errand, wending his way gingerly through the feathery <b>black</b> <b>wattles.</b> It did not take long, and he saw no puff-adders. When he had finished looking at the young trees, he returned, still walking delicately like Agag. On reaching the border of the plantation, he paused to look at Bessie, who was some twenty paces from him, perched sideways on the low sod wall, and framed, as it were, in the full rich light of the setting sun. Her hat was off, for the sun had lost its burning force, and the hand that held it hung idly by her, while her eyes were fixed on the horizon flaming with all the varied glories of an African sunset. He gazed at her sweet face and lissom form, and some lines that he had read years before floated into his mind-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Belgian naturalist Émile Auguste Joseph De Wildeman {{described}} the <b>black</b> <b>wattle</b> in 1925. The species {{is named after}} American naturalist Edgar Alexander Mearns, who collected the type from a cultivated specimen in East Africa. Along with other bipinnate wattles, it is classified in the section Botrycephalae within the subgenus Phyllodineae in the genus Acacia. An analysis of genomic and chloroplast DNA along with morphological characters found that the section is polyphyletic, though the close relationships of many species were unable to be resolved. Acacia mearnsii [...] appears to be most closely related to A. dealbata, A. nanodealbata and A. baileyana.|$|E

"Bessie," [...] said John one lovely day, {{just as the}} {{afternoon}} was merging into evening, [...] "Bessie"--he always called her Bessie now--"I am {{going down to the}} <b>black</b> <b>wattle</b> plantation by the big mealie patch. I want to see how those young trees are doing. If you have done your cooking"--for she had been engaged in making a cake, as young ladies, to their souls' health, often have to do in the Colonies--"I wish you would put on your hat and come with me. I don't believe that you have been out to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|John Niel woke {{early the}} next morning, feeling as sore and stiff {{as though he had}} been well beaten and then wrapped up tight in horse-girths. He made shift, however, to dress himself, and then, {{with the help of a}} stick, limped through the French windows that opened from his room on to the verandah, and {{surveyed}} the scene before him. It was a delightful spot. At the back of the stead was the steep boulder-strewn face of the flat-topped hill that curved round on each side, embosoming a great slope of green, in the lap of which the house was placed. It was very solidly built of brown stone, and, with the exception of the waggon-shed and other outbuildings which were roofed with galvanised iron, that shone and glistened in the rays of the morning sun in a way that would have made an eagle blink, was covered with rich brown thatch. All along its front ran a wide verandah, up the trellis-work of which green vines and blooming creepers trailed pleasantly, and beyond was the broad carriage-drive of red soil, bordered with bushy orange-trees laden with odorous flowers and green and golden fruit. On the farther side of the orange-trees were the gardens, fenced in with low walls of rough stone, and the orchard planted with standard fruit-trees, and beyond these again the oxen and ostrich kraals, the latter full of long-necked birds. To the right of the house grew thriving plantations of blue-gum and <b>black</b> <b>wattle,</b> and to the left was a broad stretch of cultivated lands, lying so that they could be irrigated for winter crops by means of water led from the great spring that gushed out of the mountain-side high above the house, and gave its name of Mooifontein to the place.|$|E
50|$|The bearded bellbird (Procnias averano) {{also known}} as the campanero or anvil-bird, is a {{passerine}} bird which occurs in northern South America. The male is about 28 cm long with white plumage apart from a brown head and black wings. At his throat hang several <b>black,</b> unfeathered <b>wattles.</b> The female is a little smaller with olive-green head and upper parts, yellow underparts streaked with green and a yellow vent area. The male has a loud, repeated metallic hammering call, as well as various other vocalisations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{invasion}} of natural ecosystems by alien plants {{is a serious}} environmental problem that threatens the sustainable use of benefits derived from such ecosytems. Most past studies in this field have focussed on the history, ecology and management of invasive alien species, and little {{work has been done}} on the economic aspects and consequences of invasions. This paper reviews what is known of the economic consequences of alien plant invasions in South Africa. These economic arguments have been used to successfully launch the largest environmental management programme in Africa. Ten million hectares of South Africa has been invaded by 180 alien species, but their impacts are not fully understood, although they are undoubtedly significant. The indications are that the total costs of these impacts are substantial. Selected studies show that invasions have reduced the value of fynbos ecosystems by over US $ 11. 75 billion; that the total cost of invasion would be about US $ 3. 2 billion on the Agulhas Plain alone; that the net present cost of invasion by <b>black</b> <b>wattles</b> amounts to US $ 1. 4 billion; that invasions by red water fern have cost US $ 58 million; and that the cost to clear the alien plant invasions in South Africa is around US $ 1. 2 billion. These few examples indicate that the economic consequences of invasions are huge. One of the unique aspects of invasive plant control programmes in South Africa has been the abilit...|$|R
