5|$|As the French {{constructed}} further fortifications, Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance aircraft}} {{picked up the}} activity and reported it. The steep slopes {{on the banks of}} the Meuse, added to what appeared in photographic reconnaissance to be a formidable <b>barrier</b> <b>of</b> bunkers and defence lines, caused Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander in chief of Army Group A, to question the wisdom of Guderian in choosing Sedan as the point of maximum effort. To identify how strong these fortifications were, a team of photographic specialists were called in to evaluate the pictures. Their analysis concluded that what appeared to be strong fortified positions were just the construction sites of half-built bunkers that were, to all intents and purposes, empty shells. The contribution of the specialists tilted the Sedan attack plan into Guderian's favour.|$|E
5|$|During {{the concept}} phase {{there were four}} people working on the Hitman Go. Initial prototypes were built on paper using printed out characters.

The studio looked at several different engines for building the game, but opted with Unity early on as it had a low <b>barrier</b> <b>of</b> entry, provided support for the main mobile platforms, and some members of the development team had previous experience creating projects in the game engine. An initial working prototype and a basic level editor were developed in a few days and after two weeks the first version of the game was presented to the remainder of the studio.|$|E

5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, {{was the most difficult}} to achieve technically, and highly prized for this and the brilliance of the colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a <b>barrier</b> <b>of</b> laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic <b>barrier</b> <b>of</b> the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Adequate {{access to}} oral and dental health {{services}} in childhood can reduce long-term complications {{in the following}} years of life. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> access to children’s oral and dental health services from the point of view of mothers referring to health centers in Qom city. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the statistical population included 325 mothers referred to health centers. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisted of items, including age, educational level, job, and <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> access to oral health services. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical indicators and logistic regression test. Results: In this study, lack of insurance coverage for dentistry costs (59. 7 %) had the highest frequency in <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> access to dental health services, followed by child's fear of dentistry (53. 2 %) and high costs of dental services (49. 8 %). There was no significant relationship between mother's job and <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> access to dental health services, but the chance <b>of</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> access to dental health services increased 1. 60 times with father’s employment in government jobs. Also, the results showed that the chance <b>of</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> access to dental health services increased 3. 60 times with residence in Pardisan region, on the other hand, the chance of access to the services, was improved up to 52 % with residence in Tohid region. Conclusion: Expansion of insurance coverage of oral and dental health services and increase of public centers providing dental services can be eliminate the major part <b>of</b> <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> access to these services. In addition, the proportional distribution of these services in different regions of the city can be effective in easy and low-cost access...|$|R

The population of the study consisted of all 285 fish farmers of the selected villages of Muktagacha upazila (sub-district) of Mymensingh district. Needed data were collected with questionnaire by personal interviewing of the respondents. Result shows that lack of technical knowledge on pond management, unavailability of credit and poor extension service and lack of information has been identified as the potential <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> pond fish culture entrepreneurships. Findings also shows that education, income from pond fish culture, availability of information sources and knowledge on pond fish culture have negative significant relationships and age and family size have positive significant relationships with the <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> pond fish culture entrepreneurships. However, the results of stepwise multiple regression indicates that 65. 4 % (Adjusted R 2 = 0. 654) of the variance in the <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> pond fish culture entrepreneurships could be explained by the explanatory variables of the study. This indicates that there are other variables working behind the <b>barriers</b> <b>of</b> pond fish culture entrepreneurships.
