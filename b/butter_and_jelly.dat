5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E

25|$|The format {{remains largely}} {{unchanged}} from previous seasons. HouseGuests are sequestered in the Big Brother House with no contact {{to or from}} the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food, luxuries, and power in the House. The winner of the weekly Head of Household competition is immune from nominations and must nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. After a HouseGuest becomes Head of Household, {{he or she is}} ineligible {{to take part in the}} next Head of Household competition. HouseGuests also take part in competitions to earn food for the week. The losing team will be forced to eat Big Brother Slop for the week. This is the second season to feature Slop as the punishment food, as it was originally peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> <b>jelly.</b> The winner of the Power of Veto competition wins the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction. If the Veto winner exercises the power, the Head of Household must then nominate another HouseGuest for eviction.|$|E
500|$|In 2003 an {{ice cream}} parlour, [...] "Udder Delight", opened in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, specialising in [...] "outlandish" [...] ice cream flavours. Among other flavours, such as their award-winning peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> ice cream, they have created a bacon ice cream which tastes like butter pecan. The owner, Chip Hearn, had {{included}} the flavour along with 17 others in an invitation-only focus group, where the tasters were allowed to suggest changes and give opinions on the flavour.|$|E
500|$|Deep-fried {{foods are}} common in many countries, and have also been {{described}} as [...] "a staple of almost all street cuisines on all continents". There are hundreds of dishes {{that are associated with}} deep frying as most foods can be deep-fried. Examples of food that can be deep-fried include meat, poultry, fish and vegetables. Fish and chips, for instance, combines deep-fried fish and deep-fried potatoes. French fries, doughnuts, onion rings, and hushpuppies are common deep-fried foods. Other common deep-fried foods include Chinese You Bing deep-fried pancakes, Southeast Asian Jin deui, and Japanese tempura. Less common deep-fried foods include maple leaves, peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> sandwiches, pizza, and Snickers bars.|$|E

50|$|The peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> banana {{sandwich}} {{has been}} referred to as a favorite of Elvis Presley, who was renowned for his food cravings such as the Fool's Gold Loaf, a loaf of Italian bread filled with a pound of bacon, peanut <b>butter,</b> <b>and</b> grape <b>jelly.</b> Books on Elvis Presley's favorite foods and culinary tastes, as well as other published reports on his taste for peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> banana sandwiches with or without bacon, have made the sandwich widely associated with Presley. It is often referred to using his name.|$|R
5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and {{they can also be}} dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> apple <b>jelly.</b> They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|R
2500|$|Peanut {{butter is}} {{served as a}} spread on bread, toast or crackers, and used to make {{sandwiches}} (notably the peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> sandwich). It is also used {{in a number of}} confections, such as peanut-flavoured granola bars or croissants and other pastries. A variety of other nut butters are also sold, such as cashew butter and almond butter, produced in comparable ways.|$|E
2500|$|Jelly can be {{made from}} sweet, savory or hot ingredients. It is made by a process similar to that used for making jam, with the {{additional}} step of filtering out the fruit pulp after the initial heating. A muslin or stockinette [...] "jelly bag" [...] is traditionally used as a filter, suspended by string over a bowl to allow the straining to occur gently under gravity. It is important not to attempt to force the straining process, for example by squeezing the mass of fruit in the muslin, or the clarity of the resulting jelly will be compromised. Jelly can {{come in a variety of}} flavors such as grape jelly, strawberry jelly, hot chile pepper, and others. It is typically eaten with a variety of foods. This includes jelly with toast, or a peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> sandwich.|$|E
2500|$|Food {{and luxury}} {{competitions}} {{have been a}} part of the series since it first premiered. In early seasons, the losers of the food competition would be placed on a peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> diet, and would not be permitted to eat any other foods. Beginning with Big Brother 7, the losers of the Have-Not competition were required to eat [...] "Big Brother Slop" [...] for food, sleep in the Have-Not bedroom, and take cold showers for the week. Slop has proven to be an issue for some HouseGuests; Hypoglycemic HouseGuest Amanda Hansen fainted and had a seizure after only a few days of being on the slop diet, while HouseGuest Allison Nichols had an allergic reaction to the slop (both of these cases occurred in Big Brother 9). Both women were medically evacuated from the house, though they returned the following morning. HouseGuests who choose to break the slop rule are punished by Big Brother. HouseGuest Jen Johnson from Big Brother 8 was the first HouseGuest to break the food restriction rules, and earned a penalty eviction vote for doing so; she was ultimately evicted that week. Audrey Middleton from Big Brother 17 and Matt Clines from Big Brother 19 also broke the rules and earned a penalty vote and ultimately evicted. HouseGuests Jeff Schroeder and Kevin Campbell of Big Brother 11 also broke the rules, to a lesser degree, and earned an extra day on the slop diet. The HouseGuests also frequently compete in luxury competitions during their time in the house. Most frequently, HouseGuests will compete for the right to watch a film or television show in the house. When competitions for films or television shows occur, an actor or actress from the series may enter the house to host the competition or speak with the HouseGuests. Actors such as Jeremy Piven, David Hasselhoff, and Neil Patrick Harris have all entered the house to participate in luxury competitions or rewards.|$|E

With no formal training in science or chemistry, he began experimenting with several distillates of the crude oil along with a chemist from eastern Pennsylvania. He developed a substance he named [...] "Rock Oil" [...] and later [...] "Seneca Oil". In 1848, he began packaging the substance as a patent medicine charging $0.50 per bottle.

5000|$|This is {{a series}} of cooking {{segments}} in which the comedians prepare foods, either traditional Japanese dishes like taiyaki, takoyaki, nabe and chawanmushi or foods like pizza, with unusual ingredients to use as fillings or flavors, which is eaten later and given a score ranging from two [...] "skull marks" [...] to ten stars. However, in recent episodes, the cast ignores the rating system more frequently, instead resorting to giving unpleasant dishes various numbers of [...] "ass hairs" [...] and [...] "pubic hairs". The results are usually disastrous and very distasteful. Endo is notorious for using Frisk, a brand of very strong breath mint, in his food. Yamazaki frequently uses junk food such as cheese puffs for rice, onigiri and sausages for taiyaki, hamburgers, hot dogs, fried chicken, fries and coke soda for nabe, peanut <b>butter</b> for takoyaki, <b>and</b> <b>jelly</b> beans for tempura. Matsumoto usually introduces very unusual (and occasionally inedible) ingredients such as a bear's paw for takikomi gohan, pig's and tuna's head for pizza, a dried cobra for nabe, a seal's testicle for takoyaki, and toothpaste for pasta. Hamada is notable for using corn bread and corn soup for Tempura, and thus {{was the only one who}} ever received the unprecedented Angel mark, although he received the [...] "Full Skeleton" [...] when he made the pasta-filled Chicken. If there was a food item that none of the cast members wanted to eat, chief director Heipo was forced to eat it, always resulting in him spitting the food out or expressing utter disgust except in the case of the individual bee larvae tempura.|$|R
