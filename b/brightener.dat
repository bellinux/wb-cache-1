25|$|Black {{light is}} used {{extensively}} in non-destructive testing. Fluorescing fluids {{are applied to}} metal structures and illuminated with a black light which allows cracks and other weaknesses in the material to be easily detected. It {{is also used to}} illuminate pictures painted with fluorescent colors, particularly on black velvet, which intensifies the illusion of self-illumination. The use of such materials, often in the form of tiles viewed in a sensory room under UV light, is common in the United Kingdom for the education of students with profound and multiple learning difficulties. Such fluorescence from certain textile fibers, especially those bearing optical <b>brightener</b> residues, can also be used for recreational effect, as seen, for example, in the opening credits of the James Bond film A View to a Kill. Black light puppetry is also performed in a black light theater.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescent {{compounds}} {{are often}} used to enhance the appearance of fabric and paper, causing a [...] "whitening" [...] effect. A white surface treated with an optical <b>brightener</b> can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the <b>brightener</b> compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white. Optical brighteners are used in laundry detergents, high brightness paper, cosmetics, high-visibility clothing and more.|$|E
6000|$|That is {{the name}} which the {{northern}} Indians give to the black-capped tit-mouse, or chickadee. [...] "Little friend Ch'geegee" [...] is what it means; for the Indians, like everybody else who knows Chickadee, are fond of this cheery little <b>brightener</b> of the northern woods. The first time I asked Simmo what his people called the bird, he answered with a smile. Since then I have asked other Indians, and always a smile, a pleased look lit up the dark grim faces as they told me. It is another tribute to the bright little bird's influence.|$|E

The stained organisms were fractionated by two procedures to determine which cellular constituents were reacting with the <b>brighteners.</b> Both fractionation procedures provided evidence that the <b>brighteners</b> were adsorbed to proteins within the cells.

Paper brightness is typically measured at 457 nm, well within the fluorescent activity range of <b>brighteners.</b> Paper used for banknotes does not contain optical <b>brighteners,</b> so a common method for detecting counterfeit notes is to check for fluorescence.|$|R

Older, non-commercial fluorescent chemicals include as umbelliferone, which absorbs in the UV {{portion of the}} spectrum and re-emit it in the blue portion of the visible spectrum.

5000|$|Brighteners can be [...] "boosted" [...] by the {{addition}} of certain polyols, such as high molecular weight polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl alcohol. These additives increase the visible blue light emissions significantly. Brighteners can also be [...] "quenched". Excess <b>brightener</b> will often cause a greening effect as emissions start to show above the blue region in the visible spectrum.|$|E

50|$|Coventya’s {{history is}} linked to Société Continentale Parker in Clichy (92, France). In 1927, four {{aviation}} pioneers: Louis Paulhan, Enea Bossi, Pierre Prier and Robert Deté created Société Continentale Parker {{on the basis of}} a license for Parkerisation from Parker Rust-Proof in Detroit (MI, USA). In 1930, Continentale Parker started its Plating activities based on a license agreement of Udylite also from Detroit. The first licensed product introduced into the market was an organic <b>brightener</b> for Cadmium plating.|$|E
50|$|Optical <b>brightener</b> {{is used to}} make paper appear whiter. Optical-brightening agents use {{fluorescence}} {{to absorb}} invisible radiation from the ultraviolet part of the light spectrum and re-emit the radiation as light in the visible blue range. The optical-brightening agent thus generates blue light that {{is added to the}} reflected light. The additional blue light offsets the yellowish tinge that would otherwise exist in the reflected light characteristics. It thus increases the brightness of the material (when the illumination includes ultraviolet radiation).|$|E
5000|$|Some {{materials}} {{can be made}} to look [...] "whiter than white", this is achieved using optical <b>brightener</b> agents (OBA). These are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm). OBAs are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white. This {{is due to the fact}} that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive.|$|E
40|$|A spectrofluorometric {{method was}} {{established}} {{and used to}} detect and quantify optical <b>brighteners</b> (OB) in ambient water samples. Optical <b>brighteners</b> are added to products such as laundry soaps, detergents, and cleaning agents {{for the purpose of}} making the fabric appear brighter after washing. Because a large fraction of OBs are discharged into wastewater, they are ideal for use as indicators of failing septic systems, sewage leaks, or lack of wastewater treatment. The method described here uses moderately priced equipment to provide rapid and accurate detection of minute levels of contamination. Standard curves were prepared with disodium diaminostilbene disulfonate solutions ranging in concentration from 0. 3 ppm to 70 ppm. Linear plots with R 2 values of ≥ 0. 987 were obtained for the standard curves, which were then used to determine the concentration of optical <b>brighteners</b> in water samples...|$|R
5000|$|... (E)-Stilbene {{itself is}} of little value, {{but it is a}} {{precursor}} to other derivatives used as dyes, optical <b>brighteners,</b> phosphors, and scintillators. Stilbene is one of the gain mediums used in dye lasers.|$|R
50|$|In general, laundry {{detergents}} contain water softeners, surfactants, bleach, enzymes, <b>brighteners,</b> fragrances, {{and many}} other agents. The formulation is strongly affected by {{the temperature of the}} cleaning water and varies from country to country.|$|R
