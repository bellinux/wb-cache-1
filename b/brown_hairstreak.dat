5000|$|... 23 {{species of}} {{butterflies}} have been recorded, including <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Thecla betulae), which requires scrub thickets and woodland edge habitats. The juniper colony supports {{several species of}} insects specific to this host plant. The snail fauna includes Abida secale, Helicella itala and Pomatias elegans.|$|E
50|$|The site's {{butterfly}} fauna in {{mentioned as}} in its citation sheet. Twenty-five species {{are known to}} breed, including colonies of silver-spotted skipper and Duke of Burgundy, together with comparatively large populations of <b>brown</b> argus, green <b>hairstreak,</b> chalkhill blue, marbled white and dingy skipper.|$|R
50|$|In {{the earlier}} {{half of the}} year (spring and summer), these are often popular sights: grizzled skipper, <b>brown</b> argus, purple <b>hairstreak,</b> eyebright, small scabious, kidney vetch, dingy, grayling, large thyme, {{marjoram}} autumn gentian and carline thistle. In the later {{half of the year}} (autumn and winter), purging buckthorns are popular.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{supports}} {{large numbers}} of fly, snail, spider and beetle species. Damselflies found here include the emerald, azure, large red, red-eyed, variable and common blue; together with dragonflies such as the southern and brown hawkers, emperor, hairy dragonfly and black-tailed skimmer. The Lepidoptera fauna is very rich also, especially the moths, with over 1000 species. The nationally rare reed leopard moth is common at the site. Other local moths include cream-bordered green pea, yellow-legged clearwing and emperor. China-mark moths such as the small, brown and ringed are also seen here. Local butterflies include the green <b>hairstreak,</b> <b>brown</b> argus, speckled wood and brimstone. There are a range of freshwater and land snails including the Red Data Book species Desmoulin's whorl snail.|$|R
50|$|Uncommon {{species of}} {{butterfly}} found include <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Thecla betulae), grayling (Hipparchia semele), grizzled skipper (Pyrgus malvae), {{high brown fritillary}} (Argynnis cydippe) and marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia). The coastline of the SSSI supported {{one of the last}} known British colonies of breeding large blue butterfly (Maculinea arion), which was declared nationally extinct in 1979. Thereafter, from 1983 the butterfly was reintroduced to the country, including at locations on this site.|$|E
50|$|Langford Heathfield {{comprises}} {{a variety}} of semi-natural habitats which includes neutral marshy grassland and ancient woodland. An outstanding assemblage of 26 different species of resident breeding butterflies have been recorded. Of these marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurina), high brown fritillary (Argynnis cydippe), wood white (Leptidea sinapis) and <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Thecla betulae) all have a local distribution in Somerset. Other invertebrates of interest include the very local beetles: Mordellistena abdominalis and Ischnomera caerulea, and hornet (Vespa crabro).|$|E
50|$|Four {{species of}} {{fritillary}} butterfly - marsh (Eurodryas aurinia), small pearl-bordered (Boloria selene), dark green (Argynnis aglaja), and silver-washed (Argynnis paphia) - have been noted. The marsh and small pearl-bordered fritillaries {{occur in the}} wet pastures, whilst the dark green is found on the drier bracken slopes and the silver-washed in the tree canopy. All have declined nationally and are local species, now principally of south-western Britain. Rare and also present is the <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Thecla betulae), while the small copper (Lycaena phlaeas) and green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi) are notably abundant.|$|E
50|$|The Hall is {{situated}} within Allestree Park - at 129 hectares, {{this is the}} largest public open space in Derby, and has been owned by Derby City Council since 1947 when, as Derby Corporation, it purchased the estate and hall. Allestree Park is heavily wooded and contains veteran trees, large areas of grassland, open water, marshland and hedgerows - all habitats contributing to the Lowland Derbyshire Biodiversity Action Plan. In 2002, 87.83 hectares of Allestree Park was designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR), and is the largest in Derbyshire. Species of particular biodiversity interest include harvest mouse; <b>brown</b> hare; white-letter <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly; English elm; adder's tongue fern and moonwort The LNR is managed by the Allestree Park LNR Management Advisory Group, which is a partnership between the City Council, the Friends of Allestree Park, and The Conservation Volunteers.|$|R
50|$|Males {{are highly}} {{territorial}} on cedar trees, where they perch {{in search of}} females. Often, males can be set in flight by gently shaking the trees. Females lay their eggs singly {{at the tip of}} host plant leaves. The eggs are pale green with white ridges. The larvae are vivid green with a faint middorsal stripe that begins at the thorax and runs down the abdomen. Whitish-yellow spots occur {{on either side of the}} middorsal stripe. A whitish-yellow subspiracular stripe (sometimes broken between segments) runs the length of the body. The chrysalis of the gryneus race is brown to pale brown and is mottled with black with the abdomen being a bit reddish. Chrysalids of western races are dark <b>brown.</b> The juniper <b>hairstreak</b> overwinters as a chrysalis. The gryneus race has two broods per year; sweadneri, two broods per year; siva, two or three broods per year; nelsoni, one brood; muiri, one brood; loki, one or two broods; and the thornei race has one brood per year.|$|R
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green <b>hairstreak,</b> <b>brown</b> argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|R
50|$|Grendon Underwood once bordered Bernwood Forest, {{the nearest}} {{remnants}} {{of which are}} now Grendon and Doddershall Woods, which are detached from the village itself by approx 500 metres. Both woods are now silvicultural and classified as ancient forest and are sites of special scientific interest (SSSI's). This offers protected status {{to some of the}} endangered species of animals residing therein such as Bechstein's bats, and nightingales. There are also 35 species of butterflies such as purple emperor, <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak,</b> black hairstreak, wood white, the silver washed fritillary, high brown fritillary, marsh fritillary, pearl-bordered fritillary and small pearly-bordered fritillary.|$|E
50|$|The plain is an {{important}} stronghold for declining downland butterflies. A high concentration of colonies of three nationally scarce species, the Adonis blue (Polyommatus bellargus), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and the largest population of marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) on the chalk, occur. A colony of <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Thecla betulae) is present on East Salisbury Plain at one of its two Wiltshire localities. Strong populations of other downland species such as chalkhill blue (Polyommatus coridon) and dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja) are found, and of note here is the occurrence of grayling (Hipparchia semele), a butterfly rarely found away from the coast.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the more}} than 30 species of {{butterflies}} and moths found in Ireland only two are not present in The Burren. Notable insects present in The Burren include the butterflies the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis); the moths, the Burren green (Calamia tridens, which is only present in Ireland in this area), Irish annulet (Gnophos dumetata) and transparent burnet (Zygaena purpuralis); the hoverfly Doros profuges and the water-beetle Ochthebius nilssoni. This last species is known from just five sites in the world, its type locality in northern Sweden and four marl lakes in The Burren.|$|E
5000|$|Blakehill Farm, {{partly in}} Purton parish, {{is the former}} RAF Blakehill Farm {{airfield}} from the Second World War. Its grasslands are habitat for mammals including roe deer and brown hare, birds including kestrel, skylark, wheatear, whinchat and stonechat and butterflies include small copper and <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak.</b> The trust bought the site from the Ministry of Defence to form a large meadow of about 600 acre, and opened {{it to the public}} in 2005. It rears a small quantity of organic grade beef, usually rare breeds such as longhorn cattle. These cattle ensure grasses and other common plants do not begin to dominate over the other rarer plants[...]|$|E
50|$|Grafton Wood is {{the centre}} of the only colony of the <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> {{butterflies}} in the Midlands. Laight Rough is also important for other butterflies such as white admiral, white-letter hairstreak and the silver-washed fritillary. In 2009 the Bat Conservation Trust launched a detail study of 10 counties in England to determine the range of the Bechstein's bat and in 2010 a lactating female Bechstein's was discovered in Grafton Wood suggesting that there was a breeding colony in the wood or close by. The People's Trust for Endangered Species are funding further research work. In October 2014 it was reported that the scarce Brandt's bat has also been found at the 300-year-old woodland.|$|E
50|$|The island {{supports}} arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side by side, due to {{the unusual}} environment. Like the Burren, the Aran islands {{are known for their}} unusual assemblage of plants and animals.The grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, thus supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found. But when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with plants like the gentian and orchids.Insects present include the butterfly the pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Thecla betulae), marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and wood white (Leptidea sinapis); the moths, the burren green (Calamia tridens), Irish annulet (Gnophos dumetata) and transparent burnet (Zygaena purpuralis); and the hoverfly Doros profuges.|$|E
40|$|Synchronisation of the {{phenology}} {{of insect}} herbivores and their larval food plant {{is essential for}} the herbivores’ fitness. The monophagous <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> (Thecla betulae) lays its eggs during summer, hibernates as an egg, and hatches in April or May in the Netherlands. Its main larval food plant blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) flowers in early spring, just before the leaves appear. As soon as the Blackthorn opens its buds, and this varies with spring temperatures, food becomes available for the <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak.</b> However, the suitability of the leaves as food for the young caterpillars is expected to decrease rapidly. Therefore, the timing of egg hatch is an important factor for larval growth. This study evaluates food availability for <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> at different temperatures. Egg hatch and budburst were monitored from 2004 to 2008 at different sites in the Netherlands. Results showed ample food availability at all monitored temperatures and sites but the degree of synchrony varied strongly with spring temperatures. To further study the effect of temperature on synchronisation, an experiment using normal temperatures of a reference year (T) and temperatures of T + 5 °C was carried out in climate chambers. At T + 5 °C, both budburst and egg hatch took place about 20 days earlier and thus, on average, elevated temperature did not affect synchrony. However, the total period of budburst was 11 days longer, whereas the period of egg hatching was 3 days shorter. The implications for larval growth by the <b>brown</b> <b>hairstreak</b> under a warmer climate are considered. ...|$|E
