This meant that Patel's evidence would significantly undermine the evidence of the second and third pathologists.|$|E

25|$|Positioned behind home plate, {{the catcher}} {{can see the}} whole field, and is {{therefore}} in the <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> direct and lead the other players in a defensive play. The catcher typically calls for pitches using hand signals. The calls {{are based on the}} pitcher's mechanics and strengths, as well as the batter's tendencies and weaknesses. Foul tips, bouncing balls in the dirt, and contact with runners during plays at the plate are all events to be handled by the catcher, necessitating the use of protective equipment. This includes a mask, chest and throat protectors, shin guards, and a heavily padded catcher's mitt.|$|E

A 3–0 loss to Turkey in Istanbul then completed their friendly matches cycle before qualifying resumed. However, the Sinisärgid won away from home to Slovenia and at home to Northern Ireland, which lifted the team to 58th in the FIFA rankings, giving them their <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> date.

25|$|The shootings {{took place}} {{in an area that}} is {{strongly}} republican with a notable IRA tradition and presence; accordingly, the locals were suspicious of strangers or unusual activity. Moreover, the lack of roadblocks following the emergency call which had allowed the gunmen to flee in the getaway car through winding country backroads that were difficult to access and exit if one was not familiar with them led journalist Peter Taylor to allege that the UVF unit probably received help from the security forces. Taylor suggested that the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was the authority in the <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> have known the exact movements of the IRA volunteers and to have passed-on the relevant information to the UVF hit squad.

25|$|On {{the night}} of 4 October morale was low amongst the monarchical troops {{stationed}} in Rossio Square, due to the constant danger of being bombarded by the naval forces and not even the Couceiro's batteries, strategically placed there, could bring them comfort. In the headquarters there were discussions about the <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> bomb the Rotunda. At 3am, Paiva Couceiro departed with a mobile battery, escorted by a municipal guard squad, and positioned himself in Castro Guimarães Garden, in Torel, waiting for daybreak. When the forces in Rotunda began to shoot on Rossio, revealing their position, Paiva Couceiro opened fire, causing casualties and sowing confusion amongst the rebels. The bombardment continued with advantage towards the monarchical side, but at eight in the morning Paiva Couceiro received orders to stop fighting, as {{there would be an}} armistice of an hour.|$|E
25|$|Among all {{counseling}} specialty areas, public elementary, {{middle and}} high school counselors are (2009) paid the highest salary on average of all counselors. Budget cuts, however, have affected placement of public school counselors in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by school counselors in public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models. With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation in the USA and a mandate for school counselors to be working with data and showing evidence-based practice, school counselors able to show and share results in assisting to close gaps are in the <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> argue for increased school counseling resources and positions for their programs (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).|$|E

40|$|China's {{spectacular}} {{economic growth}} has been spatially uneven, with much development occurring in eastern coastal areas. In particular, three metropolitan ‘super-regions’ have become China's most competitive knowledge-based economies, consisting of the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Bohai Gulf Region. This paper benchmarks the competitiveness of these regions, {{with a view to}} exploring which region is <b>best</b> <b>positioned</b> <b>to</b> become the most dominant knowledge-based economy over time. Through the theoretical lens of dynamic comparative advantage, it is shown that each region has hugely increased its competitiveness through improvements in the capacity to absorb and diffuse knowledge.

2500|$|Being [...] "out of his ground" [...] {{is defined}} as not having {{any part of the}} batsman's body or his bat {{touching}} the ground behind the crease – i.e., if his bat is slightly elevated from the floor despite being behind the crease, or if his foot is on the crease line itself but not completely across it and touching the ground behind it, then he would be considered out (if stumped). One of the fielding team (such as the wicket-keeper himself) must appeal for the wicket by asking the umpire.

2500|$|The rack, {{like other}} {{intermediate}} gaits, is smoother than the trot because the hooves hitting the ground individually rather in pairs minimizes {{the force and}} bounce the horse transmits to the rider. [...] To achieve this gait the horse must be in a [...] "hollow position". This means that, instead of a rounded back as seen in dressage horses and others that work off their hind quarters, the spine is curved somewhat downward. [...] This puts the racking horse in the <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> rack without breaking into another gait. If the rider sits back or leans slightly back, this will encourage the hollow position. This allows the hind legs to trail and makes the rack easier for the horse. [...] The downside {{of this is that}} this position weakens the back and makes the horse less able to carry the weight of the rider without strain.|$|E
2500|$|Innovation in the {{construction}} business also included a definite commitment to finish the building on time. Hitherto the financial risk of delays were assumed by the clients. Kreuger & Toll was the first firm in Europe to commit to finish projects by a fixed date, thus shifting the risk to the builder, who after all was in the <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> reduce delays.

[...] It is noteworthy that Kreuger & Toll's entire capital would have covered just two days of being late. The client, in turn, agreed to pay a bonus for every day the building was finished before the due date. Kreuger & Toll finished early and subsequently earned completion bonuses for every project.

2500|$|On 4 February 1937 Göring invited Raeder to {{a private}} conference which the later accepted. At the meeting, held on 11 March, Raeder handed Göring a {{detailed}} memorandum asking for naval aviation to be seconded, permanently, to the navy {{as it was in}} the <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> understand naval requirements. The results of the conference and conflict were summed up by the Defence Ministry. The supreme commander Werner von Blomberg ordered that aviation units in support of naval operations was the domain of the Luftwaffe but under Kriegsmarine control. It did not resolve the question of which service should be responsible for aerial operations at sea. After the naval staff complained again at the absence of a resolution on 10 March a new conference was organised with Albert Kesselring, Chief of the General Staff, and Göring on 1 April and 10 May with the same result. Göring attacked Blomberg's and Raeder's views and thus decided that air units should only be put at the disposal of the navy during specific operations. Perhaps exasperated and defeated, Raeder noted on 20 May 1937, [...] "Commander in Chief, Navy has decided that the demand of command by the Navy over all Naval Air units shall not be voiced." [...] Raeder noted that Göring did not accept that the navy should have control of air units, and likely never would.|$|E

Knowing the {{difficulty}} Sherman {{would have to}} supply himself from Memphis, I had previously ordered supplies sent from St. Louis on small steamers, to be convoyed by the navy, {{to meet him at}} Eastport.

This order was borne to Sherman by a messenger, who paddled down the Tennessee in a canoe and floated over Muscle Shoals; it was delivered at Iuka on the 27th. In this Sherman was notified that the rebels were moving a force towards Cleveland, East Tennessee, and might be going to Nashville, in which event his troops were in the <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> beat them there.
