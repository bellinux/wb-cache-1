5|$|The Irish Republican Army, that {{controlled}} {{much of the}} southern part of the country during the Irish civil war, issued a 1d, 2d and 6d label, mainly because of a stamp shortage. These were printed in Cork and were to be put on sale in August 1922, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the Irish Free State army landed near Cork and the IRA set fire to their own barracks before they retreated from Cork, destroying most of the labels.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders {{would follow}} {{in due course}} <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> General Sir Douglas Haig, the {{commander}} of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), called for diversionary actions {{to attract the attention of}} the German High Command away from the Allied preparations for the forthcoming offensive on the Somme. To achieve this, the New Zealanders mounted several trench raids. By the time the New Zealand Division was relieved in August, it had incurred 2,500 casualties, including 375 dead.|$|E
5|$|The ceasefire of 2004 brought {{relative}} peace, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> {{the sinking}} of the Joola in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along with the threat of coastal erosion on the island, some fear the worst. Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey {{submitted}} to John in 1206, and his lands {{were returned to}} him. But in 1207 Geoffrey led the clergy of England in their refusal to pay royal taxation and was forced into exile. Geoffrey excommunicated anyone who attempted to collect the tax in his archdiocese, but the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates in retaliation. Geoffrey once again secured the support of Pope Innocent, who ordered John to restore Geoffrey's possessions, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the archbishop had fled to France. A medieval chronicler, Geoffrey of Coldingham, stated that the English church considered Geoffrey a martyr because of this stand against King John.|$|E
5|$|The Normandy {{landings}} {{took place}} beginning 6 June 1944. 21st Panzer Division under Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger, positioned south of Caen, {{was the only}} panzer division close to the beaches. The division included 146 tanks and 50 assault guns, plus supporting infantry and artillery. At 02:00, Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter, commander of the 716th Static Infantry Division, ordered 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division {{was part of the}} armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation. Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne. SS-Hitlerjugend began to deploy in the afternoon of 6 June, with its units undertaking defensive actions the following day. They also took part in the Battle for Caen (June–August 1944). On 7–8 and 17 June, members of the SS-Hitlerjugend shot and killed twenty Canadian prisoners of war in the Ardenne Abbey massacre.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Marine Corps, {{which had}} been {{drastically}} reduced in size after World War II, was unprepared {{at the outset of}} the Korean War on 25 June 1950. The Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered the Marine Corps to ready a 15,000-man division for duty in Korea as a part of the United Nations Command being created there. The Marine Corps began rebuilding the 1st Marine Division to wartime strength, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> assembled a 4,725-man force around the 5th Marine Regiment to assist in the war effort as quickly as possible. On 7 July the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was reactivated in California. One week later it sailed from Long Beach and San Diego. The regiment, which had originally been slated for landing in Japan, bypassed that country and landed at Pusan in South Korea on 3 August. As it sailed to Korea, it was put under the command of Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, who met the brigade in-country. The brigade was supported by Marine Aircraft Group 33, and became a subordinate unit of the Eighth United States Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker, who placed it in his reserve.|$|E

60|$|Dominick was not boastful or ungenerous. He did not crow {{over his}} fallen foe. On the contrary, {{he offered to}} assist that smitten scorner to rise, <b>but</b> Malines {{preferred}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> to lie still.|$|R
50|$|By November of that year, {{the small}} group was able to {{establish}} their own home <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, where they began again to establish the project, setting up a workshop whereby they could earn their living and providing a gathering place for their collaborators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mission. They were desperately poor, <b>but</b> persevered. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> they received frequent communications from Butinyà, who encouraged them in their perseverance.|$|R
5|$|The first Allied {{action of}} D-Day was Operation Deadstick, a glider assault at 00:16 at Pegasus Bridge over the Caen Canal and the bridge (since renamed Horsa Bridge) over the Orne, {{half a mile}} (800 metres) to the east. Both bridges were quickly {{captured}} intact, with light casualties, {{by members of the}} 5th Parachute Brigade and the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion. The five bridges over the Dives were destroyed with minimal difficulty by the 3rd Parachute Brigade. Meanwhile, the pathfinders tasked with setting up radar beacons and lights for further paratroopers (scheduled to begin arriving at 00:50 to clear the landing zone north of Ranville) were blown off course, and had to set up the navigation aids too far east. Many paratroopers, also blown too far east, landed far from their intended drop zones; some took hours or even days to be reunited with their units. Major General Richard Gale arrived in the third wave of gliders at 03:30, along with equipment, such as antitank guns and jeeps, and more troops to help secure the area from counter-attacks, which were initially staged only by troops in the immediate vicinity of the landings. At 02:00, the commander of the German 716th Infantry Division ordered Feuchtinger to move his 21st Panzer Division into position to counter-attack. However, as the division was part of the armoured reserve, Feuchtinger was obliged to seek clearance from OKW before he could commit his formation. Feuchtinger did not receive orders until nearly 09:00, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> on his own initiative he put together a battle group (including tanks) to fight the British forces east of the Orne.|$|E

25|$|This, as well {{as other}} strong performances, led to him being awarded a new {{contract}} which will keep him at Derbyshire for a further two years. He has completed his residency period and is looking to qualify as an English player, following a similar path to that of Kevin Pietersen, for example, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> plays as a Kolpak player.|$|E

50|$|Mu'in ad-Din {{signed a}} new {{peace treaty with}} Jerusalem for their mutual {{protection}} against Zengi. While Mu'in ad-Din and the crusaders joined together to besiege Banias, Zengi once more laid siege to Damascus, but quickly abandoned it again. There were no major engagements between the crusaders, Damascus, and Zengi {{for the next few}} years, <b>but</b> Zengi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> campaigned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north and captured Ashib and the Armenian fortress of Hizan.|$|R
25|$|Subang Airport {{underwent}} a RM40 million facelift on the check-in terminals. The facelift did nothing much {{to address the}} lack of parking spots, although a valet service is provided. Parking cost RM25 on daily basis. A rail link is being constructed to connect {{to the airport to}} Kuala Lumpur via KTM Komuter <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime,</b> travellers can catch a local bus out of Central Market bus hub.|$|E
25|$|The {{first test}} of the new treaty {{involved}} Honduras. In 1908 opponents of President Dávila, probably supported by Guatemala and El Salvador, invaded the country. Nicaragua supported the Honduran president, and war seemed imminent. Perhaps motivated {{by the possibility of}} United States intervention, however, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to the new Central American court. The court ultimately rejected the Honduran and Nicaraguan complaints, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the revolt collapsed, thus briefly restoring peace to Honduras.|$|E
25|$|That November, Fisher sat his lieutenant's {{examination}} and passed with flying colours. He received top grades in seamanship and gunnery, and {{achieved the highest score}} ever — 963/1000 — for navigation. For this, {{he was awarded}} the Beaufort Testimonial, an annual prize of books and instruments; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> he had to wait around, unpaid, until his appointment came through officially. He {{was one of the last}} Royal Navy officers to receive basic training entirely at sea.|$|E
50|$|The Elector of Brandenburg {{manages to}} have Kohlhaas released, <b>but</b> since <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> Saxony has {{informed}} <b>the</b> Kaiser <b>in</b> Vienna, <b>the</b> ruling families <b>in</b> Berlin feel this {{threat to the}} authority of the aristocracy must be handled with severity. In spite of surprising efforts of the Elector of Brandenburg to save Kohlhaas, he is sentenced to death. Later it turns out that Kohlhaas has on his person papers that contain important information about the House of Saxony.|$|R
60|$|He made {{an excuse}} for leaving, but Cliffe, noticing his interest, was not satisfied, {{and went out to}} the landing with him. Gomez, however, did not go {{straight}} to the lounge. He was afraid of rousing Cliffe's curiosity, and men of his stamp are seldom direct in their methods. It seemed wiser to spend a while sauntering about the patio, where Cliffe could see him. <b>But</b> Grahame <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> came up <b>the</b> stairs, and Cliffe beckoned him.|$|R

25|$|The {{provision}} {{of water for}} the attacking force was the most difficult, but most vital element in the preparation for the attack on El Arish as from Mazar to El Arish there was no water and the Turkish defences at El Arish covered all the water in that area. So operations {{had to wait until}} the middle of December when the pipe–line had advanced sufficiently for water to be stored at Maadan (kilo. 128) and for the concentration of camels and drivers of the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, large enough to carry the water forward in support the attack force. Preparations were not complete until 20 December, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the enemy had abandoned the town.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} F1 T51 was {{the first}} Cooper powered by the 2.5-litre 4-cylinder engine which Cooper and Lotus had commissioned Coventry Climax to build specifically for their rear-engined machines. The pioneering nature of this configuration created problems of its own, since there were so few rear-engined production cars from which a gearbox could be sourced. This shortage eventually created a niche in the market which {{paved the way for}} Hewland's prominence, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> many different solutions were tried, with varying degrees of success. The works Coopers were fitted with modified Citroen gearboxes, while Rob Walker's team ran bespoke units from Italian specialist Valerio Colotti, although these proved much more fragile.|$|E
25|$|Fourteen 737-200s {{had been}} {{delivered}} by 1981. Some were leased to other carries, including Guyana Airways, Malaysia Airlines and Tunisair. Others were used charter services, mostly to Danish inclusive tour operators. From 1983 three aircraft were entirely dedicated to this task. This {{was a highly}} competitive market, where Maersk had to compete with Conair, Sterling and Scanair, amongst others. The 737-200s proved too large for domestic services. The F27s had been sold and the airline therefore determined that it needed to procure new turoprops. A {{decision was made to}} buy the de Havilland Dash 7, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the airline leased three HS748s from 1980 to 1981. The first Dash 7 entered revenue service on 13 May 1981.|$|E
50|$|Indeed, at Pórtugos some Moorish {{leaders had}} {{attempted}} to negotiate surrender terms with Mondéjar, who replied that he would intercede with King Philip, <b>but</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> <b>the</b> punishment of rebels must continue. If he did report to the King, this did him no good as it reinforced charges against him of undue clemency. <b>In</b> fact, <b>the</b> Christian campaign was compromised by a long-standing enmity between the two commanders, and this was fomented by <b>the</b> Chancery <b>in</b> Granada, which on several occasions sent complaints about Mondéjar to King Philip.|$|R

50|$|After {{completion}} of his schooling, Ritter {{was introduced to}} Bethmann Hollweg, a banker in Frankfurt. It was arranged that Ritter should become tutor to Hollweg's children, <b>but</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> he should attend the University of Halle at his patron's expense. His duties as tutor began in 1798 and continued for fifteen years. The years 1814-1819, which he spent at Göttingen in order still to watch over his pupils, were those in which he began to exclusively study geography. It was there that he courted and married Lilli Kramer, from Duderstadt and that he wrote and published the first two volumes of his Erdkunde.|$|R
25|$|The Spanish royal Council of State sent to King Philip IV on March 7, 1625 {{a report}} on the {{appointment}} of a governor for the Philippines to replace Alonso Fajardo y Tenza. In 1623 Fajardo had sought permission to return to Spain, asking for a better office as a reward for his services and those of his father and other ancestors. Before he could leave the Philippines, he died (July 1624). The Council's report listed eleven candidates, with the merits and services of each and the number of votes each received in the Council. The report was submitted directly to the king, for him to make his choice. Juan Niño de Tabora received the appointment, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> the death of Fajardo necessitated the appointment of an interim governor. This was Fernándo de Silva.|$|E
25|$|David II's new co-regents sent a {{plea for}} help to Philip VI, who in November 1334 advised Edward III that he was sending an {{ambassador}} to England to discuss the matter. Accordingly, when Edward III returned from Roxburgh in February 1335, it was to find the Bishop of Avranches waiting, demanding to know why Edward III was acting against David II and David's queen, Edward's own sister Joan. Edward III deferred his answer, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> agreed to allow the ambassadors to try to negotiate peace between England and Scotland. As serious as the French ambassadors may have been at their task, {{they were unable to}} make headway with the co-regents of David II, who were at this time divided by their own disagreements about governance. What they did do, unwitting as they may have been, was allow time for the English to restore their finances.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Muskegon also berths the S.S. Milwaukee Clipper, {{a former}} car ferry that {{traveled}} {{the same route}} as Lake Express does today. The ship (which is a National Historic Landmark) {{is in the middle}} of a long process of being restored to its original form, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime</b> is open for tours and hosts a museum aboard the vessel with information on both the Milwaukee Clipper, as well as the history of maritime in Muskegon. Muskegon is an historical port for commerce and lake travel. The lumbering era through World War II was its busiest historical use. Its image as a port the city has embraced with the local nickname 'The Port City'. It possesses a fine deep-water port and still functions delivering bulk cement, aggregate, and large cargoes to several lakeshore facilities, also coal to the B.C. Cobb power plant, an outdated coal-burning facility due to shut down.|$|E
60|$|Andrew, {{knowing his}} man, was {{satisfied}} with this. He and Whitney drove home at full speed, and arrived before their absence had been noticed.
