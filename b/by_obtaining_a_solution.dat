40|$|An inverse {{formulation}} {{is developed}} for solving three-dimensional potential fluid flows which considers the magnitudes of the cartesian coordinates x, y, and z {{as the dependent}} variables in the space defined by the potential function and two mutually orthogonal stream surface functions whose intersection defines the physical space streamlines. This formulation reverses the usual role of the variables. In this inverse space irregular boundaries, with unknown position in the physical space, such as free surfaces become plane boundaries, and the space of most potential flow problems is a parallelepiped. The basin partial differential equations resulting from this formulation are nonlinear and three in number. Finite difference methods are developed for solving the space boundary value problems simultaneously, which are associated with these three equations. The applicability of the inverse formulation and the numerical solution is demonstrated <b>by</b> <b>obtaining</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> to the three-dimensional, free surface flow past a vertical strut which extends through the fluid surface and is placed between channel walls...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} user needs, traditionally only current users of a productare examined. Classical research on problem solving shows, however, that current users are strongly constrained by their real-world experience, an effect called functional fixedness. Von Hippel’s lead user method takes a totally different approach as it {{is not based on}} current users but lead users. Lead users face needs that will be general in a marketplace –but face them months or years before the bulk of that marketplace encounters them, and they are positioned to benefit significantly <b>by</b> <b>obtaining</b> <b>a</b> <b>solution</b> to those needs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if disabled persons could be seen as lead users in mobile user interface design. Another goal was to evaluate the suitability of the selected research methods on the examined user groups. An able-bodied user may suffer from a “situational disability” caused by the environment. In this study the user needs of disabled and “situationally disabled” users were compared. The examined user groups were deaf, blind, and “ordinary” users, who see and hear well. The methods used were photo diary based on a theme, and contextual inquiry combined with an open-ended discussion. The “ordinary” users were examined in situational disability conditions, and disabled users in their ordinary environment, such as home. This research shows that “ordinary” users do face difficulties when using their mobile phones in special situations, i. e. they in fact are situationally disabled. The user needs partially overlap with the needs of disabled users in ordinary situations. Both visually and hearing impaired participants showed innovative and leading edge behaviour. It was concludedthat there is a strong indication that disabled persons could be seen as lead users. Photo diary was found to be an effective and easy method for self-documentation – also when studying blind users. No other equipment is needed for documentation, as long as the photos are later reviewed in a separate discussion. No major difficulties occurredin carrying out the contextual inquiry and open-ended discussion. All applied methods were found suitable for all examined user groups. It was recommended that disabled users would be included in mobile user interface design...|$|E

40|$|We {{suggest a}} better {{mathematical}} method, fractional calculus, {{for studying the}} behavior of the atom-field interaction in photonic crystals. By studying the spontaneous emission of an atom in a photonic crystal with one-band isotropic model, we found that the long-time inducing memory of the spontaneous emission is a fractional phenomenon. This behavior could be well described by the fractional calculus. And the results show no steady photon-atom bound state for the atomic resonant transition frequency lying in the proximity of allowed band edge which is encountered in the previous study [J. Opt.

40|$|Although quantum {{computers}} {{have the potential}} to efficiently solve certain problems considered difficult by known classical approaches, the design of a quantum circuit remains computationally difficult. It is known that the optimal gate design problem is equivalent to the <b>solution</b> of <b>an</b> associated optimal control problem, the solution to which is also computationally intensive. Hence, in this article, we introduce the application of a class of numerical methods (termed the max-plus curse of dimensionality free techniques) that determine the optimal control thereby synthesizing the desired unitary gate. The application of this technique to quantum systems has a growth in complexity that depends on the cardinality of the control set approximation rather than the much larger growth with respect to spatial dimensions in approaches based on gridding of the space, used in previous literature.
