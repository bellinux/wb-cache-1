The background research proved to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that the expedition team located the shipwreck site on the very first day of searching. They then recovered enough artifacts to identify the wreck positively and to mount an exhibit in the Marine Museum in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Bader's {{aggressive}} energy found a {{new lease}} of life at St Edward's School, where he received his secondary education. During his time there, he thrived at sports. Bader played rugby and often enjoyed physical battles with bigger and older opponents. The then Warden (or Headmaster), Henry E. Kendall, tolerated Bader's aggressive and competitive nature. At one point, he made him a prefect despite what others saw as a strong streak of conceit in the boy. Fellow RAF night fighter and bomber pilots Guy Gibson and Adrian Warburton also attended the school. In later life, Bader was deemed to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that {{he was invited to}} play a trial (or friendly game) with the Harlequins, {{but it is not clear}} whether he actually played.|$|E

500|$|The teenage Leno's growing {{popularity}} led to bookings at, among others, the Varieties Theatre in Sheffield and the Star Music Hall in Manchester. At the same time, Leno's clog dancing continued to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that in 1880 {{he won the}} world championship at the Princess's Music Hall in Leeds, for which he received a gold and silver belt weighing 44.5 oz (1.26kg). His biographer, the pantomime librettist J. Hickory Wood, described his act: [...] "He danced on the stage; he danced on a pedestal; he danced on a slab of slate; he was encored over and over again; but throughout his performance, he never uttered a word".|$|E
500|$|For his dance, Park {{highlights}} Art of Movement, Skill Methods, and Massive Monkees as b-boy crews {{that influence}} him. He also cites Andrew Baterina from SoReal Cru; Movement Lifestyle's members Keone Madrid, Lyle Beniga, and Shaun Evaristo; Ian Eastwood; and Twitch. Park is also inspired by Taiwanese-American NBA player Jeremy Lin, saying that Lin [...] "was off the radar and now he’s {{playing with the}} best of the best. People can’t hate on him even though they want to because he’s so good. That’s how a K-pop star has to be over in America if they want to succeed. They have to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> in every single way that even if people hate, they can’t really say anything".|$|E
500|$|Hill {{has been}} {{credited}} with bringing many women into rock climbing. The 1980s saw a large influx of women into the sport, in part because more women were visible in it {{and in part because}} Title IX funding mandated equal access for boys and girls to athletic programs in public schools. In answer to a question about her position as a role model for women climbers, Hill responded that she felt [...] "responsible to communicate something that touches people, that inspires them, that gives them a sense of passion". Climber John Long explains that Hill [...] "was a prodigy and everyone knew as much... Twenty years ago, no female had ever climbed remotely as well as the best guys, so when Lynn began dusting us off—which she did with maddening frequency—folks offered up all kinds of fatuous explanations. Some diehards refused to believe a woman, and a five-foot article at that, could possibly <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> Out at Josh, it was said Lynn shone owing to quartz monzonite's superior friction, which catered to her bantam weight. In Yosemite, her success apparently hinged on midget hands, which fit wonderfully into the infernal thin cracks. On limestone, she could plug three fingers into pockets where the rest of us managed two. In the desert Southwest, she enjoyed an alliance with coyotes—or maybe shape-shifters. Even after a heap of World Cup victories, it still took the climbing world an age to accept Lynn as the Chosen One, and perhaps her legacy was never established, once and for all, till she free climbed the Nose." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Foster's {{most memorable}} bass lines {{was in the}} theme tune to the late-70s UK TV show [...] "Minder" [...] {{starring}} Dennis Waterman. The tune, [...] "I Can <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good</b> For You" [...] started out life as a track on Waterman's solo album, it was then re-jigged as the show's theme tune. Mo achieved the atypical bass sound by using an unusual bass slap technique on an aluminium Kramer 650B bass guitar.|$|E

2500|$|At 8:23 pm (20:23) local time, the Italian Conference of Bishops {{released}} a statement congratulating Cardinal Angelo Scola of Milan on his election as pope. A corrected statement was {{released a}}t 9:09 pm (21:09). As cardinals described the voting process, carefully suppressing details {{so as not to}} violate their oath of secrecy, one offered this assessment, that [...] "Scola might have won" [...] and [...] "is obviously qualified to be pope", but there was [...] "a very strong bias against the Italians." [...] He added: [...] "There was a sense that the Italians aren't up to the job anymore. They used to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> but lately they seem to have lost control of things." ...|$|E

We must finish with the Serbs, quickly. Now or never!". In response, Tschirschky told the Austro-Hungarian government that same day that [...] "Germany would support the Monarchy through thick and thin, whatever action it decided to take against Serbia. The sooner Austria-Hungary struck, the better". On 5 July 1914, Count Moltke, the Chief of the German General Staff, wrote that [...] "Austria must beat the Serbs".|$|E

2500|$|The {{irony of}} the phrase and its {{aftermath}} lies in Greenspan's widely held reputation as the most artful practitioner of Fedspeak, often known as Greenspeak, in the modern televised era. [...] The speech coincided {{with the rise of}} dedicated financial TV channels around the world that would broadcast his comments live, such as CNBC. [...] Greenspan's idea was to obfuscate the Fed Chairman's true opinion in long complex sentences with obscure words so as to intentionally mute any strong market response. Precisely because he was considered to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> at this, an uncharacteristically clear statement such as [...] "irrational exuberance" [...] was viewed as a strong signal to the markets and its meaning was widely discussed by financial journalists {{at the time of the}} speech. [...] The further irony was that if it was indeed his intended purpose to [...] "talk markets down" [...] he was later ignored as stock valuations three years later dwarfed the levels at the time of the speech. [...] This phrase is arguably the most famous example of Greenspeak, albeit perhaps an atypical one.|$|E
2500|$|The theme tune, [...] "I Could <b>Be</b> <b>So</b> <b>Good</b> for You", was {{released}} on 13 October 1980 and originally written in 1979 by Gerard Kenny and Patricia Waterman and sung by Dennis Waterman, the official credits of Kenny/Waterman often lead people to mis-credit Dennis as co-writer. The record reached No.3 in the UK charts in November 1980 and led Waterman to tour as a singer. Dennis Waterman also sang the theme songs to other programmes he starred in, including On the Up, Stay Lucky, and New Tricks, and {{this led to a}} parody in Little Britain where Dennis Waterman is offered acting work; he always assumes he will also [...] "write the theme tune, sing the theme tune...". Dennis Waterman surprised the audience of a Comic Relief stage show where he came on stage {{in the middle of a}} Little Britain sketch, bemoaning the impact it has had on his work as a 'classically trained actor'. He does however forgive the sketch so long as he gets to sing his 'theme tune', to which he does to rapturous applause.|$|E
2500|$|Later after 1540 {{she gained}} a {{position}} in the household of Anne of Cleves, 4th wife of King Henry VIII from 6 January 1540 to 9 July 1540. However, she never achieved the coveted position of maid of honour, as did her sister Anne Basset, as Anne of Cleves' marriage to the king was soon annulled to facilitate his marriage to Catherine Howard. Katharine Basset was referred to thereafter simply as [...] "The Lady Anne of Cleves' woman". Anne resided at Hever Castle, the old family seat of the Boleyn family. The pursuit of a place at court for Katharine is well documented in the Lisle Papers. In 1539 Katherine wrote to her mother: [...] "...Madame, the cause of my writing to your ladyship is that we hear say that the King's grace shall be married and my lord and my lady (i.e. Rutland) as yet doth hear no word of their coming up to London. Wherefore I desire your ladyship that ye will <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> lady and mother unto me as to speak so that I {{may be one of the}} queen's maids..." [...] (signed [...] "Katherin Bassitt") Her mother took the opportunity of making the request via John Norris, brother of Henry Norris. On her way to England Queen Anne of Cleves in December 1539 had an enforced stay at Calais, and Lord Lisle used his influence as Lord Deputy of Calais, on behalf of his step-daughter Katharine, to speak to the vice-chancellor of the Duchy of Cleves, Henry Olisleger, who wrote to Lord Lisle on 6 January 1540 with disappointing news as follows: ...|$|E
