50|$|The {{bridled nail-tail wallaby}} (Onychogalea fraenata), {{also known}} as the <b>bridled</b> <b>nail-tailed</b> <b>wallaby,</b> bridled nailtail wallaby, bridled wallaby, merrin, and flashjack, is a {{vulnerable}} species of macropod. It is a small wallaby found in three isolated areas in Queensland, Australia, and whose population is declining. The total population of the species is currently estimated to be less than 1,100 mature individuals in the wild.|$|E
40|$|Acacia harpophylla F. Muell. (brigalow) used to {{naturally}} occur over a {{range of}} about 50 000 km 2 in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. Large scale clearing for agriculture has reduced the area to less than 20 000 km 2 and {{it is estimated that}} 20 - 25 % of vertebrate fauna living in brigalow communities will become locally extinct {{as a result of the}} current clearing induced loss of habitat. Some coal mining companies in central Queensland have become interested in providing habitat for the endangered <b>bridle</b> <b>nail-tailed</b> <b>wallaby</b> that lives in brigalow vegetation. However, there is little known about establishment techniques for brigalow on mine sites and other disturbed ground; an understanding of brigalow biology and ecology is required to assist in the conservation of this threatened vegetation community and for re-creation of bridled nail-tail wallaby habitat in the post mining landscape. Brigalow is an unusual species of Acacia because it is not hard-seeded and germinates readily without the need to break seed-coat imposed dormancy. Germination trials were undertaken to test the ability of brigalow seed to germinate with {{a range of}} temperatures and salinity levels similar to those experienced in coal mine spoil. Optimum germination was found to occur at temperatures from 15 to 38 °C and no germination was recorded at 45 °C. Brigalow was very tolerant of high salt levels and germinated at percentages greater than 50 % up to the highest salinity tested, 30 dS/m...|$|R
25|$|The {{region is}} also home to many fauna species that are rare and vulnerable. There are 32 {{threatened}} vertebrate species on the endangered fauna list of the Western Australian Government, which include 16 mammals, 8 birds and 8 reptiles, all of which exist or are likely to exist in the Great Western Woodlands. Furthermore, the pig-footed bandicoot, the long-tailed hopping mouse, the crescent <b>nail-tailed</b> <b>wallaby</b> and the broad-faced potoroo that were once found in the Great Western Woodlands, are now considered globally extinct.|$|R
