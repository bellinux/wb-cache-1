40|$|Abstract—A compact Vivaldi {{antenna array}} printed on thick {{substrate}} and fed by a Substrate Integrated Waveguides (SIW) structure has been developed. The antenna array utilizes a compact SIW <b>binary</b> <b>divider</b> to significantly minimize the feed structure insertion losses. The low-loss SIW <b>binary</b> <b>divider</b> has a common novel Grounded Coplanar Waveguide (GCPW) feed {{to provide a}} wideband transition to the SIW and to sustain a good input match while preventing higher order modes excitation. The antenna array was designed, fabricated, and thoroughly investigated. Detailed simulations of the antenna and its feed, {{in addition to its}} relevant measurements, will be presented in this paper. 1...|$|E

40|$|Larger, faster ICs are {{creating}} a rash of new problems for the system designer. Designers faced with building larger and larger systems base their architectures on smaller systems that may scale poorly. As a result of VLSI, many new architectures are coming into favor, either because of the changing importance of design factors or because {{it is now possible}} to design bigger chips. Efficient VLSI methods for implementing the basic arithmetic operations can push back many system-performance limitations. There is continued need for re-evaluation of arithmetic architectures, as the efficiency of implementation is related to both implementation technology and size of the operands. A new <b>binary</b> <b>divider</b> for n-bit integer operands, which produces the quotient and remainder in O(n) time using O(n) area, is presented. For very large operands, such as those required in Public Key Cryptography, the new divider is faster than comparable carry-save dividers and is more area-efficient than implementations using more redundant arithmetic. A further problem faced by the designer of very large systems is their susceptibility to error. The system must be efficiently designed to function in the presence of errors, which become more likely as the size of the system increases. Qualities inherent in many asynchronous designs can be used to provide fault detection and therefore, fault tolerance. An approach to fault tolerance, one not possible with conventional, clocked, systolic arrays, is presented. This method of fault detection/correction exploits the inherent redundancy of architectures using four-state coding, a data-driven technique for implementing bit-level wave-front arrays...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a monolithically-integrated, broadband, lumped-element, symmetrical-hybrid power divider centered at 20 GHz {{which was designed}} and fabricated to uniformly distribute power to arrays of Josephson junctions for superconducting voltage standards. This solution achieves a ten-fold decrease in chip area, and a two-fold increase in bandwidth when compared to a standard distributed 180 ◦-hybrid by utilizing LC Π sections and a coplanar-waveguide phase inverter instead of transmission lines. A single divider demonstrates 0. 5 dB maximum insertion loss, and a 1. 5 : 1 VSWR bandwidth of 13 – 23 GHz. An eight-way, three-level, <b>binary,</b> power <b>divider</b> network is characterized in a divider/attenuator/combiner back-to-back measurement configuration with a 20 dB match bandwidth from 11. 5 – 21. 5 GHz. In the 15 – 22 GHz band of interest, the maximum insertion loss for the sixteen-way divider network is 1. 0 dB, {{with an average of}} 0. 5 dB.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient 4 -bit unsigned <b>binary</b> serial <b>divider</b> and its implementation using 180 nm CMOS process technology. The layout {{design of the}} serial divider circuit is efficiently optimized in terms of area. The serial divider circuit provides a good compromise between area and performance in divider design. The serial divider is designed based on repeated one’s complement binary subtraction algorithm. The implementation consists of several combinational and sequential components such as 4 -bit ripple carry adder, 2 : 1 multiplexers, D flip-flops and 4 -bit synchronous up counter. The circuit analysis is carried out in terms of performance parameters such as transistor count, propagation delay and power consumption. According to the estimations done, the transistor count, propagation delay and power consumption of the serial divider without parasitics {{was found to be}} 568, 5. 13 ns and 196. 2 µW respectively. The presence of parasitics due to metal layers in the layout design increase propagation delay to 86. 42 ns and power consumption to 206 µW...|$|R
