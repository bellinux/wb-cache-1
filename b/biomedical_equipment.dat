As the sensitivity of a device {{is the most important}} factor regarding to <b>biomedical</b> <b>equipments,</b> this paper deals with the sensitivity of a device. Sensitivity of a cantilever based biosensor decreases with decrease in the concentration of analytes. The sensitivity depends on its deflection of a cantilever based Bio-MEMS due to interaction between the analyte and its complementary bio-receptor molecules. Therefore, designing a cantilever based biosensor which can assay analytes in low concentration is important. The design and development of the cantilever based biosensor to make a device high sensitive either by using different shapes and sizes or a different material for a cantilever structure.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Almost all of {{the modern}} <b>biomedical</b> <b>equipments</b> that record the biopotential actions have digital output but the paper chart records are a must. The volume of these records is {{significant}} and increasing rapidly. Keeping a bio-signal chart of a patient {{make it easy for}} quick assessment but still create problems in the essence of data storage, archiving, data interchange and communications. Approach: A solution to all these problems is to convert these paper records to digital form. In this study, a method for bio-potential signal extraction from single or multi-channel paper recorded charts using image processing techniques is developed. Results: After scanning the paper charts and converting them into images using a commercial scanner, the developed algorithm applied to eliminate the background of the scanned paper chart from any recording device single channel or multi-channel using binary neighborhood morphological operations then converting the extracted waveform image into quantized values representing the waveform recorded paper chart. The extracted signal then filtered to remove the high frequency effects that result from the morphological operations. A correlation and frequency analysis procedure then conducted to verify the result against known sampled waveform. Conclusion: A chart paper conversion to digital values that represent only the values for the biopotential waveform and eliminating the other irrelevant information has been achieved. These resulted in a less space occupation of patient records and make it easy for data further processing and manipulations. ...|$|R

It has long been used for the diagnosis of various central nervous system disorders like seizures, epilepsy, and brain damage and for categorizing sleep stages in patients. The artifacts caused by various factors such as Electrooculogram (EOG), eye blink, and Electromyogram (EMG) in EEG signal increases the difficulty in analyzing them. Discrete wavelet transform has been applied in this research for removing noise from the EEG signal. The effectiveness of the noise removal is quantitatively measured using Root Mean Square (RMS) Difference. This paper reports on the effectiveness of wavelet transform applied to the EEG signal as a means of removing noise to retrieve important information related to both healthy and epileptic patients. Wavelet-based noise removal on the EEG signal of both healthy and epileptic subjects was performed using four discrete wavelet functions. With the appropriate choice of the wavelet function (WF), it is possible to remove noise effectively to analyze EEG significantly. Result of this study shows that WF Daubechies 8 (db 8) provides the best noise removal from the raw EEG signal of healthy patients, while WF orthogonal Meyer does the same for epileptic patients.

Military Occupation Specialties (MOS) graduating from USAMEOS included: 35G, 35S, 35T, and 35U. Optical laboratory technicians were designated as 42E upon graduation of the 21-week optical training course. In the hallways of the USAMEOS training facility hung the pictures of graduating BMET classes over decades of operation.When the USAMEOS program was first developed, the training program was divided into Basic and Advanced Courses. The basic course work was 20 weeks long. The advanced course work was 32 weeks long. The courses were later changed to a 40-week basic class (35G) and 32-week advanced course (35U). The graduates of the basic course were known as [...] "Super G's" [...] referring to the MOS of 35G. With a small amount of additional course work, USAMEOS graduates could earn an AAS in <b>Biomedical</b> <b>Equipment</b> Maintenance from Regis University in Denver.During the 1990s, the MOS designation was changed to 91A for <b>Biomedical</b> <b>Equipment</b> Repair Technician, and the Basic Course consisted of a 38-week course broken up into twelve modules. Didactic Modules included Anatomy and Physiology, Basic Soldering, AC/DC theory and Ohm's Law, electron theory, Transistor Theory, Digital Circuits, Basic Troubleshooting, Dental and Pneumatic Devices, heating and cooling, Sterilizers and Ultrasonic Cleaners, Linear Circuits, Spectrophotometers and Solid State Relays, advanced troubleshooting, cryogenics primer, high and low capacity modules of X-ray, The school culminated in a field problem where students lived in ISOs and temper tents while filling out paperwork in the field environment to include pulling guard duty and setup of mobile sterile operating units and generators.. After graduation from the basic course, students would typically be assigned to an operational unit for practical work between the Basic and Advanced Courses. Technical training at USAMEOS was accelerated, 8 hours per day in class, it was intensive and provided both engineering theory and hands on learning opportunities in an extensive set of labs. The school closed in 1999 due to base closure.
