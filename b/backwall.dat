40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} axle load {{spreading}} through ballast {{and the effect of}} support stiffness has been investigated on short span railway bridges. Two types of bridges, simply supported bridges and bridges with integrated <b>backwalls,</b> have been modeled with 2 D beam elements. When analyzing the load spreading effect, two types of load shapes have been considered. The first one is the load shape proposed in Eurocode where the axle load is modeled with three point loads where 50 % of the axle load acts on the sleeper located underneath the wheel and 25 % on the two adjacent sleepers, respectively. Therefrom the loads are further distributed through the sleepers and the ballast. The second load shape that has been studied is a triangular load shape. These two load shapes have been modeled both with different numbers of point loads and as distributed line loads to see how the dynamic response of the bridges is affected and thereby find what level of accuracy that is required to capture the full effect of the load spreading. For the bridges with integrated <b>backwalls</b> the supports were also modeled as springs with varying stiffness to see how the dynamic response was affected. The response was measured in terms of vertical acceleration and bending moment. From the simulations the conclusion can be drawn that the triangular load shape gives significantly lower bridge responses than the Eurocode load shape. It is further found that modeling the axle loads with point loads can give spurious acceleration peaks, which in the case of bridges with integrated <b>backwalls</b> often are critical. For these bridges it is necessary to enhance the accuracy of the load spread, either by increasing the number of point loads or using a distributed line load. From the spring support simulations, {{it can be seen that}} support stiffness has great influence on the dynamic response of bridges with integrated <b>backwalls.</b> For certain values the response is increased, whereas for other values a large reduction is obtained...|$|R

The importance of accelerated bridge construction (ABC) technologies has been realized by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Bridges and Structures. This project is another {{in a series of}} ABC bridge projects undertaken by the Iowa DOT. Buena Vista County, Iowa, {{with the assistance of the}} Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Bridge Engineering Center (BEC) at Iowa State University, constructed a two-lane single-span precast box girder bridge, using rapid construction techniques.

5000|$|The {{fact that}} Chapman {{is a great}} {{defensive}} player should not mislead. Indeed, because he recognizes the situation so early he sees offensive opportunities where others do not, and positions himself so quickly he catches his opponent off guard. His offense is efficient, as he seldom goes for an outright winner without hitting it. If his opponent makes a mistake, e.g., hitting it off the <b>backwall</b> or hanging one in the front court, Chapman can see what's going to happen early, step in and end the rally by killing the <b>backwall</b> set-up, or given a frontcourt opportunity, he just [...] "sticks out his hand", as Roberts described it so many years ago. The tactic of [...] "sticking out his hand" [...] is the key chapter Chapman has added to the textbook, one he would later come to call a paddleshot. He primarily uses paddleshots from the frontcourt for fly shots because “they are more efficient {{and more difficult to}} read than side arm shots” The main difference between the traditional side-arm swing and a paddleshot swing is in the former you lead with your elbow and in the latter you lead with your hand, and rather than cupping your hand you spread your hand wide open and use it like a ping-pong paddle. Paddleshot swings are deceptive because you take the ball closer to your body, and by slightly changing the angle of your hand you can dramatically alter the direction of the ball. The key to his consistency off the <b>backwall</b> is the result of how unusually low he lets the ball drop, hitting it just inches off the floor, and thus sending the ball to the front wall with the least possible downward angle. Playing the shot off the <b>backwall</b> in this way results in a large number of flat rollouts.|$|E

40|$|The Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center's second-generation performance-based {{earthquake}} engineering (PBEE) methodology is intended {{in part to}} model highway bridge performance in terms of collapse, closure, repair duration, speed or load limitations, and possibly other performance measures. Some of these are difficult to model, particularly closure decisions where the engineering evidence of safety is inconclusive and must be supplemented by the inspector's judgment. This paper presents results of a limited, initial survey of department of transportation (DOT) engineers' beliefs {{about the relationship between}} physical damage and closure. The initial survey addresses a common class of reinforced-concrete bridges. The author and others developed and administered to a select, nationwide group of DOT engineers a one-page, multiple-choice survey form with expert self-rating, asking the engineers to relate ten damage measures (DM) to four closure levels. The DMs include approach settlement, offsets at abutments and expansion joints, flexural and shear cracks in beams, columns, shear keys, and <b>backwalls.</b> The performance levels considered are: leave open, close briefly for quick repairs, close for an extended period, and reduce speed. The survey results are analyzed to produce a number of preliminary relationships between damage and post-earthquake decisions by inspectors, relationships {{that can be used in}} probabilistic seismic performance evaluation in PEER's developing PBEE methodology.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Combining the {{analyses}} of {{three generations of}} glacial deposits and {{of a range of}} geomorphic features including widespread honeycombs and tafonis at Two Step Cliffs / Mars Oasis (71 ° 52 'S, 68 ° 15 'W) provides new insights into the geomorphological evolution of West Antarctica, with special respect to alveolar weathering. At Two Step Terrace, indicators of the inherited character of cavernous weathering were found, such as 97 % non flaking and varnished <b>backwalls,</b> and 80 % tafoni floors that are till-covered and/or sealed by lithobiontic coatings. Based on the NE predominant aspect of the alveolized boulder faces, tafoni initiation is attributed to coastal salt spray weathering by halite coming from the George VI Sound during the 6. 5 ka BP open water period. The present-day activity of these inherited cavities is restricted to roof flaking attributed to a combination of processes involving thermal stresses. This 6. 5 ka BP phase of coastal alveolization is the first step of a six-stage Holocene geomorphological scenario that includes alternatively phases of glacial advance or stationing, and phases of vegetal colonization and/or rock weathering and aeolian abrasion on the deglaciated outcrops. This geomorphic scenario is tentatively correlated with the available palaeoenvironmental record in the Antarctic Peninsula region, with two potential geomorphic indicators of the Holocene Optimum being identified: 1. clusters of centimetric honeycombs facing the sound (marine optimum at 6. 5 ka BP); 2. salmon-pink lithobiontic coatings preserved inside cavities and at the boulder surface (terrestrial optimum at 4 - 3 ka BP).

40|$|The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) {{has shown}} {{concerns}} regarding the design, fabrication, and erection of horizontally curved steel girder bridges due to unpredicted girder displacements, fit-up, and locked-in stresses. Nationally, up to one-quarter of steel girder bridges are being designed with horizontal curvature, an alarming figure {{when considering the}} unknown behaviors {{of this type of}} bridge. The primary objective of this work was to monitor and evaluate the behavior of four in-service, horizontally curved, steel-girder bridges with integral and semi-integral abutments. Additionally, the influence and behavior of fixed and expansion piers were considered. A number of steps were performed {{in order to meet the}} project objectives. First, a national state department survey was conducted and a literature review was performed in order to understand the state-of-art regarding these types of structures. Second, a monitoring program was developed and installed on six bridges located at the I- 35, I- 235, and I- 80 interchange northeast of Des Moines. Third, a monthly survey was conducted on each bridge with the purpose of tracking the bridge movements, and lastly, the data gathered during the monitoring period of the project was post-processed. The following general conclusions were made from the results of the study: There was no measureable difference between the horizontally curved bridges and straight bridges used in this work with regard to bridge behavior; internal strains were recorded in the composite girders as a result of thermally induced restrained expansion and contraction, and of the recorded strains, axial strain showed the largest ranges; the bridges expanded and contracted with seasons and showed more expansion and contraction near expansion piers than fixed piers. The equivalent cantilever method of steel pile analysis fell short of accurately predicting the relationship between weak axis bending strain in the piles and the pile head displacement; the measured internal stress in the abutment piles due to expansion and contraction of the bridge were generally below 50 % of yield stress; and the soil pressures on the abutment <b>backwalls</b> were generally below approximate passive soil pressures...|$|R

40|$|Moisture is {{the main}} source of {{deterioration}} of building envelope systems. One source of moisture that has not been studied to a great extent is inwards vapor flows, due to high temperature gradients. Such flows occur, for example, when exterior claddings like brick are wetted by rain and then exposed to solar radiation. This thesis investigates this phenomenon, which can bring large amount of undue moisture within in the envelope assembly. This thesis presents in detail the experimental work performed on large-scale wall assembly specimens to document their hygrothermal performance under conditions leading to inwards moisture flow. A large-scale experimental facility was utilized {{for the purpose of this}} work which consisted of weighing apparatuses to monitor the change of mass of the cladding and back-wall parts of wall specimens, a spraying array, a radiation array, and a test hut to provide controlled interior conditions. Five insulated wood-framed walls were monitored, four of which were brick cladded and one stucco cladded. Constructions of the <b>backwalls</b> varied by the material utilized for the exterior sheathing and the interior finish and also by presence or lack of an air cavity. The walls and the environment were equipped for electronic monitoring, complemented with manual weighing of gravimetric samples. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the presence of vapor tight interior finishes result in the accumulation of moisture in the interior gypsum board. Furthermore, it is shown that even a vapor tight sheathing does not reduce sufficiently vapor flow to prevent moisture accumulation in the wood studs and the interior gypsum board. The highly positive effect of air space, and its ventilation, in reducing the magnitude of the inward vapor flow is shown. During the process of studying the vapor diffusion through various wall assemblies, a vertical temperature and moisture content gradient was observed along the gypsum board-insulation interfaces. This phenomenon was also further investigated and studied both experimentally and numerically using CFD. The work indicated that stratification of humidity occurs within the insulation cavity of the wall. This thesis demonstrates the mechanism of inward diffusion: under high thermal gradients, large amounts of vapor are transported, inducing high relative humidity against low-permeable layers in assemblies. By sorption, materials exposed to high relative humidity display high moisture content...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the nature and}} distribution of periglacial lobes, terraces, gliding boulders, rockfalls and avalanches in granite and metaroorphic terrains in 8, part of the South-East Grampian Mountains of Scotland. Areal variations in the weathering of granite boulders were also investigated. Massive granite boulder lobes are extensively developed upon slopes in the Lochnagar and Mount Keen granite areas. The values of 14 parameters, established to describe the main elements of a lobe, were measured on 300 granite lobes. Various techniques were used to analyse the resultant dato,. Granite lobes are rare upon north-facing slopes, and absent from ground {{believed to have been}} covered by Loch Lomond age glaciers. It is concluded that these lobes are fossil features formed during the severe conditions of the Loch Lomond Stadial. Detailed sampling of 50 metamorphic lobes revealed that they are smaller features, largely restricted to the upper slopes of quartzite hills. Terraces are rare in both types of terrain. Gliding boulders are common in the granite and metamorphic areas. The values of 15 parameters were measured on 200 metamorphic and 150 granite gliding boulders. The resultant data were analysed and compared. Individual boulder movements of up to 2 cm/year were recorded between 1971 and 1975. Dendrochronological investigations of calluna and vaccinium plants growing in four furrows suggested that gliding boulder movements have decreased in the last 7 or 8 years. Rockfalls are frequently released from the <b>backwalls</b> of the three Lochnagar corries, contributing to the extensive postglacial screes. Nine rockfalls were observed between 13 June and 1 August 1972. The largest fall involved almost 4 tonnes of granite boulders. Avalanches are common on snow accumulation slopes. Their erosional activity is restricted, but they are efficient transporting agents. Four techniques were used to investigate possible differences in the extent of weathering of granite boulders in sites 'inside' and 'outside' the mapped limits of four presumed Loch Lomond age corrie glaciers. The tests assessed the amount of edge and corner rounding of the blocks, and also the degree of surface and subsurface granular disintegration. All tests indicated that boulders 'inside' the presumed limits are marginally but consistently less 'weathered' than those in 'outside' sites, independently supporting the view that corrie glaciers occupied these sites...|$|R

5000|$|Chapman's {{ability to}} force his opponents to play {{every inch of}} the court starts with his {{precision}} defense, which in turn starts with his extraordinary return of serve. Serving and returning serve usually determines who wins a handball game. Having the serve is a big advantage: only the server can score, he has the ball in his hand in the frontcourt with his opponent behind him in the backcourt, and he can pick his shot. The contemporary power player typically serves low drives along the walls trying for an ace or a weak return. However, drive serves are risky because if they are not precise they can rebound off the <b>backwall</b> toward center court and offer an offensive opportunity. Like any player, Chapman welcomes offensive opportunities, but his real advantage is his ability to defend all but the very best drive serves by punching them to the ceiling, and thereby completely neutralizing the server's advantage and forcing his opponent into the ceiling game he excels at. To compliment his extraordinary return game, when Chapman is serving he typically chooses low risk serves, usually either a lob serve or an overhand three-wall drive serve, both of which tend to force his opponents into a ceiling game (at best), and that's what Chapman wants because his precision ceiling game usually results in an offensive opportunity for him long before he gives one to his opponent.|$|E
50|$|Much of Chapman's uncanny {{anticipation}} {{starts with}} precision shotmaking. Sound technique produces ball control, {{that along with}} intelligent shot selection are the keys to Chapman's anticipation. He chooses shots that will keep his opponent on the run, off balance, or otherwise limit his options. By dictating play he knows the few options his opponent has left and positions himself on the court accordingly. Typically, Chapman's opponents are running around the court while walks to the position he wants and waits for the ball to come to him. Percentage handball strategy typically advises players {{to get to the}} short line {{in the center of the}} court after a shot. While this is generally good advice, Chapman's defense is so precise it allows him to frequently play at the restraining line rather than the short line. The extra five feet of court makes him almost impossible to pass without hitting the ball off the <b>backwall</b> and that's the worst thing you can do against Chapman. Superior positioning frequently produces a ball right to him, and the extra depth gives him additional time to react to the ball and allows Chapman to either play another defensive shot or go on the offense. Because he has a choice, his opponents don't know what's coming next and must run more to cover the court. If an opponent runs up, Chapman can hit the ball back to the ceiling or pass it down the walls, if he hangs back Chapman can paddle it into the corners.|$|E
50|$|Knockentiber {{was on a}} {{toll road}} or turnpike; the nearest toll house being {{opposite}} {{the entrance to the}} old Goods station; the <b>backwall</b> of the building remaining as the field boundary. The name 'Turnpike' originated from the original 'gate' used being just a simple wooden bar attached at one end to a hinge on the supporting post. The hinge allowed it to 'open' or 'turn' This bar looked like the 'pike' used as a weapon in the army at that time and therefore we get 'turnpike'. The term was also used by the military for barriers set up on roads specifically to prevent the passage of horses. In addition to providing better surfaces and more direct routes, the turnpikes settled the confusion of the different lengths given to miles, which varied from 4,854 to nearly 7000 ft. Long miles, short miles, Scotch or Scot's miles (5,928 ft), Irish miles (6,720 ft), etc. all existed. 5280 ft seems to have been an average! Another important point is that when these new toll roads were constructed the Turnpike Trusts went to a great deal of trouble to improve the route of the new road and these changes could be quite considerable as the old roads tended to go from farm to farm, hardly the shortest route. The tolls on roads were abolished in 1878 {{to be replaced by a}} road 'assessment', which was taken over by the County Council in 1889.Most milestones are no longer in situ and often the only remaining clue is an otherwise unexplained 'kink' in the line of a hedgerow.

Augustus is identified as [...] "Caesar" [...] (actually, [...] "Qysrs", which is based on [...] "Kaisaros", the Greek version of Caesar). He is also called [...] "Autotrator", an alteration of autokrator, or autocrat, the Greek equivalent of imperator, one of the emperor's titles. This misspelling seems to be deliberate, in order to achieve more symmetry in the hieroglyphs. In some other parts of the temple, however, the emperor is simply called [...] "Pharaoh". The middle room, which was used for offerings, and the sanctuary of Isis {{at the rear of the}} temple are undecorated but for reliefs on the door frame and <b>backwall</b> of the sanctuary. The latter shows Pihor and Pedesi as young gods worshiping Isis and Osiris respectively. The 6.55 by 13 m temple house is modest but well executed in design with two front columns, an offering hall and a sanctuary with a statue niche. A crypt was also built into the rear wall while a rock chamber in the nearby cliffs may have represented the tombs of Pediese and Pihor who were said to have drowned in the Nile river.|$|E
