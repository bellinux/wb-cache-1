Moreover, the Rajah Dugmanta of Golconda has selected Solor to wed his daughter Gamzatti (or Hamsatti, as she is known in the original production), and Nikiya, unaware of this arrangement, agrees to dance at the couple's betrothal celebrations.|$|E

25|$|In {{anticipation}} of the new piece, the Alhambra revived Offenbach's Le roi Carotte; at its premiere Whittington was preceded by Dieu et la <b>Bayadère</b> by Auber and a one-act farce. Whittington then ran for 120 performances in the large theatre of the Alhambra.|$|E
25|$|In late 1991, Rudolf Nureyev, artistic {{director}} of the Paris Opera Ballet, began making plans for a revival of the full-length La <b>Bayadère,</b> to be derived from the traditional Ponomarev/Chabukiani version he danced during his career with the Kirov Ballet. Nureyev enlisted the assistance of his friend and colleague Ninel Kurgapkina, former Prima Ballerina of the Kirov Ballet, to assist in staging the work. The administration of the Paris Opéra knew that this production of La <b>Bayadère</b> would be Nureyev's last offering to the world, as his health was deteriorating more and more from advanced AIDS disease. Because of this, the cultural administration of the Paris Opéra gave the production an enormous budget, with even more funding coming from various private donations.|$|E

2500|$|Catel {{was a great}} {{admirer of}} Mozart, whose The Magic Flute had been staged in France in 1801. and the music of Les <b>bayadéres</b> {{reflects}} this. Gérard Condé describes the score as [...] "a rare example in the French repertoire of an opera that assimilates the Mozartian style {{as a means of}} toning down the brazenness and sterility of neo-Gluckism." [...] Nevertheless, Les <b>bayadères</b> too shows the influence of Gluck. Its heroine, Laméa, resembles Gluck's Iphigénie (in both Iphigénie en Aulide and Iphigénie en Tauride).|$|R
25|$|Les <b>bayadères</b> also marks a stage {{towards the}} {{creation}} of French Grand Opera. It shares many features with another work set to a libretto by Jouy, Spontini's La vestale (1807), the greatest operatic success of the Napoleonic era. Like La vestale, the heroine of Les <b>bayadères</b> has taken a religious vow of perpetual chastity. The choice of an historical subject, the sumptuous sets and the many opportunities for dance were all features of La vestale too, as they would be of the Grand Opera which appeared in France in the late 1820s and dominated the repertoire of the 19th century.|$|R
