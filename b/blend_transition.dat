METHODS: We treated 25 eyes of 21 patients for a mean correction of + 3. 38 [...] 0. 97 D (range, + 1. 00 to + 4. 00 D). The hyperopic correction was made using an erodible disc inserted on the laser optical pathway; an axicon lens was then {{used to create a}} <b>blend</b> <b>transition</b> zone. Eyes were evaluated at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. For a smaller series of 11 eyes, we also present 24 -month results. RESULTS: Mean refractive error 1 month after treatment (25 eyes) was- 2. 35 [...] 1. 55 D (range, + 1. 00 to- 6. 50 D). Eight eyes (32 %) had a spectacle-corrected visual acuity loss greater than 1 line.

The analysis focuses on a four stroke SI engine equipped with a low pressure common rail type multi-fuel injection system. First, the injection system is simulated {{by means of a}} comprehensive lumped and distributed parameter numerical model, in order to evaluate the dynamic behavior of the fuel rail in terms of injection pressure profiles, instantaneous mass flow rate delivered to each cylinder and engine heat of combustion power. The accuracy of the model is addressed by comparing the predicted results with the measured data. By using both the experimental in-cylinder pressure profiles as well as the engine total efficiency, and the calculated injection profiles, the instantaneous torque is determined for different engine speeds and ethanol/gasoline blends. In particular the torque variation during the transition from one fuel mixture to a different one is investigated, accounting for the influence of the blend composition rate of change. Finally, the magnitude of instantaneous torque variation is compared with the overall accuracy of a torque sensor currently adopted in production series engines to detect combustion misfires, in order to evidence its capability to monitor the fuel <b>blend</b> <b>transition...</b>|$|E

The character is turning around {{to walk in}} the user-requested travel direction, depicted by the red arrow on the ground. In this paper, we present an example-based motion synthesis technique that generates continuous streams of high-fidelity, controllable motion for interactive applications, such as video games. Our method uses a new data structure called a parametric motion graph to describe valid ways of generating linear <b>blend</b> <b>transitions</b> between motion clips dynamically generated through parametric synthesis in realtime. Our system specifically uses blending-based parametric synthesis to accurately generate any motion clip from an entire space of motions by blending together examples from that space. The key to our technique is using sampling methods to identify and represent good transitions between these spaces of motion parameterized by a continuously valued parameter. This approach allows parametric motion graphs to be constructed with little user effort. Because parametric motion graphs organize all motions of a particular type, such as reaching to different locations on a shelf, using a single, parameterized graph node, they are highly structured, facilitating fast decision-making for interactive character control. We have successfully created interactive characters that perform sequences of requested actions, such as cartwheeling or punching...|$|R

40|$|Microstructural {{deformation}} behaviour in polystyrene-based compatible {{polymer blend}} systems was studied using {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) and microdensitometry. Four different binary compatible blend systems were employed and characterized in this investigation: polystyrene (PS) and poly(2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 4 -phenylene oxide) (PPO), PS and poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME), PS and poly([alpha]-methylstyrene) (P[alpha]MS), and PPO and P[alpha]MS. Individual craze and shear deformation zone (DZ) microstructures were examined by TEM. For TEM observations, specimens deformed in situ on a TEM grid (loaded condition) were utilized. TEM micrographs showed that, for PS/PPO <b>blends,</b> deformation mode <b>transition</b> from crazing to shear DZ occurred around 25 % PPO inclusion. For PS/PVME <b>blends,</b> this <b>transition</b> occurred around 20 % PVME inclusion. For PS/P[alpha]MS blends, the deformation mode was totally controlled by crazing regardless of composition. For PPO/P[alpha]MS <b>blends,</b> deformation mode <b>transition</b> from shear DZ to crazing occurred around 25 % P[alpha]MS inclusion. Quantitative analyses of these crazes and shear DZs were conducted utilizing microdensitometry of the TEM negatives in the manner developed by Lauterwasser and Kramer. From the microdensitometry, molecular parameters such as fibril extension ratios ([lambda]s) were determined. Microdensitometry results showed that [lambda] decreased as the PPO content increased in the PS/PPO blends, and, for 100 % PPO, only shear DZs were observed. For PS/PVME blends, [lambda] also decreased as the PVME content increased. For PS/P[alpha]MS and PPO/P[alpha]MS blends, [lambda] increased as the P[alpha]MS content increased. These results were analysed in terms of existing entanglement and intermolecular interaction models in compatible blends. From this analysis, it is concluded that the overall microstructural deformation behaviour of binary compatible blends cannot be fully explained by either entanglement density or intermolecular interaction model alone. Rather, the combined entanglement density and intermolecular interaction model can explain the microstructural deformation behaviour in binary compatible blends well...|$|R
