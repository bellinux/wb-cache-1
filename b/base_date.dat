On November 10, 2005, the WBC voted to award its heavyweight championship to Rahman, making Rahman a two-time heavyweight champion.|$|E
25|$|For the Classic Mayas, the <b>base</b> <b>date</b> of the Long Count (4 Ahau 8 Cumku), {{following}} {{upon the}} completion of thirteen previous baktun eras, {{is thought to have}} been the focus of specific acts of creation. Through the figures of two so-called 'Paddler Gods', the mythology of the Maya maize god appears to have been involved. References to 4 Ahau 8 Cumku events are few in number (the most important one occurring on Quirigua stela C), seemingly incoherent, and hard to interpret. They include an obscure conclave of seven deities in the underworld (among whom the deity Bolonyokte') and a concept of 'three stones' usually taken to refer to a cosmic hearth.|$|E
25|$|The on-line {{calendar}} converters cited at {{the bottom}} of this page all give the current Fasli year (following Nawruz in AD 2011) as 1381 Y.Z. – the same year as the Qadimi and Shahanshahi. However, the accumulated leap days not reckoned in the latter two calendars add up to a whole year in just over 1508 years. Since there is exactly one Fasli year for every Gregorian year, then day one of the proleptic Fasli calendar would be 21 March (Gregorian) AD 631, with Year 2 beginning on 21 March AD 632. But Yazdegird III did not ascend the throne until 19 June AD 632 (Gregorian), leading to the curious quirk that the <b>base</b> <b>date</b> for the reckoning of years ends up in Year 2 of the Fasli calendar.|$|E

50|$|The Dresden codex {{contains}} {{another method}} for writing distance numbers. These are Ring Numbers. Specific dates within the Dresden codex are often given by calculations involving Ring Numbers. Förstemann identified these, but Wilson (1924:24-25) later clarified {{the way in}} which they operate. Ring Numbers are intervals of days between the Era <b>Base</b> <b>date</b> 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk’u and an earlier Ring <b>Base</b> <b>date,</b> where the place-holder for the numeral of days in the interval is circled by an image of a tied red band. Added to this earlier Ring <b>Base</b> <b>date</b> is another count of days forward, which Thompson refers to as a Long Round, leading to a final date within the Long Count that is given as an entry date to be used within a specific table in the codex.|$|E
