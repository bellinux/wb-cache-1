5|$|Monotype {{licensed}} {{and released}} the font Centaur {{around the same}} time as Bembo. It was drawn by the American <b>book</b> <b>designer</b> Bruce Rogers. Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo, the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 (the so-called Venetian style). Like Bembo, its italic (by Frederic Warde) comes from the 1520s, being again loosely {{based on the work of}} Arrighi from around 1520. Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure, something particularly true in its digital facsimile. Penguin often used it for headings and titles of 'classic' editions, particularly its capitals and italic; its lower-case does not so effectively harmonise with Bembo due to the different letter shapes such as the tilted 'e'.|$|E

25|$|According to <b>book</b> <b>designer</b> Hugh Williamson, {{a second}} decline in Caslon's {{popularity}} in Britain did, however, set {{in during the}} twentieth century due to the arrival of revivals of other old-style and transitional designs from Monotype and Linotype.

25|$|The first {{well-known}} public {{presentation of}} markup languages in computer text processing {{was made by}} William W.

In the 1970s, Tunnicliffe led the development of a standard called GenCode for the publishing industry and later was the first chair of the International Organization for Standardization committee that created SGML, the first standard descriptive markup language. <b>Book</b> <b>designer</b> Stanley Rice published speculation along similar lines in 1970.

Although simple Realistic Books can easily be created from PDF or HTML files using a shell script or web service, it is not so easy for <b>book</b> <b>designers</b> to take advantage of advanced features that are not normally represented in the input files. This paper describes the Bookmaker’s Workbench, an interactive system intended to help <b>book</b> <b>designers</b> produce Realistic <b>Books.</b> It incorporates many features, including a text mining option that automatically identifies significant key terms and marks them visually in the text, the ability to incorporate synonyms automatically into the full-text search capability, and include automatically generated back-of-the-book index. A user evaluation is reported that demonstrates the system’s usability and learnability...|$|R
