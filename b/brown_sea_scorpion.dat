5000|$|Megalograptus (Greek for [...] "big writing") is a 4 ft Ordovician {{eurypterid}} (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpion),</b> and {{was among}} the earliest known genera (and {{was a member of}} the family Megalograptidae). The generic name is derived from the fact that its first fossils were of its very spiny legs, which were mistaken for massive graptolites. It lived from 460 to 445 mya. Megalograptus preyed on fish, trilobites, other <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions,</b> and smaller orthocones, using the spines on their claws to feel for their prey hiding in the sand and mud. Adult Cameroceras, along with the bigger <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> species, preyed on it. Megalograptus did not have a stinger, but may have curled its tail and sword-like telson forward as a threat pose, much like a scorpion.|$|R
50|$|Hibbertopterus is a genus {{of giant}} <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> (order Eurypterida) that {{inhabited}} the swamps of Scotland during the Carboniferous.|$|R
50|$|Fossils of Pterygotus are {{relatively}} common, although complete skeletons are rare. It {{was one of}} the last of the gigantic sea scorpions: later species were much smaller and more nimble. The decline of the larger <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> may be related to their relative slowness and possible vulnerability during moulting, since they could not escape to land like smaller <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions.</b> However, the latter is unlikely since Pterygotus was such a large creature.|$|R
5000|$|Eurypterus ( [...] ) is an extinct genus of <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions.</b> They existed {{during the}} Silurian Period, from around 432 to 418 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Pterygotus is a genus {{of marine}} {{arthropod}} within the extinct order eurypterida (or <b>Sea</b> <b>Scorpion),</b> and includes {{some of the}} largest species of this group.|$|R
5000|$|Pentecopterus decorahensis is an extinct <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> {{that lived}} during the Middle Ordovician period, {{as early as}} 467.3 million years ago. It is the oldest {{described}} eurypterid, and, at an estimated length of up to 1.83 m, {{one of the largest}} known arthropods ever discovered, similar in size to the famous millipede-like Arthropleura. Other notable <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> include the more recent Silurian-aged Acutiramus, and Devonian Jaekelopterus, the only arthropod currently known to surpass P. decorahensis in size. According to researcher James Lamsdell of Yale University, P. decorahensis [...] "is the first real big predator".|$|R

50|$|Merostomata is a {{class of}} chelicerate {{arthropods}} that contains the extinct Eurypterida (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions)</b> and the extant Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs). The term was originally used by James Dwight Dana to refer to Xiphosura only, but was emended by Henry Woodward to cover both groups.|$|R
5000|$|Strobilopterus {{probably}} {{was one of}} the closest relatives of Dolichopterus, but overall the phylogeny and systematics of the family Dolichopteridae is disputed: some place it closer to the Eurypteridae, while others assign it to the second lineage of <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> which contains the Stylonuridae.|$|R
25|$|Some rock pool fish {{which are}} {{temporary}} residents include the long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion,</b> the pipefish worm, the rock goby {{and the common}} lumpsucker. However some other rock pool fish are territorial in nature, and will stay with the same pool for extended periods. Examples are the common blenny and its near relative the butterfish.|$|R

50|$|Horseshoe crabs were {{traditionally}} grouped {{with the}} extinct eurypterids (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions)</b> as the Merostomata. They may have {{evolved in the}} shallow seas of the Paleozoic Era (570-248 million years ago) with other primitive arthropods like the trilobites. The four species of horseshoe crab are the only remaining members of the Xiphosura, {{one of the oldest}} classes of marine arthropods.|$|R
50|$|Until a {{few decades}} ago it was thought that Palaeophonus, {{similarly}} to many other scorpions of the Silurian, was one of the earliest animals to have conquered the land. In fact, a closer examination of the fossils has determined that these animals possess well developed gills, very similar to those of contemporary Eurypterids (or <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions).</b>|$|R
5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions,</b> extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|R
50|$|Miller's {{death was}} very tragic, {{and his life}} brief, but he left a {{heritage}} of new discoveries of several Silurian <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> (the eurypterid genus Hughmilleria was named in his honour), and many Devonian fishes, including several placoderms (the arthrodire Millerosteus also honoured him), described in his popular books. Though he had no academic credentials, he is today considered one of Scotland's premier palaeontologists.|$|R
2500|$|The long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion,</b> a small stout fish which grows about 29cm long, {{is another}} {{temporary}} resident of rocky pools. They have large black eyes, a large mouth, and four long spines—two {{on each side}} on the gill cover—that stick out when the fish {{is removed from the}} water. They also have an organ like a finger on each side of their mouths which helps them catch prey. Because of their broad heads, they are also called [...] "bullheads". They have a variety of effective camouflaged colours ranging from shades of browns with cream blotches, to orange and red with white blotches. They can also change their body colour to match their surroundings. They are found around the coasts of Northern Europe in shallow rocky waters hiding amongst seaweed. They are also found in rock pools and sometimes in waters 30 m deep. Long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions</b> lay eggs amongst seaweed or attached to rock crevices. The young hatch after two or three weeks, and go through several development stages before maturing into adults.|$|R

40|$|During {{a three-year}} field study, {{interspecific}} and interannual {{differences in the}} trophic ecology of littoral fish species were investigated in the rocky intertidal of Helgoland Island (North Sea). We investigated trophic niche partitioning of common coexisting littoral fish species based on a multi tracer approach using stable isotope and fatty acids {{in order to show}} differences and similarities in resource use and feeding modes. The results of the dual tracer approach showed clear trophic niche partitioning of the five target fish species, the goldsinny wrasse Ctenolabrus rupestris, the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus, the painted goby Pomatoschistus pictus, the short-spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> Myoxocephalus scorpius and the long-spined <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> Taurulus bubalis. Both stable isotopes and fatty acids showed distinct differences in the trophic ecology of the studied fish species. However, the combined use of the two techniques added an additional resolution on the interannual scale. The sand goby P. minutus showed the largest trophic plasticity with a pronounced variability between years. The present data analysis provides valuable information on trophic niche partitioning of fish species in the littoral zones of Helgoland and on complex benthic food webs in general. ...|$|R
50|$|Eurypterids (<b>sea</b> <b>scorpions)</b> were {{a diverse}} group of aquatic and {{possibly}} amphibious predators that included the most massive arthropods to have existed. They survived over 200 million years, but finally died out in the Permian-Triassic extinction event along with trilobites and most other forms of life present at the time, including most of the dominant terrestrial therapsids. The Early Devonian Jaekelopterus reached an estimated length of 2.5 m, not including its raptorial chelicerae, and is thought to have been a freshwater species.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{particular}} combination of characteristics, {{the position of}} the Euthycarcinoidea within the Arthropoda has been ambiguous; previous authors have allied euthycarcinoids with crustaceans (interpreted as copepods, branchiopods, or an independent group), with trilobites, or the merostomatans (horseshoe crabs and <b>sea</b> <b>scorpions).</b> However, the general features and the discovery of fossils from this group in Cambrian rocks suggest that its may have given rise to the mandibulates, the group that includes the myriapods (centipedes, millipedes and the like), crustaceans, and hexapods (insects, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Excavation of the Gilboa petrified forest {{continued}} {{on into the}} early twentieth century, but by 1921 excavation at Gilboa Forest had completed. Prior to 1933 very few fossils were known in New York. Among the early finds were the Cambrian jellyfish and eurypterids. Only 15 mammoth finds had been made before 1933. However, mastodon remains had become relatively common. By 1933, {{more than a hundred}} mastodon specimens had been dug up in New York. More recent was the 1984 designation of the Silurian <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> Eurypterus remipes as the New York state fossil.|$|R
50|$|Fishes of {{the area}} include Arctic char, Greenland halibut, polar cod, cuttlefish, wolf fish, <b>sea</b> <b>scorpion</b> and Greenland shark. Aquatic mammals are {{dominated}} by seals (ringed, hooded, harbor, bearded and harp seal) which feed on fish in winter (mostly polar cod) and crustaceans in summer. Larger species include Atlantic walrus, narwhal and sometimes beluga whale. Atlantic walrus feeds on mussels, fish and ringed seals that urges ringed seals to disappear from the area when walruses stay there for prolonged periods. Narwhals consume polar cod, Greenland halibut, cuttlefish and pelegaec crustaceans.|$|R
