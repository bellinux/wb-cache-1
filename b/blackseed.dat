40|$|Abstract: Intake of galactogogues {{increases}} {{breast milk}} secretion. Aim {{of this study}} was to investigate the Srijela (an herbal preparation) for its galactogenic property on postpartum mothers. The study was conducted on 75 postpartum mothers comprising 50 mothers who received Srijela preparation and 25 mothers as control who did not received the Srijela. The Srijela is an herbal preparation of Ashwagandha, <b>Blackseeds,</b> Amlaki, Methi and Hing. Observations were made on lactation factors-time of starting milk secretion after delivery, frequency of breast feeding, quantity of milk secretion, frequency of urination and weight gain of the babies. It was seen that Srijela enhanced the breast milk secretion in terms of onset, frequency, and quantity of milk secretion in the postpartum mothers as compared to those who did not received Srijela. Frequency of urination (an indicator for increase milk intake) was also remarkably higher for the babies of Srijela mothers than that for the babies of non...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Unconventional therapy (UT) is a {{therapeutic}} practice of alternative {{and complementary medicine}} that is not currently considered {{an integral part of}} modern medical practice. The aim {{of this article is to}} investigate the experience of Saudi patients with UT modalities in the treatment of asthma. Materials and Methods: We carried out a cross-sectional study of asthma patients referred to King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the year 2004. Information was collected using a pre-designed questionnaire administered through interviews. Results: Two hundred consecutive patients with a mean age of 52. 3 years (&#x 00 B 1; 18. 7) were included in this study. Sixty-nine (34. 5 &#x 0025;) of those patients used some form of UT in the previous year. There was a tendency to use UT among the older age group (P = 0. 029) and among those with longer duration of disease (P = 0. 009). However, there was no significant correlation observed between the use of UT and gender, FEV 1, or disease control. The most commonly used form of UT was recitation of Holy Quran (9 &#x 0025;), honey (24. 5 &#x 0025;), herbs (23. 5 &#x 0025;), cautery (12 &#x 0025;), and <b>blackseed</b> (10 &#x 0025;). There was no significant correlation between disease control and the use of modalities. Conclusion: Unconventional therapy is frequently practiced by asthma patients in Saudi Arabia, who commonly believe that UT will lead to improvement. The lack of evidence necessitates the fostering of a national project to address the practice of UT...|$|E
40|$|In this {{experimental}} work, 120 virgin female mice (body weight 40 ± 10 gm) {{were divided}} into 6 equal groups. Mice in Group 1 served as a control. Mice in Groups 2 and 3 were fed on a basal diet provided with 100 mg/kg b. wt from each of <b>blackseed</b> (Nigella sativa) and garlic (Allium sativum), respectively, for one month. Mice in Group 4 were inoculated subcutanously (S/C) with Ehrlich tumor cells after one month {{from the start of}} the experiment. Mice in Groups 5 and 6 were treated similarly to those in Groups 3 and 4, respectively, for one month and then immediately inoculated S/C with Ehrlich tumor cells (ETC, 0. 1 mL/mouse). Blood samples were taken from mice of Groups 1, 2 and 3 at one month of experiment and tissue specimens were collected from mice in all groups two weeks after inoculation of Ehrlich tumor cells. Histopathologically, Groups 2 and 3 showed proliferation of mononuclear phagocytic system and mild degeneration of internal organs. In Group 4, histopathology revealed neoplastic mass with signs of malignancy, ultrastructurely exhibited pleomorphism, degenerated organelles with activated euo- and heterochromatin and cavitations of the cytoplasm. Groups 5 and 6 revealed much smaller neoplastic growth with necrosis and hemorrhage. The necrotic neoplastic cells replaced by empty cavities with congested blood vessels, the others showed pyknotic or karryolytic nuclei. In Groups 5 and 6, the electron microsopic appearance of the neoplastic growth exhibited degenerated and swollen cells with multiple cavitations. Most of the cytoplasmic organelles were degenerated with activation of lysozymes.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveEvaluation of {{in vitro}} {{antioxidant}} activities of grape seed (Vitis vinifera) extract GSE, <b>blackseed</b> (Nigella sativa) extract NSE and curcumin CUR. MethodsIn vitro antioxidative potential of GSE, NSE and CUR was evaluated through determination of total soluble phenolic content and reducing power. Also, the antioxidant activity {{was measured using}} linoleic acid peroxidation assay, phosphomolybdenum method, superoxide anion radical scavenging assay and DPPH. free radical-scavenging assay. ResultsGS and NS were extracted with 50 % ethanol and methanol, respectively. Extraction yield of GSE and NSE was 127 and 109 mg/g dry weight, respectively. CUR elicited greater phenolic contents (115 ± 0. 04) than NSE (14 ± 0. 05) and GSE (5. 2 ± 0. 06) mgGAE/g. Percentage scavenging activity of each sample against DPPH. was 1425 %, 600 % and 333 % for CUR, NSE and GSE, respectively. Percentage superoxide scavenging activity was more pronounced in CUR (41 %) than NSE (32 %) and GSE (14 %). CUR exhibited highest percentage antioxidant activity (87. 1 %) followed by NSE (77. 6 %) and GSE (61. 4 %) using phosphomolybdenum method. In Contrary, increased order of antioxidant activity using FTC-linoleic system was GSE > CUR > NSE. All the mentioned experiments were also conducted using vitamin E as a standard antioxidant. Strong linear regression between the total phenolic contents and above parameters in studied samples were noticed as indicated by high r 2 at P< 0. 0001 that was slightly low in DPPH. scavenging activity than the other analyses. ConclusionsOur results indicated that, reducing power and antioxidative potentials of GSE, NSE and CUR {{may be attributed to}} high total phenolic contents. GSE, NSE and CUR may be valuable as food preservative and nutritional health supplements...|$|E
