40|$|It {{has long}} been {{understood}} that different ways of speaking {{about the same thing}} may obtain drastically different psychological functions and, thereby, occasion different patterns of responding. Knowledge of this phenomenon has afforded powerful application in the rhetoric of political discourse. In this arena, increasing trends in Earth’s temperature may be called “global warming ” or “climate change”; dissenting citizens may be “revolutionaries ” or “gangs of thugs, ” and various positions on the inclusion of contraceptives in healthcare coverage may be “a war on women’s health ” or “an attack upon religious freedom”. In the age of twenty-four hour news and online social networking, such strategies for gaining political capital have never before been taken to greater extremes, and our opportunities to observe them have never been more frequent.

40|$|From recent commentaries {{about the}} role of basic <b>behavior</b> <b>scientists</b> in {{translational}} research, I distill some advice to young investigators who seek to apply their basic science training to translational studies. Among the challenges are (a) devising use-inspired research programs that complement, and are not redundant with, existing efforts in basic and applied behavior analysis; and (b) making tactical decisions, such as the selection of methods and collaborators, based on the research topic rather than, necessarily, the existing traditions in behavioral research. Finally, it must be recognized that although use-inspired basic research has the potential to attract support to basic laboratories and contribute to “saving the world,” neither of these outcomes is guaranteed. I discuss the relative risks for basic scientists who proceed with use-inspired basic research rather than ignore such translational questions...|$|R
40|$|To model <b>behavior,</b> <b>scientists</b> need to {{know how}} models behave. This means {{learning}} what other behaviors a model can produce besides the one generated by participants in an experiment. This is a difficult problem because of the complexity of psychological models (e. g., their many parameters) and because the behavioral precision of models (e. g., interval-scale performance) often mismatches their testable precision in experiments, where qualitative, ordinal predictions are the norm. Parameter space partitioning is a solution that evaluates model performance at a qualitative level. There exists a partition on the model’s parameter space that divides it into regions that correspond to each data pattern. Three application examples demonstrate its potential and versatility for studying the global behavior of psychological models. Mark A. Pitt, Woojae Kim, Daniel J. Navarro, and Jay I. Myun...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Behavioral Medicine (BM) is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{concerned with the}} development and integration of behavioral and biomedical sciences (Schwartz & Weiss, 1978 b). The interdisciplinary nature of the field poses barriers to researchers and practitioners interested in the field. While there are currently many disciplines {{that contribute to the}} field of behavioral medicine, this paper focuses exclusively on the relationships between the biological and psychological sciences, highlighting the theoretical similarities and differences. Our preliminary analysis of publications in each discipline revealed that while Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) had early influences in behavioral medicine and many <b>behavior</b> <b>scientists</b> recommend the collaboration between ABA and BM, {{the relationship between the two}} is tenuous. The roles of an applied behavior analyst and practitioner of behavioral medicine are largely the same, focused on the prevention and treatment of health conditions. These similarities provide excellent opportunity for collaborative work. The present theoretical analysis of BM examines contributions of ABA to BM and vice versa, discusses ABA’s history and current role within the field BM, and provides a rationale for the future collaboration between of behavior science and behavioral medicine...|$|R

40|$|Determining {{how much}} time animals spend eating could help animal caretakers {{identify}} sick livestock, improve management, and establish genetic differences within a herd. But first, a system is needed to monitor animal feeding <b>behavior.</b> <b>Scientists</b> at the Agricultural Research Service’s Roman L. Hruska U. S. Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, Nebraska, have developed a new system to monitor feeding behavior of feedlot cattle and grow-finish swine in a livestock industry setting. The system, created by agricultural engineers Tami Brown-Brandl and Roger Eigenberg in the center’s Environmental Management Research Unit, uses standard radio-frequency identification technology designed around a commercial reader. The technology includes an ear tag applied to each animal, monitoring equipment at the feeders, and data recording and storage. Eigenberg designed the hardware for the system, including a “multiplexer. ” Instead of a single unit that connects to a single antenna, the multiplexer functions as multiple switches—connecting the signal from the reader to the correct antenna. Software designed by Brown-Brandl controls the hardware, timing, and data recording and storage. “We can check antennas at a quick pace {{to determine if there}} is or isn’t an animal at each feeder space,” Brown-Brandl says. “This allows us to measure individual animal feeding behavior without influencing it. Once data is gathered and summarized, we can tell {{how much time}} each animal spent at the feeder. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Because making {{science is}} inescapably a special class of {{behaviors}} by people thereby called scientists, then a {{science of science}} inevitably will involve behaviorism. Behaviorism advises us always {{to look for the}} relevant reinforcers; and science behaviors apparently are often reinforced by the discovery of truthas scientists define it, and often by the accomplishment of usefulnessas society defines it. This paper discusses some responses that scientists have in common, and some contingencies which control the <b>behavior</b> of <b>scientists.</b> Key words: <b>Behavior</b> of scientists; behavior analysis; experimental proof; knowledge; unification of technology; unification of science; language of scientists; diversity and evolutionary niches; economics. To talk carelessly of the <b>behavior</b> of the <b>scientist</b> is to assume that there is just one way to do science, and that we should all do it alike. Presumably, behavior analysts would never make that assumption: We call ourselves scientists, and know our own behavior; and we know the behavior of other people who also call themselves scientists. They do their science differently from us. Either we agree that there are various ways to do science, or we declare our way definitive and tel...|$|R
