40|$|Classical {{theoretical}} {{treatments for}} diffusional deposition of particles in tube flow describe the losses within straight tubes. The plumbing in many systems of practical interest, notably aerosol instruments, consists of short segments of tubing connected by <b>elbows,</b> <b>bends,</b> and other disturbances. To understand the particle losses in such systems, particle losses in tube flows containing <b>bends</b> and <b>elbows</b> {{has been studied}} for Reynolds numbers ranging from 80 to 950. Monodisperse aerosol of 5 – 15 nm diameter particles passed through individual <b>bends</b> or <b>elbows,</b> and {{through a number of}} <b>bends</b> or <b>elbows</b> in series. The results show that the effect of <b>bends</b> and <b>elbows</b> on particle diffusion loss is significant. For a flow configuration with four elbows in series, the penetration efficiency drops as much as 44 % when compared to a straight tube with the same length. For Reynolds number smaller than 250, the enhancement of diffusion losses due to <b>bends</b> and <b>elbows</b> is sensitive to both the relative orientations of the <b>bends</b> and <b>elbows</b> and the lengths of straight tubing between them. Because of this sensitivity, direct calibration or simulation is required to assess nanoparticle penetration efficiencies for any flow system containing <b>bends</b> or <b>elbows</b> at low Reynolds number. When the Reynolds number exceeds 250, the enhancement is insensitive to the actual flow configurations. Experimental results are presented, which may be useful for design of aerosol flow systems at Reynolds number larger than 250...|$|R

The network structure for multi-layer perceptron is a fully connected one, while the structures used in radial basis functions network are both fully connected and partially connected.

40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} {{processes of}} elbows have some shortcomings {{such as the}} thickness of the convex side of elbows is less than that of the concave side of elbows. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the process of hot push <b>bending</b> <b>elbows</b> is introduced in this paper. By this process, the even thickness and strength elbows can be produced for modern industrial demands. Four fundamental hypotheses describing the forming characteristic of the elbows are put forward based on the experiment results in elbows forming process. Then, the relation among instantaneous curvature, diameter and thickness of the elbow is investigated, which is the key problem for manufacturing die. Finally, the process parameters CAD system of heated pushing elbows is developed. This CAD system has brought great economic and social benefit in industrial applications. ...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{manifolds}} {{are used}} to realize compact circuit layout, but may introduce a high pressure drop in the system. Their design is in fact oriented more toward achieving minimum size and weight than to reducing pressure losses. This work studies the pressure losses in hydraulic manifolds using different methods: Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis; semi-empirical formulation derived from the scientific literature, when available; and experimental characterization. The purpose is to obtain the pressure losses when the channels' connections within the manifold are not ascribable to the few classic cases studied in the literature, in particular for 90 ° <b>bends</b> (<b>elbows)</b> with expansion/contraction and offset intersection of channels. Moreover, since CFD analysis is used to predict pressure losses, general considerations of the manifold design may be outlined and this will help the design process in the optimization of flow passages. The main results obtained show how CFD analysis overestimates the experimental results; nevertheless, the numerical analysis represents the correct trends of the pressure losses...|$|R

The {{pressure drop in}} the vertical inlet tangent showed some significant differences to that found for straight vertical pipe. This {{was caused by the}} <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> partially choking the inflow resulting in a build-up of pressure and liquid in the vertical inlet riser and differences {{in the structure of the}} flow regimes when compared to the straight vertical pipe. The horizontal outlet tangent by contrast gave data in general agreement with literature even to exhibiting a drag reduction region at low liquid rates and gas velocities between 1 and 2 m s- 1. The <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> pressure drop was best correlated in terms of l(e) /d determined using the actual pressure loss in the inlet vertical riser. The data showed a general increase with fluid rates that tapered off at high fluid rates and exhibited a negative pressure region at low rates. The latter was attributed to the flow being smoothly accommodated by the bend when it passed from slug flow in the riser to smooth stratified flow in the outlet tangent. A general correlation was presented for the <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> pressure drop in terms of total Reynolds numbers. A modified Lockhart-Martinelli model gave prediction of the data...|$|R

The <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> tended to constrict the flow presented by the vertical inlet tangent leg while sometimes acting as a wave and droplet generator for the horizontal outlet tangent leg.

The <b>elbow</b> <b>bend</b> pressure drop was best presented as l e / d the equivalent length to diameter ratio using the actual total pressure drop in the vertical inlet tangent leg. Generally l e / d values rose with gas rate, but exhibited an increasingly complex relation with f o the oil to liquid volumetric ratio as liquid rate was increased. A significant maximum in l e / d was in evidence around the inversion from water dominated to oil dominated flows. Several models are presented to predict the data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric aerosol has {{significant}} impact on climate. It influences radiative transfer by scattering and absorbing sunlight and by changing the microphysical structure, lifetime, and amount of the clouds. Due to its short lifetime, the spatial and temporal distributions of tropospheric aerosol are highly inhomogeneous. Aircraft {{have proven to be}} an effective platform in characterizing the atmospheric aerosol. To maximize the potential and to reduce the artifacts associated with aircraft sampling, both improvements in existing instruments and developments of new instruments are required. To increase the speed of submicron aerosol size distribution measurements, a mixing condensation nucleus counter (MCNC) has been developed. By carefully designing the mixing chamber and condenser, the response time of the MCNC was significantly reduced. Our experiments demonstrate that a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) coupled with the developed MCNC can measure complete aerosol size distributions in as little as 2 seconds. The effects of <b>bends</b> and <b>elbows</b> on the diffusional losses of particle in nanometer range were studied. The results show that the effect of <b>bends</b> and <b>elbows</b> on particle diffusion loss is significant, and for Reynolds number smaller than 250, the enhancement of diffusion losses due to <b>bends</b> and <b>elbows</b> is sensitive to both the relative orientations of the <b>bends</b> and <b>elbows</b> and the lengths of straight tubing between them. Because of this sensitivity, direct calibration or simulation is required to assess nanoparticle penetration efficiencies for any flow system containing <b>bends</b> or <b>elbows</b> at low Reynolds number. When the Reynolds number exceeds 250, the enhancement is insensitive to the actual flow configurations. Experimental results are presented, which can be used for design of aerosol flow systems at Reynolds number larger than 250. To minimize the airborne sampling bias, an advanced differential mobility analyzer (DMA) system for measuring submicron aerosol size distribution at ambient relative humidity, with special attention to implementation on aircraft, has been developed. The system includes an active RH controller, a cylindrical differential mobility analyzer (CDMA), and a condensation nucleus counter. A cascade controller consisting of two PID modules maintains the RH inside the CDMA at ambient RH by actively adding or removing water vapor from the air stream. The flows are controlled with feedback PID controllers, which compensate for the variation of pressure as the aircraft changes altitude. This system was integrated into the CIRPAS Twin Otter aircraft and used to measure ambient size distributions during the Aerosol Characterization Experiment-Asia (ACE-Asia), carried out from March to May, 2001, in Japan. During the ACE-Asia experiment, the above DMA system, together with an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS), was used to characterize aerosol size distributions in East Asia during 19 flights on board of CIRPAS Twin Otter aircraft. Besides providing the aerosol size characteristics, the data were combined with chemical composition and aerosol mixing state measurements to predict the vertical profile of aerosol extinction, which was compared with those derived from simultaneous direct measurements of aerosol optical depth by the NASA 14 -channel sunphotometer. Agreement between the predicted and derived aerosol extinction varies for different scenarios, but the discrepancies were generally within the calculated uncertainties. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- This paper {{describes}} a three part analysis {{to characterize the}} interaction between the female upper extremity and a helicopter cockpit side airbag system and to develop dynamic hyperextension injury criteria for the female elbow joint. Part I involved a series of 10 experiments with an original Army Black Hawk helicopter side airbag. A 5 th percentile female Hybrid III instrumented upper extremity was used to demonstrate side airbag upper extremity loading. Two out of the 10 tests resulted in high <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> moments of 128 Nm and 144 Nm. Part II included dynamic hyperextension tests on 24 female cadaver elbow joints. The energy source was a drop tower utilizing a three-point bending configuration to apply <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> moments matching the previously conducted side airbag tests. Post-test necropsy showed that 16 of the 24 elbow joint tests resulted in injuries. Injury severity ranged from minor cartilage damage to more moderate joint dislocations and severe transverse fractures of the distal humerus. Peak <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> moments ranged from 42. 4 Nm to 146. 3 Nm. Peak bending moment proved to be a significant indicator of any elbow injury (p = 0. 02) as well as elbow joint dislocation (p = 0. 01). Logistic regression analyses were used to develop single and multiple variate injury risk functions. Using peak moment data for the entire test population, a 50 % risk of obtaining any elbow injury was found at 56 Nm while a 50 % risk of sustaining an elbow joint dislocation was found at 93 Nm for the female population. These results indicate that the peak <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> moments achieved in Part I are associated with a greater than 90 % risk for elbow injury. Subsequently, the airbag was re-designed in an effort to mitigate this a...|$|R
