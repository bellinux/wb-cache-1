25|$|O'Connor's own {{politics}} were liberal. He understood the Bunker character and played him {{not only with}} bombast and humor, but also with touches of vulnerability.

Although Bunker was famous for his malapropisms of the English language, O'Connor was highly educated and cultured and was an English professor <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> to acting.|$|E

Mishima's first published works included waka poetry, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> his attention to prose.|$|E
