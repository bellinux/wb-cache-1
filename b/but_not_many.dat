He arrived with 30men on January 19, where they found a force of 104men with a few weapons and a few cannons, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> supplies and little gunpowder. Houston {{knew that there were}} not enough men to hold the fort in an attack and had given Bowie authority to remove the artillery and blow up the fortification. Bowie and the Alamo commander, James C. Neill, decided they did not have enough oxen to move the artillery, and {{they did not want to}} destroy the fortress. On January 26, one of Bowie's men, James Bonham, organized a rally which passed a resolution in favor of holding the Alamo. Bonham signed the resolution first, with Bowie's signature second.|$|E

And then, too, the story of Llewelyn the Great and Joanna, King John’s illegitimate daughter, is a remarkable one, which struck an emotional chord with many readers.” ...|$|E

There have been good and wise kings <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>many</b> of them... and this I believe {{to be one of}} the worst." [...] On his death The Times captured elite opinion succinctly: [...] "There never was an individual less regretted by his fellow-creatures than this deceased king. What eye has wept for him? What heart has heaved one throb of unmercenary sorrow?... If he ever had a friend – a devoted friend in any rank of life – we protest that the name of him or her never reached us." [...] George IV was described as the [...] "First Gentleman of England" [...] on account of his style and manners. He possessed many good qualities; he was bright, clever, and knowledgeable. However, his laziness and gluttony led him to squander much of his talent. The Times wrote, he would always prefer [...] "a girl and a bottle to politics and a sermon".|$|E

An article [...] was written [...] in the Halifax Courier on 3 October 1914 when he was involved with the Harrow Dog Kennels, Halifax. Two dogs had been officially recruited at Halifax and given a constables number in the 1880s, so there was a long tradition of using them for whatever purpose long before other constabularies did. This tradition might well be the reason Harrow Kennels were considered important, and Richardson was known as being an advocate of the use of dogs to be properly trained in the detection of crime. Later in the local newspaper there were several articles about two Halifax Policemen who had joined up and were now in the trenches. A letter was written to the Chief Constable by them whilst serving with the British Expeditionary Force. They had written to Richardson thanking him for their Christmas gift.
