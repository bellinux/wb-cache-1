50|$|Usually {{conventional}} valves such as ball valves, piston valves or {{gate valves}} tend to fail when in process with the above-mentioned aggressive products. The {{reason is that}} the valve <b>body</b> <b>seat</b> or the gate/piston of the valves wears out too quickly and the valve can no longer shut off tightly, whereas air-operated pinch valves work without almost any wear of the elastic rubber hose because the kinetic energy of the solids are absorbed through the extremely high elasticity of the rubber that also helps to resist abrasion.|$|E
50|$|Seatbelts {{restrain}} the passengers so they don't {{fly through the}} windshield, and are in the correct position for the airbag and also spread the loading of impact on the <b>body.</b> <b>Seat</b> belts also absorb passenger inertial energy by being designed to stretch during an impact, again to reduce the speed differential between the passenger's body and their vehicle interior. In short: a passenger whose body is decelerated more slowly due to the crumple zone (and other devices) over a longer time survives much more often than a passenger whose body indirectly impacts a hard, undamaged metal car body which {{has come to a}} halt nearly instantaneously. It is like the difference between slamming someone into a wall headfirst (fracturing their skull) and shoulder-first (bruising their flesh slightly) is that the arm, being softer, has tens of times longer to slow its speed, yielding a little at a time, than the hard skull, which isn't in contact with the wall until it has to deal with extremely high pressures. The stretching of seatbelts while restraining occupants during an impact, means {{that it is necessary to}} replace them if a vehicle is repaired and put back on the road after a collision. They should also be replaced if their condition has deteriorated e.g. through fraying or mechanical or belt mounting faults. In New Zealand it is officially mandatory to replace worn inertia reel type seatbelts only with 'webbing grabber' type belts that have less play and are more effective on older cars. Newer cars have electronically fired pre-tension seatbelts that are timed to work with the airbag firing. Buying used seatbelts is not a good idea even in countries where it is legal to do so, because they may have already been stretched in an impact event and may not protect their new users as they should.|$|E

40|$|Identification of most {{probable}} {{ranges of}} biodynamic {{responses of the}} human body exposed to whole-body vibration is essential for developing effective integrated human-machine system design tools, improved vibration mitigation devices and frequency-weighting for exposure assessment. The international standard, ISO- 5982 (2001), defines such ranges for very limited conditions, namely for <b>body</b> <b>seated</b> without a back support and exposed to vertical vibration. The reported data on biodynamic responses of the seated and standing human body exposed to whole-body vibration along different directions and the associated experimental conditions are systematically reviewed in an attempt to identify datasets that are likely to represent comparable and practical postural and exposure conditions. Syntheses of datasets, {{selected on the basis of}} a set of criterion, are performed to identify the most probable ranges of biodynamic responses {{of the human body}} to whole-body vibration. These include the driving-point biodynamic responses of the <b>body</b> <b>seated</b> with and without a back support while exposed to fore-aft, lateral and vertical vibration and those of the standing body to vertical vibration, and seat-to-head vibration transmissibility of the <b>seated</b> <b>body.</b> The proposed ranges are expected to serve as reasonable target functions in various applications involving coupled human-system dynamics in the design process, and potentially for developing better frequency-weightings for exposure assessments...|$|R
