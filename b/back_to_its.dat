5|$|Hilda instructs Link to {{find and}} rescue the Seven Sages, who have been {{scattered}} across her kingdom, {{in order to gain}} the Triforce of Courage. With help from Ravio's services, Link accomplishes this and returns to Lorule Castle, where he discovers Hilda taking the Triforce of Wisdom from Zelda. Hilda reveals that Lorule fell into ruin after her ancestors destroyed their own Triforce. Deciding that in order to restore her kingdom <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> former glory, she needs Hyrule's Triforce, arranging everything so that Link would bring it to her. Hilda attempts to use Yuga to obtain the Triforce of Courage from Link, but Yuga betrays her and turns her into a painting, stealing the Triforce of Wisdom for himself. With Zelda's help, Link manages to defeat Yuga. He then restores Zelda and Hilda from their paintings. As Hilda feels bitter over her loss, Ravio, who is revealed to be Link's counterpart, convinces her that stealing Hyrule's Triforce isn't the right way to save Lorule, having secretly sought out Link to help her see the light.

With his quest completed, Link returns the Master Sword to its resting place once more.|$|E

The former route of US27 through downtown Marshall was then redesignated Bus. US27, using BL I-94 to connect to the new freeway carrying US27 west of downtown. This arrangement lasted until 1972 when the Bus. US27 designation was decommissioned and the section of highway between BL I-94 and I-94 turned over to local control.|$|E
