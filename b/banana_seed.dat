40|$|Banana is {{the common}} name for {{herbaceous}} plants of the genus Musa and for the fruit they produce. It {{is one of the}} oldest cultivated plants. All parts of the banana plant have medicinal applications: the flowers in bronchitis and dysentery and on ulcers; cooked flowers are given to diabetics; the astringent plant sap in cases of hysteria, epilepsy, leprosy, fevers, hemorrhages, acute dysentery and diarrhea, and it is applied on hemorrhoids, insect and other stings and bites; young leaves are placed as poultices on burns and other skin afflictions; the astringent ashes of the unripe peel and of the leaves are taken in dysentery and diarrhea and used for treating malignant ulcers; the roots are administered in digestive disorders, dysentery and other ailments; <b>banana</b> <b>seed</b> mucilage is given in cases of diarrhea in India. Antifungal and antibiotic principles are found in the peel and pulp of fully ripe bananas. The antibiotic acts against Mycobacteria. A fungicide in the peel and pulp of green fruits is active against a fungus disease of tomato plants. Norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin are also present in the ripe peel and pulp. The first two elevate blood pressure; serotonin inhibits gastric secretion and stimulates the smooth muscle of the intestines...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the effect of acid and hot water {{treatment}} on the wild <b>banana</b> <b>seed</b> germination rate and to identify the faster technique to increase the germination in vitro percent. Seed were treated using three techniques which is Nursery, Seed culture and Embryo Culture. In nursery involved four different of treatment that is scarification with 10 % HCI and 10 % H 2 SO 4 for 15 min; hot water treatment for 40 °C and 60 °C for 14 hours and 8 hours respectively. For the Seed Culture by in vitro technique involved six different of treatment that is scarification with 10 % HCI, 15 % HCI, 10 % H 2 SO 4, 15 % H 2 SO 4 for 15 min; hot water treatment for 40 °C and 60 °C for 14 hours and 8 hours respectively. By in vitro embryo culture technique involved two different of technique that is embryo culture halves cutting and Zygotic embryo culture. The percentages of germination in H 2 SO 4 treated seeds were higher (20 %) than in HCI treated seeds (18 %). High germination of zygotic embryo rescue technique had been observed with the percentage of 28. 86 % and followed by the embryo recue halves cutting technique about 28. 67 %. The zygotic embryo rescue technique is the best way to increase the germination rate wild banana seeds compared to in vivo technique...|$|E

40|$|Two {{distinct}} technique, in vivo and {{in vitro}} technique (embryo rescue) {{were applied to}} determine which one {{is the best way}} to germine wild <b>banana</b> <b>seeds</b> for research purpose. This research also includes the comparison of germination rate of highland banana and lowland banana, the morphology and characteristic of each seed and embryo and also dormancy state of Musa acuminata spp. malaccensis. Study on in vitro technique had been carried out on three population collected from three different locations. Two populations were collected from the lowland area alleviation of 98 m (Meranto and Jeli population) and the other population was collected from highland area alleviation of 387 m (Gunung Chamah). The media culture used is MS supplemented with 2 mg of BAP hormones. The in vivo technique, studies were carried only in lowland wild banana (Meranto population) by sowing seeds in two type of medium, mix soil and sand, to study the relationships between medium and the rate of seed germination. High scale mass of wild banana plantlets can be produce by using in vitro technique compare to in vivo technique. However, the micro propagation will succeeded if the level of contamination occurred can be controlled. Highland banana and lowland banana has greater differences between their characteristics. Highland banana have small size of seeds, and flattened embryo-shaped while lowland banana have quite bigger size of seeds, and mushroom like shape of embryo. Those characteristics were influenced the sterilization technique of culture initiation. Mix of sand and compost has a good potential to support the growth of wild <b>banana</b> <b>seeds</b> compare to sand medium...|$|R

50|$|Musa balbisiana is {{a species}} of wild banana native to eastern South Asia, {{northern}} Southeast Asia, and southern China.

It grows lush leaves in clumps with a more upright habit than most cultivated bananas. Flowers grow in inflorescences coloured red to maroon. The fruit are between blue and green. They are considered inedible because of the seeds they contain. It may be assumed that wild bananas were cooked and eaten or agriculturalists would not have developed the cultivated <b>banana.</b> <b>Seeded</b> Musa balbisiana fruit are called butuhan ('with seeds') in the Philippines, and kluai tani (กล้วยตานี) in Thailand.

40|$|Fusarium Wilt {{becomes one}} of lethal disease and gives worst {{scenario}} to banana plantation industry.

The wild progenitors of the cultivated bananas co-evolved with the F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Vakili, 1965) offering a possible source of resistance to the Fusarium wilt disease. Embryo culture technique (in vitro) is a valuable and best tool for breeding purpose by exploiting genetic variation of wild banana. Two samples of wild banana Musa acuminata spp. malaccensis were harvested from two different sites that showed an early sign of Fusarium disease at Dabong, Gua Musang. Seeds from both samples were extracted from the matured fruit bunch and undergone two different sterilization treatments whether with 3 % sodium hypochlorite or 70 % ethanol.

50|$|One major {{impediment}} in breeding bananas is polyploidy; Gros Michel and Cavendish bananas are triploid {{and thus}} attempts at meiosis in the plant's ovules cannot produce a viable gamete. Only rarely does the first reduction division in meiosis in the plants' flowers tidily fail completely, {{resulting in a}} euploid triploid ovule, which can be fertilized by normal haploid pollen from a diploid banana variety; a whole stem of bananas would contain only a few seeds and sometimes none.
