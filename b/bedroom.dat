5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's <b>bedroom</b> door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the <b>bedroom</b> to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the <b>bedroom</b> window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the <b>bedroom</b> window.|$|E

5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master <b>bedroom,</b> which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the <b>bedroom</b> door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her <b>bedroom</b> door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
