40|$|The {{cultivation}} {{of the sugar}} beet in warm regions has been encouraged {{for the purpose of}} decreasing importation of sugar and of utilizing by-products of the sugar beet cultivation to live-stock feeding. With a view to making clear the chemical composition and the feeding value of by-products of the sugar beet cultivated in warm regions, some experiments have been made. The results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) No distinct variation in chemical composition of sugar <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> could be found between the various varieties, nor between <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> harvested at different times. Crude protein content of blades was over 20 per cent. (2) Oxalic acid contents in various parts of sugar beets were determined. (cf. Table 4). <b>Beet</b> <b>tops</b> contained 0. 25 - 0. 51 per cent. oxalic acid. In <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> of such varieties as KL-E. Verna and Polish content of oxalic acid was comparatively high, but in those of KL-AA and Cesena rather low. (cf. Table 5). (3) Carotene content was 2. 9 mg. / 100 g. in <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> in the bolting Period and 2. 7 mg. / 100 g. in beet top silage. (4) The results of digestion experiments on rabbits using <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> (with dry matter content 12. 2 percent.) showed that the digestibility of organic matter was 91. 7 per cent; the digestible crude protein was 1. 64 per cent. and the total digestible nutrient 9. 5 per cent. (cf. Tables 6 and 7). (5) The beet top silage made without any additive had a satisfactory pH 4. 09, and contained 2. 65 per cent. lactic acid, 0. 47 per cent. acetic acid, and 0 per cent. butyric acid. The rate of ammoniacal nitrogen to the total nitrogen was 5 per cent. The silage seemed to be palatable to live-stock. (6) Oxalic acid content of the beet top silage was 0. 43 per cent. It was found that about thirty percent of oxalic acid diminished during storage. (7) The results of digestion experiments with the beet top silage on rabbits are shown in Table 12. Contents of dry matter, digestible crude protein and the total digestible nutrient of the silage were 13. 5, 1. 5 and 9. 6 per cent. respectively.

40|$|The {{authors have}} already {{published}} {{a report on}} the feeding values of by-products of sugar beet cultivation in warm regions. This is the report of some experiments successively made on the feeding values of beet top silage, sun-cured <b>beet</b> <b>tops,</b> beet pulp silage and beet pulp. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) The beet top silage made without any additive had a good value of pH 3. 7, and contained 3. 6 per cent lactic acid and 0 per cent butyric acid. Pro-vitamin A content of the beet top silage was 1 - 2 mg. per 100 g. The silage was found to be a favourite feed with live-stock. Beet top silage contained 544 mg. oxalic acid per 100 g. The nutrient loss in fermentation process was 24 per cent in organic matter and 9 per cent in crude protein. The results of digestion experimets on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 78 per cent; the digestible crude protein was 2 per cent and the total digestible nutrient 10. 4 per cent(cf. Table 9). 2) The <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> lost 24 per cent of organic matter, 17 per cent of crude protein and 86 per cent of carotene during 10 days of sun-curing. The results of digestion experiments on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 66 per cent, lower than that of fresh <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> or beet top silage. The sun-cured <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> were less palatable to rabbits than the fresh <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> or the beet top silage. The contents of digestible crude protein and total digestible nutrient were 8. 4 per cent and 42. 0 per cent respectively. 3) A good silage was able to be prepared from beet pulp. Furthermore, addition of morea in silage-making with the beet pulp was effective and the morea added silage was palatable to live-stock; it had the following properties: pH 4. 15, lactic acid 1. 89 per cent. acetic acid 0. 25 per cent and butyric acid 0 per cent. The results of digestion trials on goats are shown in Table 19. The digestible crude protein and the total digestible nutrient were respectively 1. 8 per cent and 13. 5 per cent. 4) The digestible crude protein and the total digestible nutrient of dried beet pulp were respectively 5. 9 per cent and 69. 0 per cent. 5) The rsults of digestion trials by chromic oxide method using goats as experimental animals were compared with those obtained by the total collection method(cf.

40|$|In {{order to}} find the {{fundamental}} principle of the technics of silage-making and also the factors governing quality of silage, samples of the silage made at the experimental farm of this university, were analyzed. In the first experiments corn was ensiled in a tower silo (2. 5 m× 7 m), and samples of the resulted silage were taken seven times as the consumption of silage progressed. The samples from each layer {{were divided into two}} groups, the central and circumferential portions (Fig. 1). In the second experiments a mixture of corn and green soybeans was ensiled in the silo and samples of the resulted silage were taken from three parts, i. e. the top, the middle, and the bottom layers (Fig. 2). In each sample the chemical composition, especialiy the contents of organic acids, the total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen as well as the pH value were determined in the usual manner. It was found that the differences in quality and nutrient contents were not significant, although a slight difference was sometimes found when the resulted silage was not of good quality. In further investigation conducted with the bag sample method, also, the results were almost the same. Small scale experiments of silage-making were carried out with "Sekishomo", Vallisneria spralis L. var. asiatica MAKINO, cale, alfalfa, the peel of "Hassaku", a variety of citrus, the peel of "Unshiu", Citrus Unshiu MAKINO, <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> and mint feed, i. e. the residual of distillation of mint for obtaining menthol and mint oil. Satisfactory silages were found to be prepared from peel of Unshiu, peel of Hassaku, cale, <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> and mint feed, but not from Sekishomo. The peels of Unshiu and Hassaku gave fragrant and paratable products rich lactic acid, free of butyric acid, and of pH between 3. 1 and 3. 8. The silage prepared from the peel of Unshiu contained dry matter 23. 35, crude protein 2. 03, ether extract 0. 45, N-free extract 10. 08, crude fiber 0. 35, and ash 0. 89 per cent. The digestibility of the protein in these silages was determined by the usual WEDEMEYER method (Table 14). The protein of the silages Prepared from cale, peels of both Unshiu and Hassaku, and <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> possessed a satisfactory digestibility, but that of Sekishomo and mint feed did not.

Crops with lower risk of negative environmental impact in cultivation, such as ley and hemp, produced {{less than half the}} methane energy yield per hectare. Triticale, also having less risk of negative environmental impact, gave an energy yield similar to that of winter wheat grain and maize. Replacing most of the mineral fertiliser with biogas digestate did not, with the exception for hemp, influence crop yields per hectare, but energy input in cultivation decreased by on average 34 % for the six crops tested.

For maize, <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> and first and second year ley, the feedstock costs were lower, and for triticale much lower. When ensiled crops were used for biogas the feedstock costs increased and only those of triticale silage remained slightly lower than the cost of dried wheat grain.

40|$|Successful growing {{of spring}} barley for malting {{purposes}} depends on many factors. The yield and its stability {{as well as}} grain quality are of great im-portance to growers. A critical role is ascribed to the previous crop and besides, time and method of its harvest, soil tillage and the method used to manage organic matter from the preceding harvest. These factors affect nutrient content in the soil environ-ment, availability to the root system of spring barley, physical properties of the soil and health status of the crop stand. Here, an important role is played by the variety and its genetically determined resistance to diseases, a course of weather conditions during the year and relevant occurrence of diseases. There are very good conditions for growing spring barley for malting in several regions in the Czech Republic. In the past, cultivation of barley in these regions was based on good crop rotations, where high quality of malting varieties was given by quality of the previous crop. The previous crops, which are mostly used now, were considered less favourable (oilseed rape) and barley was not grown after them at all. Farmers, being under economical pressure, grow barley even af-ter summer intercrops. Furthermore, the barley management practice using the traditional previ-ous crop sugar beet {{is not the same}} either, since <b>beet</b> <b>tops</b> are not harvested and producers have reduced a tillage system.
