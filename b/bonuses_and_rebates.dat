40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this paper}} is to study <b>bonus</b> <b>and</b> <b>rebate</b> for {{exclusive}} dealers in GSM sector in Turkey, for which operators and handset manufacturers provide special incentives to dealers for exceeding specific sales targets. They develop a theoretical model of dealers and manufacturer behavior based on observations about key aspects of the mobile phone market. The analysis provides important insights about sales bonus. For example, rebate is not preferred by the owners of dealers instead of bonuses. The authors find empirical support when they test the theoretical results...|$|R
50|$|In the U.S.A., home {{fuel cells}} are {{eligible}} for substantial incentives <b>and</b> <b>rebates</b> at {{both the state and}} federal levels as a part of renewable energy policy. For example, the California Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) rebate ($2,500 per kW) and Federal Tax Credits ($1,000 per kW residential and $3,000 per kW commercial) will significantly reduce the net capital cost to the customer. For businesses, additional cash advantages can be realized from <b>bonus</b> <b>and</b> accelerated depreciation of fuel cells.|$|R

40|$|All U.

The difference between the take fee <b>and</b> make <b>rebate</b> is an important source of revenue for the exchange and competition among exchanges results in a high correlation between an exchange’s fee <b>and</b> its <b>rebate.</b> Thus, venues charging high take fees also tend to pay large liquidity rebates.

40|$|Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) {{are popular}} worldwide. Especially in Korea, {{there were about}} 19 million gamers in 2006. Despite this wide popularity, some players have become seriously {{addicted}} to online games, causing a serious social problem. However, studies and/or trials to address game addiction problems have rarely been performed. In this paper, we investigate the relationships among interested parties in the game industry and propose a base model to explain them. From the base model, we expect that casual gamers increase until some point of time, but decline afterward. The growth rate of total revenue from online games is decreased due to a reduced number of casual gamers over time and a negative image of online games. To resolve game addiction problems, we analyzed a self regulation policy and a tax <b>and</b> <b>rebate</b> policy in the base model. Through {{the analysis of the}} policies, we found that a tax <b>and</b> <b>rebate</b> policy is preferable to a self regulation policy. Under the tax <b>and</b> <b>rebate</b> policy, the total revenue of online games increases contrary to the concern of game companies, the social image of online games is improved and the number of game addicts decreases...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the manufacturers' strategy of optimizing the direct rebate {{to the final}} customer and the wholesale price to a profit-maximizing retailer with a price-dependent stochastic demand. The manufacturer possesses full information about the cost and the functional relationship among demand, price <b>and</b> <b>rebate,</b> but {{may or may not}} know {{about the nature of the}} underlying demand uncertainty faced by the retailer. The conditions under which a retailer benefits from passing on such information are identified. The main features of the model are illustrated analytically and numerically, using linear or iso-elastic demand functions, with additive or multiplicative error structures. Several important implications have been derived, especially those dealing with price <b>and</b> <b>rebate</b> pass-throughs <b>and</b> with the cost to the manufacturer of asymmetric information. ...|$|R

Thus, tying, bundling, <b>and</b> loyalty/requirement <b>rebates</b> can be used to extract consumer surplus and enhance profit of firms with market power.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the stock price}} liquidity changes before <b>and</b> after the <b>bonus</b> <b>and</b> rights issue announcements. Liquidity measured using raw trading volume ratio, relative trading volume ratio and liquidity ratio suggest that raw trading volume and relative trading volume have decreased around <b>bonus</b> <b>and</b> rights announcements.

There is evidence of negative and significant decrease in stock price liquidity for <b>bonus</b> <b>and</b> rights issue announcements similar to other issue announcements in US, UK and other emerging economies. The results support cash substitution hypothesis and signaling theory but rejects liquidity hypothesis with respect to <b>bonus</b> <b>and</b> rights issue announcements. ...|$|R
