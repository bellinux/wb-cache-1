Questions as to how the ruling {{government would}} fund this policy have been raised. Policy Think Tank, IMANI Ghana has already questioned how the government will fund the policy. However, former Director-General of the Ghana Education Service, Charles Aheto-Tsegah said the government’s decision to roll out the free Senior High School education policy this year is feasible but there must be some changes in the national <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure.</b> Senior minister, Minister Yaw Osafo Marfo, said the Heritage Fund which receives nine percent of the country’s annual petroleum revenue will be used to sustain the program. Minority leader, Haruna Iddrisu disagreed saying government’s decision to tap into reserved oil revenue (Heritage Fund) to finance its free senior high school (SHS) policy would be fatal for Ghana’s future because it might compromise the safety of the country as it was set aside to serve as a buffer during challenging economic times. The President said, “By free SHS, we mean that in addition to tuition, which is already free, there will be no admission fees, no library fees, no science center fees, no computer laboratory fees, no examination fees, no utility fees. There will be free textbooks, free boarding and free meals and day students will get a meal at school for free. “Free SHS will also cover agricultural, vocational and technical institutions at the high school level".|$|E

The empirical analysis makes use of linear and nonlinear Granger causality tests to evaluate the applicability of Wagner’s Law {{and that of the}} contrasting Keynesian theory. We employ aggregate and disaggregate data with the sub-categories of most important <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure,</b> including health care and social security, education and science, national defence and public security expenditure and government administration expenditure for the period Q 1 2000 to Q 3 2008. This causality analysis indicates that total relation between <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> and economic growth is consistent with Keynesian theory. The results of our computations have important policy implications. In case of Poland the health care expenditure was found to be as important for economic growth as expenditures on education and science. Furthermore, in order to stimulate economic growth, Polish government should consider reallocating some of national defence, public security and government administration expenditure to health care, social security, education and science expenditure. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causal links between {{different}} kinds of <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> and the economic growth of Poland.

We based our research on aggregate and disaggregate quarterly data with the sub–division of public expenditure on human resources (HR), physical resources (PR), net interest payment (NIP) and other remaining <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> (OTHER) for the period Q 1 2000 to Q 3 2008. Linear causality analysis showed that relation between total <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> and economic growth is consistent with Keynesian theory. However, for the examined sub–categories of expenditure mixed results were reported supporting Keynesian theory (NIP), Wagner’s Law (OTHER) or none of them (HR and PR). Results of nonlinear causality analysis performed for unfiltered data also provided some support for Keynesian theory (HR and OTHER). However, after GARCH(1, 1) –filtration of data nonlinear causality was not reported in any case. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the main effects of the current global {{financial}} and economic crisis on the European Union budget and the measures that were taken in order to support the EU member states with the purpose of limiting and counteracting its effects. The focus will be on the <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> and on the new Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance. For this purpose, we developed a regression model using the Least Square method with three significant variables: a dependent variable – EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> and two independent variables – budgetary deficit and unemployment rate of member states. According to our analysis, the crisis determined the increase of the EU <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure,</b> which was due especially to the increase of the budgetary deficit and rising unemployment in the EU member states. Our findings suggested that the budgetary deficit and the unemployment rate had a highly significant influence on community expenditure growth during the crisis, while the GDP growth and the public debt did not have any significance for the community expenditure growth. </p...|$|E

Secondary {{data in the}} form of <b>budgetary</b> <b>expenditure</b> records were obtained from various publications of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Federal of Statistics (FOS). Results from the fitted trend equations showed that budgetary expenditures on agriculture were generally low and insignificant (p> 0. 05). Annual compound growth rate of expenditure on the sector was also low (1. 02 %) and fluctuating for the entire period under review. Furthermore, the fitted quadratic equations in time variable showed the absence of either significant acceleration or deceleration in expenditure growth on agriculture. This, therefore, confirms that expenditure growth on agriculture had been stagnant, suggesting a case of financial neglect of the sector. Based on these findings, the study recommends deliberate efforts by Government to increase funds to agriculture in order to boost self-sufficiency in food production and reduce poverty in Nigeria...|$|E
