50|$|Another {{modification}} was a non-powered <b>bulb</b> <b>exposure.</b> This was {{a popular}} request from astronomers that needed the camera to expose for times greater that the batteries could allow. The demand for this modification was reduced when {{the availability of a}} third party adapter plate that could override the need for a battery and force the shutters to lock open and release by simple using two cable releases.|$|E
5000|$|The term bulb is a {{reference}} to old-style pneumatically actuated shutters; squeezing an air bulb would open the shutter, and releasing the bulb would close it. According to the Focal Encyclopedia of Photography: <b>BULB</b> <b>EXPOSURE</b> (B). Another term for a brief exposureâ€”in which the shutter remains open only {{so long as the}} shutter release is held down. The word originated with the early pneumatic shutter release.|$|E
50|$|JanLeonardo {{started off}} as a self-educated person in photography, preferably working at nighttime. Later on he became {{assistant}} of Reinhart-Wolf- Award laureate Stephan Meyer-Bergfeld. As an artist he works exclusively with <b>bulb</b> <b>exposure</b> in darkness or nighttime since 2005. His personal challenge is patterned, controlled and choreographed artificial light, staged and organized in a performance. His photographies are easily mixed up with photos altered by image editing or digital images from scratch. He lives {{in the town of}} Bremen.|$|E
50|$|All {{kinds of}} light (sunlight, {{artificial}} light, spotlights) can be harmful. Light {{can result in}} fading, darkening, bleaching, and cellulose breakdown. Some inks and other pigments will fade if exposed to light, especially ultraviolet (UV) light present in normal daylight and from fluorescent <b>bulbs.</b> Any <b>exposure</b> to light can cause damage, as the effects are cumulative and cannot be reversed. Minimal or no exposure to light is ideal.|$|R

The drawbacks/breakthroughs encountered when going on the way of a greener approach are discussed. Examples of recent achievements are presented...|$|R
50|$|The Minolta 5000, Minolta's {{entry level}} camera and {{essentially}} a downscaled 7000, {{was released in}} 1986. It featured shutter speeds of 1/2000 to 4 seconds and <b>BULB,</b> center-weighted lightmetering, <b>exposure</b> compensation of +1EV, flashsync speed of 1/100s and fully automatic programs.|$|R
5000|$|SQ-B (Basic): Introduced April 1996, {{production}} discontinued December 2003. The SQ-B was a manually operating SLR {{evolved from the}} SQ-Ai, built to primarily satisfy the needs of professional [...] "studio" [...] photographers who work with hand-held light meters, studio or portable flash equipment and various other accessories. Thus, motorized film-advance and through-the-lens metering (TTL) functionality were not present, as well as B (<b>bulb</b> <b>exposure)</b> and T (time exposure), as found on other SQ-series models. T (time exposure), however, was available when utilizing the appropriate SQ-series Zenzanon-S/PS lenses which incorporated the time (T) exposure lever function; by default the Zenzanon-PS/B 80mm f/2.8 lens which accompanied the SQ-B model did not include this feature. All SQ-series accessories and lenses were interchangeable with the SQ-B with few exceptions.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNewly {{developed}} benzophenone derivatives {{in combination}} with an iodonium salt (and optionally Nvinylcarbazole) or amines {{have been used as}} photoinitiating systems. Their abilities to initiate cationic photopolymerization of epoxides and/or radical photopolymerization of acrylates under very soft visible halogen lamp, LED and laser diodes irradiations have been investigated. One of them (BPD 5) is particularly efficient for the cationic and radical photopolymerization of an epoxide/acrylate blend in a one-step hybrid cure and leads to the formation of an interpenetrated polymer network IPN upon the house hold blue LED <b>bulb</b> <b>exposure</b> (1 min for getting tack free coatings). The performances attained with some derivatives are better than those obtained with camphorquinone, used as reference photoinitiator, highlighting their high initiating abilities. These systems can be useful to overcome the oxygen inhibition for very low light intensity. The photochemical mechanisms are studied by molecular orbital calculations, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, and steady state photolysis techniques...|$|E
50|$|Common {{sources of}} mercury {{exposure}} include mining, production, and transportation of mercury, {{as well as}} mining and refining of gold and silver ores.

50|$|Because {{exposure}} {{times for}} star trail photographs can be several hours long, camera batteries {{can be easily}} depleted. Mechanical cameras {{that do not require}} a battery to open and close the shutter have an advantage over more modern film and digital cameras which utilize battery power. On these cameras, the <b>Bulb,</b> or B, <b>exposure</b> setting is used to keep the shutter open. Another problem that digital cameras encounter is an increase in detector noise with increasing exposure time.|$|R
40|$|In bulb farming {{the use of}} {{pesticides}} for crop protection and bulb disinfection is extensive. To estimate long-term occupational exposure to pesticides, generic levels of exposure specific to the method of working were needed. In order to derive these values, dermal and inhalation exposure was the fungicide mixture zineb/maneb was assessed for different methods of mixing and loading a wettable powder formulation. Further, dermal exposure was also assessed for two methods of disinfection of <b>bulbs.</b> Observed <b>exposure</b> was {{expressed in terms of}} method-specific levels of exposure, which makes it possible to compare exposure resulting from different methods of working, with respect to the amount of pesticide handled, or whether ladling the pesticide with a scoop or dipping the bulbs using baskets resulted in high exposure. Moreover, the relative importance of dermal and inhalation exposure routes was estimated. The results show that during mixing and loading with bare hands dermal exposure is by far the greater contributor (> 99 %) to the total estimated exposure. Comparing these results and also some preliminary results of the dermal protection provided by working gloves, with tentative health-based limit values of exposure, emphasize the need for a programme on appropriate dermal protection...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory {{perception}} initiates in {{the nasal}} epithelium wherefrom olfactory receptor neurons-expressing the same receptor protein-project and converge {{in two different}} glomeruli within each olfactory bulb. Recent evidence suggests that glomeruli are isolated functional units, arranged in a chemotopic manner in the olfactory <b>bulb.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to odorants leads to the activation of specific populations of glomeruli. In rodents, about 25 - 50 mitral/tufted cells project their primary dendrites to a single glomerulus receiving similar sensory input. Yet, {{little is known about}} the properties of neighboring mitral/tufted cells connected to one or a few neighboring glomeruli. We used tetrodes to simultaneously record multiple single-unit activity in the mitral cell layer of anesthetized, freely breathing rats while exposed to mixtures of chemically related compounds. First, we characterized the odorant-induced modifications in firing rate of neighboring mitral/tufted cells and found that they do not share odorant response profiles. Individual units showed a long silent (11. 01 ms) period with no oscillatory activity. Cross-correlation analysis between neighboring mitral/tufted cells revealed negligible synchronous activity among them. Finally, we show that respiratory-related temporal patterns are dissimilar among neighboring mitral/tufted cells and also that odorant stimulation results in an individual modification that is not necessarily shared by neighboring mitral/tufted cells. These results show that neighboring mitral/tufted cells frequently exhibit dissimilar response properties, which are not consistent with a precise chemotopic map at the mitral/tufted cell layer in the olfactory bulb...|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study on the}} stability of Le Fort III midface advancement with distraction in craniofacial dysostosis. Twenty-six surgical procedures for midface advancement were performed between 2000 and 2009. Subjects were 14 consecutive patients who underwent Le Fort III osteotomy with midface advancement using a rigid external distraction device (Synthes) in the Department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery of the University "Sapienza" of Rome. In this study, 8 patients (n = 3 females, n = 5 males) affected by craniofacial dysostosis (Crouzon, n = 5; Apert, n = 3; Pfeiffer syndrome, n = 1; and other, n = 1) were {{selected on the basis}} of age and radiologic documentation. The mean age at the time of the procedure was 8. 6 years, and all the patients had at least 1 year of follow-up after distraction. The radiologic documentation of each case was composed of posteroanterior and lateral cephalograms preoperatively (T 1), at the time of removal of the distractor device (T 2), and at follow-up (T 3). The average latency period before activation of the distractor was 5 days. The device was activated on an average of 15 mm (range, 7 - 22 mm) as recorded on the device at a rate of 1 mm/d. Activation period ranged from 7 to 15 days, and the consolidation period was 8 to 12 weeks. Seven anatomic landmarks and 5 cephalometric measurements were identified on the lateral cephalograms at each of the 3 time periods. The cephalograms underwent digital analysis via Dolphin imaging digitalization software by 2 operators independently. The displacement of each identified landmark was recorded and examined in relation to their position at each time point. Cephalometric analysis revealed stability of Le Fort III midface advancement during follow-up. However, bone growth after midface advancement is limited, and as reported in the literature, almost no spontaneous growth is present because of the intrinsic nature of malformations. Patients treated in the growing age benefit from midface advancement, with resolution of exophthalmos, ocular <b>bulb</b> <b>exposure,</b> airway impairment, and good aesthetic outcome...|$|E
5000|$|The {{time for}} which a shutter remains open (exposure time, often called [...] "shutter speed") is {{determined}} by a timing mechanism. These were originally pneumatic (Compound shutter) or clockwork, but since {{the late twentieth century}} are mostly electronic. Mechanical shutters typically had a Time setting, where the shutter opened when the button was pressed and remained open until it was pressed again, Bulb where the shutter remained open as long as the button was pressed (originally actuated by squeezing an actual rubber <b>bulb),</b> and Instantaneous <b>exposure,</b> with settings ranging from 30" [...] to 1/4000" [...] for the best leaf shutters, faster for focal-plane shutters, and more restricted for basic types. The reciprocal of exposure time in seconds is often used for engraving shutter settings. For example, a marking of [...] "250" [...] denotes 1/250". This does not cause confusion in practice.|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{point to}} an {{important}} role for the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) in regulating sexual behavior in male mice. We asked whether sexual experience could compensate for the disruptive effects of lesioning the MOE on sexual behavior in male mice. Male mice, which were either sexually naive or experienced, received an intranasal irrigation of either a zinc sulfate solution to destroy the MOE or saline. Sexual behavior in mating tests with an estrous female was completely abolished in zinc sulfateâ€“ treated male mice regardless of whether subjects were sexually experienced or not before the treatment. Furthermore, zinc sulfate treatment clearly disrupted olfactory investigation of both volatile and nonvolatile odors. Destruction of the MOE by zinc sulfate treatment was confirmed by {{a significant reduction in}} the expression of Fos protein in the main olfactory <b>bulb</b> fol-lowing <b>exposure</b> to estrous female urine. By contrast, vomeronasal function {{did not seem to be}} affected by zinc sulfate treatment: nasal application of estrous female urine induced similar levels of Fos protein in the mitral and granule cells of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) of zinc sulfate â€“ and saline-treated males. Likewise, the expression of soybean agglutinin, which stains the axons of vomeronasal organ neurons projecting to the glomerular layer of the AOB, was similar in zinc sulfate â€“ and saline-treated male mice. These results show that the main olfactory system is essential for the expression of sexual behavior in male mice and that sexual experience does not overcome the disruptive effects of MOE lesioning on this behavior. Key words: main olfactory system, male mice, sexual behavior, sexual experience, zinc sulfat...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{found that}} female aromatase knockout (ArKO) mice showed less investigation of socially relevant odours {{as well as}} reduced sexual behaviour. We now ask whether these behavioural deficits {{might be due to}} an inadequate processing of odours in female ArKO mice. Therefore, we exposed female ArKO mice to same- and opposite-sex urinary odours and determined the expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos along the main and accessory olfactory projection pathways. We included ArKO males in the present study as we previously observed that they show female-typical detection thresholds of urinary odours, suggesting a role for perinatal oestrogens in these behavioural responses. No sex or genotype differences were observed in the olfactory <b>bulb</b> after urine <b>exposure.</b> By contrast, sex differences in c-Fos responses were observed in wild-type (WT) mice following exposure to male urine in the more central regions of the olfactory pathway; only WT females showed a significant Fos induction in the amygdala, central medial pre-optic area and ventromedial hypothalamus. However, ArKO females did not show a c-Fos response to male odours in the ventromedial hypothalamus, suggesting that the processing of male odours is affected in ArKO females and thus that oestrogens may be necessary for the development of neural responses to sexually relevant odours in female mice. By contrast, c-Fos responses to either male or oestrous female urine were very similar between ArKO and WT males, pointing to a central role of androgen vs. oestrogen signalling in the male circuits that control olfactory investigation and preferences.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the neuroendocrine mechanism of the mating behavior in the adult male mandarin voles Microtus mandarinus, the radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochemistry methods were used {{to investigate the}} differences in plasma testosterone (T) concentrations and distribution of T immunoreactive neurons (T-IRs), androgen receptor immunoreactive neurons (AR-IRs) and Fos protein immunoreactive neurons (Fos-IRs) in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and the main olfactory <b>bulb</b> (MOB) following <b>exposure</b> to clean hard-wood shavings (control group), soiled bedding (exposure group) or contact with an estrous female (mating group). Results showed that plasma T concentration was significantly higher in the mating group than that in the exposure group, and both the mating group and the exposure group displayed significantly higher plasma T concentration than the control group. T-IRs, AR-IRs and Fos-IRs were investigated with the immunohistochemistry method in granule cell (GC) and mitral cell (MC) of the MOB and the AOB in the three groups. There were significantly more T-IRs, AR-IRs and Fos-IRs in MC and GC of the AOB in the mating group than that in the exposure group or the control group. T-IRs, AR-IRs and Fos-IRs did not show {{significant differences between the}} exposure group and the control group. Furthermore, obvious differences in MC and GC of the MOB were not found among the three groups. The results confirm that both changes of T and AR in the AOB might be underlying mating behavior in the adult male mandarin voles [Current Zoology 55 (4) : 288 â€“ 295, 2009]...|$|R
