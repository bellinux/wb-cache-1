5|$|Malawi is {{composed}} of three regions (the Northern, Central and Southern regions), which are divided into 28districts, and further into approximately 250traditional authorities and 110administrative wards. Local government is administered by central government-appointed regional administrators and district commissioners. For {{the first time in}} the multi-party era, local elections took place on 21 November 2000, with the UDF party winning 70% of the available seats. There was scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> round of constitutionally mandated local elections in May 2005, but these were cancelled by the government.|$|E
5|$|Military {{tensions}} between the two leaders immediately increased. Theobald mobilised his forces {{along the border with}} Touraine; Henry responded by attacking Chaumont in Blois in a surprise attack; he successfully took Theobald's castle in a notable siege. At the start of 1161 war seemed likely to spread across the region, until a fresh peace was negotiated at Fréteval that autumn, followed by a second peace treaty in 1162, overseen by Pope Alexander III. Despite this temporary halt in hostilities, Henry's seizure of the Vexin proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> long-running dispute between him and the kings of France.|$|E
5|$|New {{material}} from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, includes a skull and partial skeleton that represent the species G. monumentensis. Its skull was more robust {{than that of the}} other species, and its predentary had enlarged prongs along its upper margin, where the lower jaw's beak was based. This new species greatly expands the geographic range of this genus, and there may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> more lightly built species present as well. Multiple gryposaur species are known from the Kaiparowits Formation, represented by cranial and postcranial remains, and were larger than their northern counterparts.|$|E

5|$|At 03:30 on 16 October, another sail {{was spotted}} to the southwest, rapidly {{revealed}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> British frigate, the 38-gun HMS Ethalion under Captain James Young. Ethalion joined the chase and at dawn two more sails were sighted, the 32-gun HMS Alcmene under Captain Henry Digby {{to the west}} and 32-gun HMS Triton under Captain John Gore to the north. With four British frigates now in full pursuit, the Spanish captains sought to split their enemy and divided, at which Pierrepont directed Ethalion, the closest British ship, to pursue the faster Thetis. Young complied, firing long-range shot in Santa Brigidas direction at 09:00, driving Pillon's ship further from his companion.|$|E
5|$|Hilliard led the Wildcats to a 33–3 season. His {{final game}} at Villanova was a 71-68 {{upset at the}} hands of N.C. State in the NCAA Tournament Round of 32, despite {{contributing}} 27 points. Hilliard finished his Villanova career with 1,511 points, 18th highest in school history; 400 rebounds; and 176 steals. Hilliard was a 2014–15 Men's All-District II Team selection by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association. The Sporting News selected him to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Second</b> Team All American. Hilliard was one of three players, along with LaDontae Henton and Kris Dunn, to be named to the All Big East First Team. He was named to the First Team All-District V by the National Association of Basketball Coaches, and was named Big 5 Player of the Year. After the season, he was invited to the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament.|$|E
5|$|Literature {{in early}} modern Scotland is {{literature}} written in Scotland or by Scottish writers between the Renaissance {{in the early}} sixteenth century and {{the beginnings of the}} Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mid-eighteenth century. By the beginning of this era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands, but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived. Middle Scots became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. The establishment of a printing press in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.|$|E

5|$|More than 50specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex {{have been}} identified, {{some of which}} are nearly {{complete}} skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in {{at least one of these}} specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology and potential speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> Tyrannosaurus species while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} a group of Magnemite—magnet-like Pokémon with {{levitation}} abilities—delivering a television to the player's house. Upon turning the television on, Professor Oak appears to request the player's help: he is creating a new television network for Trainers and their Pokémon to enjoy together, and he wants the player to serve as a beta tester. He has them watch an episode of an anime called Pichu Bros. and then introduces the game's basic features before leaving them alone. The player then hears Pokémon cries from outside, which turn out to belong to a Pikachu and two other creatures: the reptilian Treecko and the avian Torchic. While the others run off, the Pikachu stays and the player adopts it. Oak decides to allow Pikachu to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> beta tester.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} modern era Gaelic had been in {{geographical}} decline for three centuries and had begun to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands. The tradition of classic Gaelic poetry survived longer in Scotland than in Ireland, with the last fully competent member of the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were hereditary poets to the Lords of the Isles and then the Donalds of Clanranald, still working in the early eighteenth century. Nevertheless, interest in the sponsorship of panegyric Gaelic poetry was declining among the clan leaders. Gaelic was gradually being overtaken by Middle Scots, which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Middle Scots was derived substantially from Old English, with Gaelic and French influences. It was usually called Inglyshe and {{was very close to}} the language spoken in northern England, but by the sixteenth century it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England. With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came {{to be done in the}} English fashion.|$|E
