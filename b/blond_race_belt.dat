50|$|These {{stories told}} of God, his warrior saints {{and the last}} Emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos, who would awaken and leave the cave where angels had carried him and {{transformed}} him into marble. These heavenly powers would lead Greek soldiers to Constantinople. In this battle, they would also {{be accompanied by a}} xanthos genos, a <b>blond</b> <b>race</b> of liberators come from the North. It was for this reason that the Greeks turned to the Russians, the only Orthodox not to have been conquered by the Turks, to help them recover their freedom.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} the [...] "dark race" [...] (zalmat-qaqadi) in line 18 of K.3364 refers to the [...] "black-headed" [...] Sumerians, as their name suggests they derived it from the fact they were black haired. An array of earlier prominent Assyriologists have supported this position, noting that the aborigines of ancient Mesopotamia would only have employed such a name for themselves if they had encountered another people who possessed a different physiognomy, specifically fairer (blonde) hair: [...] "this implies that there was also a <b>blond</b> <b>race</b> in the country from which their black hair and eyes distinguished them". Laurence Waddell was also a notable proponent of this theory, but maintained that the Sumerian royal dynasty was blonde (Aryan) while the lower masses (or 'subject' people) dark black haired primitives. The [...] "dark race" [...] (zalmat-qaqadi) has then been suggested to only refer to the black hair of the Sumerian aborigines of Mesopotamia (Fertile Crescent) and not their skin complexion. Although some argue the [...] "dark race" [...] refers to both a dark skinned and black haired population.|$|R

There was no sensible reason for such regimentation in the saving of lives, but the practice persisted well after short surfboard and power boat rescues had become more common than belt and reel rescues. When I criticised the antiquated, militaristic surf lifesaving movement in a book title SURF BEACHES OF AUSTRALIA'S EAST COAST (Angus & Robertson 1968) there was a storm of protest from the hierarchy, earheaded by the movement's patron, Sir Adrian Curlewis, who dubbed me the 1968 equivalent of being 'un-Australian'. However the introduction of short Malibu boards, etc. and the dissatisfaction of returning Vietnam veterans with military style restraints quickly revolutionised life saving methods. Today, surfboat <b>races,</b> <b>belt</b> and reel events and march pasts are held purely for their pageantry and tourist drawing potential. " [...] Description {{supplied by}} photographer...|$|R
5000|$|Belt-sander {{racing is}} the {{practice}} of <b>racing</b> <b>belt</b> sanders competitively. Belt sanders {{were one of the}} first power tools used in the growing field of power tool drag racing wherein a pair of stock or modified belt sanders are placed in parallel wooden channels and fitted with long extension cords. Each heat begins when a common switch or individual switches triggered by the racers energizes them, causing the sanders to race {{towards the end of the}} track spitting wood dust along the way. Both stock sanders and modified sanders race down a [...] long track. Sanders of all shapes and sizes can go very fast, or very slow depending on the power of the motor. The fastest time on a 75-foot track was 2.2103 seconds recorded by Dudley Harper's Sudden Death Racer of San Marcos, Texas. Sudden Death raced on that date at the Legends Raceway in Rockport, Texas. The peak velocity of that belt sander at the finish line was in the range of 50 - 60 mph.|$|R

5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{member of}} Parliament Sir John Astley founded a [...] "Long Distance Championship of the World" [...] in 1878, staged over six days, which {{became known as}} the [...] "Astley Belt Races". [...] While marking a peak in press {{coverage}} of such <b>races,</b> the Astley <b>Belt</b> <b>Races</b> allowed a wide interpretation of rules, with trotting, jogging, and even some running allowed. The competition was partly inspired by a desire to clean up the perception of the sport as corrupted by gambling interests and led to a push amongst some to codify pedestrianism as an amateur sport. The same process was happening to British track and field athletics and gave rise to the modern Olympic Movement.|$|R

Prior to the {{international}} World Cup ski competition, the Silver <b>Belt</b> <b>race</b> was {{considered one of the most}} challenging of that era and often attracted the top European and American skiers. Jannette Burr was the only competitor to win the race three different times and other notable winners included Alf Engen, Tom Corcoran, Buddy Werner, Willy Favre, Jean Saubert, Barbara Cochran, Jack Reddish, Penny Pitou, Anne Heggtveit, Dick Buek, Jill Kinmont, Andrea Mead Lawrence, Gordon Wren and Cynthia Nelson, who won the last event, which was held in 1975.|$|R

6000|$|THE LIFE. If the {{literature}} of a people springs directly out of its life, then the stern, barbarous life of our Saxon forefathers would seem, at first glance, to promise little of good literature. Outwardly their life was a constant hardship, a perpetual struggle against savage nature and savage men. Behind them were gloomy forests inhabited by wild beasts and still wilder men, and peopled in their imagination with dragons and evil shapes. In front of them, thundering at the very dikes for entrance, was the treacherous North Sea, with its fogs and storms and ice, but with that indefinable call of the deep that all men hear who live long beneath its influence. Here they lived, a big, <b>blond,</b> powerful <b>race,</b> and hunted and fought and sailed, and drank and feasted when their labor was done. Almost {{the first thing we}} notice about these big, fearless, childish men is that they love the sea; and because they love it they hear and answer its call: ...|$|R

50|$|The carrera de cintas, or <b>belt</b> <b>race,</b> is a {{traditional}} sport often played during the feria patronal in Spain and Latin America. In the carrera de cintas, short belts with loops on one end are hung from a wire suspended between two posts. Contestants, who may be on either horses or bicycles, ride towards the wire and attempt to capture a belt by putting a peg through the loop. Traditionally, the belts are given {{to a group of}} women who then award prizes. The origin of the sport is not known.|$|R

The fifth fence claimed three runners: State of Play unseated his rider Noel Fehily and Chicago Grey and Rare Bob were brought down. Fehily suffered a broken leg and a screen was soon erected around him as he was treated by medics, while course officials prepared for the fence to be bypassed on the second circuit.|$|R

50|$|Models 27 and 28 do {{not have}} a motor mount {{hardpoint}}; the hardpoint appeared later on the models 127 and 128. Without a hardpoint, screw holes must be manually drilled and tapped into the pillar for the motor mounting bolts. Unfortunately there is not a standard location for these screw holes, and so the add-on motor can be mounted anywhere within a two-inch range on the pillar. Consequently, the <b>belt</b> <b>race</b> length can vary from the standard race lengths of the 127 and 128. If it does vary, then the standard Singer V belts can be too long or too short. In that case a stretch belt (good over a range of several inches) will suffice instead.|$|R

The intent by each manufacturer was to sell at least 200 units of their respective models to the public, thus making the cars eligible for the Hardie-Ferodo 500, a major motor race held on the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, New South Wales which at the time was run under Group E Series Production regulations meaning that the cars that raced had to be available for sale to the general public, though the race cars did have safety features such as roll cages and <b>racing</b> seat <b>belts.</b> (the Hardie-Ferodo 500 mile race was a forerunner to the current [...] "Bathurst 1000" [...] event) ...|$|R
