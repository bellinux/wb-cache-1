5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E

When genetically modified with adenovirus mediated BMP 2 gene transfer, muscle biopsies from animals have demonstrated success in regenerating bone within rat bony defects. However, it is uncertain whether the human adult skeletal muscle displays an osteogenic potential in vitro when a suitable biological trigger is applied. In present study, human skeletal muscle cultured in a standard osteogenic medium supplemented with dexamethasone demonstrated significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity approximately 24 -fold over control at 2 -week time point. More interestingly, measurement of mRNA levels revealed the dramatic results for osteoblast transcripts of alkaline phosphatase, <b>bone</b> <b>sialoproteins,</b> transcription factor CBFA 1, collagen type I, and osteocalcin.

40|$|Age-related {{bone loss}} is {{characterized}} by decreased osteoblast activity, possibly related to the reduction of energy production. Carnitine promotes energy availability and its concentration declines with age; Therefore, two Carnitine derivatives, L-carnitine fumarate (LC) and isovaleryl L-carnitine fumarate (Iso-V-LC), have been tested on several parameters of human osteoblasts in vitro. Both compounds significantly increased osteoblast activity, but the new compound Iso-V-LC was more efficient than LC at lower concentrations. They both significantly enhanced cell proliferation, [3 H]-proline incorporation and the expression of collagen type I (COLLI), and the <b>bone</b> <b>sialoproteins</b> (BSPs) and osteopontin (OPN). The percentage of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) -positive cells and the secretion of osteocalcin were not modified by LC and Iso-V-LC. Both molecules increased the formation of mineralized nodules, but Iso-V-LC reached the maximum effect at a concentration 10 -fold {{lower than that of}} LC. Furthermore, we showed that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I and IGF-II mRNA levels were not modified by the treatment. However, the two compounds induced an increase of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) - 3 and a decrease of IGFBP- 5 in both osteoblast lysates and the extracellular matrix (ECM). In conclusion these data suggest that carnitine and, in particular, its new derivative, Iso-V-LC supplementation in the elderly may stimulate osteoblast activity and decrease age-related bone loss...|$|R

The biochemical constituents investigated were: 36 kDa, 58 kDa, 59 kDa, 62 kDa, 148 kDa, 400 kDa proteins, chondrocalcin, <b>bone</b> <b>sialoproteins</b> I and II (BSP I and II), osteopontin (ost I), small cartilage 1 and 2 as well as large cartilage proteoglycans (PG-S 1, PG-S 2, PG-LA).

Labelling of the proteins 59 kDa protein, BSP I and II, and ost I was distinct along the sutural bone margins and, initially, cells and fibrillar structures within the sutural ligament were also labelled. The 58 kDa protein was localised unspecifically to the suture tissue proper at Days 50 and 100. PG-S 1 labelling was concentrated primarily at the sutural edge.

40|$|To fully {{understand}} the significance of bone as a target tissue of lead toxicity, {{as well as a}} reservoir of systemic lead, it is necessary to define the effects of lead on the cellular components of bone. Skeletal development and the regulation of skeletal mass are ultimately determined by the four different types of cells: osteoblasts, lining cells, osteoclasts, and osteocytes. These cells, which line and penetrate the mineralized matrix, are responsible for matrix formation, mineralization, and bone resorption, under the control of both systemic and local factors. Systemic components of regulation include parathyroid hormone, 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3, and calcitonin: local regulators include numerous cytokines and growth factors. Lead intoxication directly and indirectly alters many aspects of bone cell function. First, lead may indirectly alter bone cell function through changes in the circulating levels of those hormones, particularly 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3, which modulate bone cell function. These hormonal changes have been well established in clinical studies, although the functional significance remains to be established. Second, lead may directly alter bone cell function by perturbing the ability of bone cells to respond to hormonal regulation. For example, the 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 -stimulated synthesis of osteocalcin, a calcium-binding protein synthesized by osteoblastic bone cells, is inhibited by low levels of lead. Impaired osteocalcin production may inhibit new bone formation, as well as the functional coupling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Third, lead may impair the ability of cells to synthesize or secrete other components of the bone matrix, such as collagen or <b>bone</b> <b>sialoproteins</b> (osteopontin). Finally, lead may directly effect or substitute for calcium in the active sites of the calcium messenger system, resulting in loss of physiological regulation. The effects of lead on the recruitment and differentiation of bone cells remains to be established. Compartmental analysis indicates that the kinetic distribution and behavior of intracellular lead in osteoblasts and osteoclasts is similar to several other cell types. Many of the toxic effects of lead on bone cell function may be produced by perturbation of the calcium and cAMP messenger systems in these cells...|$|R

50|$|The organic part of mineralized tissues {{is made of}} proteins. In bone for example, {{the organic}} layer is the protein collagen.

Moreover, many proteins are regulators in the mineralization process. They act in the nucleation or inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation. For example, the organic component in nacre is known to restrict the growth of aragonite. Some of the regulatory proteins in mineralized tissues are osteonectin, osteopontin, osteocalcin, <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and dentin phosphophoryn.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To detect {{evidence}} for localised changes in bone matrix metabolism after joint trauma and in post-traumatic osteoarthritis by quantification of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> in joint fluid and serum after knee injury in a cross sectional study. METHODS: Samples of knee joint fluid and serum {{were obtained from}} volunteers with normal knees (n = 19), patients with rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament isolated or combined with tear of a meniscus (n = 114), and patients with isolated meniscus lesions (n = 80). Concentrations of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> were determined by ELISA. Concentrations of other markers of joint tissue metabolism in these samples were determined in previous investigations. RESULTS: The median concentrations of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> in joint fluid from healthy volunteers was 122 ng ml- 1 (range 41 to 183). Concentrations of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> were increased in both injury groups compared with the reference group (median for cruciate ligament injury 146 ng ml- 1, range 72 to 339; median for meniscus injury 166 ng ml- 1, range 75 to 376). After injury, <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> increased quickly and remained increased for six months. <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> in joint fluid was increased only in samples from joints with normal or nearly normal (fibrillated) cartilage, and was within reference range in joints with radiographic signs of osteoarthritis. <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> concentrations in joints with cruciate ligament injury were positively correlated with levels of aggrecan and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein fragments, and with levels of stromelysin- 1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1. The ratios between the concentrations of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> in joint fluid and serum were > 1 {{in the majority of}} the cruciate ligament injury cases. CONCLUSIONS: The release of significant amounts of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> into joint fluid in connection with acute joint trauma may be associated with injury to, and active remodelling of, the cartilage-bone interface and subchondral bone. The findings are consistent with dramatic shifts in cartilage, bone, and synovial metabolism following joint injury. <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> concentrations in synovial fluid may be a useful marker of subchondral injury and remodelling following joint injury...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2006 American Academy of PeriodontologyBACKGROUND: Periodontal {{disease is}} marked by {{inflammation}} and damage to tooth-supporting tissues. In particular, damage occurs to factors present in cementum that {{are thought to have}} the ability to influence the regeneration of surrounding tissues. <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and osteopontin are major non-collagenous proteins in mineralized connective tissues associated with precementoblast chemo-attraction, adhesion to the root surface, and cell differentiation. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the expression and distribution of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and osteopontin on root surfaces affected by periodontitis are altered compared to healthy, non-diseased root surfaces. METHODS: Thirty healthy and 30 periodontitis-affected teeth were collected. Following fixation and demineralization, specimens were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and exposed to antibodies against <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and osteopontin. Stained sections were assessed using light microscopy. RESULTS: <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> was not detected in the exposed cementum (absence of overlying periodontal ligament) of diseased teeth. In most areas where the periodontal ligament was intact, <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> was detected for healthy and diseased teeth. For teeth reactive for <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein,</b> the matrix of the cementum just below the periodontal ligament was moderately stained. A similar immunoreactivity pattern for osteopontin was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and osteopontin staining along exposed cementum surfaces may be due to structural and compositional changes in matrix components associated with periodontal disease.

40|$|PURPOSE: Skeletal metastases are the {{hallmark}} of advanced prostate cancer and recurrence after local surgery is common. Currently to our knowledge no biological markers predict the risk of disease progression in individuals with localized prostate cancer. In a search for predictive markers we evaluated the expression of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and bone morphogenetic protein 6, 2 bone related proteins, and the angiogenic factor thymidine phosphorylase. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included 43 men who presented with localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein,</b> bone morphogenetic protein 6 and thymidine phosphorylase expression was assessed by immunohistochemical testing. Results were analyzed in relation to pathological disease stage, Gleason score and clinical outcome. Clinical followup was 4. 3 to 11. 4 years after surgery (median 7. 9). RESULTS: Disease did not progress in 17 of the 43 cases, while recurrence and/or metastasis developed in the other 26 at a median of 6. 5 and 6. 9 years, respectively. <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and bone morphogenetic protein 6 expression detected in 28 (65 %) and 29 (67 %) of the 43 samples, respectively, was significantly associated (p = 0. 0001). Thymidine phosphorylase detected in 26 samples (60 %) {{was not related to}} <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and/or bone morphogenetic protein 6 positivity. <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> and/or bone morphogenetic protein 6 expression correlated with bone metastasis, while thymidine phosphorylase expression was related to local recurrence (p = 0. 002 and/or 0. 007, and 0. 00007, respectively). On multivariate analysis only the correlation of thymidine phosphorylase expression with recurrence remained statistically significant (p = 0. 002). Co-expression of the 3 markers was observed in the samples of 10 of the 11 patients (90 %) with bone metastases and only in 5 of the 17 (29 %) who were disease-free. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the expression of <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein,</b> bone morphogenetic protein 6 and thymidine phosphorylase determined at a clinically early stage of disease by a simple immunohistochemical technique would enable subgroups of patients to be identified that are at different risks of bone metastasis or recurrence.

Localization of osteopontin, osteocalcin, BMP- 2 and BM P- 4 within sections of human periodontal structures was stronger in the periodontal ligament compared to the gingiva. <b>Bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> was not detected in either of the soft tissues but, along with osteopontin and osteocalcin, it was localized in the cementum and bone. In vitro, both the gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblasts expressed mRNA for alkaline phosphatase, BMP- 2, BMP- 4 and osteopontin. Although there were no differences in the expression of alkaline phosphatase and BMP- 4 mRNA between the two cell types, we noted significantly higher mRNA levels of osteopontin in the periodontal ligament and BM P- 2 in the gingival fibroblasts.

Because no bone formation occurs in Osx-null mice, Osterix {{is thought to}} be an essential regulator of osteoblast differentiation. We report that, in several mesenchymal and osteoblastic cell types, BMP- 2 induces an increase in expression of the two isoforms of Osterix arising from two alternative promoters. We identified a consensus Sp 1 sequence (GGGCGG) as Osterix binding regions in the fibromodulin and the <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> promoters in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that Osterix is a novel substrate for p 38 MAPK in vitro and in vivo and that Ser- 73 and Ser- 77 are the regulatory sites phosphorylated by p 38.

These results demonstrate that, as earlier found in other species, dexamethasone and 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 promote the osteogenic differentiation of human marrow stromal cells as measured by expression of these osteogenic markers...|$|E
40|$|Discrimination of {{soft tissue}} {{infection}} from osteomyelitis in diabetic foot infections {{is a common}} clinical problem. Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients with osteomyelitis express bone sialoprotein-binding protein (Bbp) that binds the bone matrix protein <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein.</b> The serological assay with Bbp discriminated cases of osteomyelitis from soft tissue infections in patients with diabetic foot ulcers...|$|E
30|$|Alveolar {{decortication}} {{has been}} shown to induce the rate of tooth movement via the coupled mechanism of bone resorption and formation in early stages of orthodontic tooth movement [67]. The underlying biomarkers (OPN, osteocalcin, <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein)</b> demonstrated increased anabolic activity. Whether the orthodontic tooth movement can be accelerated via targeting the underlying signaling pathways warrants further investigation.|$|E
40|$|In dentinogenesis, certain growth factors, matrix proteoglycans, and {{proteins}} {{are directly}} or indirectly dependent on growth hormone. The hypothesis that growth hormone up-regulates the expression of enzymes, sialoproteins, and other extracellular matrix proteins implicated in the formation and mineralization of tooth and bone matrices was tested by the treatment of Lewis dwarf rats with growth hormone over 5 days. The molar teeth were processed for immunohistochemical demonstration of bone-alkaline phosphatase, bone morphogenetic proteins- 2 and - 4, osteocalcin, osteopontin, <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein,</b> and E 11 protein. Odontoblasts responded to growth hormone by more cells expressing bone morphogenetic protein, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and osteopontin. No changes were found in <b>bone</b> <b>sialoprotein</b> or E 11 protein expression. Thus, growth hormone may stimulate odontoblasts to express several growth factors and matrix proteins associated with dentin matrix biosynthesis in mature rat molars. W. G. Young, H. Li, Y. Xiao, M.
