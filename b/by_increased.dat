5|$|A 1905 {{review of}} the Falmouth defences {{concluded}} that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and the recently re-established battery at St Anthony's instead. Disarmed, St Mawes was then used as a barracks in the First World War. In 1920 the castle {{was transferred to the}} control of the government's Office of Works, and was opened to visitors, being promoted as a tourist destination by the Great Western Railway company who hoped to profit <b>by</b> <b>increased</b> numbers of visitors to Falmouth.|$|E

5000|$|Clock {{multipliers}} on {{many modern}} processors are fixed; {{it is usually}} not possible to change them. Some versions of processors have clock multipliers unlocked; that is, they can be [...] "overclocked" [...] <b>by</b> <b>increasing</b> the clock multiplier setting in the motherboard's BIOS setup program. Some CPU engineering samples may also have the clock multiplier unlocked. Many Intel qualification samples have maximum clock multiplier locked: these CPUs may be underclocked (run at lower frequency), but they cannot be overclocked <b>by</b> <b>increasing</b> clock multiplier higher than intended by CPU design. While these qualification samples and majority of production microprocessors cannot be overclocked <b>by</b> <b>increasing</b> their clock multiplier, they still can be overclocked by using a different technique: <b>by</b> <b>increasing</b> FSB frequency.|$|R
5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused <b>by</b> <b>increased</b> interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E

As {{editor-in-chief}} at Us Weekly from 2002 to 2009, she was influential in creating popular culture trends and an industry for celebrity gossip. Min {{also created a}} more celebrity-friendly editorial style and placed more emphasis on reality TV stars. Min was appointed to lead The Hollywood Reporter in 2010 {{as part of a}} turnaround effort, as the publication was doing poorly.

5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead levels is the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused <b>by</b> <b>increased</b> calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

50|$|Of {{particular}} interest are the benzodiazepine drugs which reduce insomnia <b>by</b> <b>increasing</b> {{the efficiency of}} GABA.

5|$|From 1906 the CLR {{began to}} {{experience}} a large fall in passenger numbers caused <b>by</b> <b>increased</b> competition from the DR and the MR, which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905, and from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906. Road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in greater numbers. In an attempt to maintain income, the company increased the flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909. Multiple booklets of tickets, which had previously been sold at face value, were offered at discounts, and season tickets were introduced from July 1911.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered <b>by</b> <b>increased</b> thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the work}} to {{establish}} a financing package for new investments in public transport in Akershus and Oslo started. It was passed, in 2001, by {{the city and county}} councils, as well as the Norwegian Parliament. Oslo Package 2 allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented <b>by</b> <b>increased</b> fare and toll road revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by Oslo Sporveier was for 33 units (or 99 cars), and was approved by the board on 28 June 2003. The initial order cost NOK1.6 billion, and included options for further orders. Five other manufactures had been rejected during the procurement process. Combined with other investments in the network, the new trains will allow faster travel times on the metro.|$|E

30|$|As the {{magnitude}} of NCDs continues to accelerate, the pressing need for access to quality healthcare is increasingly recognized.

This subsection investigates the first approach to increasing accessibility, which involves expanding health insurance to poor, unskilled workers in the informal sector.|$|R
