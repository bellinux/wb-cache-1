40|$|This chapter proposes an item-level RFID-enabled store {{management}} system {{to help improve}} retail business. The system adopts an integral design approach to exploit RFID and the e-pedigree established for anti-counterfeiting and tracking of product items in a supply chain. Various modules, such as <b>back-store</b> inventory, smart shelves, interactive mirrors and fitting, and self-checkout services, can be subsequently implemented for retail operations and management. Features for anti-counterfeiting and individual customer marketing can also be incorporated to enhance brand image and customer experience. Moreover, intelligent algorithms may be integrated to mine useful information, such as the sales history of products and the shopping behaviour of customers from the data captured by the RFID devices to facilitate business decision-making and proactive individual marketing. As such, the efficiency of store operations and the overall retail business {{can be expected to}} improve substantially. The chapter presents the design approach of the proposed system and discusses some implementation issues, exemplified by two basic applications: (1) track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting to prevent injection of faked products into the <b>back-store</b> inventory and (2) smart product collocation to promote individual customer marketing and cross selling...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} {{process of}} methane (CH 4) production during the back-freezing of permafrost soils in autumn {{and the future}} fate of produced CH 4 in the thawing phase of the following spring are not well understood. Long-term CH 4 flux studies in the Lena Delta (Siberia) indicate that <b>back-stored</b> CH 4 adds to the emission of newly-produced CH 4 {{at the beginning of}} the vegetation period. Further field analysis shows that microbial CH 4 production already occurs at in situ temperatures of around 1 C in the bottom layer of the soil. Therefore, a permafrost microcosm was developed to simulate the influence of the annual freezing-thawing cycles on the CH 4 fluxes in the active layer of permafrost soils. Two cryostats ensure independent freezing and thawing the top and the bottom of the microcosm to simulate different field conditions. The CH 4 concentration (Rhizon soil moisture samplers), the soil temperature (film platinum resistance temperature detectors [RTDs]) and the soil water content (time domain reflectometry) are analysed in different depths of the microcosm during the simulation in addition to the concentration of emitted CH 4 in the headspace of the microcosm. The data obtained contribute to the understanding of microbial processes and CH 4 fluxes in permafrost environments in the autumn and early winter. Copyright # 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
