Slavery was legal in Pennsylvania until it was gradually abolished beginning in 1780 when the importation of slaves was prohibited. The management of the furnace had quite a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> with the staff of indentured servants. These unskilled workers were imported from Germany, England and Ireland. Many of them worked at Cornwall {{for a short time}} before eventually running away.|$|E

There, {{during the middle of the}} first wave’s attack, he fired up the only flyable Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter on the island. A ground crew member crawled up on the wing telling him, “You can’t take this airplane!” “The heck I can’t, get off my wing!” Arnold replied. “But it doesn’t have any ammunition!” came the response.|$|E
500|$|David Goodman comments, {{regarding}} the plot partially following Herbert that [...] "there {{is always a}} <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> pitching a Herbert storyline to the network." [...] Samm Levine had originally been selected to voice Kyle, but the character was recast because, as show producer Seth MacFarlane comments, [...] "it seemed a lot funnier when Peter was beating up a kid if he was younger and more defenseless." [...] A deleted scene had been made which showed Chris asking for money and stating [...] "I spent my last ten bucks on a ham costume," [...] and Peter replying with [...] "it's just sitting there right now, {{but you know what}} the great thing is, it's just three months until Halloween and I am done." [...] Peter's ancestor shown preparing to wrestle with a kangaroo was described by Seth MacFarlane to be [...] "a very strange gag," [...] which was added after the other parts of the episode had been created. Quagmire's profanity-laced tirade during the golf game was bleeped out on TV, but uncensored on DVD. The scene of Stewie remembering the time the Griffins had a nymphomaniac from Wisconsin in their attic was edited as FOX objected to the sounds of the woman having an orgasm being shown over a shot of a wide-awake Stewie.|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} this chapter is doing some work, albeit in a {{somewhat}} awkward fashion. Giles Deleuze appears, philosopher of a “bastard kind” (Massumi 1992, 1). Deleuze opens the work because he, and his concepts, do something they are rather good at: a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>troubling,</b> a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> “prying open” of habitual ways of thinking (Massumi 1987, xv). In this chapter that <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>troubling</b> and prying open is directed toward a rethinking of youth transition {{and the role of}} schools in that particular form of ‘becoming’. Teenage mothers appear as they, too, are ‘known’ to be trouble makers: the ‘teenage mother’ signifier is by default a negative one. As Sara found, ‘teenage mother’ as a signifier doesn’t rest easily alongside ‘school girl’ as a signifier. It is this assemblage of teenager+parent+school student — a gathering in which I too was once involved (Kamp and Kelly forthcoming) — that is the focus of this chapter...|$|R

500|$|Channel Seven {{described}} Martha {{as being}} [...] "Friendly, {{straight down the}} line, and with a great enthusiasm for life", and Jetstar magazine called Martha [...] "a feisty addition to the Stewart family". Gordon described Martha's persona stating: [...] "Martha's pretty feisty {{all of the time}} but in the sense of always fighting for what's right and keeping up a strong perspective on where I want to go, things like that." [...] Gordon says that she feels Martha always makes bad choices when it comes to her love life, because she never knows what she wants. Gordon said that Martha is [...] "messed up" [...] but with a [...] "warm side" [...] to her persona, and that overall Martha is [...] "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" [...] type character. Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side. Gordon later said that [...] "There will always be a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> attached to Martha. She will always be a little bit mischievous". On the character's appearance, RTÉ said [...] "Martha was a self-confessed tomboy, loving sport and anything physical. Now she has grown into a stylish woman with great taste in clothes which range from shorts and strappy tops to gorgeous summer dresses." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie {{was still in the}} tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't what it looks like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E
2500|$|During Australia's second innings, Slater hit 45 from 55 {{deliveries}} before departing to Fraser and Angel, nightwatchman on {{the third}} evening, was run out by his captain, England reducing the Australians to 123/5. Blewett and Steve Waugh then hit a partnership of 203 at almost a run a minute. Blewett's 115 (158 balls, 19 fours) pleased the batsman who argued that [...] "I enjoyed this more ...

I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!"

Prior to serving in the military Travis worked as a farm hand and horse breaker and was known as being a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> maker to the extent that he led a rather transient existence after leaving home at the age of 21. During the war he served briefly at Gallipoli before being sent to France where he fought in the trenches along the Western Front, earning a reputation as scout and sniper. He was killed by shellfire a day after performing the deed that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E

[...] I've been working really hard," [...] Ponting said on his technique. [...] "I've {{made no secret of}} it, my record here has been poor. Today is one step in the right direction. It was nice to get some runs out there and put the team in a good position. But one innings doesn't make a tour. The other tours I've had here, apart from the last Test I played, I've batted at six, always coming in against spin and when the wicket has worn. One thing that stands out in my career is whenever I've been in early, with the team in a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble,</b> I've managed to make runs." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{short time}} later, Gar [...] "Beast Boy" [...] Logan found himself alone in Los Angeles after the team {{neglected}} {{to ask him}} back. Landing himself in a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> by an impostor framing him for various crimes, Gar asked former teammate Bette for help. Having been recently chastised for her dedication (or lack thereof) to crime-fighting by Robin (now in his adult Nightwing identity), Flamebird {{seized the opportunity to}} better herself and her reputation, becoming more level-headed and boosting her crime-fighting arsenal. However, the design of her outfit as an adult has similarities to that of Dick Graysons's Nightwing outfit, with a red tunic and gold V running across the chest. After Bette helped Gar clear his name, his cousin Matt attempted one last recruitment drive for Titans West (dubbing the ill-fated team Titans L.A.). None of the recruits took the event seriously except for insane and uninvited former Titan Duela Dent, who crashed the party and was subdued by Bette. Around the same time, she and Beast Boy both served on an ad hoc Young Justice team, which she hoped would raise their public profiles; however, the team only lasted for one mission. Content to remain a hero on her own, Bette was unheard from until she was captured by a Brainiac-worshipping cult leader in Oregon and eventually rescued by Oracle's covert team of female operatives in Birds of Prey. She fought Doctor Light alongside the majority of heroes who had once been members of the Teen Titans.|$|E
2500|$|Quirinus Quirrell is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the first novel in the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. Though the character's first name was never {{mentioned in the}} novels, the character is given the first name [...] "Quirinus" [...] in the official Harry Potter Trading Card Game. Quirrell is the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts during Harry's first year and secretly a Death Eater. Prior to his employment at Hogwarts, he is said by Hagrid {{to have had a}} [...] "brilliant mind", and was a fine teacher while studying from books; some time before Harry's arrival at Hogwarts, [...] "he took a year off to get some first-hand experience". Rowling stated in a live web chat on 30 July 2007 that Quirrell had worked at Hogwarts as Muggle Studies teacher for a certain length of time, before taking the cursed Defence Against the Dark Arts position in the same year that Harry joined. There were rumours that he encountered vampires in the Black Forest and one in Romania, and he apparently had [...] "a nasty <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> with a hag". After that, he was 'never the same' – upon his return, he appears perpetually nervous and has developed a stutter and nervous tics [...] and Hagrid was able to say even before the beginning of the autumn term that he was [...] "scared of the students, scared of his own subject". Quirrell's attire includes a new purple turban which he claims to have received as a reward from an African prince for getting rid of a troublesome zombie. Fred and George constantly joke that the turban was full of garlic to ward away vampires and in one part they even enchant snowballs to hit it. According to JK Rowling, Quirrell taught Muggle Studies before Harry studied at Hogwarts, which explains why he was a teacher before {{but at the same time}} only a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher for one year.|$|E

[...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast.

5000|$|Robertson as {{an active}} player in 1946 had a brief but {{interesting}} experience with another ballplayer from Canada, Jeff Heath. Heath in his baseball career had good numbers and hit with power. He was physically very strong and a good athlete, {{but he was a}} <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a <b>trouble</b> maker. In December 1945 he was traded from the Cleveland Indians to the Senators in exchange for very fast outfielder George Case and was Washington's starting right fielder, but in June 1946 the Senators sent him to the St. Louis Browns. After being traded to St. Louis, Washington writers commented about Heath's unwise riding of Robertson on the bench during games and calling him [...] "owner's pet." [...] This situation was disussed in a column after the trade by longtime Washington Post sports writer Shirley Povich. The sad part of the situation for Washington was that the Nats could have used Heath. With St. Louis the next year, he had a career high 27 home runs, but the Browns, always needing cash to operate, sold him to the Boston Braves after the 1947 season. He batted [...]319 with 20 home runs for the 1948 Braves as they won a surprise National League pennant, but Heath missed the World Series after severely breaking his ankle in a slide toward home plate in the last week of the season. A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth gaping in pain and shock, with his leg shattered mid-ankle. The lower ankle could distinctly be seen rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. Heath was never the same ball player afterwards.|$|R
