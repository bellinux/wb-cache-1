5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both shallow and deep marine waters {{where they can be}} benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many <b>benthic</b> <b>species</b> make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{only a few}} <b>benthic</b> <b>species</b> of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard {{sharks and}} catsharks, had survived in {{aquarium}} conditions {{for a year or}} more. This gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. More knowledge has led to more species (including the large pelagic sharks) living far longer in captivity, along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation. For a long time, the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long, but in September 2004, the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they {{emerge from the}} marsupium. The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating a feeding current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some <b>benthic</b> <b>species,</b> especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs.|$|E
25|$|Rather uncommon, the {{circular}} stingaree has a restricted range off southwestern Australia between Esperance and Rottnest Island. It is a <b>benthic</b> <b>species</b> {{that can be}} found from the shore to a depth of , generally sighted over rocks and reefs, or amongst kelp.|$|E
25|$|Ray finned species, with spiny fins, {{are rare}} among deep sea fishes, which {{suggests}} that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful. The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the Beryciformes and Lampriformes, which are also ancient forms. Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments. In contrast, deep water <b>benthic</b> <b>species,</b> are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes.|$|E

50|$|Three {{distinct}} {{marine habitat}} community types {{have been identified}} within the Marine Park: coral reefs, macroalgal beds, and offshore/open coast communities. The distribution of these depends on wave exposure. The Lord Howe Island Group supports more than 305 <b>benthic</b> algae <b>species,</b> including 47 endemic species. Hence, approximately 15% of the <b>benthic</b> algal <b>species</b> are endemic to the Lord Howe Island Marine Park. Also, two species of non-endemic sea grasses are found within the marine park: Eelgrass, Zostera muelleri subsp capricorni and Paddleweed, Halophila ovalis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Benthic</b> {{invertebrates}} <b>species</b> {{composition is}} characterized by low diversity and densities. Three species of polychaetes and bivalves are identified.

25|$|In {{common with}} other Thiaridae, Tarebia granifera is {{primarily}} a <b>benthic</b> <b>species</b> and in South Africa has been collected {{on a variety of}} substrata in both natural and artificial waterbodies, e.g. sand, mud, rock, concrete bridge foundations and the concrete walls and bottoms of reservoirs, irrigation canals and ornamental ponds. Many of these habitats were vegetated and the associated vegetation included many types of emergent monocotyledons (e.g. Cyperus papyrus, Scirpus sp., Typha sp., Phragmites sp.) and dicotyledons (e.g. Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton crispus, Nymphaea nouchali). Where densities are high, Tarebia granifera may also occur on marginal, trailing vegetation and the floating Common Water Hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes as well. It favours turbulent water and tolerates current speeds up to 1.2m.sâˆ’1 and possibly greater. This habitat range is similar to that recorded for Tarebia granifera in Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 2,927 marine {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the Spratly Sea, including 776 <b>benthic</b> <b>species,</b> 382 species of hard coral, 524 species of marine fish, 262 species of algae and sea grass, 35 species of seabirds, and 20 species of marine mammals and sea turtles. Terrestrial vegetation in the islands includes 103 species of vascular plants of magnolia branches (Magnoliophyta) of 39 families and 79 genera. The islands that do have vegetation provide important habitats for many seabirds and sea turtles. Both the green turtle (Chelonia mydas, endangered) and the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata, critically endangered) formerly occurred in numbers sufficient to support commercial exploitation. These species reportedly continue to nest even on islands inhabited by military personnel (such as Pratas) to some extent, though {{it is believed that}} their numbers have declined.|$|E
25|$|Set {{gillnets}} {{consist of}} a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or <b>benthic</b> <b>species.</b> On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based {{on the relationship of}} fuel/fish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the invasion history of <b>benthic</b> crustacean <b>species</b> that have recently invaded the Estonian coastal sea. Physical characteristics of their habitat and communities associated with the invasive species were explored. The crustaceans Gammarus tigrinus, Chelicorophium curvispinum, Pontogammarus robustoides, and Paramysis intermedia are the most recent newcomers in the Estonian coastal sea. All these species have formed permanent populations and more aggressive species have likely caused significant shifts in the community structure and functioning. Besides the true invasive species, some native amphipod species have significantly expanded their range in the Baltic Sea. This group consists of rare or previously not spotted <b>benthic</b> invertebrate <b>species</b> in the northern Baltic Sea range such as Echinogammarus stoerensis, Calliopius laeviusculus, and Melita palmata...|$|R

500|$|The {{seamount}} is {{populated by}} a large variety of deep-sea corals, most of which in turn provide a habitat for other species. It {{has in the past}} been called [...] "An Oasis in the Deep", hosting a vast coral forest, large sponge field, crabs, deep-sea fish, basket stars, and a number of rare <b>benthic</b> <b>species,</b> some of which have yet to be studied properly or even named.

2500|$|Seamounts enhance {{water flow}} through {{localised}} tides, eddies, and upwelling, and these physical processes may enhance primary production. [...] Seamounts may therefore {{be considered as}} hotspots of marine life; fauna benefit from the enhanced hydrodynamics and phytoplankton supply, and thrive on the slopes and summits. [...] Suspension feeders, such as gorgonian sea fans and the cold-water corals like Lophelia pertusa, often dominate the rich benthic (seafloor-dwelling) communities. The enhanced abundance and diversity of fauna {{is not limited to}} <b>benthic</b> <b>species,</b> as fish are known to aggregate over seamounts. [...] Unfortunately, this knowledge has led to increasing commercial exploitation of seamount fish by the fishing industry, and a number of seamount fish populations have already been depleted. [...] Part of HERMIONE research will assess the threats and impacts of human activities on seamounts, including comparing data from seamounts in different stages of fisheries exploitation to understand more about the impacts of fishing activities., both on target species and non-target species, and their habitats.|$|E
2500|$|The brown shyshark or plain happy (Haploblepharus fuscus) is {{a species}} of catshark, {{part of the family}} Scyliorhinidae. It is endemic to the shallow, coastal waters of South Africa from west of Cape Agulhas to KwaZulu-Natal. This <b>benthic</b> <b>species</b> is usually found over sandy or rocky bottoms. Measuring up to [...] long, the brown shyshark is stoutly built, with a broad, {{flattened}} head and rounded snout. Unlike other shysharks, the brown shyshark has a plain brown color, though some individuals have faint [...] "saddle" [...] markings or light or dark spots. When threatened, this shark curls into a circle with its tail over its eyes, which is the origin of the name [...] "shyshark". It feeds on bony fishes and lobsters, and is oviparous with females laying pairs of egg capsules. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this harmless species as Vulnerable. It is of no commercial or recreational interest, but its limited distribution makes its entire population vulnerable to increases in fishing pressure or habitat degradation.|$|E
50|$|Development along shorelines {{may have}} {{negative}} {{impacts on the}} habitats of these marsh-dwelling bivalves.

Deposit-feeding species are particularly vulnerable to depletion of their food source along the shoreline.|$|R
30|$|Fish occupy {{different}} habitats in {{the ecosystem}} and have different feeding behaviors, thereby exhibiting different profile of accumulation of contaminants such as pesticides. For example, <b>benthic</b> fish <b>species</b> are considered {{more prone to}} contamination (Yim et al. 2005; Wei et al. 2014), as they tend to accumulate sediments bound contaminants than pelagic fish (Qadir and Malik 2011; Ccanccapa et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from a {{peculiar}} restricted marine environment, the Mljet Lakes (Mljet Island, Adriatic Sea, Croatia) have been studied. These lakes are drowned karst dolines, which are {{connected with the}} Adriatic Sea through a narrow, shallow channel. Occasional stagnant conditions in the marine lakes cause hypoxic and anoxic conditions in the bottom waters. Such stressed conditions are reflected in oligospecific benthic foraminiferal assemblages with a Shannon-Wiener species diversity index (H) ranging from 0. 8 to 1. 0 and equitability index (E) ranging from 0. 18 to 0. 26, identified in samples from each marine lake. In the more dysoxic Malo Jezero, Haynesina depressula dominates an assemblage of 12 <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal <b>species.</b> In the less (and less frequently) hypoxic Veliko Jezero, we found an Asterigerinata mamilla assemblage with 18 foraminiferal species.
