5|$|Boron carbide's {{ability to}} absorb {{neutrons}} without forming long-lived radionuclides (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of <b>boron</b> <b>carbide</b> include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, <b>boron</b> <b>carbide</b> is often powdered, {{to increase its}} surface area.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the <b>boron</b> <b>carbide</b> article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of <b>boron</b> <b>carbide</b> gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E
5|$|Like other hard {{ceramics}} (namely alumina and <b>boron</b> <b>carbide),</b> {{silicon carbide}} {{is used in}} composite armor (e.g. Chobham armor), and in ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Dragon Skin, which was produced by Pinnacle Armor, used disks of silicon carbide.|$|E

5|$|<b>Boron</b> <b>carbide</b> and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{have either}} pyrotechnic applications or associated properties. Boron and silicon are commonly encountered; they act somewhat like metal fuels.

Silicon, like boron, is a component of initiator and delay mixtures. Doped germanium can act as a variable speed thermite fuel. Arsenic trisulfide As2S3 was used in old naval signal lights; in fireworks to make white stars; in yellow smoke screen mixtures; and in initiator compositions. Antimony trisulfide Sb2S3 is found in white-light fireworks and in flash and sound mixtures. Tellurium has been used in delay mixtures and in blasting cap initiator compositions.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} conductivities of <b>boron</b> <b>carbides,</b> B{sub 12 +x}C{sub 3 {minus}x} with 0. 1 < x < 1. 7, between 300 and 1200 K {{suggest the}} hopping of a nearly temperature-independent density of small (bi) polarons. The activation energies of the nobilities are low, {approx} 0. 16 eV, and are nearly {{independent of the}} composition. At lower temperatures, conductivities have non-Arrhenius temperature dependencies and strong sensitivity to carbon concentration. Percolative aspects of low-temperature hopping are evident in this sensitivity to composition. Boron carbides' Seebeck coefficients are anomalous in that (1) they are much larger than expected from boron carbides' large carrier densities and (2) they depend only weakly on the carrier density.

25|$|Many of the {{internal}} components and fuel assembly cladding are made from zircaloy because it is relatively transparent to neutrons. At normal operating temperatures of approximately , zircaloy is inert. However, above 1200 degrees Celsius, zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas. The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction. In addition, zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal. This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of <b>boron</b> <b>carbide</b> with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.|$|E
25|$|Sand{{blasting}} or {{bead blasting}} is a generic {{term for the}} process of smoothing, shaping, and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds. Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles {{come in a variety}} of shapes, sizes, and materials. <b>Boron</b> <b>carbide</b> is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well.

25|$|In {{empirical}} formulas, these proportions {{begin with}} a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, as ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers.

Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas.

25|$|Radiation {{damage to}} nickel alloys - The {{standard}} Hastelloy N alloy {{was found to}} be embrittled by neutron radiation. Neutrons reacted with nickel to form helium. This helium gas concentrated at specific points inside the alloy, where it increased stresses. ORNL addressed this problem by adding 1–2% titanium or niobium to the Hastelloy N. This changed the alloy's internal structure so that the helium would be finely distributed. This relieved the stress and allowed the alloy to withstand considerable neutron flux. However the maximum temperature is limited to about 650°C. Development of other alloys may be required. The outer vessel wall that contains the salt can have neutronic shielding, such as <b>boron</b> <b>carbide,</b> to effectively protect it from neutron damage.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the reactor}} control rods are {{inserted}} from above; 24 shortened rods are inserted from below {{and are used}} to augment the axial power distribution control of the core. With the exception of 12 automatic rods, the control rods have a [...] long graphite section at the end, separated by a [...] long telescope (which creates a water-filled space between the graphite and the absorber), and a <b>boron</b> <b>carbide</b> neutron absorber section. The role of the graphite section, known as [...] "displacer," [...] is to enhance {{the difference between the}} neutron flux attenuation levels of inserted and retracted rods, as the graphite displaces water that would otherwise act as a neutron absorber, although much weaker than boron carbide; a control rod channel filled with graphite absorbs fewer neutrons than when filled with water, so the difference between inserted and retracted control rod is increased. When the control rod is fully retracted, the graphite displacer is located {{in the middle of the}} core height, with 1.25m of water at each of its ends. The displacement of water in the lower 1.25m of the core as the rod moves down causes a local increase of reactivity in the bottom of the core as the graphite part of the control rod passes that section. This [...] "positive scram" [...] effect was discovered in 1983 at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The control rod channels are cooled by an independent water circuit and kept at [...] The narrow space between the rod and its channel hinders water flow around the rods during their movement and acts as a fluid damper, which is the primary cause of their slow insertion time (nominally 18–21 seconds for the RCPS rods, or about 0.4m/s). After the Chernobyl disaster, the control rod servos on other RBMK reactors were exchanged to allow faster rod movements, and even faster movement was achieved by cooling of the control rod tubes by a thin layer of water while letting the rods themselves move in gas.|$|E
