5|$|A <b>brain</b> <b>tumor</b> is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E

Therefore, the workshop was focused mainly on <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> in the F 344 rat and B 6 C 3 F 1 mouse because of the frequent use of these strains in long-term carcinogenesis studies. Over 100 <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> in F 344 rats and more than 50 <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice were reviewed and compared to tumors found in man and domestic or companion animals.

40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>tumors</b> are {{relatively}} rare but deadly cancers, and present {{challenges in the}} determina-tion of risk factors in the population.

The development of methods to prevent or detect <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> {{at an early stage}} is extremely important to reduce damage to the <b>brain</b> from the <b>tumor</b> and the therapy.

40|$|Objectives. The B-cell-specific moloney leukemia virus {{insertion}} site 1 (the Bmi- 1) gene {{is an important}} member in the family of polycomb group (PcG) genes that plays an oncogenic role in several types of cancer, but it’s expression as a prognostic marker in pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> has not been indicated. Materials and Methods. The Bmi- 1 gene expression, clinic pathological and prognostic significance {{in a series of}} pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> were examined by real-time PCR method in 56 pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors.</b> Results. The Bmi- 1 gene expression in various types of pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> compared to that in normal brain tissue was 4. 85 -fold. The relative expression varied from 8. 64 -fold in ependymomas to 2. 89 -fold in other types. Expression level in high-grade tumors compared to that in low-grade tumors was 2. 5 times. In univariate survival analysis of the pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors,</b> a significant association of high expression of the Bmi- 1 with patient survival was demonstrated. In multivariate analysis, the Bmi- 1 high expression provided significant independent prognostic factors. Conclusion. Increased expression of the Bmi- 1 in pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> may be important in the acquisition of an aggressive phenotype. In addition, it {{can be used as a}} strong and independent molecular marker of prognosis in pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. Primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of benign and malignant tumors {{arising from the}} brain parenchyma and its surrounding structures. The epidemiology of these tumors is poorly understood. The aim of our study is to systematically review the latest literature on the incidence and prevalence of primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumors.</b> Methods. The systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted according to a predetermined protocol and established guidelines. Only studies reporting on data from 1985 onward were included. Articles were included if they met the following cri-teria: (i) original research, (ii) population based, (iii) reported an incidence or prevalence estimate of primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumors.</b> Results. From the 53 eligible studies overall, 38 {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. A random-effects model found the overall incidence rate of all <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> to be 10. 82 (95 % CI: 8. 63 – 13. 56) per 100 000 person-years. The incidence proportion estimates were heterogeneous, even among the same tumor subtypes, and ranged from 0. 051 per 100 000 (germ cell tumors) to 25. 48 per 100 000 (all <b>brain</b> <b>tumors).</b> There were insufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis of the prevalence of primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumors.</b> Conclusions. There is a need for more accurate and comparable incidence and prevalence estimates of primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> across the world.

40|$|Background : Till date {{there is}} no {{published}} multi-institutional data regarding the epidemiological profile of pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> in India.

Material and Methods : Data regarding frequencies of various primary <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> (diagnosed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification), in 3936 pediatric patients (< 18 yrs of age), was collected from seven tertiary care hospitals in India. Results : The most common primary pediatric <b>brain</b> <b>tumors</b> were astrocytic tumors (34. 7 &#x 0025;), followed by medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors (22. 4 &#x 0025;), craniopharyngiomas (10. 2 &#x 0025;) and ependymal tumors (9. 8 &#x 0025;). The most common astrocytic tumor was pilocytic astrocytoma. In comparison to adults, oligodendrogliomas and lymphomas were rare in children.
