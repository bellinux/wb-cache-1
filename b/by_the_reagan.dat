5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E

With President Ronald Reagan's support, Cecil prevails, his reputation growing {{to the point that}} he and his wife are invited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagans</b> to be guests at a state dinner. Cecil becomes uncomfortable with the class divisions in the White House. After witnessing Reagan's refusal to support economic sanctions against Apartheid South Africa, Cecil resigns.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the case}} for support of the contras {{continued}} {{to be made in}} Washington, D.C., <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration and <b>The</b> Heritage Foundation, which argued that support for the contras would counter Soviet influence in Nicaragua.|$|R
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} {{on a number of}} issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> and Bush administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the park's lands were donated by entertainer Bob Hope. [...] Other parts of the park, added later, were previously owned by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox for movie ranches. Part of the former 20th Century Fox Ranch had been purchased in 1966 from Ronald <b>Reagan.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Reagan</b> ranch, known as 'Yearling Row,' was owned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> future president from 1951 to 1966 (Reagan earlier owned another ranch also called Yearling Row in Northridge, California). It was sold <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagans</b> to pay campaign debts from the 1966 California governor's campaign. Additional parcels have been connected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.|$|R

25|$|Prior to the 1980s, private prisons did {{not exist}} in the U.S. During the 1980s, {{as a result of the}} War on Drugs <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> Administration, the number of people incarcerated rose. This created a demand for more prison space. The result was the {{development}} of privatization and the for-profit prison industry.|$|E
25|$|From {{an early}} stage, the rebels {{received}} financial and military {{support from the}} United States government, and their military significance decisively depended on it. After US support was banned <b>by</b> Congress, <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration covertly continued it. These covert activities culminated in the Iran–Contra affair.|$|R

25|$|A 1997 {{survey of}} 35 {{countries}} found rates above 2% {{in about a}} third of the countries surveyed. The highest rates were in the former USSR, the Baltic states, Argentina, India and China, and was associated with poor or failing national Tuberculosis Control programmes. Likewise, the appearance of high rates of MDR-TB in New York city the early 1990s was associated with the dismantling of public health programmes <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration.|$|E
25|$|The Brown Defense budgets by fiscal year, in TOA, were as follows: 1978, $116.1 billion; 1979, $124.7 billion; 1980, $141.9 billion; and 1981, $175.5 billion. In {{terms of}} real growth, there were slight {{negative}} percentages in 1978 and 1979, {{and increases in}} 1980 and 1981. Part of the increase for FY 1981 resulted from supplemental appropriations obtained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration; but the Carter administration by this time had departed substantially from its early emphasis on curtailing the DoD budget. Its proposals for FY 1982, submitted in January 1981, called for significant real growth over the TOA for FY 1981.|$|E
25|$|AuCoin's {{opposition}} to U.S. support of authoritarian governments in El Salvador and Guatemala and the Nicaraguan Contras—irregular forces armed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration {{to topple the}} Sandinista government—led him to travel frequently to Central America to document right wing human rights abuses. In 1987, a constituent of AuCoin's named Ben Linder was killed by Contra forces while helping build a small hydroelectric electricity generator for Nicaraguan villagers. Pressed by AuCoin to investigate, the U.S. State Department noted discrepant accounts of Linder’s death: the Contras asserted that Linder died in a firefight, but village witnesses claimed the Contras gave no opportunity to surrender and assassinated Linder at point-blank range.|$|E

5000|$|The Lost Nigger Gold Mine is {{a legendary}} {{mine in the}} {{folklore}} of the United States. According to the legend, in 1887 four brothers in Dryden, Texas—Frank, Jim, John, and Lee Reagan—hired an illiterate Seminole man named William Kelly to help with work on their ranch. Kelly was known as [...] "Nigger Bill" [...] (nigger being a term for a multiracial person in the slang of the Big Bend region) and {{has been identified as}} a cook and also as a horse wrangler; {{at the time of his}} employment <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagans,</b> he was only 14. While working on the ranch, Kelly announced that he had discovered a gold mine, and was [...] "greeted only with jeers". The next day he again tried to tell <b>the</b> <b>Reagans</b> about <b>the</b> mine, even going so far as to show them a lump of gold ore, but received a [...] "cussing out" [...] for his trouble.|$|R
25|$|Cuba {{has participated}} in the {{training}} of Nicaraguan workers {{in the use of}} new machinery imported to Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan revolution caused the United States to oppose the country's government; therefore the Sandinistas would not receive any aid from the United States. The United States embargo against Nicaragua, imposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration in May 1985, made it impossible for Nicaragua to receive spare parts for US-made machines, so this led Nicaragua to look to other countries for help. Cuba was the best choice because of the shared language and proximity and also because it had imported similar machinery over the years. Nicaraguans went to Cuba for short periods of three to six months and this training involved close to 3,000 workers. Countries such as Canada and the UK, sent farm equipment to Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Congress {{authorized}} {{an overhaul}} of the system between Washington and Boston. Called the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project (NECIP), it included safety improvements, modernization of the signaling system by General Railway Signal, and new Centralized Electrification and Traffic Control (CETC) control centers by Chrysler at Philadelphia, New York and Boston. It allowed more trains to run faster and closer together, and set the stage for later high-speed operation. NECIP also introduced the AEM-7 locomotive, which lowered travel times between cities and became the most successful engine on the Corridor. The NECIP set travel time goals of 2 hours and 40 minutes between Washington and New York, and 3 hours and 40 minutes between Boston and New York. These goals were not met because of the low level of funding provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> Administration and Congress in the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Campbell {{gave one}} of his last speeches at the National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights when the 1984 Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco in July. He was {{introduced}} as a feminist, a registered Democrat and a Person With AIDS; he had served as a board director of the National AIDS Foundation and on the steering committee of the Federation of AIDS-related Organizations, founded the National Association of People With AIDS and testified in front of Congressional subcommittees. Campbell told the crowd that he had hugged his boyfriend on the cover of Newsweek, and then kissed Hilliard on stage, [...] "to show Middle America that gay love is beautiful," [...] criticising the Christian right for using scripture to justify their homophobia. After criticising the lack of progress being made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> administration, he held 15 seconds of silence for the 2,000 who had died of AIDS at that point [...] "and [...] those who will die before this is over," [...] before laying out a series of concerns for politicians to address — including increased funding for both research and support services and a warning of the potential for discrimination with the advent of a test for HTLV-3 (now known as HIV) — and appealing to all candidates in the upcoming elections to meet with people with AIDS.|$|E

5000|$|The {{release of}} the US hostages, {{as well as the}} {{unfreezing}} of Iranian assets and establishing arbitration for resolving claims on both sides was negotiated in the Algiers Accords; the accords were signed on the last full day of the Carter administration and assented to <b>by</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>Reagan</b> Administration.|$|R
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reagan</b> Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

50|$|Pressured to {{counteract}} the increased deficit caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> recession, <b>Reagan</b> agreed to a corporate tax increase in 1982.
