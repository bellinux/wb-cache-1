5|$|The least weasel {{is small}} enough to be preyed upon by a range of other predators. Least weasel remains {{have been found in}} the {{excrement}} of red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecat, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards. The owls most efficient at capturing least weasels are barn, barred, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey threatening to the least weasel include broad-winged and rough-legged buzzards. Some snake species may prey on the least weasel, including the <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snake</b> and copperhead. Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.|$|E

40|$|Thermoregulation {{is thought}} to be the most {{important}} factor influencing habitat selection by terrestrial ectotherms, at least in temperate climates. The cost-benefit model of thermoregulation predicts that ectotherms should invest more in thermoreg-ulation when the costs of doing so are low (when the thermal quality of the habitat is high). However, the extent to which ectotherms vary their thermoregulatory behaviour according to the thermal quality of habitats is currently unknown. We studied the relationship between habitat use and thermoregulation in 53 <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. Among the habitats available to <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> edges had the highest thermal quality, retreat sites and forest were intermediate, and open habitats had the lowest thermal quality. <b>Black</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> experienced more favourable body temperatures while in barns (retreat sites) than in edges, and in edges than in forest. During the day, the effectiveness and the extent of thermoregulation by the snakes were equal in barns and forest, but much lower in edges. In fact, <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes</b> selected thermally favourable microhabitats less than their availability while in edges. Therefore, more favourable body temperatures wer...|$|R

50|$|Elaphe {{live in a}} {{great variety}} of environments. The {{variation}} of habitat depends on different species and subspecies. Most are terrestrial or semi-arboreal, but some burrow in sand or loose soil. For example, the <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta, prefer heavily wooded habitats due to their excellent tree climbing ability. Their population can be distributed throughout all elevations, usually on rocky hillsides of mountains or on flat farmlands.On the other hand, the yellow <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta quadrivittata, prefer river swamps as habitats. Similarly, Everglades <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta rossalleni, live in the shrubs and trees along the water way.The Elaphe snakes are spread throughout the northern hemisphere; however, there are some in South America, Africa, Southeast Asia and Northern Australia.For instance, the <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> or Elaphe obsoleta ssp., are well distributed from Ontario, Canada to Florida and Texas.The population of Elaphe guttata is widespread in many southeastern states of the United States including Florida, Louisiana, southern New Jersey and parts of Kentucky.|$|R

Many insect pests eat hickory leaves and bark. Mockernut hickories also provide cavities for animals to live in, such as woodpeckers, <b>black</b> <b>rat</b> <b>snakes,</b> raccoons, Carolina chickadees, and more. They are also good nesting trees, providing cover for birds with their thick foliage. Animals help disperse seeds so that new hickories can grow elsewhere. Chipmunks, squirrels, and birds do this best. Some fungi grow on mockernut hickory roots, sharing nutrients from the soil.|$|R
