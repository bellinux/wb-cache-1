40|$|In 1965 it {{was shown}} that men with an {{additional}} Y chromosome were found in unusually large num-bers in the Scottish State Hospital (Jacobs et al.), and this observation was substantiated by a similar finding in the English Special Hospitals (Casey et al., 1966) and among the inmates of comparable insti-tutions in France (Noel et al., 1969). As the pre-vious histories of {{more than half of}} the men with a 47,XYY constitution identified in the Scottish State Hospital had included periods of training in ap-proved schools and <b>borstal</b> <b>institutions</b> and periods of imprisonment, it was decided to investigate the cytogenetic status of males in these establishments.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present an {{analytical}} review of juvenile delinquents, generally in Pakistan and particularly in Sindh. Pakistan is facing an ever-increasing Juvenile delinquency and there are insufficient Juvenile Jails to humanely accommodate them in for their rehabilitation. It is obvious that the crimes by delinquents obviously differ by type and intentions from traditional crimes by adults. The open ended data, through well-structured and pre-tested Questionnaires, was collected only from Karachi Central Prison and <b>Borstal</b> <b>Institutions</b> located in Karachi. The result manifests the causes that are based on conflicting environments, in and outside home, as well as spoiling attitudes and bad impact influenced by media. Poverty is the nucleus of all the anti-social actions and is the main cause of increasing juvenile delinquency. Juvenileâ€™s detention in jail with adult criminals is another cause of generating hardened criminals. The study recommends separate Jails for Juveniles in every District, providing them with educational and vocational training during probationary imprisonment, and dealing with the juvenile delinquents as per the clauses provided in Juvenile Justice System Ordinance (JJSO) 2000. The JJSO 2000 would be the only solution to facilitate the often innocent offender to become the active social worker of his or her community.

40|$|This {{study was}} an {{investigation}} of the attribution of social causality by delinquents and non-delinquents. For this purpose, an attempt was made to construct a locus of control scale with item contents relevant to the limited life spaces of young people. The resulting Causal Attribution Scale for Children (C. A. S. C.) yielded validity and reliability indices good enough to encourage its use in the substantive investigation. To test the similarity in developmental antecedents between internal control orientation and high self-esteem, the relationship between the attributional orientations of subjects and their self-esteem was investigated along with sex, age and social class differences in both constructs. Delinquents were drawn from a remand home, a community home, and <b>borstal</b> <b>institutions.</b> Controls were drawn from various secondary schools, a technical college, and from a group of interviewees for university places. Results showed that delinquents were both significantly more external in control orientation and lower in self-esteem than controls. Intra-delinquent group differences showed that remand home delinquents were significantly more external but nonsignificant ly lower in self-esteem than all other groups of delinquents. Community home delinquents, though of the same age range as remand home delinquents, did well enough to be non-significantly different in both constructs from the much older borstal subjects. Suggestions that could yield administrative and therapeutic advantages were made. While borstal boys were more internal in orientation and higher in self-esteem than borstal girls, female controls were more internal than male controls but lower in self-esteem than the latter. No social class differences were found. Delinquency played a major role vis a vis the differences foundin the study. In contrast to controls, delinquents were also significantly more inclined to positive reinforcements. Locus of control correlated more highly with self-esteem for controls than for delinquents and more highly for males than for females, possibly reflecting the differential treatment by society of males, females, and young offenders. It was concluded that, among other things, a refined C. A. S. C. with the T. S. C. S. could effectively aid the detection and management of problems of delinquency. <p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Juvenile {{delinquency}} {{has become}} a significant global problem. Conduct disorder (CD), among other psychiatric disorders, has assumed prominence in its association with juvenile offending as well as criminality in adulthood. Despite this knowledge, little attention is given to this problem especially as it affects adjudicated adolescent offenders in developing countries. Aim: To examine the prevalence and correlates of CD among incarcerated adolescents in a Nigerian <b>Borstal</b> <b>Institution</b> and to investigate its independent predictors. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 147 inmates of a <b>Borstal</b> <b>Institution</b> in Abeokuta, South Western Nigeria. A self-administered questionnaire and interviewer administered MINI-KID were used. The associations between conduct disorder and socio demographic as well as forensic variables were investigated using Chi square statistics while logistic regression was used to predict CD. Results: Out of 147 respondents, 83 (56. 5 %) met the criteria for CD {{with a mean age}} 17. 1 Â± 1. 1. Of the socio-demographic and forensic variables investigated, number of siblings (OR 4. 630; p = 0. 010; 95 % CI 1. 433 - 14. 964) and previous history of incarceration (OR 4. 99; p = 0. 043; 95 % CI 1. 048 - 23. 846) emerged as independent predictors of CD. Conclusions: This study recorded a high prevalence of conduct disorder among a sample of incarcerated juvenile offenders. The association of conduct disorder with large family size and recidivism highlights the need for comprehensive early interventions focused on improving parental supervision in large families as well as other re-training programs aimed at reducing juvenile re-offending...|$|R
50|$|The Verne Prison {{opened in}} 1949 within a former {{military}} citadel, {{which had been}} built between 1857-81, and designed by Captain W Crossman of the Royal Engineers, enclosing 56 acres to defend Portland Harbour. The Verne Citadel became a prison in 1949, while HM Prison Portland had become a <b>Borstal</b> <b>Institution</b> by this time. On 1 February 1949 an advance party of 20 prisoners arrived. The prison largely occupied {{the southern part of}} the citadel. Since becoming established the interior of the prison was substantially rebuilt by prison labour, and the modern prison, a Category C prison for adult males, gained a considerable training programme for its prisoners who were serving either medium and long term sentences, including life sentences.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{inception}} of the prison, various quarries were opened up within the Grove area for convicts to work in. A large majority of Portland's landscape is strongly influenced by the remains of past quarrying, as well as related transport and tramway systems, as well as subsidiary industries such as lime production. As a result of this many lime kilns would be built to produce quicklime through the calcination of limestone. The Grove Lime kiln dates from circa 1900, with the prison first opening in 1848. The lime kiln is one of at least six individual examples on Portland that existed between 1864 and 1902, built to process limestone from the surrounding quarries. The lime kiln was constructed and operated by prisoners from the Portland Convict Establishment (now the Young Offenders Institution). When the prisoners were first brought to Portland in 1848, they formed a valuable workforce on the island. The convicts would be employed in quarrying and general construction work, and this was originally to provide stone for the construction of Portland Harbour's breakwaters and the Verne Citadel. The conditions in the prison and its quarries during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century were a major catalyst for penal reform in this country, and many prisoners died while quarrying stone. Within The Grove village and surrounding areas, local entrepreneurs living adjacent to the prison quarries would charge visitors to view the prisoners at work from the upper windows of their houses. In 1921 the government decided to convert the prison into a <b>Borstal</b> <b>Institution,</b> and as a result the quarry and associated masonry works closed. It is likely that lime production at the Grove Lime kiln also ceased at about this time.|$|R

40|$|Between 1978 and 1992 {{the number}} of {{juvenile}} offenders aged under 17 in England and Wales who were removed from home under sentence and sent to institutions such as detention centres, <b>borstals,</b> youth custody <b>institutions</b> or residential Community Homes with Education fell from 14, 000 to 1, 800. This thesis documents how this significant decarceration came about, and why it has been given little attention in the criminological literature, placing it in context of developments in juvenile justice legislation and practice between 1965 and 1996 and theories of policy change. It suggests that the key development was the funding of charity and voluntary sector organisations to provide Intensive Intermediate Treatment programmes to juvenile courts {{as an alternative to}} custody, {{and the development of a}} small group of practitioners willing to act as campaigning advocates for young offenders in court. Interviews with key politicians, civil servants, academics and practitioners from this period are used to explore these trends in more detail, and consideration is given to the respective roles of the Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Security and the tensions between them over responsibility for young offenders. The development is then situated within theories and examples of decarceration, deinstitutionalization, abolitionism and reductionism, drawing on attempts to close institutions or to reduce institutionalization in the fields of youth justice, mental health and learning difficulties in the UK and other countries. Alternative explanations of what happened in juvenile justice in England and Wales are considered and challenged. Conclusions are then drawn as to the conditions that are necessary for any decarceration strategy to be successful and sustainable...|$|R
