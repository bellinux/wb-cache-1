5|$|Other NAD-dependent enzymes include <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> ligases, which join two DNA ends {{by using}} NAD as a {{substrate}} to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3' hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> to another bacterium.|$|E

PFGE, on the other hand, showed that all the patients were contaminated with individual isolates. Combined numerical analysis performed by compiling the PFGE patterns obtained after XbaI and DraI digestions of <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNAs</b> suggested the occurrence of polyclonal infection in three of nine patients. Our results do not support a common source of M. simiae infection in Guadeloupe...|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E

25|$|Since 1893, it {{has been}} {{recognized}} that Coley's toxin, a mixture of bacterial cell lysate, has immunostimulatory properties that could reduce the progression of some carcinomas, {{but it was not}} until 1983 that Tokunaga et al. specifically identified <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> as the underlying component of the lysate that elicited the response. Then, in 1995 Krieg et al. demonstrated that the CpG motif within <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> was responsible for the immunostimulatory effects and developed synthetic CpG ODN. Since then, synthetic CpG ODN have been the focus of intense research due to the Type I pro-inflammatory response they elicit and their successful use as vaccine adjuvants.|$|E

25|$|Unlike eukaryotes, the <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> is not {{enclosed}} {{inside of}} a membrane-bound nucleus but instead resides inside the bacterial cytoplasm. This means that the transfer of cellular information through the processes of translation, transcription and DNA replication all occur within the same compartment and can interact with other cytoplasmic structures, most notably ribosomes. The <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> is not packaged using histones to form chromatin as in eukaryotes but instead exists as a highly compact supercoiled structure, the precise nature of which remains unclear. Most bacterial chromosomes are circular although some examples of linear DNA exist (e.g. Borrelia burgdorferi). Along with chromosomal DNA, most bacteria also contain small independent pieces of DNA called plasmids that often encode for traits that are advantageous but not essential to their bacterial host. Plasmids can be easily gained or lost by a bacterium and can be transferred between bacteria {{as a form of}} horizontal gene transfer. So plasmids can be described as an extra chromosomal DNA in a bacterial cell.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{announce}} that they successfully introduced two artificial nucleotides, Unnatural Base Pairs (UBRs), into <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA,</b> and by including the individual artificial nucleotides {{in the culture}} media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins {{able to use the}} artificial nucleotides. The artificial nucleotides featured two fused aromatic rings which formed a complex mimicking the natural (dG–dC) base pair.|$|E
25|$|It is now {{relatively}} simple to generate transgenic flies in Drosophila, {{relying on a}} variety of techniques. One approach of inserting foreign genes into the Drosophila genome involves P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as transposons, are segments of <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> that are transferred into the fly genome. Transgenic flies have already contributed to many scientific advances, e.g., modeling such human diseases as Parkinson's, neoplasia, obesity, and diabetes.|$|E
40|$|Isopycnic {{sedimentation}} in metrizamide gradients {{has shown}} that mouse-liver histones bind co-operatively to both homologous and <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA's.</b> However, at low input ratios of histone to DNA, two types of stable complex are formed, depending on the histone concentration. One complex contains half as much histone as DNA while the other contains approximately equal amounts of histone and DNA. At high input ratios of histone to DNA extra histone is bound giving complexes containing up to twice as much histone as DNA. Poly-L-lysine and protamine were also found to bind co-operatively to DNA...|$|R

This difference in capacity of the strands to reassociate can be used to effect a preparative separation of the minor component from the principal fraction. The rate constant for reassociation of the minor component, compared with those of viral and <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA's,</b> indicates that the minor component consists of a short nucleotide sequence present in about one million copies...|$|R

25|$|Many {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} for incorporating unnatural nucleotides and amino acids into nucleic acids and proteins, both in vitro and in vivo.

25|$|A {{critical}} review of ancient DNA literature {{through the development}} of the field highlights that few studies after about 2002 have succeeded in amplifying DNA from remains older than several hundred thousand years. A greater appreciation for the risks of environmental contamination and studies on the chemical stability of DNA have resulted in concerns being raised over previously reported results. The dinosaur DNA was later revealed to be human Y-chromosome, while the DNA reported from encapsulated halobacteria has been criticized based on its similarity to modern bacteria, which hints at contamination. A 2007 study also suggests that these <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> samples may not have survived from ancient times, but may instead be the product of long-term, low-level metabolic activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is unique and complex. The drug works by damaging <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA,</b> since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is {{made possible by the}} rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the bacterial cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on bacterial cells than mammalian cells because bacterial cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad {{mechanism of}} action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the bacterial cell.|$|E

3000|$|... cGAS {{plays an}} {{important}} role in monitoring <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNAs.</b> As a classic intraphagosomal pathogen, M. tuberculosis can translocate from phagolysosomes to cytoplasm where M. tuberculosis PAMPs associate with host cytosolic sensors (van der Wel et al., 2007). M. tuberculosis activates the cytoplasmic DNA surveillance pathway through disrupting phagosomes by proteins of the secretion system such as ESX- 1, ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 (De Leon et al., 2012; Manzanillo et al., 2012; Simeone et al., 2012). Microbial DNAs then leak out to the cytosol where they are recognized by cGAS, followed by STING-IRF 3 activation (Collins et al., 2015; Wassermann et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2015).|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of methylated sites on <b>bacterial</b> genomic <b>DNA</b> {{would be a}} useful tool to study the major roles of DNA methylation in prokaryotes: distinction of self and nonself DNA, direction of post-replicative mismatch repair, control of DNA replication and cell cycle, and regulation of gene expression. Three types of methylated nucleobases are known: N- 6 -methyladenine, 5 -methylcytosine and N- 4 -methylcytosine. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a method to detect all three types of DNA methylation in complete genomic DNA. It was previously shown that N- 6 -methyladenine and 5 -methylcytosine in plasmid and viral DNA can be detected by intersequence trace comparison of methylated and unmethylated DNA. We extended this method to include N- 4 -methylcytosine detection in both in vitro and in vivo methylated DNA. Furthermore, application of intersequence trace comparison was extended to <b>bacterial</b> genomic <b>DNA.</b> Finally, we present evidence that intrasequence comparison suffices to detect methylated sites in genomic DNA. In conclusion, we present a method to detect all three natural types of <b>DNA</b> methylation in <b>bacterial</b> genomic <b>DNA.</b> This provides the possibility to define the complete methylome of any prokaryot...|$|R
25|$|DNA vaccination– an alternative, {{experimental}} {{approach to}} vaccination called DNA vaccination, created from an infectious agent's DNA, is under development. The proposed mechanism is the insertion (and expression, {{enhanced by the}} use of electroporation, triggering immune system recognition) of viral or <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> into human or animal cells. Some cells of the immune system that recognize the proteins expressed will mount an attack against these proteins and cells expressing them. Because these cells live for a very long time, if the pathogen that normally expresses these proteins is encountered at a later time, they will be attacked instantly by the immune system. One potential advantage of DNA vaccines is that they are very easy to produce and store. As of 2015, DNA vaccination is still experimental and is not approved for human use.|$|E
25|$|Plasmid DNA itself {{appears to}} have an {{adjuvant}} effect on the immune system. Bacterially derived DNA can trigger innate immune defence mechanisms, the activation of dendritic cells {{and the production of}} TH1 cytokines. This is due to recognition of certain CpG dinucleotide sequences that are immunostimulatory. CpG stimulatory (CpG-S) sequences occur twenty times more frequently in bacterially-derived DNA than in eukaryotes. This is because eukaryotes exhibit “CpG suppression” – i.e. CpG dinucleotide pairs occur much less frequently than expected. Additionally, CpG-S sequences are hypomethylated. This occurs frequently in <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA,</b> while CpG motifs occurring in eukaryotes are methylated at the cytosine nucleotide. In contrast, nucleotide sequences that inhibit the activation of an immune response (termed CpG neutralising, or CpG-N) are over represented in eukaryotic genomes. The optimal immunostimulatory sequence is an unmethylated CpG dinucleotide flanked by two 5’ purines and two 3’ pyrimidines. Additionally, flanking regions outside this immunostimulatory hexamer must be guanine-rich to ensure binding and uptake into target cells.|$|E
500|$|In {{bacterial}} conjugation, where DNA {{is transferred}} between bacteria through direct cell-to-cell contact, homologous recombination helps integrate foreign DNA into the host genome via the RecBCD pathway. [...] The RecBCD enzyme promotes recombination after DNA is converted from single-strand DNA–in which form it originally enters the bacterium–to double-strand DNA during replication. [...] The RecBCD pathway is also {{essential for the}} final phase of transduction, a type of horizontal gene transfer in which DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another by a virus. [...] Foreign, <b>bacterial</b> <b>DNA</b> is sometimes misincorporated in the capsid head of bacteriophage virus particles as DNA is packaged into new bacteriophages during viral replication. [...] When these new bacteriophages infect other bacteria, DNA from the previous host bacterium is injected into the new bacterial host as double-strand DNA.
