40|$|A blanket {{supplementary}} feeding programme for young children was implemented for four months in five northern districts of Kenya from January 2010 because of fears of food insecurity exacerbated by drought. An attempt to evaluate {{the impact of the}} food on children’s anthropometric status was put in place in three districts. The main aim of the analysis was to assess the quality of the data on the cohort of children studied in the evaluation and to propose methods by which it could be improved to evaluate future <b>blanket</b> <b>feeding</b> programmes. Data on the name, age, sex, weight and height of a systematic sample of children recruited at 61 food distribution sites were collected at the first, second and third rounds and again at an extra, fifth food distribution, offered only to the evaluation subjects. Of the 3, 544 children enrolled, 483 (13. 63 %) did not collect a fifth ration. Of the 2, 640 children who were considered by their name to be the same at the first and fifth food distribution (13 % were different), data on only 902 children (34. 17 %) were considered acceptable based on their age (an arbitrary 63 months different) and their length or height (between. 21 or# 4 cm different) at the two instances they were seen. Data on nearly two thirds of children were of questionable quality. The main reasons for the poor quality data were inconsistencies in estimating age or because caretakers may have brought different children. Recommendations are made about how to improve data quality including ensuring that entry to a <b>blanket</b> <b>feeding</b> programme is clearly based on height, not age, to avoid misreporting age; careful identification of subjects at all contacts; and using well-trained, specialis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recently, {{operational}} organizations {{active in}} child nutrition {{in developing countries}} have suggested that <b>blanket</b> <b>feeding</b> strategies be adopted to enable the prevention of child wasting. A new range of nutritional supplements is now available, with claims that they can prevent wasting in populations at risk of periodic food shortages. Evidence is lacking as {{to the effectiveness of}} such preventive interventions. This study examined the effect of a ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) on the prevention of wasting in 6 - to 36 -mo-old children within the framework of a general food distribution program. Methods and Findings: We conducted a two-arm cluster-randomized controlled pragmatic intervention study in a sample of 1, 038 children aged 6 to 36 mo in the city of Abeche, Chad. Both arms were included in a general food distribution program providing staple foods. The intervention group was given a daily 46 g of RUSF for 4 mo. Anthropometric measurements and morbidity were recorded monthly. Adding RUSF to a package of monthly household food rations for households containing a child assigned to the intervention group did not result in a reduction in cumulative incidence of wasting (incidence risk ratio: 0. 86; 95 % CI: 0. 67, 1. 11; p = 0. 25). However, the intervention group had a modestly higher gain in height-for-age (+ 0. 03 Z-score/mo; 95 % CI: 0. 01, 0. 04; p < 0. 001). In addition, children in the intervention group had a significantly higher hemoglobin concentration {{at the end of the}} study than children in the control group (+ 3. 8 g/l; 95 % CI: 0. 6, 7. 0; p = 0. 02), thereby reducing the odds of anemia (odds ratio: 0. 52; 95 % CI: 0. 34, 0. 82; p = 0. 004). Adding RUSF also resulted in a significantly lower risk of self-reported diarrhea (- 29. 3 %; 95 % CI: 20. 5, 37. 2; p < 0. 001) and fever episodes (- 22. 5 %; 95 % CI: 14. 0, 30. 2; p < 0. 001). Limitations of this study include that the projected sample size was not fully attained and that significantly fewer children from the control group were present at follow-up sessions. Conclusions: Providing RUSF as part of a general food distribution resulted in improvements in hemoglobin status and small improvements in linear growth, accompanied by an apparent reduction in morbidity...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{nutritional}} {{impact of a}} Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplement (LNS) and an Improved Dry Ration (IDR) in <b>blanket</b> supplementary <b>feeding</b> programs. Design: Longitudinal, quasi experimental non-randomized study Setting: Otash and Al Salaam internally displaced persons camps, South Darfur, Sudan Subjects: Children aged 6 - 36 months were randomly selected {{for inclusion in the}} study based on height cut-off of 95 cm and were anthropometrically assessed (weight-for-height z scores [WHZ] based on WHO standards, edema presence, and midupper arm circumference) monthly. IDR was distributed in Otash camp and LNS in Al Salaam. Main findings: At baseline, 658 and 893 children were enrolled and 159 and 187 children were assessed at all 4 distributions in Otash and Al Salaam camps, respectively; There {{was no significant difference in}} mean WHZ between the two groups at baseline, (Otash=- 1. 18 and Al Salaam=- 1. 03, p= 0. 17). Children receiving LNS had higher mean WHZ than those receiving IDR. Significant differences were detected at months 2 - 4, for the mean WHZ of the LNS cohort, and at 4 months, for the difference of the difference in mean WHZ (- 0. 23) between camps, p = 0. 02.

40|$|In {{response}} to a nutritional crisis, the World Food Programme (WFP) and its partners implemented a <b>blanket</b> supplementary <b>feeding</b> program (BSFP) in six counties across northern Kenya (Marsabit, Isiolo, Mandera, Wajir, Turkana, and Samburu). Children 6 - 36 months of age or less than < 95 cm in length/height, and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) were initially the target population based on the funds available. Monthly rations of corn soy blend plus (CSB+) and oil were distributed; 200 gm CSB+ and 20 gm oil per day provided approximately 977 kilocalories per day. Systematic interventions (vitamin A supplementation, deworming and immunization per the national protocol) and health education were {{also included in the}} BSFP. Children and PLW were screened using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) at each distribution and referred to treatment if found to be acutely malnourished (moderate or severe). Caregivers were instructed to bring the registered child to each distribution to receive the ration. The initial program was planned for August–December 2011, or 5 monthly distributions, but extended until March 2012 as a result of delays in transport, mainly due to impassable roads during the short rains, and lack of prepositioned commodities caused by late contributions from donors. The overall objective of the program evaluation was to describe the impact of BSFP in two Counties in northern Kenya. The evaluation was designed to determine if this specific program prevented deterioration of the nutritional status among children enrolled in the program by following a prospective, longitudinal cohort of non...|$|R
40|$|American Nuclear Society. This paper {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of designing seed-and-blanket (S & B) sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) cores to generate a significant fraction of the core power from radial thorium-fueled blankets that operate in the breed-and-burn (B & B) mode. The radiation damage on the cladding material in both seed and blanket does not exceed the presently acceptable constraint of 200 displacements per atom (dpa). The S & B core is designed to have an elongated seed (or driver) to maximize the fraction of neutrons that radially leak into the subcritical B & B blanket and reduce the neutron loss via axial leakage. A specific objective {{of this study is}} to maximize the fraction of core power generated by the B & B blanket that is proportional to the neutron leakage rate from the seed to the blanket. Since the <b>blanket</b> <b>feed</b> fuel is very inexpensive and requires no reprocessing and remote fuel fabrication, a larger fraction of power from the blanket will result in a lower fuel cycle cost per unit of electricity generated by the SFR core. It is found possible to design the seed of the S & B core to have a lower transuranics (TRU) conversion ratio (CR) than a conventional advanced burner reactor (ABR) core without deteriorating core safety. This is due to the unique synergism between a low CR seed and the B & B thorium blanket. The benefits of the synergism are maximized when using an annular seed surrounded by inner and outer thorium blankets. Two high-performance S & B cores are designed to benefit from the annular seed concept: (1) an ultra-long-cycle core having a CR = 0. 5 seed and a cycle length of ∼ 7 effective full-power years (EFPYs) and (2) a high-transmutation core having a TRU CR of 0. 0. The TRU transmutation rate of the latter core is comparable to that of the reference ABR with a CR of 0. 5, and the thorium blanket can generate close to 60 % of the core power. Because of the high blanket power fraction along with the high discharge burnup of the CR = 0 seed, the reprocessing capacity per unit of core power required by this S & B core is only approximately 1 / 6 th that of the reference ABR core with a TRU CR of 0. 5. Although the seed fuel CR is nearly zero, the burnup reactivity swing is low enough to enable a cycle length of more than 4 EFPYs. This is attributed to a combination of reactivity gain in the thorium blankets over the cycle and the relatively high heavy metal inventory. Moreover, despite the very low leakage, the S & B cores feature a less positive coolant reactivity coefficient and large enough negative Doppler coefficient even when using nonfertile fuel for the seed, because of the unique physics properties of the U and Th in the thorium blankets. With the long cycles, the S & B SFR is expected to have a higher capacity factor, and therefore a lower cost of electricity, than conventional ABRs. The discharge burnup of the thorium blanket fuel is typically 70 MWd/kg such that the thorium fuel utilization is approximately 12 times that of natural uranium in light water reactors. A sensitivity study is subsequently undertaken to quantify the trade-off between the core performances and several design variables: amount of zirconium in the inert matrix seed fuel, active core height, coolant pressure drop, and radiation damage constraint. The effect of the criterion used for quantifying acceptable radiation damage is evaluated as well. It is concluded that a viable S & B core can be designed without significant deviation from typical SFR core design practices...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{closely related}} disease Bluetongue {{established}} itself in The Netherlands in 2006 (Mellor et all., 2008), African Horse Sickness (AHS) {{is considered a}} potential threat for the Dutch horse population (Maclachlan & Guthrie, 2010). In the 2011 Culicoides- project of the Department of Equine Sciences (Dr. Sloet) one pair of sheep were housed within mosquito tent traps {{with or without a}} inner tent and two horses were also placed in apart tents with or without an insect blanket. All trapped Culicoides spp. were counted and identified microscopically. The complete project included three questions: 1. 	What types of Culicoides spp. are caught in the proximity of sheep and horses by means of mosquito tent traps in The Netherlands, and are these similar to the number and types caught during the same period in an Onderste Poort black light trap? 2. 	What is the normal biting rate of the Culicoides spp., which are caught in the proximity of sheep and horses? 3. 	Does the use of an insect blanket including neck and hood reduce the biting rate? These three questions were studied by the three students participating in the project. In the practical parts of the project the three students have worked closely together, but afterwards each of the students wrote an own paper. In the present paper the third question will be outlined. To be able to find effective ways to prevent these Culicoides species of spreading African Horse Sickness, {{it is important to know}} which Culicoides species can be found in the direct surroundings of horses and sheep in the Netherlands. There are several strategies devised to protect horses against AHS. A measure that might work, looking at the prevention of insect bite hypersensitivity, is the use of an insect blanket. Determining the average insect feeding rate of Culicoides species in horses caught in a mosquito tent traps with a horse with or without an insect blanket including neck and hood is important to evaluate whether these insect <b>blankets</b> limit the <b>feeding</b> of Culicoides species on horses. In the present study the effects of the insect blanket on the Culicoides biting rate are outlined. The total number of Culicoides caught in this study varied widely per test from 5 to 328 in the mosquito tent traps with a horse and from 10 to 1302 in the black light trap. In the direct surrounding of horses wearing insect <b>blankets</b> the average <b>feeding</b> rate of all Culicoides midges (32...|$|R
40|$|Stunting and {{micronutrient}} malnutrition are persistent {{public health}} problems in refugee populations. UNHCR and its partner organisations implement <b>blanket</b> supplementary <b>feeding</b> programmes using {{a range of}} special nutritional products as one approach to address these issues. The evidence base for the efficacy and effectiveness of a small quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement, Nutributter®, in reducing stunting and anaemia is limited. Secondary data {{analysis was used to}} assess the effectiveness of Nutributter® distribution on anaemia and stunting in children aged 6 - 23 months (programme target group) and 6 - 59 months (the standard age group sampled in routine nutrition surveys). Analysis was conducted using routine pre and post-intervention cross-sectional nutrition survey data collected between 2008 - 2011 in five refugee camps in Kenya and Djibouti. Changes in total anaemia (Haemoglobin< 110 g/L), anaemia categories (mild, moderate and severe), and stunting (height-for-age z-score <- 2) were explored using available data on the Nutributter® programme and contextual factors. A significant reduction in the prevalence of anaemia in children aged 6 - 23 months and 6 - 59 months was seen in four of five, and in all five camps, respectively (p< 0. 05). Reductions ranged from 12. 4 to 23. 0, and 18. 3 to 29. 3 percentage points in each age group. Improvements were largely due to reductions in moderate and severe anaemia and occurred where the prevalence of acute malnutrition was stable or increasing. No change in stunting was observed in four of five camps. The replicability of findings across five sites strongly suggests that Nutributter® distribution was associated with a reduction in anaemia, but not stunting, among refugee children in the Horn of Africa. Benefits were not restricted to the 6 - 23 month target group targeted by the nutrition programme. However, even following this intervention anaemia remained a serious public health problem and additional work to define and evaluate an effective intervention package is warranted...|$|R
