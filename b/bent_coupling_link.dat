40|$|Traffic {{dynamics}} on {{single or}} isolated complex networks {{has been extensively}} studied in the past decade. Recently, several coupled network models {{have been developed to}} describe the interactions between real-world networked systems. In a system of interconnected networks, the <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> refer to the physical links between networks and provide paths for traffic transmission. Thus, the coupling pattern, i. e., the way <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> are added, has a profound influence on the overall traffic performance. In this paper, we employ a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal configuration of the <b>coupling</b> <b>links,</b> which effectively improves the overall traffic capacity compared with random, assortative and disassortative couplings. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal configuration of <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> given by the SA algorithm and develop a faster method to select the <b>coupling</b> <b>links.</b> Comment: 5 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{algebraic}} connectivity UN- 1, i. e. {{the second}} smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, plays {{a crucial role}} in dynamic phenomena such as diffusion processes, synchronization stability, and network robustness. In this work we study the algebraic connectivity in the general context of interdependent networks, or network-of-networks (NoN). The present work shows, both analytically and numerically, how the algebraic connectivity of NoNs experiences a transition. The transition is characterized by a saturation of the algebraic connectivity upon the addition of suffcient <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> (between the two individual networks of a NoN). In practical terms, this shows that NoN topologies require only a fraction of <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> in order to achieve optimal diffusivity.

40|$|We {{propose a}} set of general {{coupling}} conditions to select a coupling profile ({{a set of}} coupling matrices) from the linear flow matrix (LFM) of dynamical systems for realizing global stability of complete synchronization (CS) in identical systems and robustness to parameter perturbation. The coupling matrices define the <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> between any two oscillators in a network that consists of a conventional diffusive <b>coupling</b> <b>link</b> (self-coupling link) {{as well as a}} cross-coupling link. The addition of a selective cross-coupling link in particular plays constructive roles that ensure the global stability of synchrony and furthermore enables robustness of synchrony against small to non-small parameter perturbation. We elaborate the general conditions for the selection of coupling profiles for two coupled systems, three- and four-node network motifs analytically as well as numerically using benchmark models, the Lorenz system, the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model, the Shimizu-Morioka laser model, the Rössler system and a Sprott system. The role of the cross-coupling link is, particularly, exemplified with an example of a larger network where it saves the network from a breakdown of synchrony against large parameter perturbation in any node. The perturbed node in the network transits from CS to generalized synchronization (GS) when all the other nodes remain in CS. The GS is manifested by an amplified response of the perturbed node in a coherent state. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, Physical Review E (accepted...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a mathematical model}} of synaptic interaction between two pulse neuron elements. Each of the neurons is modeled by a singularly-perturbed difference-differential equation with delay. Coupling {{is assumed to be}} at the threshold, and time delay is taken into consideration. Problems of existence and stability of relaxation periodic movements for obtained systems are considered. It turns out that the ratio between the delay due to internal causes in a single neuron model and the delay in the <b>coupling</b> <b>link</b> between oscillators is crucial. Existence and stability of a uniform cycle of the problem is proved for the case where the delay in the link is less than a period of a single oscillator that depends on the internal delay. As the delay grows, the in-phase regime becomes more complex, particularly, it is shown that by choosing a suitable delay, we can obtain more complex relaxation oscillation and inside a period interval the system can exhibit not one but several high-amplitude splashes. This means that bursting-effect can appear in a system of two synaptic coupled oscillators of neuron type due to a delay in a <b>coupling</b> <b>link...</b>|$|R

40|$|The big {{advantage}} of LED is the flexible spectral design to make white light using different color mixing schemes. Recently, the color mixing of RGB LEDs is mostly done by sealing all three chips at single package and regulated the mix ratio {{of these three}} colors to produce the color of light.

While distance variation in WPT has been thoroughly studied, the effects of conductive interfering objects in resonant inductive <b>coupling</b> <b>links</b> are still unclear. When a conductive element is in the vicinity of a RIC link, both the transmitter and the receiver can experiment a change on their resonant frequencies as well as their impedances. This can greatly affect the efficiency of such WPT link causing it to a) make the transmitter and/or receiver act as a pass-band filter and b) loose part of the transmitter magnetic field through coupling to the interfering object. Depending on the natural resonant frequency of the object and the distances between this object and the transmitter and receiver antennas, this can affect significantly the RIC wireless power transfer link. In this article, we characterize the Magnetic behavior of a resonant inductive <b>coupled</b> <b>link</b> {{in the presence of a}} conductive interfering object using a Finite Element Field Solver (FEKO).
