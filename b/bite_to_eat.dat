2500|$|Events {{taking place}} in Hispania (Islamic rule, the adoptionist heresy, the gradual {{assimilation}} of the Mozarabs) were, for Beatus, signals of the imminent apocalyptic aeon. As Elipandus describes in his Letter from the bishops of Spania to their brothers in Gaul, the abbot of Santo Toribio {{went so far as}} to announce to his countrymen the coming of the End of Time in the Easter of the year 800. On the dawn of that day, hundreds of peasants met around the abbey of Santo Toribio, waiting terrified for the fulfilling of the prophecy. They remained in that place, without having had a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> during a day and half, until one of them, named Ordonius, exclaimed: [...] "Let us eat and drink, so that if the End of the World comes we are full!".|$|E

50|$|Early {{tetrapods}} had a wide gaping jaw {{with weak}} muscles {{to open and}} close it. In the jaw were moderate-sized palatal and vomerine (upper) and coronoid (lower) fangs, as well rows of smaller teeth. This was {{in contrast to the}} larger fangs and small marginal teeth of earlier tetrapodomorph fishes such as Eusthenopteron. Although this indicates a change in feeding habits, the exact nature of the change in unknown. Some scholars have suggested a change to bottom-feeding or feeding in shallower waters (Ahlberg and Milner 1994). Others have suggesting a mode of feeding comparable to that of the Japanese giant salamander, which uses both suction feeding and direct <b>biting</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> small crustaceans and fish. A study of these jaws shows that they were used for feeding underwater, not on land.|$|R

2500|$|Hemotoxic venom {{takes more}} time than {{neurotoxic}} venom to immobilize prey, so viperid snakes need to [...] track down prey animals {{after they have been}} bitten, in a process known as [...] "prey relocalization". Vipers are able to do this via certain proteins contained in their venom. This important adaptation allowed rattlesnakes to evolve the strike-and-release bite mechanism, which provided a huge benefit to snakes by minimizing contact with potentially dangerous prey animals. However, this adaptation then requires the snake to track down the <b>bitten</b> animal <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> it, in an environment full of other animals of the same species. Western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) respond more actively to mouse carcases that have been injected with crude rattlesnake venom. When the various components of the venom were separated out, the snakes responded to mice injected with two kinds of disintegrins. These disintegrin proteins are responsible for allowing the snakes to track down their prey.|$|R

50|$|The {{central focus}} of the series is upon a group of malevolent {{carnivorous}} aliens from outer space, called Krites, that {{have the ability to}} roll into balls (cf. hedgehogs) and combine into a pernicious sphere that can roll across the landscape and cause mayhem. In appearance, the individual Krites resemble small furry/spiky animals with large mouths and many sharp teeth. Throughout the movies they attack humans by <b>biting</b> and attempting <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them, or at least a piece of them. The spikes on their backs can be launched as projectiles (rendering the victim unconscious). The coloration of the Krites varies between black, brown and navy blue. In the original film they were also able to grow to a much larger size, although this ability was dropped for the sequels.|$|R
40|$|The {{video games}} {{industry}} has been successfully using {{the image of the}} zombie for dec-ades. Since the first game released in 1984, the zombie-slaying theme has appeared in more than 100 video games and still remains popular. In-game realities, characters and zombies have been portrayed with ever more precision and detail over the years. Video games are not the first medium in which zombies have appeared, thus an in-game zom-bie image often refers to other cultural works. Video games generally portray zombies as brainless, slow creatures whose sole purpose is <b>to</b> <b>bite</b> or <b>eat</b> the player. However, there are productions attempting to “warm up” the image of zombies. The animated presentation of amusing zombies fighting with plants gained great popularity among users of mobile devices, computers and video game consoles. In the chapter Evolution of the Image of the Zombie in Video Games, Bartosz Mazurkiewicz looks more closely at the evolution of zombie-themed games in order to distinguish the characteristics of the entire genre and examine which of those games inspired other productions.

50|$|Canada lynxes hunt around {{twilight}} or at night, {{the time}} when snowshoe hares tend to be active. Lynxes rely on their vision and sense of hearing to locate prey. The lynx will roam or wait on certain trails where snowshoe hares gather, pounce on a hare and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Young ungulates are given a throat <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> suffocate them to death. They can eat their kill immediately or cache them in snow or leaves <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them {{over the next few}} days. Lynxes will occasionally hunt together, and achieve success rates as 55% - notably greater than that achieved when they hunt singly (14%). Scavenging is common in Canada lynxes; they will take ungulates killed in the cold or by roadkill.|$|R

50|$|The {{mandrill}} is an omnivore. It usually consumes plants, {{of which}} it eats over a hundred species. It prefers <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> fruits, but will also eat leaves, lianas, bark, stems, and fibers. It also consumes mushrooms and soil. Carnivorously, mandrills mostly eat invertebrates, particularly ants, beetles, termites, crickets, spiders, snails, and scorpions. It will also eat eggs, and even vertebrates such as birds, tortoises, frogs, porcupines, rats, and shrews. Mandrills likely will eat larger vertebrates when they have the opportunity, such as juvenile bay duikers and other small antelope. Large prey are likely killed with a <b>bite</b> <b>to</b> the nape with the mandrill's long canines. One study found the mandrill's diet was composed of fruit (50.7%), seeds (26.0%), leaves (8.2%), pith (6.8%), flowers (2.7%), and animal foods (4.1%), with other foods making up the remaining (1.4%).|$|R
