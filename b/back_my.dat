25|$|Crevedia {{took his}} final revenge on Rădulescu by having her satirized in the 1936 novel Buruieni de dragoste ("Love Weeds"). Some {{two years after}} the scandal, Crevedia married Maria Mutu, in a {{religious}} ceremony with Crainic as godfather. Maria was a niece of the Gândirea novelist Gib Mihăescu, in whose house she lived before marriage; she worked as a professor of French and Romanian. The couple had two daughters, Ioana and Diana. A flight enthusiast, Crevedia continued to travel throughout Europe, and announced by 1937 that he was planning to publish a travelogue of his trips through the Balkans, a theatrical version of Bacalaureatul lui Puiu, and an anthology of Bulgarian poetry, alongside a new novel, Mămăligă—referencing the folk dish. His play was reportedly finished, and Crevedia failed at convincing Camil Petrescu to include it in the National Theater program. Two other volumes of his poetry appeared around that time: Maria (1938), named after his wife, and Dă-mi înapoi grădinile ("Give Me <b>Back</b> <b>My</b> Gardens", 1939).|$|E

Although the album debuted in the top ten of the US, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, it was notably less successful compared to Ciara's previous albums, only selling 193,000 copies in the US in a year. One single from the album, [...] "Love Sex Magic", however, was a worldwide top ten hit. The album also spawned the top ten US R hit [...] "Never Ever".

500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not cause you to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know better, if he loves you, let him come <b>back.</b> <b>My</b> fellas, if you love her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E
500|$|... "Louboutins" [...] {{received}} mixed reception from critics. Elana Gorgan of Softpedia {{focused on}} the single cover and concept of the song. She said [...] "While {{the idea of the}} track is original, critics and fans alike say, the artwork is lackluster at best... There is a certain old vibe to the cover, what with the font of the writing and the shot in itself, but it's not helping the singer in any way garner much interest in the release." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said [...] " [...] does for the ultra high-end shoe brand what Crocs do for sexy." [...] She pointed out how the song was not as good as Lopez's previous material and at one point even called the song [...] "Poo". Further to this, Peter Gicas of E! Online was also critical of the song, suggesting that the song leaked online before its official debut to warn fans of what Lopez was about to inflict on them. [...] "The track begins with the singer insisting, [...] "I'm taking <b>back</b> <b>my</b> love." [...] Personally, we wish we could take back the last three minutes and 49 seconds." [...] Tom Stacks of Entertainment Weekly was less than impressed saying [...] "J. Lo needs to move on from her recording career. She had some fun, catchy songs ('If You Had My Love,' 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'), but trying to regain musical relevance by singing about pricey high-heels just seems a little sad. I say focus on getting the movie career back on track..." ...|$|E
