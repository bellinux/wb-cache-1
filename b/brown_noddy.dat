5|$|Though no {{terrestrial}} {{birds are}} {{found on the}} atoll, Ducie Island is known for the seabirds that breed there. Birds that have been recorded nesting on the atoll include the red-billed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, fairy tern, great frigatebird, bristle-thighed curlew, masked booby and red-footed booby. A number of gull species, including the sooty tern, blue noddy, <b>brown</b> <b>noddy,</b> lesser noddy and white tern, have been recorded, as have {{several members of the}} Procellariidae family: Kermadec petrel, Trindade petrel, Murphy's petrel and Christmas shearwater.|$|E
5|$|External parasites include chewing lice of {{the genus}} Saemundssonia, feather lice and fleas such as Ceratophyllus borealis. Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite {{different}} species. Internal parasites include the crustacean Reighardia sternae, and tapeworms such as Ligula intestinalis {{and members of the}} genera Diphyllobothrium and Schistocephalus. Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry Haemoproteus species. An exception is the <b>brown</b> <b>noddy,</b> which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West Nile virus.|$|E

25|$|Twenty-three {{species of}} birds were found in a 1969 survey, of which 19 were {{observed}} during a follow-up count in 1988. Species breeding in larger numbers that year included the great frigatebird and red-footed booby. Their numbers appear reduced due {{to the destruction of}} the Pisonia forests. Other breeding species include the red-tailed tropicbird, white-tailed tropicbird, the masked booby, brown booby, white tern, <b>brown</b> <b>noddy,</b> and sooty tern.|$|E
25|$|The atoll {{supports}} {{a large population}} of sea and shorebirds, with up to 26 species present. Species breeding during 1988 included the brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, sooty tern, white tern, <b>brown</b> <b>noddy,</b> and possibly the reef heron. Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, turnstone, wandering tattler, golden plover, and the sanderling. The densest bird populations are on three islets {{to the north of}} Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer's petrel.|$|E

40|$|Wing {{morphology}} of nine {{species of}} seabirds from Johnston Atoll {{in the central}} tropical Pacific was analyzed to determine how wing size and shape correlated with observed foraging behavior and, in some species, the energetic cost of flight. Red-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) and Christmas Shearwaters (Puffinus nativitatis) had lower wing areas, shorter wing spans, and higher relative wing loading than would be predicted from mass alone. <b>Brown</b> <b>Noddies</b> (Anous stolidus) and Red-footed Boobies (Sula sula) had lower wing loading, Brown Boobies (Sula leucogaster) and Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata) had higher aspect ratios, and <b>Brown</b> <b>Noddies</b> had lower aspect ratio than would be predicted from mass alone. Aspect ratio showed greater intraspecific variation than the other variables. In most cases, predicted differences in wing morphology correlated well with observed foraging differences among species, and species that {{did not differ significantly}} in body mass differed with respect to wing size and shape; these morphological differences reflected varying flight and foraging behaviors. Sooty Terns had a higher aspect ratio and higher wing loading than <b>Brown</b> <b>Noddies</b> reflecting their more pelagic lifestyle, and Christmas Shearwaters had a lower aspect ratio and higher wing loading than Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) reflecting their pursuit plunging behavior...|$|R
50|$|Great {{frigatebirds}} {{will also}} hunt seabird chicks at their breeding colonies, taking mostly the chicks of sooty terns, spectacled terns, <b>brown</b> <b>noddies</b> and black noddies. Studies show that only females (adults and juveniles) hunt in this fashion, {{and only a}} few individuals account for most of the kills.|$|R

50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>noddy</b> or common noddy (Anous stolidus) is a seabird in {{the family}} Laridae. The largest of the noddies, it can be told from the closely related black noddy by its larger size and plumage, which is dark brown rather than black. The <b>brown</b> <b>noddy</b> is a {{tropical}} seabird with a worldwide distribution, ranging from Hawaii to the Tuamotu Archipelago and Australia in the Pacific Ocean, from the Red Sea to the Seychelles and Australia in the Indian Ocean and in the Caribbean to Tristan da Cunha in the Atlantic Ocean. The <b>brown</b> <b>noddy</b> is colonial, usually nesting on elevated situations on cliffs or in short trees or shrubs. It only occasionally nests on the ground. A single egg is laid by the female of a pair each breeding season.|$|E

50|$|The islands, with an {{associated}} tract of coastal marine habitat, form a 750 ha Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports populations of black-naped (10 breeding pairs) and sooty terns (5000-10,000 pairs), and <b>brown</b> <b>noddies</b> (2000-5900 pairs). green and hawksbill sea turtles nest there.African Banks {{are surrounded by}} coral rim (the eastern side) and waters rich in fish, especially mackerel , tuna and sharks.|$|R
