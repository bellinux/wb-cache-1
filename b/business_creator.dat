Using a hermeneutic approach, we have chosen to interview four musicians and other key people in the music business. We do not present a clear and simple answer, though this subject is too complex to explain in just one sentence. Instead we have constructed three models that show one way of understanding authenticity. The first model is an approach to maintain authenticity in different processes. The second model shows how different actors can work closely in a team toward the same goal, named KBM-platform, which stands for <b>Creator,</b> <b>Business</b> and Management. The model shows how these three can work together. The third model analyses attitude and its influence on the music and the music business.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a model for the {{analysis}} of <b>business</b> schools as <b>creators,</b> disseminators, and adopters of knowledge on environmental management.   Design/methodology/approach – A review of the importance of higher education institutions for sustainability, and more specifically, about their relevance for the creation, diffusion, and adoption of knowledge on environmental management is performed. Guided by this reflection, a model for analyzing the contributions of business schools for expertise in environmental management is proposed. This model considers that activities such as teaching, research, extension community, and university management are elementary for these schools. For each addressed topic, empirical evidence on how some business schools and universities are addressing the environmental dimension in its activities is presented.   Findings – The paper’s discussions lead the reader to a draft of the evolutionary stages of business schools’ contribution for environmental management knowledge, which can be useful for many stakeholders linked to a business school. Finally, the opportunity for a continuation of this research line and the limitations inherent in this proposal are highlighted. Originality/value – The literature on the subject can be considered meager and when existing tends to report experiences and challenges faced by business schools on the inclusion of environmental issues in their teaching activities, research, extension community, and university management, considering these activities almost always as watertight...|$|R
40|$|Foreword Global {{business}} creation {{is a tough}} game. To welfare societies {{it is no longer}} just a game, however, but {{a matter of life and}} death. The ability of nations to sustain public services – for example, to pay salaries to researchers and educators – depends upon the jobs and tax income created by their globally growing enterprises. And yet there is no university domain dedicated to producing masters and mastery of this important art. The 11 th EBRF Conference – Global Business Creation Games: Co-Creation of Enterprise for Problems Worth Solving – urged us all to make better use of our slack resources, both tangible and intangible. This is equally acutely needed in every sector of society and from every person, both natural and legal. Like in the times of the Great Explorers, bold exploration across murky waters is again called for. Like always, some roads will be dead-ends, but we cannot find the right ones without leaving our sofa. At EBRF 2011, we discussed with concern “time to market” for new products and businesses, but were equally concerned about time to market for the research we conduct – or whether our research has an impact on the marketplace, to begin with. This is how EBRF has challenged us, from the get-go, in 2001. With elements of an unconference, EBRF 2011 sought for ecosystem level impact by engaging entrepreneurs, executives, and policy makers in the scholarly process through what were called ecosystem level Live Case exercises. Such exercises were undertaken under six grand topics: Capital, Education, Energy, Health, ICT, and Wellbeing. All the approved abstracts and conference presentations were divided between them. The purpose was to jointly discover exciting new ways forward. At least some baby steps were taken. Entrepreneurs can freely choose which type companies they build. They can, for example, concentrate on building businesses aimed at solving big social and ecological problems. Researchers can choose the problems and solutions they investigate, and the purposes they serve. Policy makers and innovation financiers can first define quite exactly what they want and demand plans that fit the bill. Alternatively, they can build agile policies that are fitted to back the most innovative, motivated and committed teams. For a game-change, co-creation across all borders is needed. At EBRF 2011, each of the ecosystem level Live Case exercises produced their own global {{business creation}} canvas. One objective was to inspire the presenters of approved abstracts when finalizing their full papers, after the conference. By an ultimate deadline, altogether 20 conference presentations transformed into full research papers, all featured on the following pages. A range of 2 - 4 full papers emerged under each grand topic. While there are only 2 papers under ICT, there are 3 papers under Capital an Energy and 4 papers under Education, Health, and Wellbeing. To be sure, as these are not business as usual research topics or streams, there may be a paper or two, for example, under Education, with little or nothing to do with education, per se. For important acknowledgement of our work and approach, Technology Innovation Management Review (www. timreview. ca) decided to dedicate a special issue to EBRF 2011 conference papers. Dedicated to “Global Business Creation”, the TIM Review June issue features seven particularly insightful EBRF papers. All but one of the grand topics, namely ICT, is represented in the special issue. Also the authors whose paper did not make the special issue pulled themselves and the fellow members of their ecosystem level Live Case exercises out of their comfort zones, thereby successfully providing value-adding inspiration, provocation and stimulation across many borders. On behalf of all the organizers, I wish to thank each contributing author and participant. In her message to the EBRF 2011 organizers, having to decline a keynote invitation, Kelly Fitzsimmons, an extraordinary lady game changer and serial entrepreneur, pointed how successful <b>business</b> <b>creators</b> come in every size, shape, gender, and colour of skin, and from every kind of family and educational background as well as type of personality. What they share in common, according to her discoveries and observations, is their willingness and ability to tolerate discomfort for unreasonably long periods of time. At EBRF 2011, we were pushed outside our comfort zone only for a few days. Even there, it was educating enough for the organizers to take a time-out on EBRF’s future. Since 2001, the conference has continuously pushed – and stretched – the envelope in the frontier between art and science, theory and practice, having perhaps reached the limit. Consequently, the conference mission and concept are currently being reconsidered, and the conference board reorganized. For closing, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all the participants, co-organizers and sponsors of EBRF 2011 for an invaluable contribution. As co-founder and co-organizer or chairman of the conference since 2001, I wish to warmly thank all the individuals and institutions whose co-creative efforts and support have made 11 consecutive annual international peer reviewed business research conferences possible in Finland. For me, personally, this has been a most educational, rewarding, and worthwhile journey.

40|$|User-generated video content {{sites such}} as Youtube have become {{extremely}} popular. Understanding video online popularity is of great value for network and service providers, marketing industries, entertainment <b>businesses</b> and content <b>creators.</b> In this thesis, we develop novel frameworks to evaluate the impacts of different content-agnostic factors on Youtube videos popularity and use the resulting insights to study and model their popularity growth patterns. The first significant subject of our thesis is developing and applying a novel methodology that is able to accurately assess, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the impacts of various content-agnostic factors on video popularity. When controlling for video content, we observe a strong linear ``rich-get-richer'' behavior, with {{the total number of}} previous views as the most important factor except for very young videos. We analyze a number of phenomena that may contribute to rich-get-richer, including the first-mover advantage, and search bias towards popular videos. Our findings also confirm that inaccurate conclusions can be reached when not controlling for video content. The second central topic of our research is performing a characterization and modeling of the videos popularity dynamics using only the total view count for analysis. We develop a framework for studying the popularity dynamics of user-generated videos, present a characterization of the popularity dynamics, and propose a model that captures the key properties of these dynamics. Using a dataset that tracks the views to a sample of recently-uploaded Youtube videos over the first eight months of their lifetime, we study the popularity dynamics. We find that the relative popularities of the videos within our dataset are highly non-stationary, owing primarily to large differences in the required time since upload until peak popularity is finally achieved, and secondly to popularity oscillation. We propose a model that can accurately capture the popularity dynamics of collections of recently-uploaded videos as they age. Another important aspect of our research is illustrating the biases that may be introduced in the analysis for some choices of the sampling technique used for collecting data...|$|R
40|$|Grounded in the {{business}} model literature, this paper examines business models in the Creative Industries (CI), and the of role intellectual property (IP) following the UK’s 2011 Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property. It does so via a meta-analysis of 20 research projects, including 80 case studies, on business models in the CI, {{with a focus on}} television, film, computer games and publishing. This paper probes the research to identify CI business models, and the interaction of IP and business models. The paper makes three contributions to the literature: one, it brings together the literature on business models in the CI with IP policy against a backdrop of technological change, two, it applies the Baden-Fuller (2016) business model taxonomy to the CI, and three, it performs the first meta-analysis of business models. The analysis suggests business models in digital era have remained remarkably stable, and the CI have actively lobbied to support existing models. Methodology: Business Models and a Meta-Analysis The paper presents two methodological advances in the study of business models and the CI. First, it is the first CI study to adopt the Baden-Fuller (2016), four elemental business model taxonomy: product, solution, multi-sided triadic and matchmaker models. This framework focuses on the relationship between firms and customers, and is technology and process agnostic. This is supplemented by the Osterwalder & Pigneur (2010) Business Model Canvas, to provide a more granular understanding of changes in pricing mechanisms and value propositions. Studies of business models are dominated by qualitative, small sample studies, which suggests a systematic approach will lead to wider insights. The second contribution of this paper is applying {{the business}} model framework to qualitative meta-analysis. The scope of this analysis is limited to the studies in the Centre for Copyright and New Business Models in the Creative Economy (CREATe) at Glasgow University. This choice addresses challenges typically associated with qualitative meta-analyses by reducing variation in: chronology, definitions, populations, and the purpose of studies. The choice of studies, in which the author has been involved, also counters the common critique that researchers are unfamiliar with the studies (Stern and Harris, 1985). Following the reading of all abstracts, the population of 58 CREATe projects plus commissioned works was narrowed to 20 studies, resulting in 80 case studies. The paper also probes the Hargreaves era IP policy debates for the role of business models, industry and policy approaches to business models, and subsequent developments in copyright policy. Findings The paper demonstrates that evidence that, in the years since policy discussions on business models intensified in the UK, the CI in the sample have chosen to lobby to secure a competitive advantage, but business models have remained stable. The vast majority of business models are categorised as product models, as they have been historically. Commissioned work, common in television production companies and independent games development studios, is the second most popular category of solution based business models. Commissioning is a ‘heritage’ business model in television, and has been adopted by the nascent computer games industry. Likewise, just as newspapers have traditionally operated with a multi-sided market, where users are readers and customers are advertisers, so do platforms (e. g. YouTube) and free-to-play games. This again suggests stability in business models. Finally, matchmaking models are found only in the retail side of the industry. There is, however, an important caveat to this finding in that end-user subscription services such as Spotify, represent the introduction of a solutions model to the consumer and account for an increasing proportion of revenues. However, the overall conclusion remains business models in the CI are relatively stable. However, changes are observed in pricing mechanisms and value propositions. In pricing, firms experiment with pay-as-you-go, freemium (free basic product, paid-for “premium” product), and others. Similarly, pricing mechanisms, combined with value propositions, have shifted towards more subscription models (e. g. streaming), as opposed to product sales. The business model framework adopted in this paper does not identify these changes as new business models; however a more colloquial definition of business models might. Outside the CREATe sample, subscription services like Spotify have combined new value propositions and delivery channels to launch new service models. Yet these changes are found in a minority of cases. Change and IP The evidence for IP infringement as an impetus for business model change is scant. Both DoyleCR (2016) and Searle (2011, 2016 CR) argue IP and copying concerns do not lead to changes in <b>business</b> models. <b>Creators</b> rely on alternative, non business-model strategies to protect against any negative impact of copyright infringement. The paper establishes lobbying as a preferred business strategy in the choice between business model and copyright changes. Overall, the picture is one of surprising business model stability, against a background of a concerted effort towards maintaining the status quo in copyright policy. While the digital era has transformed transaction costs, and production and distribution technologies, the CI largely rely on the same business model on which they have always relied: selling products and standardised services to customers...|$|R
