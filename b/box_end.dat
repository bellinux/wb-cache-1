Since the emergency braking was extremely powerful, passengers were seated facing to the rear, and Japanese law already precluded standing in automated vehicles. In some versions, two of the four seats could be folded to allow larger loads, like prams or bicycles. CVS also tested light cargo vehicles, carrying between 300 and 400 kg. Three types of cargo bodies were tried; a flatbed version for palleted cargo that was loaded using two conveyor belts on a trackside [...] "station", another was similar to a pickup truck with a <b>box</b> <b>end,</b> and the last was an enclosed postal van.|$|E
5000|$|Until the 19th century Kempston was a mainly rural parish. It {{was one of}} {{the largest}} in Bedfordshire with an area of 5,025 acres (20 km²) at the time of {{enclosure}} in 1804, and was in Redbournestoke Hundred. Historically there was no central village, but instead settlement was divided between a number of hamlets called [...] "Ends", for example, Up End, Bell End, Wood End and <b>Box</b> <b>End.</b> Kempston's parish church, All Saints, was in Church End, which was not the largest end but is fairly central. In the 19th century East End, Bell End and Up End began to coalesce into a larger settlement. In 1870 developers began to attempt to develop land on the road from Kempston to Bedford under the name [...] "Kempston New Town". Construction was slow at first, but the new district soon began to expand steadily and Kempston acquired a more urban feel. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Kempston Barracks in 1876.|$|E

5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's Pass-Thru brands.

40|$|Samples 1 and 2 from Oakley and Bromham {{respectively}} {{are thought}} to be from the Kellaways Clay Member. The occurrence of Callialasporites spp., Ctenidodinium sp., ?Gonyaulacysta jurassica and Leptolepidites spp. indicates that these samples are of Bathonian-Callovian (Mid Jurassic) age. A detailed lithostratigraphical determination cannot be made, however they are probably from the Cornbrash or Kellaways formations. Correlation to the Blisworth Clay Formation is deemed unlikely. Sample 3 from <b>Box</b> <b>End</b> is believed to be from the Whitby Mudstone Formation. The presence of Callialasporites spp. and Leptolepidites spp. indicates that this sample is of Mid-Late Jurassic age, thus an attribution to the Whitby Mudstone Formation is untenable. The sample is a dark grey mudstone, hence it is most likely that it is from the Northampton Sand, Grantham, Rutland or Blisworth Clay formations. 2 Sample 4 is also from <b>Box</b> <b>End</b> and is assumed to be from the Rutland Formation. The assemblage is dominated by Meiourogonyaulax reticulata. This, and other, dinoflagellate cysts recovered are indicative of a Bathonian age. The acme occurrence of Meiourogonyaulax reticulata is characteristic of the lowermost Blisworth Clay Formation of the English Midlands. Sample 5 from Oakley is also presumed to be from the Rutland Formation. The dinoflagellate cysts are dominated by Ctenidodinium sellwoodii, and this is characteristic of the Bathonian. The occurrence of Gonyaulacysta jurassica subsp. adecta and Meiourogonyaulax reticulata means that this horizon is also interpreted as being from the Blisworth Clay Formation. Sample 6 from Bromham is supposed to be from the lowermost Oxford Clay Formation. It produced a sparse palynoflora including Mendicodinium groenlandicum and Nannoceratopsis pellucida, which are characteristic of the Callovian. The low diversity of this sample means that it is from the Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation. Sample 7 is thought to be from the Oxford Clay Formation of Ravensden. Many key dinoflagellate cyst taxa were recorded which indicate an early Oxfordian age. This means that this sample is from the Weymouth Member of the Oxford Clay Formation. This conclusion is surprising because the Oxford Clay Formation in this area is largely Peterborough Formation. This sample is not thought to be of a till and more sampling is needed to determine the lateral extent of the Weymouth Member at Ravensden. Sample 8 from Bozeat is supposed to be from the Whitby Mudstone Formation. The spores and pollen indicate that the sample is late Pliensbachian to Toarcian in age. The dinoflagellate cysts are consistent with this assessment and refine this to early Toarcian, probably the D. tenuicostatum or the H. falciferum ammonite subzones. Sample 8 is therefore from the Whitby Mudstone Formation, specifically from the Grey Shale or Jet Rock members or equivalents...|$|E
40|$|The English-speaking Caribbean {{consists}} of some fifteen countries, {{with a population}} of just over 6 million. The countries including Suriname are united under CARICOM, (the Caribbean Economic Community) and share a common education system. The area is characterised by low infant mortality rates (averaging less than 20 / 1000 live births) and high literacy rates (above 85 % for many years) *. espite these impressive indicators, the incidence of AIDS has steadily increased in many countries with figures now 50 % higher in 1994 than they were in A ~ 1991. The Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) member countries in 1994 with an incidence rate of AIDS cases more than 10 per 100, 000 population are as follows: These countries are the worst affected and due to the large proportion of potential transmitters deserve priority attention. Efforts to reduce the rate of increase in HIV/AIDS cases in the Caribbean appear to be failing. AIDS will soon become the largest single killer of young people in the Caribbean (see <b>Box,</b> <b>end</b> of article). CAREC estimates that 70 % of AIDS cases are falling into the 20 - 40 age group. This means a significant proportion of the working and child bearing population could be affected by the year 2010. Many of those dying from AIDS have or will contract the disease as teenagers. Responding to these issues UNICEF has become part of a major multi-agency strategy to strengthen and change the focus of Health and Family Life Education in schools...|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} torque {{required}} to either further tighten or loosen the connection under tension and pressure was determined from the threaded {{model and the}} same method of summing thread forces x radii. Using 0. 021 friction coef-ficient, the torques were: Nominal tapers at three turns, torque = 5 5 3 8 ft • lb Addition of 500 kips tension = 5628 ft*lb Addition of 11, 220 psi pressure = 10, 480 ft-lb Therefore, tension has negligible effect and pressure has a significant effect. The lack of effect by tension is due to loss of preload force on the stab flanks being equal to the increase of force on the load flanks, thereby producing no change on total torque. This behavior was also recognized by Clinedinst. Effect of Yielding on Torque Part II of this paper discusses elastic and plastic solutions with the threaded finite element model that used to determine maximum strain for 5. 4 turns, 9350 psi and 660 kips tension. The assembly interference was for a fast pin and slow box, with interferences of 0. 0079 in. at the pin end and 0. 0231 in. at the <b>box</b> <b>end.</b> Stresses were compared in Fig. 12 of Part II and showed significant reductions due to yielding of the P-l 10 material with the stress/strain relationship shown in Fig. 11 of Part II. The same solutions were {{used to compare the}} effects of load and yielding on torque with results given in Table 7. Torque reduction due to yielding when assembled was 11 percent and the reduction at full load was 16 percent. The reductions are not particularly high but do show a source of variation in the torque/turn relationship that can occur for makeup. The elastic assembly solution {{can also be used to}} check above equation (3) for torque. The radius at the middle of the 3. 25 in, length of threads was 3. 418 in. The inside radius was 3. 116 in. and the outside radius was 3. 833 in., which gives the following calculated values...|$|E
