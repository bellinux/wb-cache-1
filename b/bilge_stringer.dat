5000|$|Due to {{the problem}} with ingot loading, a [...] trial (with PTs fully fitted out) was {{conducted}} on August 12, 1941. Four boats returned: PT-8, PT-69, PT-70, and MRB, and Elco sent two new boats, PT-21 and PT-29. During this trial, boats faced heavier seas, as high as 16 ft. All except the Huckins (PT-69) completed the run. The Huckins withdrew due to <b>bilge</b> <b>stringer</b> failure. The Higgins 76-footer (PT-70) completed the entire run but also suffered structural failures, attachments between planking and web frames pulling loose, and deck fastenings {{in the neighborhood of}} engine hatches showing extensive failures. PT-21 suffered minor cracks in the deck in the same location (but not to the same extent) as previously observed in PT-26, PT-30, and PT-33. PT-29 was assigned as a pace boat with PT-8 in order to generate a pounding comparison.|$|E
