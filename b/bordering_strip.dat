40|$|AbstractA {{generalization}} {{of the usual}} column-strict tableaux (equivalent to a construction of R. C.

These objects are called rational tableaux since they play the same role for rational representations of GLn as ordinary tableaux do for polynomial representations. A {{generalization of}} Schensted's insertion algorithm is given for rational tableaux, and is used to count the. multiplicities of the irreducible GLn-modules in the tensor algebra of GLn. The problem of counting multiplicities when the kth tensor power gln⊗k is decomposed into modules which are simultaneously irreducible with respect to GLn and the symmetric group Sk is also considered. The existence of an insertion algorithm which describes this decomposition is proved. A generalization of <b>border</b> <b>strip</b> tableaux, in which both addition and deletion of <b>border</b> <b>strips</b> is allowed, is used to describe the characters associated with this decomposition.

40|$|Motivated by {{results and}} conjectures of Stanley {{concerning}} minimal <b>border</b> <b>strip</b> tableaux of partitions, we present three results. First we generalize {{the rank of}} a partition [lambda] {{to the rank of}} a shifted partition S([lambda]). We show that the number of bars required in a minimal bar tableau of S([lambda]) is max(o, e + (â([lambda]) mod 2)), where o and e are the number of odd and even rows of [lambda]. As a consequence we show that the irreducible negative characters of [tilde]S[sub]n vanish on certain conjugacy classes. Another corollary is a lower bound on the degree of the terms in the expansion of Schur's Q[sub][lambda] symmetric functions in terms of the power sum symmetric functions. The second result gives a basis for the space spanned by the lowest degree terms in the expansion of the Schur symmetric functions in terms of the power sum symmetric functions. These lowest degree terms studied by Stanley correspond to minimal <b>border</b> <b>strip</b> tableaux of [lambda]. The Hilbert series of these spaces is the generating function giving the number of partitions of n into parts differing by at least 2. Applying the Rogers-Ramanujan identity, the generating function also counts the number of partitions of n into parts 5 k + 1 and 5 k - 1. Finally for each [lambda] we give a relation between the power sum symmetric functions and the monomial symmetric functions; the terms are indexed by the types of minimal <b>border</b> <b>strip</b> tableaux of [lambda]. by Peter Clifford.
