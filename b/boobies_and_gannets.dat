Some amount of niche partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants or Platanista river dolphins, and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to <b>boobies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gannets.</b> The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E

50|$|The bird family Sulidae {{comprises}} the <b>gannets</b> <b>and</b> <b>boobies.</b> Collectively called sulids, they are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish and similar prey. The ten species {{in this family}} are often considered congeneric in older sources, placing all in the genus Sula. However, Sula (true <b>boobies)</b> <b>and</b> Morus (<b>gannets)</b> can be readily distinguished by morphological and behavioral and DNA sequence characters. Abbott's booby (Papasula) is given its own genus as it stands apart from both in these respects. It {{appears to be a}} distinct and ancient lineage, maybe closer to the gannets than to the true boobies.|$|R
50|$|The red-footed booby is the {{smallest}} member of the <b>booby</b> <b>and</b> <b>gannet</b> family at about 70 cm in length and with a wingspan of up to 1 m. The average weight of 490 adults from Christmas Island was 837 g. It has red legs, and its bill and throat pouch are coloured pink and blue. This species has several morphs. In the white morph the plumage is mostly white (the head often tinged yellowish) and the flight feathers are black. The black-tailed white morph is similar, but with a black tail, and can easily {{be confused with the}} Nazca <b>and</b> masked <b>boobies.</b> The brown morph is overall brown. The white-tailed brown morph is similar, but has a white belly, rump, and tail. The white-headed and white-tailed brown morph has a mostly white body, tail and head, and brown wings and back. The morphs commonly breed together, but in most regions one or two morphs predominates; e.g. at the Galápagos Islands, most belong to the brown morph, though the white morph also occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Tropicbirds were {{traditionally}} grouped in {{the order}} Pelecaniformes, which contained the pelicans, cormorants <b>and</b> shags, darters, <b>gannets</b> <b>and</b> <b>boobies</b> <b>and</b> frigatebirds; in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the Pelecaniformes were united with other groups into a large [...] "Ciconiiformes". More recently this grouping {{has been found to}} be massively paraphyletic (missing closer relatives of its distantly related groups) and split again.|$|R
50|$|The {{positions}} of brood patches can vary with many having a single brood patch {{in the middle}} of the belly while some shorebirds have one patch on each side of the belly. Gulls and Galliformes may have three brood patches. Pelicans, penguins, <b>boobies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gannets</b> do not develop brood patches, but instead cradle the eggs on their feet when incubating. Brood parasitic cuckoos do not develop brood patches. In species where both parents incubate, brood patches may develop in both sexes.|$|E
5000|$|Nelson {{conducted}} pioneering fieldwork on {{the habits}} and communication methods of gannets and boobies; among his key hypotheses was {{the suggestion that}} gannets use a gesture known as [...] "skypointing" [...] to warn mates that {{they are about to}} leave the nest. As Scottish Field Magazine noted: [...] "He interpreted and described the fascinating non-verbal communication of gannets. As a zoology lecturer, he amused and inspired thousands of Aberdeen University students over many years with his 'skypointing' and 'beak fencing'." [...] He was the author of an authoritative 1,000-page monograph on <b>boobies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gannets,</b> including a volume on Pelecaniformes and a more general volume on seabird biology and ecology.|$|E
5000|$|One {{species of}} Odontopteryx has been {{formally}} described, but several other named taxa of pseudotooth birds might belong here too. The type species Odontopteryx toliapica is {{known from the}} Ypresian (Early Eocene) London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey (England) and slightly older rocks of the Ouled Abdoun Basin (Morocco). Its tarsometatarsus (e.g. specimen BMNH A4962) was for {{some time in the}} late 20th century believed to be from a giant procellariiform and called Neptuniavis minor, but specimen BMNH A44096 [...] - [...] the holotype skull described by Richard Owen in 1873 [...] - [...] was the first pelagornithid recognized as such, and not assigned to some other seabird lineage. It was still often allied with Sulidae (<b>boobies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gannets)</b> or Diomedeidae (albatrosses), to which it is quite certainly not closely related.|$|E

40|$|A {{skull of}} a new pelecaniform bird is {{described}} from the Middle Eocene of Messel (Germany). Masillastega rectirostris gen. et sp. nov. is tentatively referred to the Sulidae (<b>boobies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gannets).</b> If this assignment is correct, the new taxon would represent the earliest fossil record of the family, preceding Sula ronzoni Milne−Edwards, 1867 from the lowermost Oligocene of France by about 15 million years. Masillastega rectirostris most distinctly differs from extant Sulidae in the proportionally longer beak which indicates that the Eocene taxon was not adapted to plunge−diving. Contrary to extant Sulidae, which are exclusively marine birds, Masillastega rectirostris {{was found in a}} freshwater deposit.

40|$|<b>Boobies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gannets</b> (family Sulidae) are {{the most}} {{specialized}} plunge divers among seabirds. Their fossil record along the Pacific coast of South America extends to the early Middle Miocene. Here we describe three new species of sulids: Sula brandi sp. nov., Sula figueroae sp. nov., and Ramphastosula aguirrei sp. nov., from the early Late Miocene of the Pisco Formation (Peru). Two of them are relatives of the living genus Sula, which represents medium and large-sized boobies. A new species of the extinct genus Ramphastosula is also described, adding to the discussion of possible alternative feeding strategies among sulids. The fossil record suggests that sympatric sulids exhibit different body sizes {{at least since the}} Oligocene epoch, a strategy related with resource partitioning. Furthermore, we find current analysis and knowledge of the fossil record unsuitable to evaluate properly seabird diversity changes through time...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} avian Order Pelecaniformes {{is composed}} of birds with all four toes connected by a web. This "totipalmate" condition is found in ca. 66 living species: 8 pelicans (Pelecanus), 9 <b>boobies</b> <b>and</b> <b>gannets</b> (Sula, Papasula, Morus), ca. 37 cormorants (Phalacrocorax), 4 anhingas or darters (Anhinga), 5 frigatebirds (Fregata), and 3 tropicbirds (Phaethon). Several additional characters are shared by these genera, and their monophyly has been assumed {{since the beginning of}} modern zoological nomenclature. Most ornithologists classify these genera as an order, although tropicbirds have been viewed as related to terns, and frigatebirds as relatives of the petrels and albatrosses. DNA. DNA hybridization data indicated that the pelicans are most closely related to the Shoebill (Balaeniceps rex), a stork-like bird that lives in the swamps of central Africa; the boobies, gannets, cormorants, and anhingas form a closely related cluster; the tropicbirds are not closely related to the other taxa; and the frigatebirds are closest to the penguins, loons, petrels, shearwaters, and albatrosses (Procellarioidea). Most of these results are corroborated by DNA sequences of the 12 S and 16 S rRNA mitochondrial genes, and they provide another example of incongruence between classifications derived from morphological versus genetic traits...|$|E

50|$|Within {{the family}} itself, three living genera—Sula (boobies, 6 species), Papasula (Abbott's booby), Morus (gannets, 3 species)—are recognized. A 2011 study of {{multiple}} genes found Abbott's booby to be basal {{to all other}} <b>gannets</b> <b>and</b> <b>boobies,</b> <b>and</b> likely to have diverged from them around 22 million years ago, and the ancestors of the <b>gannets</b> <b>and</b> remaining <b>boobies</b> split around 17 million years ago.

2500|$|The {{cormorants}} are a group {{traditionally placed}} within the Pelecaniformes or, in the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy, the expanded Ciconiiformes.

Some earlier authors included the darters in the Phalacrocoracidae as subfamily Anhinginae, but this is nowadays generally considered overlumping.
