50|$|Semen in {{the early}} days of {{artificial}} insemination was delivered everyday to technicians by bull studs as semen was not frozen at this point. It was not until the addition of glycerol to semen extenders that semen could be frozen. In those early days semen was extended by bulls stud into a type of bottle, or test tube, kept at low temperatures, and delivered to technicians usually everyday. The freezing process was discovered by a man named Polge. It was placed in containers called glass ampules, sealed, frozen in dry ice and alcohol and kept in that type of solution until it was needed for insemination. Later the liquid nitrogen refrigerator was invented by Union Carbide with money given to them by John Rockefeller Prentice, who used it exclusively for his <b>bull</b> <b>stud</b> before a number of years later giving it to the entire A.I. industry at no charge or royalty. Liquid nitrogen temperature is 320 degrees below zero, thus almost an absolute temperature that allows very little deterioration of bovine semen. It is also a safe product as it is not flammable. The ampules were fastened to a cane which was placed inside the canister. When the technician needs to inseminate the cow he merely opens the tank, pulls up the desired canister, selects the cane and puts the ampule in a water bath usually of an ice cube and water mixture. The ampule thaws for several minutes and the top is broken off by either the ampule being pre-scribed or cut with a scribe. Then the semen is drawn up into a pipette. A polybulb or syringe is attached to the end of the pipette to facilitate this.|$|E

Over all <b>bull</b> <b>studs,</b> type was a major economic influence in determining price of semen. When bulls with outlier prices ($ 100 or more) were excluded, relative economic values over all buII studs were 4. 31 : 2. 63 : 1 for milk, type, and fat test. For three <b>bull</b> <b>studs</b> with more than 35 bulls with evaluations for milk, type, and fat test, relative economic values (values per phenotypic standard deviation) were 3. 16 : 1. 35 : 1, 4. 81 : 1. 93 : 1, and 4. 06 : 2. 15 : 1. With so much economic emphasis on type and fat test, genetic gain in milk production from the sire of cow path would be substantially less than if selection were for milk production alone. Unusual bulls (outlier prices) were associated with nonlinear economic values. When outliers were excluded, models including functions of sire evaluations accounted for 50 to 75 % of the variation in semen prices...|$|R

The {{possibility that}} exposure to bifenthrin induced an outbreak of teratospermia at a <b>bull</b> <b>stud</b> was investigated. Semen evaluation and clinical examination of reproductive organs were performed weekly on hospitalized sentinel cases and at critical intervals on bulls remaining at stud. During the 13 days following exposure to bifenthrin, semen quality was poor, with significantly decreased progressive motility, high percent of distal midpiece reflexes, and reduced ejaculate volume. However, clinical examination of bulls revealed no gross abnormalities of reproductive organs. Evaluation 26 days following exposure showed overall improvement in semen quality, with progressive motility increased, percent distal midpiece reflexes reduced, and ejaculate volume trending upwards. Clinical examination continued to demonstrate no abnormalities of reproductive organs. Semen quality recovered to levels nearly equivalent to those observed before exposure and was similar when re-evaluated at 64 -days postexposure. These data suggest a potential deleterious effect of bifenthrin on epididymal, but not testicular function. Dietrich Volkmann, BVSc, MMedVet (Gyn...|$|E

"December 2011 "Semen evaluation via traditional light microscopy provides information about sperm motility and basic morphology but has a limited ability to predict reproductive performance in an assisted reproduction setting. In-depth analysis carried out quickly and with repeatable precision on a large number of sperm cells is important to human assisted reproductive therapies (ART) and farm animal biotechnology. As a result, flow cytometric evaluation using biomarkers to detect specific spermatozoon characteristics is growing in popularity in both andrology laboratories and agricultural studs. Here we investigate the application of two biomarkers, the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) and the post-acrosomal ww-domain binding protein (PAWP) to human assisted reproductive therapy and an agricultural <b>bull</b> <b>stud,</b> respectively. Analysis of the results of SCSA, infertility treatment outcomes, and the occurrence of spontaneous abortions (SAB) and multiple births was conducted in 233 couples. A correlation was found between SCSA parameters and SAB, and lower levels of chromatin defects were found in men from couples with triplet pregnancies. In a second trial, semen samples from 162 sires in artificial insemination (AI) service were analyzed using flow cytometry after labeling with an anti-PAWP antibody. Measurements yielded statistically significant correlations between PAWP intensities and several fertility parameters used by the AI industry. Based on these two studies, we conclude that biomarkers such as SCSA and PAWP are useful for the evaluation of spermatozoa and may be predictive of the outcome of assisted reproduction...|$|E

The AI <b>stud</b> <b>bulls</b> were sampled through traditional progeny-testing programs of 13 AI organizations; AI nonstud bulls had AI semen collection reported by an-other organization or by multiple organi-zations. The non-AI bulls had no reported AI semen collection. Actual daughter yield deviations for these three groups of bulls were compared with ex-pected performance (parent average) to provide an indication of whether evalua-tions were free from bias for daughter yield deviations. Mean difference of daughter yield deviation from parent average was close to 0 kg for animal model evaluations of all 22, 930 bulls but was positively biased by 46 kg of milk for AI nonstud bulls.

40|$|Gender {{selected}} or sexed semen {{has been}} commercially {{available to the}} dairy industry for almost a decade. However, sexed semen from beef bulls became commercially available only recently. The availability of sexed semen from beef bulls along with concerns about success of the technology at the ranch level has limited the use of sexed semen in purebred and commercial beef operations. Recent changes in semen availability combined with current studies with sexed beef semen are providing insights to the uses, limitations, opportunities, and challenges of this technology. Increased sorting capacity allowed the number of beef bulls with gender selected semen available to increase exponentially {{over the last five}} years. For the major US AI studs, the number of beef bulls with gender sorted semen available increased from 0 to 70 from 2008 to 2011 (Hall, 2011). Sexing Technologies, the major semen sexing company, lists 28 sires with sexed semen in their catalog. In addition to sex sorting operations at all major <b>bull</b> <b>studs</b> in the US and several other countries, Sexing Technologies now has custom semen sexing operations in five locations across the US. However, the number and genetic diversity of beef bulls with sexed semen available is limited compared to the offering of AI beef bulls with conventional semen.

40|$|The chief {{advantages}} of sire evaluation based on five-month daughter records are: 1. Genetic progress is {{inversely proportional to}} the turnover rate in testing bulls so that if this interval is shortened by 10 %, the rate of genetic progress will be increased by 11 %. The turnover period can be shortened {{with the use of}} 5 -month records from about 50 months to 45 months—a decrease of 10 % in time. 2. Genetic progress is also related to how many top bulls are saved and how many poor ones are culled out of all those sampled. In other words, the more bulls tested with the same number saved for use, then the faster the progress which can be made. The shorter length of time which bulls have to be saved with five-month record evaluation can allow up to 10 % more bulls to be tested with the same physical layout. 3. Returning a superior sire to service 5 – 6 months earlier will allow an increased service life for those sires. This could increase the service period by 15 % and would also reduce the overhead costs to the stud as well as allow the dairyman the services of a superior bull for a few extra months. Some problems to be solved to enable <b>bull</b> <b>studs</b> to make practical use of five-month records are: 1. Suitable mature equivalent factors must be determined for all breeds for five-month records. 2. Breed averages for five-month records must be established. 3. The regression of daughter records on stablemate averages must be estimated. 4. Estimates of variance and covariance components used in the procedures must be confirmed from larger numbers of observations. 5. The importance of differential persistency between sire groups should be investigated...|$|R
