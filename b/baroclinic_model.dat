40|$|Abstract. The estuarine zone {{is an area}} {{of strong}} {{interaction}} between fresh and salty water. Dynamics in these areas is complex due to the interaction of the forcing mechanisms such as wind, tides, local coastal currents and river discharges. The difference of density between fresh water and salted water causes the formation of the buoyant plumes which have been investigated by means of numerical models and field studies. Plumes {{play a significant role in}} the transport of pollutants and the ecology in the frontal areas where density gradients are strong. Therefore, in order to investigate the horizontal and vertical dispersion of salinity and temperature the YAXUM/ 3 D <b>baroclinic</b> numerical <b>model</b> was developed. The model is validated and applied for two particular cases. The first one consist of modeling the discharge of a jet of hot water where the gradients of temperature prevail and the second to study the discharge of the mouth of the estuary Leschenault toward the Koombana bay, Australia where salinity gradients are analyzed.

With respect to geopotential height and zonal wind distributions and to the phase speed of wave propagation, the results from the {{barotropic model}}, time-integrated on a sector latitude-longitude grid, agree better with a high-resolution control lun than those computed on a modified Kurihara grid, particularly at high latitudes. The barotropic model is also timeintegrated on a hemispheric, latitude-longitude grid, and the results compare well with a high-resolution control. The latter comparison is performed on initial data having strong cross-polar flow.

40|$|Studies of {{numerical}} forecasting errors {{have revealed}} that the principal difficulties encountered in models currently operational at the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit arise from errors in the 500 -mb. forecasts. These errors are common to both barotropic and <b>baroclinic</b> <b>models.</b> The errors in the 1000 - 500 -mb. thickness forecasts are considerably smaller. Results show that systematic errors are introduced (1) {{by the use of}} the geostrophic approximation and (2) by the approximations used on the boundaries. The cases presented in this paper show that the first type of error is virtually nonexistent in non-geostrophic, barotropic forecasts. Boundary errors are particularly serious in cases where the boundaries are meteorologically active, suggesting the future use of hemispheric forecast grids. The elimination of these two types of errors from all forecasts appears to be essential before the smaller errors, such as truncation errors and errors due to baroclinic development, non-adiabatic effects, etc., can be isolated and studied satisfactorily. 1...|$|R
40|$|A <b>baroclinic</b> <b>model</b> for the {{atmospheric}} jet at middle latitudes {{is used as}} a stochastic generator of nonstationary time series of the total energy of the system. A linear time trend is imposed on the parameter TE, descriptive of the forced equator-to-pole temperature gradient and responsible for setting the average baroclinicity in the model. The focus lies on establishing a theoretically sound framework for the detection and assessment of trend at extreme values of the generated time series. This problem is dealt with by fitting time-dependent generalized extreme value (GEV) models to sequences of yearly maxima of the total energy. A family of GEV models is used in which the location and scale parameters depend quadratically and linearly on time, respectively, while the shape parameter is kept constant. From this family, a GEV model is selected with Akaike’s information criterion, complemented by the likelihood ratio test and by assessment through standard graphical diagnostics. The inferred location and scale parameters are found to depend in a rather smooth way on time and, therefore, on TE. In particular, power-law dependences of and on TE are obtained, in analogy with the results of a previous work where the same <b>baroclinic</b> <b>model</b> was run with fixed values of TE spanning the same range as in this case.

40|$|Earlier {{theoretical}} {{models of the}} Gulf Stream have treated the motion of a single fluid layer of constant density and vertically uniform flow velocity. As a step toward models with continuous stratification, the present work analyses inviscid, steady-state, purely inertial flow using two moving layers of different density and velocity. The first type of Gulf Stream model analysed consists of two layers of different densities flowing over a denser layer at rest (<b>baroclinic</b> <b>model).</b> The second has two layers of different densities flowing over a rigid, horizontal bottom (mixed barotropic-baroclinic model). In both models there exist, at any latitude, either 0, 2, or 4 theoretical solutions to the flow problem. Only one such solution, however, is realistic and satisfies the boundary condition of vanishing northward velocity at the southern latitude boundary of the flow region considered. This is called the correct solution, while the others are called incorrect solutions. As {{the parameters of the}} two-layer models converge to limiting values corresponding to one-layer models (for example, vanishing density difference between the upper and lower layers), the solutions may or may not converge to the one-layer solutions. If a correct solution converges uniformly, the limit is called a correct limit. If convergence is non-uniform at some value of the latitude coordinate, the limit is called an incorrect limit. If no solutions exist as the limit is approached, it is an impossible limit. The most important limits discussed are as follows: 1. As the density contrast between the upper and lower moving layers becomes large in a <b>baroclinic</b> <b>model</b> for which the upper layer increases in thickness with latitude in the interior of the ocean to the east of the stream, the upper layer goes, via a correct limit, to the one-layer <b>baroclinic</b> <b>model.</b> 2. As the density contrast between the upper and lower layers becomes small in a <b>baroclinic</b> <b>model,</b> the solution for the sum of the two layers converges, via an incorrect limit, to the one-layer <b>baroclinic</b> <b>model.</b> 3. As the thickness of the upper layer becomes small while the density difference across it remains proportional to the thickness (a constant density "gradient" in the upper layer), the range of latitude over which there exists a correct solution tends to zero. The incorrect solution goes to the one-layer model via an incorrect limit. This result suggests that continuously stratified, purely inertial models of the Gulf Stream are impossible for finite density gradients. 4. In the limit as the interface between the lower moving layer and the resting layer becomes horizontal, the lower layer velocity goes to zero. No solution exists as the limit is approached. It is an impossible limit. 5. As the density contrast between the upper and lower layer becomes small in the barotropic-baroclinic model, the solution goes via a correct limit to the homogeneous barotropic model. In an attempt to model the actual Gulf Stream, parameters are selected for a model of two moving layers, the upper about 600 meters thick and the lower about 400 meters. This model is close to the impossible limit of 4. above, and no solution exists. The physical {{reason for this is that}} because of the small transport in the lower layer, the velocity in the lower layer must be small, which is incompatible with the large velocity gradient needed for conservation of potential vorticity as required in an inertial model. It therefore seems questionable that the deeper waters of the Gulf Stream can be modelled by a purely inertial theory. No off-shore countercurrents can be found, despite fairly accurate modelling of boundary conditions which might be expected to give them. The general implication of this work is that steady, purely inertial models are inadequate to describe even the lower latitude growth region of Gulf Stream if density stratification is taken into account, and that viscosity or unsteadiness must therefore be introduced...|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for low-order predictive statistical modeling and uncertainty quantification in turbulent dynamical systems is developed here. These reduced-order, modified quasilinear Gaussian (ROMQG) algorithms apply to turbulent dynamical systems {{in which there}} is significant linear instability or linear nonnormal dynamics in the unperturbed system and energy-conserving nonlinear interactions that transfer energy from the unstable modes to the stable modes where dissipation occurs, resulting in a statistical steady state; such turbulent dynamical systems are ubiquitous in geophysical and engineering turbulence. The ROMQG method involves constructing a low-order, nonlinear, dynamical system for the mean and covariance statistics in the reduced subspace that has the unperturbed statistics as a stable fixed point and optimally incorporates the indirect effect of non-Gaussian third-order statistics for the unperturbed system in a systematic calibration stage. This calibration procedure is achieved through information involving only the mean and covariance statistics for the unperturbed equilibrium. The performance of the ROMQG algorithm is assessed on two stringent test cases: the 40 -mode Lorenz 96 model mimicking midlatitude atmospheric turbulence and two-layer <b>baroclinic</b> <b>models</b> for high-latitude ocean turbulence with over 125, 000 degrees of freedom.

An extension of this method to <b>baroclinic</b> <b>models</b> is formulated, including {{a description of the}} various steps in the calculations. In the proposed scheme, the temperature is separated into a basic part dependent only on the vertical coordinate and a corresponding perturbation part. All terms involving the perturbation temperature are calculated from current values of the variables, while a centered finite-difference time average is applied to the horizontal pressure gradient, the divergence, and the vertical motion in the remaining terms. This method gives computationally stable integrations with relatively large time steps. The model used to test the semi-implicit scheme does not include topography, precipitation, diabatic heating, and other important physical processes. Five-day hemispheric integrations from real data with time steps of 60 and 30 min show differences of the order of 3 m. These errors are insignificant when compared to other sources of error normally present in most numerical models. Presently, this model produces relatively good short-range predictions, and this is a strong factor in favor of inserting the major physical processes as soon as possible. 1...|$|R
