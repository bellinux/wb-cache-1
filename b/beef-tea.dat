60|$|When Mr. Stone woke it {{was past}} three o'clock and Bianca at once handed him another cup of strong <b>beef-tea.</b>|$|E
60|$|When he {{was dressed}} in his woollen gown and seated before the fire, she gave him a cup of strong <b>beef-tea,</b> with brandy. He {{swallowed}} it with great avidity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] said Eliza. [...] "I won't be {{bringing}} {{him in his}} cup of <b>beef-tea</b> any more, nor you, ma'am, sending him his snuff. Ah, poor James!" ...|$|E
60|$|They found Old Peg {{in the act}} of {{administering}} <b>beef-tea</b> refreshment--or {{something of}} that sort--to the invalid. Peter Davidson and Archie Sinclair were there also, paying him a visit.|$|E
6000|$|... "We haven't heard, you know, {{about the}} slops yet. Do stop just one minute, dear papa. I wonder if it's like the <b>beef-tea</b> nurse makes {{for me when}} I'm ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|The idea of [...] "Miss" [...] {{being applied}} to Hetty, and slops {{compared}} to <b>beef-tea</b> proved {{almost too much}} for the broken-legged boy in the corner, but he put strong constraint on himself and listened.|$|E
6000|$|... "’Prognotice,’ ses the skipper, {{at least}} I think that’s the word he said. ’You keep {{perfectly}} still, an’ I’ll go an’ mix you up a draught, {{and tell the}} cook to get some strong <b>beef-tea</b> on.’ ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she came}} to herself completely, and was {{astonished}} to feel {{the pain in her}} head, which had been bandaged, and to see a strange stewardess sitting by her with a cup of <b>beef-tea</b> in her hand.|$|E
60|$|She busied herself {{over the}} {{preparation}} of a basin of arrowroot, and the steward, despite his distaste for this dish, devoured it in a twinkling. <b>Beef-tea</b> {{and a glass of}} milk in addition failed to take more than the edge off his appetite.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilks muttered that he didn't know, and lay crossly {{regarding}} his attentive neighbour as she {{knelt down and}} daintily lit the fire. This task finished, she proceeded to make the room tidy, and then set about making <b>beef-tea</b> in a little saucepan.|$|E
60|$|He {{sent for}} the club doctor next morning, and, pending his arrival, partook of a basin of {{arrowroot}} and drank a little <b>beef-tea.</b> A bottle of castor-oil and an empty pill-box on the table by the bedside added a little local colour to the scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure something's happening," [...] he said. [...] "I {{went out}} to take Jamie his <b>beef-tea,</b> and he was holding Mary's hand. I coughed as loud as I could, but they took no notice at all. So I thought I'd better not disturb them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{a little}} <b>beef-tea,</b> {{or a little}} rice pudding. Take nourishment, don't take that muck. Do you hear--" [...] {{charging}} upon the attendant women, who shrank against the wall--"she's to have nothing alcoholic at all, and don't let me catch you giving it her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arter these chaps {{had been}} ill two days, the other fellers began {{to put their}} heads together, being maddened by the smell o’ <b>beef-tea</b> an’ the like, an’ said they {{was going to be}} ill too, and both the invalids got into a fearful state of excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} ill, Ruth, but thank God you are better now. Don't talk, dear, and don't worry. I have got some <b>beef-tea</b> warming by the fire; {{the doctor said}} you were to try and drink a cup when you woke, and then {{to go off to}} sleep again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I wanted," [...] he whispered, [...] "she will {{be better}} after this. Get {{a cup of hot}} tea for her, or <b>beef-tea</b> {{will be better}} still if you have any, make her drink it and then leave her for a time. I will see her again presently." ...|$|E
60|$|The cold {{sunlight}} was {{weaker and}} Brother Michael {{was standing at}} his bedside {{with a bowl of}} <b>beef-tea.</b> He was glad for his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing in the playgrounds. And the day {{was going on in the}} college just as if he were there.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Boer {{women and}} {{children}} get as much food as they require, and {{have all sorts of}} medical comforts, such as <b>beef-tea,</b> extracts of meat, jellies, brandy and wine, and the advantage of fully qualified attendants. Not only are their absolute requirements provided for, but even their [...] "fads" [...] are considered.' ...|$|E
60|$|Sleep {{considerably}} repaired {{her little}} ladyship; {{and when she}} had awakened, and supped up a bason of <b>beef-tea,</b> toast and all, with considerable appetite, she was so much herself again, {{that there was no}} reason that anyone should be kept at home to attend to her. Mary's absence was extremely inconvenient, as she was organist and leader of the choir.|$|E
60|$|The journey {{seemed very}} long; and Lucy was really tired {{when she was}} put down at last in a big bed, nicely warmed for her, and with a bright fire in the room. As soon as she had had some <b>beef-tea,</b> she went off soundly to sleep and only woke to drink tea, give the dolls their supper, and put them to sleep.|$|E
60|$|Betsey {{produced}} {{the property in}} question, together with some other articles of general chandlery; and Mrs Gamp transferred them to her own pocket, which was a species of nankeen pannier. Refreshment then arrived {{in the form of}} chops and strong ale for the ladies, and a basin of <b>beef-tea</b> for the patient; which refection was barely at an end when John Westlock appeared.|$|E
60|$|In {{addition}} to the loan of the monthly boxes (which are always painted blue, {{with the name of}} the society in large white letters on the lid), the society dispense occasional grants of <b>beef-tea,</b> and a composition of warm beer, spice, eggs, and sugar, commonly known by the name of ‘candle,’ to its patients. And here again the services of the honorary members are called into requisition, and most cheerfully conceded. Deputations of twos or threes are sent out to visit the patients, and on these occasions there is such a tasting of candle and <b>beef-tea,</b> such a stirring about of little messes in tiny saucepans on the hob, such a dressing and undressing of infants, such a tying, and folding, and pinning; such a nursing and warming of little legs and feet before the fire, such a delightful confusion of talking and cooking, bustle, importance, and officiousness, as never can be enjoyed in its full extent but on similar occasions.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, doctor,' said Mrs. Kemp, {{as he was}} going, 'could yer give me somethin' for my rheumatics? I'm {{a martyr}} to rheumatism, an' these cold days I 'ardly knows wot ter do with myself. An', doctor, could you let me 'ave some <b>beef-tea?</b> My 'usbind's dead, an' of course I can't do no work with my {{daughter}} ill like this, an' we're very short--.' ...|$|E
60|$|At the end o' {{six days}} Sam {{was still alive}} and losing a {{shilling}} a day, {{to say nothing of}} buying 'is own <b>beef-tea</b> and such-like. Ginger said it was fair highway robbery, and tried to persuade Sam to go to a 'orsepittle, where he'd 'ave lovely nurses to wait on 'im hand and foot, and wouldn't keep 'is best friends awake of a night making 'orrible noises.|$|E
60|$|For {{three days}} {{they kept their}} lodgings and became fast friends, going, despite their anxiety, for various trips in the neighbourhood. Twice a day at least they sent down <b>beef-tea</b> and other delicacies for the invalid, which never got farther than the cabin, {{communication}} being kept up by a small boy who had strict injunctions not to go aboard. On the fourth day {{in the early morning}} they came down as close to the ship as they dared to bid farewell.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was on the}} {{day after}} New Year's Day,' said Geraldine, now {{speaking}} very fast. 'You were all at church, and she came out of-- this room with Bernard in her arms--and called to me that I might come and sit with--him, because she was going down to the kitchen to make some <b>beef-tea.</b> And just then she put her foot into a loop of whip-cord, and fell. She could not save herself at all, because of Bernard; but she went backwards--against the steps.' ...|$|E
60|$|While Mrs. Boutell {{held her}} hand and fed her <b>beef-tea,</b> Una showed {{photographs}} of Villa Estates and became feebly oratorical in its praises, and when Mr. Boutell came home at six-thirty they all had a light dinner together, {{and went to the}} moving-pictures, and through them talked about real estate, and at eleven Mr. Boutell uneasily took the fountain-pen which Una resolutely held out to him, and signed a contract to purchase two lots at Villa Estates, and a check for the first payment.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Kernan sent {{a letter}} to his office next day and {{remained}} in bed. She made <b>beef-tea</b> for him and scolded him roundly. She accepted his frequent intemperance as part of the climate, healed him dutifully whenever he was sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast. There were worse husbands. He had never been violent since the boys had grown up, and she knew that he would walk to the end of Thomas Street and back again to book even a small order.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a treasure, my dear, for you {{can turn}} your hand to any thing and do well {{whatever}} you undertake. So many come with plenty of good-will, but not a particle of practical ability, and are offended because I decline their help. The boys don't want to be cried over, or have their brows 'everlastingly swabbed,' as old Watkins calls it: {{they want to be}} well fed and nursed, and cheered up with creature comforts. Your nice <b>beef-tea</b> and cheery ways are worth oceans of tears and cart-loads of tracts." ...|$|E
6000|$|She was {{relieved}} by the admiration {{with which the}} jeune fille Rita Simons looked at the steel buckles on her pumps; but she resented Mrs. Howland's tart demand, [...] "Don't you find that new couch of yours is too broad to be practical?" [...] She nodded, then shook her head, and touchily left Mrs. Howland {{to get out of}} it any meaning she desired. Immediately she wanted to make peace. She was close to simpering in the sweetness with which she addressed Mrs Howland: [...] "I think that is the prettiest display of <b>beef-tea</b> your husband has in his store." ...|$|E
60|$|Less often, it {{is a mere}} male {{thing that}} rides the machine. He is not so {{accomplished}} an acrobat as is the lady; but simple tricks, such as standing on the saddle and waving flags, drinking beer or <b>beef-tea</b> while riding, he can and does perform. Something, one supposes, he must do to occupy his mind: sitting still hour after hour on this machine, having no work to do, nothing to think about, must pall upon any man of active temperament. Thus {{it is that we}} see him rising on his pedals as he nears the top of some high hill to apostrophise the sun, or address poetry to the surrounding scenery.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{all thought}} it a fine joke at first, but the airs them two chaps give {{themselves}} was something sickening. Being in bed all day, they was naturally wakeful of a night, and {{they used to call}} across the fo’c’sle inquiring arter each other’s healths, an’ waking us other chaps up. An’ they’d swop <b>beef-tea</b> an’ jellies with each other, an’ Dan ’ud try an’ coax a little port wine out o’ Harry, which he ’ad to make blood with, but Harry ’ud say he hadn’t made enough that day, an’ he’d drink to the better health of old Dan’s prognotice, an’ smack his lips until it drove us a’most crazy to ’ear him.|$|E
6000|$|... "This went on, though, {{after she}} got better in her health; and a strange look came over her eyes. They seemed to be always {{wondering}} and frightened, in a confused way, about something or other. She took, too, to rolling her head about restlessly {{from one side of}} the pillow to the other; making a sort of muttering and humming now and then, but still never seeming to notice or to care for anything I said to her. One day, I was warming her a nice cup of <b>beef-tea</b> over the fire, when I heard, quite sudden and quite plain, these words from where she lay on the bed, 'Why are you always so quiet here? Why doesn't somebody speak to me?' ...|$|E
60|$|The little party {{stumbled}} eagerly after him. In a {{few moments}} {{they were at the}} camp. Trent roused his companions, packages were hastily undone and a meal prepared. Scarcely a word was said or a question asked. One or two of the Kru boys seemed on the verge of insanity--Francis himself was hysterical and faint. Trent boiled a kettle and made some <b>beef-tea</b> himself. The first mouthful Francis was unable to swallow. His throat had swollen and his eyes were hideously bloodshot. Trent, who had seen men before in dire straits, fed him from a spoon and forced brandy between his lips. Certainly, at the time, he never stopped to consider that he was helping back to life the man who in all the world was most likely to do him ill.|$|E
60|$|All that night, while squall after squall smote Berande, {{uprooting}} trees, overthrowing copra-sheds, and {{rocking the}} house on its tall piles, Sheldon slept. He {{was unaware of the}} commotion. He never wakened. Nor did he change his position or dream. He awoke, a new man. Furthermore, he was hungry. It was over a week since food had passed his lips. He drank a glass of condensed cream, thinned with water, and by ten o'clock he dared to take a cup of <b>beef-tea.</b> He was cheered, also, by the situation in the hospital. Despite the storm there had been but one death, and there was only one fresh case, while half a dozen boys crawled weakly away to the barracks. He wondered if it was the wind that was blowing the disease away and cleansing the pestilential land.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew there}} wasn't another soul {{in the room}} but the poor child at that time; and yet, the voice as spoke those words was no more like little Mary's voice, than my voice, sir, is like yours. It sounded, somehow, hoarse and low, and deep and faint, {{all at the same}} time; the strangest, shockingest voice to come from a child, who always used to speak so clearly and prettily before, that ever I heard. If I was only cleverer with my words, ma'am, and could tell you about it properly--but I can't. I only know it gave me such a turn to hear her, that I upset the <b>beef-tea,</b> and ran back in a fright to the bed. 'Why, Mary! Mary!' says I, quite loud, 'are you so well already that you're trying to imitate Mr. Jubber's gruff voice?' ...|$|E
