We use the curvature based shape index to represent the fingersÕ surface. Gallery and probe shape index signatures are compared using the normalized correlation coefficient to compute a match score. A large unique database of hand images supports the research. We use data sets obtained over time to examine the performance of each individual finger surface as a <b>biometric</b> <b>identifier</b> {{as well as the}} performance obtained when combining them. Both identification and verification experiments are conducted. In addition, probe and gallery sets sizes are increased to further improve recognition performance in our experiments.

40|$|Biometric {{technology}} {{that involves the}} identification and verification of individuals by analyzing the human body characteristics has been widely used in various aspect of life for different purposes, most importantly as regards this study the issue of staff attendance. Despite the numerous advantages of the biometric system and its impact to various work sectors across the globe, most biometric technology users face the issue of defining the right and accurate biometric technology system that will be cost effective in solving particular problems in specific environment. In this paper, a study was conducted using a telecommunication company in the South West region of Nigeria, {{in order to determine}} the specific <b>biometric</b> <b>identifier</b> that can be used to enhance their traditional staff attendance system which presently affects the productivity of the organization. The study was conducted using a quantitative approach by designing a questionnaire as the data collection instrument based on different biometric technologies. The survey involved 37 employees based on stratified random sampling technique. The results however show that fingerprint <b>biometric</b> <b>identifier</b> was found suitable for the staff attendance management system of the organization.

5000|$|Soft {{biometrics}} {{traits are}} physical, behavioral or adhered human characteristics {{that have been}} derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers (e.g. height, gender, hair color). They are used to complement the identity {{information provided by the}} primary <b>biometric</b> <b>identifiers</b> [...] Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably, and can be easily faked, they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial. In other words, despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject, they are effective in distinguishing between people. Combinations of personal attributes like gender, race, eye color, height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems. Most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment.Two main ethical issues are raised by soft biometrics. First, some of soft biometric traits are strongly cultural based; e.g., skin colors for determining ethnicity risk to support racist approaches, biometric sex recognition at the best recognizes gender from tertiary sexual characters, being unable to determine genetic and chromosomal sexes; soft biometrics for aging recognition are often deeply influenced by ageist stereotypes, etc. Second, soft biometrics have strong potential for categorizing and profiling people, so risking of supporting processes of stigmatization and exclusion.|$|E

DNA phenotyping is used when investigators need to narrow the pool of possible individuals or identify unknown remains by learning about the person’s ancestry and appearance. When the suspected individual is identified, traditional DNA profiling can be used to prove a match, provided there is a reference sample {{that can be used for}} comparison.|$|R
