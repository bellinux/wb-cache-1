5000|$|The {{nature of}} the Torsen is akin {{to that of a}} limited slip {{differential}} in that, rather than actively allocating torque (as a computer controlled clutch can do), it supports a torque difference across the differential (the torque bias ratio/TBR), from the side with the least grip to the side with the most. Hence by nature the Torsen is limited in the amount of torque that can be supplied to the axle with the most grip by the torque available at the axle with the least amount of grip. Therefore, if one axle has no grip, regardless of the TBR, the other axle will not be supplied substantial torque. In the extreme, for a centre differential implementation, complete loss of traction on a single wheel will result in very limited torque to the other three wheels. Audi responded to this limitation for the first Torsen-equipped cars by adding a manually locking rear differential and then later replaced this feature with Electronic Differential Lock (EDL), which is the ability to use the individual wheel <b>brakes</b> (<b>monitored</b> by the ABS sensors) to limit individual wheel spin. EDL was implemented across both front and rear (open) differentials to operate at speeds < 80 km/h. This has the effect of increasing torque from a single low-traction wheel hence allowing more torque to be passed by the Torsen to the remaining high-traction wheels.|$|R

According to {{the vehicle}} braking {{efficiency}} road test rules in GB 7258, the <b>braking</b> efficiency on-line <b>monitoring</b> index, parameter, method and threshold are studied.

40|$|Abstract â€” Brakes {{and tires}} {{are the major}} {{contributors}} for catastrophic failure of ground vehicles. Braking system is the utmost important besides tire {{to ensure the safety}} of users and vehicle. Ensuring good condition of brake lining is very crucial to ensure the efficiency of the braking system, where, the worn off brake lining not only endangers life but also damages the entire brake associated parts such as hub, disk, shaft, etc. In this paper, Malaysian made luxury car Proton Perdana V 6 brake pads were investigated to be embedded with a lining wear limit alert system. The current spring steel alert system has some drawbacks where, the alerting sound is only activated while the car moves and secondly, when the car is on move, rarely the alerting sound reaches the driver. Therefore, a critical investigation of the existing pads manufactured in Malaysia and their characterizations are conducted to identify the most suitable sensor spot on the brake pad. Later, a micro sensor is embedded into the pad and fully tested on a specially designed test rig. The evaluation of thickness, hardness, layer properties and critical wear region has enabled the spotting of exact sensor location. The embedment of the micro switch was successfully done and tested to be very efficient in alerting the driver upon reaching the maximum lining wear limit.

2500|$|The {{signalling}} {{technology used}} {{on all three}} SkyTrain lines to run trains automatically was originally developed by Alcatel, and loaded from a 3.5" [...] diskette. There are four systems called the VCC (Vehicle Control Computer) with three divided over the mainline {{and one for the}} storage yard. VCC1 controls trains from Waterfront to Royal Oak; VCC2 controls trains from Royal Oak to King George (it now also controls a portion of the Millennium line); and VCC3 controls trains in the yard. Each VCC is a cluster of three IBM rack-mount computers with Intel-IA32 processors and proprietary hardware, configured in a fault tolerant setup. For every command that is sent to a VCC, {{at least two of the}} computers must agree with the action, otherwise an error is generated and the command is ignored. The VCCs communicates with the train's VOBC (Vehicle On Board Computer), whose data is transmitted through leaky coax cable laid along the tracks. There are up to two VOBCs per married-pair trains, i.e., 4-car train would have two VOBCs. If the VCCs fail or communication between the VCC and the VOBC is lost, the train will 'time-out' and (EB) emergency-brake through a Quester Tangent BAM (<b>Brake</b> Assurance <b>Monitor)</b> that controls propulsion and braking systems. The VCCs have a command-line-console, but normally the trains are controlled through a system known as the SMC, which also provides scheduling. All commands from the SMC are verified to be safe by the VCC before execution. However if the SMC fails, the system can still be operated through the VCC. This is known as 'degraded mode'. The SkyTrain HMU (Health Monitoring Unit) developed by Quester Tangent [...] provides monitoring and diagnostic functionality for vehicle maintenance by connecting to CAN vehicle network and providing a maintenance display in the Hoslter Panel.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} part of the 20 th century, the US {{trucking}} industry has provided a safe and economical means of moving commodities across the country. At present, nearly 80 % of US domestic freight movement involves the use of trucks. The US Department of Energy (DOE) is spearheading a number of research efforts to improve heavy vehicle fuel efficiencies. This includes research in engine technologies (including hybrid and fuel cell technologies), lightweight materials, advanced fuels, and parasitic loss reductions. In addition, DOE is developing advanced tools and models to support heavy vehicle research and is leading the 21 st Century Truck Partnership and the SuperTruck development effort. Both of these efforts have the common goal of decreasing the fuel consumption of heavy vehicles. In the case of SuperTruck, a goal of improving the overall freight efficiency of a combination tractor-trailer has been established. This Medium Truck Duty Cycle (MTDC) project is a critical element in DOE s vision for improved heavy vehicle energy efficiency; it is unique in that there is no other existing national database of characteristic duty cycles for medium trucks based on collecting data from Class 6 and 7 vehicles. It involves the collection of real-world data on medium trucks for various situational characteristics (e. g., rural/urban, freeway/arterial, congested/free-flowing, good/bad weather) and looks at the unique nature of medium trucks drive cycles (stop-and-go delivery, power takeoff, idle time, short-radius trips). This research provides a rich source of data that can contribute to the development of new tools for FE and modeling, provide DOE a sound basis upon which to make technology investment decisions, and provide a national archive of real-world-based medium-truck operational data to support energy efficiency research. The MTDC project involved a two-part field operational test (FOT). For the Part- 1 FOT, three vehicles each from two vocations (urban transit and dry-box delivery) were instrumented for the collection of one year of operational data. The Part- 2 FOT involved the towing and recovery and utility vocations for a second year of data collection. The vehicles that participated in the MTDC project did so through gratis partnerships in return for early access to the results of this study. Partnerships such as these are critical to FOTs in which real-world data is being collected. In Part 1 of the project, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) established partnerships with the H. T. Hackney Company (HTH), one of the largest wholesale distributors in the country, distributing products to 21 states; and with Knoxville Area Transit (KAT), the city of Knoxville s transit system, which operates across Knoxville and parts of Knox County. These partnerships and agreements provided ORNL access to three Class- 7 day-cab tractors that regularly haul 28 ft pup trailers (HTH) and three Class- 7 buses for the collection of duty cycle data. In addition, ORNL collaborated with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to determine if there were possible synergies between this duty cycle data collection effort and FMCSA s need to learn more about the operation and duty cycles of medium trucks. FMCSA s primary interest was in collecting safety data relative to the driver, carrier, and vehicle. In Part 2 of the project, ORNL partnered with the Knoxville Utilities Board, which made available three Class- 8 trucks. Fountain City Wrecker Service was also a Part 2 partner, providing three Class- 6 rollback trucks. In order to collect the duty cycle and safety-related data, ORNL developed a data acquisition system (DAS) that was placed on each test vehicle. Each signal recorded in this FOT was collected by means of one of the instruments incorporated into each DAS. Other signals were obtained directly from the vehicle s J 1939 and J 1708 data buses. A VBOX II Lite collected information available from a global positioning system (GPS), including speed, acceleration, and spatial location information at a rate of 5 Hz for the Part 1 FOT. For the Part 2 FOT, this information was obtained from DAS-based GPS instrumentation. The Air-Weigh LoadMaxx, a self-weighing system that determines the vehicle s gross weight by means of pressure transducers, was used to collect vehicle payload information for the combination, urban transit, and towing and recovery vehicles. A cellular modem, the Raven X EVDO V 4221, facilitated the communication between the eDAQ-lite (the data collection engine of the system) and the user. The modem functioned as a wireless gateway, allowing data retrievals and system checks to be performed remotely. Also, in partnership with FMCSA, two additional safety sensors were installed on the combination vehicles: the MGM e-Stroke <b>brake</b> <b>monitoring</b> system and the Tire SafeGuard tire pressure monitoring system. All of these sensors posted data to the J 1939 data bus, enabling the signals to be read withou [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Brake rotors play a {{significant}} role in converting the vehicle kinetic energy into heat energy that is dissipated through conduction and convection. The automotive industry has been looking for many years to develop lightweight brake rotors to reduce vehicle weight and subsequently improve fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions targets. Uncoated wrought aluminium alloys and metal matrix composite (Al-MMC) rotors have been reported to have insufficient safety margin for most passenger car applications. In this study, the thermal performance of coated and uncoated lightweight aluminium disc brake rotors was investigated numerically and experimentally, using both small scale and full size brake dynamometers. Five small scale solid brake rotors were investigated: grey cast iron, forged aluminium alloy (6082), the same 6082 alloy but with an alumina surface layer applied by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), cast aluminium MMC (AMC 640 XA), and the same MMC again with PEO alumina surface layer. The disc and pad temperatures, brake pressure, coefficient of friction and <b>brake</b> torque were <b>monitored</b> during the tests for each disc brake material. In addition, a two dimensional axisymmetric finite element model was developed using Abaqus software in order to investigate the temperature distribution through the disc.

It was found that the PEO coated aluminium alloy has the best overall performance of the lightweight rotors tested in terms of friction and structural integrity at elevated temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{capability}} to provide localized, real-time monitoring of material regression rates in various applications {{has the potential}} to provide a new stream of data for development testing of various components and systems, as well as serving as a monitoring tool in flight applications. These applications include, but are not limited to, the regression of a combusting solid fuel surface, the ablation of the throat in a chemical rocket or the heat shield of an aeroshell, and the monitoring of erosion in long-life plasma thrusters. The rate of regression in the first application is very fast, while the second and third are increasingly slower. A recent fundamental sensor development effort has led to a novel regression, erosion, and ablation sensor technology (REAST). The REAST sensor allows for measurement of real-time surface erosion rates at a discrete surface location. The sensor is optical, using two different, co-located fiber-optics to perform the regression measurement. The disparate optical transmission properties of the two fiber-optics makes it possible to measure the regression rate by monitoring the relative light attenuation through the fibers. As the fibers regress along with the parent material in which they are embedded, the relative light intensities through the two fibers changes, providing a measure of the regression rate. The optical nature of the system makes it relatively easy to use in a variety of harsh, high temperature environments, and it is also unaffected by the presence of electric and magnetic fields. In addition, the sensor could be used to perform optical spectroscopy on the light emitted by a process and collected by fibers, giving localized measurements of various properties. The {{capability to}} perform an in-situ measurement of material regression rates is useful in addressing a variety of physical issues in various applications. An in-situ measurement allows for real-time data regarding the erosion rates, providing a quick method for empirically anchoring any analysis geared towards lifetime qualification. Erosion rate data over an operating envelope could also be useful in the modeling detailed physical processes. The sensor has been embedded in many regressing media for the purposes of proof-of-concept testing. A gross demonstration of its capabilities was performed using a sanding wheel to remove layers of metal. A longer-term demonstration measurement involved the placement of the sensor in a <b>brake</b> pad, <b>monitoring</b> the removal of pad material associated with the normal wear-and-tear of driving. It was used to measure the regression rates of the combustable media in small model rocket motors and road flares. Finally, a test was performed using a sand blaster to remove small amounts of material at a time. This test was aimed at demonstrating the unit's present resolution, and is compared with laser profilometry data obtained simultaneously. At the lowest resolution levels, this unit should be useful in locally quantifying the erosion rates of the channel walls in plasma thrusters. ...|$|R

Abaqus finite element and Matlab software {{were used to}} construct one dimensional (1 D), two dimensional (2 D) and three dimensional (3 D) thermal models to investigate the general thermal performance of disc brakes to develop a valid method of reduced scale testing. Five small scale solid brake rotors were investigated experimentally: grey cast iron, wrought aluminium alloy (6082), the same 6082 alloy with an alumina surface layer applied by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), cast aluminium MMC (AMC 640 XA) and the same MMC with a PEO alumina surface layer. The disc and pad temperatures, brake pressure, coefficient of friction and <b>brake</b> torque were <b>monitored</b> during the tests for each material. Surface morphology, microstructure and micro hardness of the coatings and substrate were evaluated {{before and after the}} tests. Numerical simulations confirmed the equivalence between the full and small scale disc thermal performance using the proposed scaling methodology and also provide a good agreement with the experimental results. The coated 6082 alloy rotor was shown to give good thermal and friction performance up to relatively high rubbing surface temperatures of around 500 oC. This rotor failed at a surface temperature of about 550 oC due to brittle fracture of the wrought aluminium substrate. The proposed scaling methodology was shown to be a valid method of investigating a rotor design concept in the laboratory at low cost and reduced operating time. The PEO coating on aluminium alloy was denser and more uniform compared to the PEO coating on aluminium MMC. In addition, the PEO coating improved the hardness and thermal resistance of both the aluminium alloy and aluminium MMC. A sensitivity analysis based on the Taguchi approach was carried out on the PEO coated aluminium alloy rotor to investigate the effect of various parameters on thermal performance. Optimisation of the structure was carried out using a genetic algorithm to design coated aluminium alloy discs that are potentially technically viable on small-medium passenger cars...|$|R
