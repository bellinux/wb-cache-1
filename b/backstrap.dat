25|$|Weaving {{can be done}} {{on either}} a <b>backstrap</b> loom, mostly in {{indigenous}} communities or wood frame pedal looms, introduced by the Spanish in the colonial period. Xonacatlan and Ameyalco are two communities that still use the <b>backstrap</b> loom, with pedal looms used in communities such as Coatepec Harinas, Chiconcuac, Texcoco, San Felipe del Progreso, Xonacatlán, Guadalupita. Guadalupita, San Felipe del Progreso and Xonacatlan are particularly known for the making of serapes of naturally dyed wool in this manner.|$|E
25|$|The town of Santo Tomás Jalieza {{specializes in}} cotton textiles, {{embroidered}} items and those woven with a <b>backstrap</b> loom such as blouses, sarapes, other traditional clothing and tablecloths.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} known for its <b>backstrap</b> loom works for at least 400 years, with most of its {{production}} in the colonial period sold locally, especially to communities in the Sierra de Villa Alta.|$|E

5000|$|All {{variations}} of the pistols (save some law enforcement models that are decock only) include ambidextrous safety/decocking levers, magazine releases, and slide stop release levers. [...] All variations also include a Picatinny rail, tritium night sights, and a loaded chamber indicator on the right side. [...] New models are sold in a plastic hard case with three magazines, and two interchangeable <b>backstraps.</b> [...] As of 2012, new models include 4 interchangeable <b>backstraps</b> rather than two. One is shipped on the handgun and three extra are in the case. The <b>backstraps</b> are two different thicknesses and two different patterns (a cross-hatch pattern similar {{to the sides of}} the grip, and horizontal lines similar {{to the front of the}} grip).|$|R

25|$|The SR9 {{also has}} a {{reversible}} <b>backstrap</b> which allows the owner to select either a flat or arched grip housing, based on personal preference. In addition, the SR9 sports a Picatinny rail for the mounting of laser sights and tactical lights.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{communities}} are noted for weaving. El Jorongo {{is one of}} these, for items made both on back strap and pedal looms. Back strap and pedal looms {{are used in the}} Nahua coastal areas and the Mazahua mountain areas of the state for both everyday and festive wear. The finest woven products of both wool and cotton are made in Patzcuaro, Uruapan and Zamora, producing rebozos, other traditional clothing, and linens. Wool items are woven on <b>backstrap</b> looms is only done in the Purepecha region and part of the Mazahua region {{in the eastern part of}} the state. Angahuan is noted for its rebozos, blankets, echequemos, ruanas and heavy fabrics with images of birds, flowers and geometric patterns. Heavy jackets are made in Pichátaro, Santa Clara del Cobre, Cherán, Comachúen, Macho de Agua, Nahuatzen, Sevina and Charapan. In Tarecuato, <b>backstrap</b> looms create wool belts and in Cuanajo, they make pouches, belts and more in a “dog leg” pattern. In Boca de la Cañada, Crescencio Morales and Macho de Agua, rebozos, cobijas, jackets, carrying bags and more are created with fabric made on <b>backstrap</b> looms, with elements such as stars, fretwork and deer.|$|E
25|$|The Bisley {{mainspring}} {{is longer}} than the SAA mainspring, and the two are not interchangeable; it {{is attached to the}} hammer with a stirrup via a forked upper end. The serial numbers are stamped on the frame, the <b>backstrap</b> and the trigger-guard at the end of production, with tiny dies.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} used are non-flammable or fire-resistant, impact resistant {{and have a}} high resistance to mechanical damage. The controls are accessible from both sides. Other characteristics include folding telescopic stock and interchangeable <b>backstraps</b> in three sizes.|$|R
50|$|Current {{production}} Grand Power pistols use a solid {{trigger guard}} {{and a new}} take down lever. They also have 4 user interchangeable grip <b>backstraps</b> to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm.|$|R
50|$|Both the VP9 and VP40 use Heckler & Koch's {{ergonomic}} handgun grip {{design that}} includes three changeable <b>backstraps</b> and six side panels {{that allow the}} pistol's to fit any and all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves {{in the front of}} the pistol's grip also instinctively position the shooters hand for optimal shooting.|$|R
25|$|While huipils {{today are}} made from {{commercial}} cloth, the most traditional {{are made from}} hand woven fabric made on a <b>backstrap</b> loom. The pieces {{to be used to}} make the huipil are woven to size and are never cut. Despite its simplicity, the <b>backstrap</b> loom permits more types of techniques and designs to be woven into the cloth than other types of looms. Most of the hand woven fabric have designs woven into them, especially cloth destined for ceremonial huipils. The decorative elements can signify history, cultural identity, something personal about the wearer and more. Since most indigenous come from agricultural societies, clothing designs generally relate to the natural world. The most complicated designs are generally known only to a few older master weavers. In addition to designs embedded into the fabric, other decorative elements can include embroidery, ribbon, feathers, lace and more.|$|E
25|$|Beluga whale {{or white}} whale Delphinapterus leucas (cetuaq, assigarnaq, qecip'atuli in Yup'ik cituaq in Cup'ik, cetuar in Cup'ig) {{is used for}} human and dog food. Beluga {{harvested}} in spring are used primarily for human food, although some are used for dog food. Beluga harvests in the fall usually are lower than in spring. The late fall beluga hunts were used to produce food for the dogs. Parts of the beluga used for human food include the skin, fat, <b>backstrap,</b> and intestines. <b>Backstrap</b> meat is sometimes dried, and beluga skin is sometimes pickled. Beluga products are prepared a number of ways, such as boiling skin and meat (eaten hot or cold); flouring and frying or barbecuing backstraps; and processing fat into oil for use with dried fish and meat. Ways of preserving and using beluga products show local differences between communities and families.|$|E
25|$|Another major craft {{category}} is textiles. Textiles from cotton and other fibers date to {{early in the}} pre-Hispanic period on <b>backstrap</b> looms. This form of weaving {{has been dominated by}} women since that time. The Spanish introduced the wide European frame loom, which is mostly used by men. Traditional clothing items such as huipils are still made on <b>backstrap</b> looms, while the European looms are used to produce larger and heavier items such as rugs, ponchos and blankets. Most items are produced with cotton or wool fibers, although some maguey fibers can be found and palm fronds are used to produce mats and hats. Embroidery {{is an important part of}} indigenous clothing, especially for women. One municipality noted for its indigenous and embroidered clothing is Santo Tomás Jalietza, just south of the city of Oaxaca. The Xochimilco neighborhood of the capital is known for its embroidered tablecloths, napkins and other tableware.|$|E
50|$|On June 19, 2005, Ben Bradshaw from Australia {{performed}} a Posey straitjacket escape using four <b>backstraps,</b> an arm loop, a crotch strap, arm straps and self-tightening clasps. He {{managed to escape}} {{in a time of}} 50.08 seconds on the Guinness World Records studio in Sydney, beating the previous 81.24-second record by David Straitjacket.|$|R
50|$|Heckler & Koch also {{manufactures}} the HK45 Compact (HK45C), {{which can}} use an 8-round and a 10-round magazine. The HK45C features the same improvements as the full-size HK45, {{but has a}} more conventional straight grip similar to Heckler & Koch's P2000. This design still allows the user to customize the grip size via interchangeable <b>backstraps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ergonomics were a key {{focus in}} the design of the firearm, and as a result, three {{interchangeable}} grip <b>backstraps</b> are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. This adaptable grip was innovative at the time the P99 was introduced.|$|R
25|$|It is a {{loose-fitting}} tunic, generally {{made from}} {{two or three}} rectangular pieces of fabric which are then joined together with stitching, ribbons or fabric strips, with an opening for the head and, if the sides are sewn, openings for the arms. Traditional huipils, especially ceremonial ones, are usually made with fabric woven on a <b>backstrap</b> loom and are heavily decorated with designs woven into the fabric, embroidery, ribbons, lace and more. However, some huipils are also made from commercial fabric.|$|E
25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{group in}} the state is the Amuzgo people, who are concentrated in the south, near the Oaxacan border in municipalities such as Xochistlahuaca. This group {{is known for its}} handwoven textiles done on <b>backstrap</b> looms with many pieces recognized by the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes. Cualac is noted for its machetes which have blades decorated by etching miniature landscapes. Temalacacingo and Acapetlahuaya produce gourd items, toys and small lacquered items. Olinalá has been an important producer of lacquer since pre-Hispanic times.|$|E
25|$|The textile {{collection}} {{is one of}} the most varied in Mexico, standing out as one of few collections in the country with significant samples. Much of the current collection consists of recent acquisitions, but it began with Mayer collecting rebozos, then blankets from Saltillo, Flemish tapestries, shawls from Manila, dresses and liturgical garments. Mexican textiles include those from the colonial period made on <b>backstrap</b> as well as European pedal looms. There are also pieces with fine embroidery including the use of gold and silver thread. Many of the rugs are from Europe and Spain but with Oriental motifs.|$|E
50|$|PPS pistols are {{delivered}} in a polymer pistol case containing; the pistol, 2 <b>backstraps</b> of different sizes, 2 magazine (small and medium), magazine loader, instruction manual, warranty papers, factory test target showing 5 shots fired at 15 m distance and an envelope with {{the case of the}} proof round fired during the proof test at the C.I.P. accredited Beschussamt Ulm (Proof House Ulm).|$|R

25|$|The Mixe largely {{live from}} {{subsistence}} agriculture of maize, beans, squash and potatoes, complementing with hunting of small game and fishing on the smaller rivers and streams. However, {{in the past}} century the midland Mixe have begun to commercialize coffee, usually as small producers who sell their roasted beans to buyers from outside the Mixe area. The Mixe are well known in Oaxaca for their large brass bands – every Mixe town has a band that performs in their local festivals. In some towns traditional weaving is practiced on <b>backstrap</b> looms whereas other towns mainly produce ceramics.|$|E
25|$|Tolimán {{is known}} for its {{traditional}} clothing, especially quexquemetls made of silk and embroidered with colored thread for men and quexquemetls made of cotton for women. The ones made here are the largest in the country, made on <b>backstrap</b> looms. They also weave and embroider bags and linens such as tablecloths and napkins. Another area for traditional Otomi dress is Amealco de Bonfil, where blouses, skirts and more are embroidered with designs from this ethnicity. They also make cloth dolls dressed in traditional clothing. In Tolimán, Pame influence is noted in the textiles, which are mostly woven to make tablecloths and napkins. Colón, Cadereyta and Bernal are known for items made of wool which has been naturally dyed, such as rebozos, blankets and more.|$|E
25|$|One {{other way}} to use {{feathers}} {{was the creation of}} garments either decorated with feathers or with thread which was created by spinning cotton and feather shreds. The garments of eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Fabric made of the latter was favored by the nobility, both men and women which distinguished them from commoners. Little is known how feathers were incorporated into fabric in the Mesoamerican period. The only vestige of this practice is the making of wedding huipils in the town of Zinacantán in Chiapas. Although research has shown this practice is descended from the Mesoamerican one, it is still different. The Mesoamerican feathered cloth was made with thread made of cotton fiber and feathers done on a <b>backstrap</b> loom, which the current wedding huipils incorporate feathers into commercially spun cotton thread.|$|E
50|$|In May 2010, the Army {{requested}} {{changes to}} the design {{before it could be}} operational including the change from a folding and telescoping stock to just a folding one, a pin-stabilized magazine well, a pistol grip with changeable <b>backstraps,</b> and the change from a 7-lug bolt to a 6-lug bolt. The first delivery of the CZ 805 occurred on 19 July 2011 with 505 guns and 20 grenade launchers. The initial order was to be completed in 2013.|$|R
2500|$|The HK45 {{represents}} an evolutionary {{advancement of the}} Heckler & Koch USP, and shares the same operating principles of that weapon. It {{is available in the}} same ten variants as the USP. The HK45 is a full size model pistol, but significant effort went towards making it more ergonomic than the HK USP full-size chambered in [...]45 ACP by incorporating features found on the Heckler & Koch P2000. These include an extended ambidextrous slide release, a textured ergonomic grip with finger grooves, and interchangeable <b>backstraps</b> to fit differently sized hands. The newer grip and <b>backstraps</b> allow the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to greater control of the weapon and recoil management. In order to accommodate the smaller, more ergonomic grip, the HK45 has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds versus 12 rounds for the USP45. The HK45 also added grip serrations on {{the front end of the}} slide, a Picatinny rail in front of the trigger guard for mounting accessories, and an O-ring polygonal barrel similar to the USP Expert and Match models and the Mark 23 for more consistent lock-up of the slide and barrel during cycling and increased accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|The UCP {{operated}} on the delayed-blowback operating principle. The external {{design of the}} UCP {{appears to have been}} borrowed from the HK P2000 pistol, and includes ambidextrous controls, interchangeable <b>backstraps,</b> and a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny-type rail system for the attachment of accessories. Like the USP and P2000 series of pistols, the trigger mechanism is reported to have been modular and capable of different configurations. The UCP was designed to accept an extended, threaded barrel capable of accepting the attachment of a sound suppressor made by Brügger & Thomet.|$|R
25|$|Chiapas’ most {{important}} handcraft is textiles, {{most of which}} is cloth woven on a <b>backstrap</b> loom. Indigenous girls often learn how to sew and embroider before {{they learn how to}} speak Spanish. They are also taught how to make natural dyes from insects, and weaving techniques. Many of the items produced are still for day-to-day use, often dyed in bright colors with intricate embroidery. They include skirts, belts, rebozos, blouses, huipils and shoulder wraps called chals. Designs are in red, yellow, turquoise blue, purple, pink, green and various pastels and decorated with designs such as flowers, butterflies, and birds, all based on local flora and fauna. Commercially, indigenous textiles are most often found in San Cristóbal de las Casas, San Juan Chamula and Zinacantán. The best textiles are considered to be from Magdalenas, Larráinzar, Venustiano Carranza and Sibaca.|$|E
500|$|The sprang {{technique}} also survives as {{a traditional}} method for making hammocks in Guatemala, Mexico, and Colombia, and also in Colombia for making a shopping bag known as mechita. [...] The work in these locations is generally performed on a <b>backstrap</b> loom. [...] Handmade Mesoamerican sprang hammocks continue to be produced for export {{to a variety of}} international markets. [...] Additionally, sprang remains in use for making silk trouser drawstrings for male and female attire in Punjab in India [...] There village women still use the technique to create colourful check/stipped/zigzag designs that have been handed down the generations. They finish the ends of the work using a weaving technique to make a hard 2inch'harar' with bunched twisted threads & knot. These sprang drawstrings are also used for the 'ghugrai' ...|$|E
2500|$|The basic grip {{size of the}} {{fourth-generation}} Glock pistols {{is slightly}} smaller compared to the previous design. A punch is provided to remove the standard trigger housing pin {{and replace it with}} the longer cross pin needed to mount the medium or large <b>backstrap</b> that will increase the trigger distance by [...] or [...] With the medium <b>backstrap</b> installed, the grip size is identical to the third-generation pistols. The magazine release catches are enlarged and reversible for left-handed use. To use the exchangeable magazine release feature, fourth-generation Glock magazines have a notch cut {{on both sides of the}} magazine body. Earlier versions of the magazines will not lock into the Gen4 pistols if the user has moved the magazine release button to be operated by a left-handed user. Gen4 magazines will work in older models.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} recent Heckler & Koch pistol designs, the P2000 is modular to suit {{individual}} needs. For instance, the grip is modular with exchangeable <b>backstraps,</b> allowing {{the user to}} customize the pistol's grip size and feel. There is a universal accessory rail built into the dust cover {{in front of the}} trigger guard that allows for the use of tactical lights, laser pointers and other accessories. This is in contrast with the USP series which uses a proprietary H&K mounting rail that limits the types of accessories that could be used with the pistol.|$|R
2500|$|At the 2010 SHOT Show, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fourth generation", now dubbed [...] "Gen4" [...] by Glock itself. [...] Updates centered on ergonomics and the recoil spring assembly. Some parts of fourth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The initial two fourth-generation models announced were the full-sized Glock 17 and Glock 22, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum and [...]40 S cartridges, respectively. The pistols were displayed with a modified rough-textured frame, grip checkering, and interchangeable <b>backstraps</b> of different sizes. [...] "Gen4" [...] is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth-generation pistols.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} weapons copied their naval {{equivalents}} and will have similar designs. Maritime cutlasses will have corrugated/ribbed iron grips and sheet-metal guards over the hilt. Boarding pikes will have leaf-shaped or 4-sided spiked points, although the private purchase items may be cruder and lack the long <b>backstraps</b> found on some pikes of the naval type. Nautical motifs can sometimes help to identify sea service use, such as an anchor design, etchings of sea shells, dolphins, ships, etc. Likewise, sea items were frequently blackened/japanned to protect their iron parts from the rusting effect of salt air. A hanger sword with a black-painted guard is probably the real deal.|$|R
