40|$|This paper {{compares the}} DC breaker {{requirements}} for different DC <b>breaker</b> <b>protection</b> schemes for high voltage direct current (HVDC) grids. DC breakers {{are essential for}} DC grid protection as they can provide a selective and fast protection. The DC breakers experience challenging operation conditions which results in an increased cost to meet the breaker requirements. The breaker requirements are strongly determined by the employed protection system. As such, the solution of breaker and protection system is strongly linked. A solution to reduce the requirements is by choosing the best suited protection method concerning the breaker requirements. In this paper, two proposed protection methods and their breaker requirement are explained and compared. The first protection method is a full selective DC protection (FSP) similar to AC protection. A second option, referred to as open grid protection (OGP), is by opening each breaker independently {{in case of a}} fault. The reduction potential of the dissipated energy requirement of the DC breaker of both protection schemes is simulated by applying a pole-to-ground DC fault in a four-terminal network with modular multi-level converters. The required energy for the different protection schemes is investigated for different current ratings and switching times. All studies have been performed using PSCAD/EMTDC. From the advantages and drawbacks of these two protection schemes, a new protection method is proposed. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|To {{ensure a}} {{reliable}} fault clearing, a backup protection scheme {{is required for}} selective HVDC grid protection. One way to achieve this is to use both voltage and current measurements to distinguish uncleared faults from cleared ones during the fault clearing process of the primary protection. This paper studies the applicability of such a backup protection algorithm in meshed bipolar HVDC grids and evaluates the robustness of the algorithm against system operating conditions and breaker opening delays.

Automatic re-closure was employed with line protection, and the timer setting was 700  ms. <b>Breaker</b> failure <b>protection,</b> dead-zone protection, over-current protection and current measurement of each branch were implemented in the bay units, while busbar differential protection was completed in the center unit.|$|R
30|$|Conventional {{protective}} relays cannot cover the whole power supply configuration {{because of the}} combined effect of economy and technology on the configuration of current transformer (CT) used {{in the design and}} construction of the power grid. A fault occurring between a circuit-breaker and the CTs cannot be eliminated by busbar protection. Similarly, the fault also cannot be isolated by <b>breaker</b> failure <b>protection</b> rapidly because of the time delay involved. As a supplementary form of protection, dead-zone protection can be installed to isolate faults quickly to avoid affecting the operation of the segments of the power system grid that are 220  kV and above [1, 2].|$|R

The RIBP acquires every CS’s available data through wide area communication network to analyze regional comprehensive information.
