Not-for-profit funds allocate more of their portfolios to illiquid assets, on average, than <b>retail</b> <b>funds.</b> Their allocations reflect fund size, net cash inflows and member age — factors relevant to a fund’s liquidity requirements. Furthermore, the allocations reflect {{the extent of the}} fund’s in-house investment management. In contrast, there is no clear relationship between these factors and allocations by <b>retail</b> <b>funds.</b> Funds with more illiquid investments experience investment returns that are commensurate with the non-diversifiable risk these assets contribute to their overall portfolios...|$|R

40|$|Within {{this study}} we propose {{different}} measures to prove the influence of prior <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> performance on fund flows. In contrast to previous literature, our work indicates that investors behave directly and in a selective manner by redeeming their shares of poor performing funds. By using a large data set of 1672 <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> in Germany from March 2008 to April 2010 {{we are able to}} underscore that in general, both the prior performance of funds and the prior net redemptions have a statistically significant influence on outflows of funds. Moreover, it seems likely that investors react faster to market signals by withdrawing their shares in crisis situations than in previous decades that might be due to lower cost of information. Our findings can serve as a warning signal for policy-makers, regulatory authorities and the fund industry to establish a strong regulatory framework to prevent liquidity shortages of <b>retail</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|R

30|$|During {{the last}} two decades the area of {{socially}} responsible investments (SRI) has grown substantially. Between 1995 and 2012 SRI assets in the US rose more than 480  % to $ 3.74 trillion in 2012 (Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (2013)). The German market grew about 9  % with respect to 2012 values. In 2013 it is estimated to have a value of € 79.9 billion (FNG (2014)). One possibility for private investors to participate in the SRI market is to invest in socially responsible (SR) funds. According to the FNG (2014), € 12.7 billion are invested in roughly 300 SR <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> that are available in Germany. Currently, this corresponds to 1.8  % of the total volume of the German mutual <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> market. Therefore, it has great potential to grow strongly in the following years, especially when Germany is compared to The Netherlands, the European frontrunner, where SR <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> amount almost to a total of 15.4  % of the volume of the Dutch mutual <b>retail</b> <b>fund</b> market (see Vigeo Rating (2013)). SR funds in Germany mostly practice negative screening and/or follow a best in class investment approach (see FNG (2014)). When the performance of SR and conventional <b>retail</b> <b>funds</b> domiciled in Germany are compared, no significant underperformance of SR funds can be found (Cortez et al. 2009, 2012; Renneboog et al. 2008; Kreander et al. 2005; Bauer et al. 2005; Schröder 2004; Kreander et al. 2002)). Globally, there are more than 100 studies concerning the performance of SR funds (e.g., Chegut et al. 2011; Rathner 2013; von Wallis and Klein 2014). Capelle-Blancard and Monjon (2012) point out that “maybe too much {{attention has been paid to}} this issue”. Therefore, we want to add to the “few studies [which] examine the aspirations of SRI investors”.|$|R
