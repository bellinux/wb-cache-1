25|$|Giant {{elongate}} drifts form {{very large}} mounded elongated geometries {{parallel to the}} deepwater bottom-current flow. They are characterized by a near complete lack of parallel bedding. Mounded drifts are often bounded on one or both sides by non-depositional or erosional channels, sometimes known as moats. These drifts can be “tens to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and range from 0.1 to more than 1 km in relief above the surrounding seafloor”. Their length to width ratio ranges from 2:1 to 10:1. They can accumulate to thicknesses greater than 2km and can form anywhere from the upper slope to the deepest parts of the basin depending on the specific location of the bottom-current. Sedimentation rates range from 20 – 100 m/Ma. They tend to be finer-grained {{with a lot of}} mud, silt and <b>biogenic</b> <b>material.</b> Coarse-grained contourites are very rare. They may also form detached or separated versions due to seafloor topography and flow conditions. Detached drifts are isolated and migrate downslope while separated drifts typically are asymmetric in shape, tend to form {{at the base of a}} slope and migrate up-slope.

50|$|Hemipelagic {{sediment}}, or hemipelagite, {{is a type}} {{of marine}} sediment that consists of fine-grained biogenic and terrigenous material.

50|$|Catagenesis is {{the second}} stage of {{maturation}} of organic carbon on the path to becoming graphitic. This geologic process accounts for very significant changes in the biogenic materials that make up the carbonaceous sediment. During catagenesis the temperature increases, the pressure increases, and both organic and inorganic constituents “adjust” their phase or form to compensate. The process of “lithification” begins during this stage. Generally speaking a rise in temperature results in the volatization of unstable species or elements that are weakly attached to carbon atoms. Increased temperature and pressure also result in the cessation of biogenic processes. One way to express these changes {{is to look at the}} ratio of oxygen to carbon, or hydrogen to carbon as the sediment matures. In almost all cases as <b>biogenic</b> <b>material</b> matures in a geologic environment the volatile elements such as oxygen and hydrogen are significantly reduced, resulting in a reduction in the O/C and H/C ratios. A typical O/C ratio value for a fully matured, catagenesis stage carbon might be less than 0.1. This means that for every 100 carbon atoms there are less than 10 oxygen atoms. Similar reductions in the level of hydrogen are also apparent.|$|E

30|$|In 2014, a {{sediment}} trap mooring was deployed {{adjacent to}} station Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO)’s National Ocean and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) surface mooring. These data, from July 2014 to July 2016, are used here to investigate nutrient supply mechanisms that support ocean productivity in this oligotrophic {{region of the}} subtropical western North Pacific. Both years of sediment trap data show that <b>biogenic</b> <b>material</b> fluxes at ~[*] 5000  m increased between late winter (March) and late spring (June). Based on sea surface temperature and upper ocean water temperature profiles, from the NOAA surface buoy, and satellite-based surface chlorophyll-a, this increase was likely due to an increase of ocean productivity in early spring (March) that was supported by nutrients supplied by winter mixing. On the other hand, <b>biogenic</b> <b>material</b> fluxes also increased in October 2014, and between late December 2014 and January 2015 when concentrations of nutrients near the surface typically are low. Sea surface height anomalies and vertical profiles of water temperature in the upper 500  m showed cyclonic eddies passing station KEO and causing upwelling in late July–early August 2014 and November 2014. It appears that these events supplied nutrients to the upper layer, which then caused ocean productivity in the subsurface layer to temporally increase, resulting in increased deep <b>biogenic</b> <b>material</b> fluxes in autumn and winter. This interpretation of the data {{is consistent with a}} simple 3 D physical-biological model simulation that shows meso-scale cyclonic eddies can supply nutrient to support new production at KEO. During the 2 -year-long sediment trap deployments, several typhoons also passed near station KEO and near-inertial internal waves were observed near the nitracline depth after the typhoons passed. Although turbulent mixing caused by near-inertial internal wave could have possibly supplied nutrient to upper oligotrophic euphotic layer, numerical simulations of the turbulent nutrient supply indicate that enhanced turbulent diffusion across the nutrient concentration gradient did not supply enough nitrate to support the increase in <b>biogenic</b> <b>material</b> flux in autumn.|$|E

40|$|Geochemical {{records are}} {{presented}} for five sediment cores from basins on the continental shelf of Mac. Robertson Land, East Antarctica. The cores contain 2 - 4 m thick sequences of hemipelagic, siliceous mud and ooze (SMO) deposited under seasonally open marine conditions. The inner and middle shelf SMO sequences are massive dark olive green material, whereas the outer shelf SMO sequences are dark olive material interspersed with light olive green layers ~ 1 - 10 cm thick. The <b>biogenic</b> <b>material</b> {{is dominated by}} marine diatoms including Fragilariopsis curta, Fragilariopsis cylindrus, and Chaetoceros spp. in the dark-colored SMO and Corethron criophilum in the light-colored layers. Radiocarbon dates suggest that the cores provide continuous accumulation records extending from < 1 kyr before present (B. P.) {{back as far as}} 4 - 15 kyr B. P., with estimated accumulation rates of 0. 07 - 5 mm/yr.

40|$|Abstract Several {{biogeochemical}} {{data have}} been collected in the last 10 years of Italian activity in Antarctica (ABIOCLEAR, ROSSMIZE, BIOSESO-I/II). A comprehensive 1 -D biogeochemical model was implemented {{as a tool to}} link observations with processes and to investigate the mechanisms that regulate the flux of <b>biogenic</b> <b>material</b> through the water column. The model is ideally located at station B (175 ^{o}E - 74 ^{o}S) and was set up to reproduce the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton and organic matter fluxes as forced by the dominant water column physics over the period 1990 - 2001. Austral spring-summer bloom conditions are assessed by comparing simulated nutrient drawdown, primary production rates, bacterial respiration and biomass with the available observations. The simulated biogenic fluxes of carbon, nitrogen and silica have been compared with the fluxes derived from sediment traps data. The model reproduces quite well the magnitude of the biogenic fluxes, expecially those observed in the bottom sediment trap, but the peaks are delayed in time. Sensitivity experiments have shown that the characterization of detritus, the choice of the sinking velocity and the degradation rates are crucial for the timing and magnitude of the vertical fluxes. An increase of velocity leads to a shift towards observation but also to an overestimation of the deposition flux which can be counteracted by higher bacterial remineralization rates. Model results suggest that observed fluxes could be explained by the size-distribution and quality of the locally-produced <b>biogenic</b> <b>material.</b> It is hypothesized that the bottom sediment trap collects material originated from rapid sinking of particles and also from previous years production periods, likely modulated by advective and aggregation mechanisms which are still not resolved by the model...|$|E
