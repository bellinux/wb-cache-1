5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones {{have proposed that}} cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation. Cultivating the plant would most likely require good water drainage, a sunny or part-shaded position and acidic soil.

Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> in cultivation.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Ramayana by Valmiki, Trijata {{is described as}} an aged rakshasi (demoness) who is prominently featured in two incidents. The first {{takes place in the}} Sundara Kanda, the epic's fifth book. The kidnapped princess Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika of Lanka. The demon-king of Lanka, Ravana has ordered the raskshasis who guard Sita to convince her to marry him <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> possible, since Sita adamantly refuses and is still faithful to her husband Rama. After Ravana leaves, the rakshasis start to harass Sita to compel her to change her will. The aged Trijata intervenes and narrates a prophetic dream that predicts Ravana's doom and Rama's victory.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although {{the result was a}} defeat, it was not <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E

5|$|Adam Cleveland at IGN called Revelations: The Demon Slayer a fun but not {{innovative}} game. The American game magazine Nintendo Power did however find it innovative; for instance, they {{cited the}} automatic battle option. Cleveland disliked the monster conversation system, which he found irritating; {{he said that}} players never know what answer they should give a monster, and that the questions the monsters ask feel monotone due to how often they are repeated. Writers for the Japanese game magazine Famitsu thought the monster fusion system was fun. In their review of Last Bible III, they commented on how different the game is from the Megami Tensei series, and instead compared it to Final Fantasy. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove wrote for Hardcore Gaming 101 that while The Demon Slayer was not <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> an outstanding game, {{it was one of}} few competent role-playing games on Game Boy. They found Last Bible III to be the best game in the series.|$|E
5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.|$|E
5|$|Raynor {{returns in}} , having earned {{the trust of}} the Protoss and befriended the templar warrior Fenix. The Raiders and Fenix's forces remain on Aiur as a rearguard while the {{surviving}} Protoss evacuate their homeworld, now devastated and overrun by the Zerg, for the dark templar world of Shakuras. Raynor is later contacted by Kerrigan, who convinces them to join with her against the United Earth Directorate (UED), which has arrived to pacify the sector <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> necessary. Raynor and Fenix reluctantly prevent Mengsk's capture by the UED, and with Kerrigan's Zerg rout the UED from the Dominion throne world of Korhal. However, Kerrigan turns on her allies, launching a surprise attack against both the Dominion and the Raiders. Although the Hyperion escapes the planet, Fenix is killed in the attack; an outraged Raynor vows that Kerrigan will die by his hands.|$|E

5|$|The Germans swiftly mobilised {{to expel}} the Allied forces and {{launched}} heavy air assaults on Kos and Leros. Without fighter support, the islands' defence was soon precarious; the LRDG {{and the rest}} of the troops on Kalymnos were withdrawn to Leros on 4 October after the Germans won the Battle of Kos. German air assaults on Leros intensified during late October, and at dawn on 12 November 1943 the Germans attacked Leros by sea and air. During the ensuing Battle of Leros, the LRDG Rhodesians at Point 320, commanded by Rhodesian Captain JR Olivey, spiked their position's guns and withdrew before counter-attacking and retaking the point the next day. They held that position for three more days, during which they learned that the Germans were winning the battle. On 16 November, Olivey decided that holding the point any longer was pointless and ordered his men to split up, escape <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> possible and re-assemble in Cairo.

5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said {{that if it was}} not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the NRA {{captured}} Kampala with a {{force of}} 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president, he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, {{with the goal of}} allowing the refugees to return home. In addition to fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention, it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> possible. In 1988, a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing Peter Bayingana as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, with Kagame assuming the vice-presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice-president, but resented the loss of the leadership.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the {{darkness}} of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven remaining boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> which they could find”. Waring had torn up {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E
