Such slip gates were built {{with a series of}} downward facing 'L'-shaped grooves {{on one side and a}} matching concavity on the other gatepost. Wood bars could then be inserted across and parallel, giving a gate without a hinge. These are sometimes still found in the countryside at large, but they are almost always adapted to carry metal hinged gates. In some areas wood rather than stone was used to construct this type of hinge-less gatepost.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plug and}} {{socket-outlet}} system defined in BS1363 {{is a result of}} one of the report's recommendations. [...] Britain had previously used a combination of 2A, 5A and 15A round pin sockets. [...] In an appendix to the main report (July 1944), the committee proposed that a completely new socket-outlet and fused plug should be adopted as the [...] "all-purpose" [...] domestic standard. [...] The main report listed 8 points to consider in deciding the design of the new standard. The first of these was stated as “To ensure the safety of young children it is of considerable importance that the contacts of the socket-outlet should be protected by shutters or other like means, or by the inherent design of the socket-outlet.” [...] Others included flush fitting, no need for a switch, requirements for terminals, <b>bottom</b> <b>entry</b> for the cable, and contact design. [...] The appendix added 5 further [...] "points of technical detail" [...] including requirements that plugs could not be inserted incorrectly, should be easy to withdraw, and should include a fuse.|$|E

5000|$|Originally {{there was}} no {{convention}} as to {{the direction of the}} Earth pin. Often it was facing upwards, as socket-outlets in China now do but it could also be downwards or horizontal, in either direction. [...] The pin orientation was codified in the 1950s with the Earth pin required to face downwards, so that the longer Earth pin will be the last to lose contact if the inserted plug is tugged downwards. If products destined for the Chinese market are exported, the <b>bottom</b> <b>entry</b> plug becomes a top entry plug, and the customer will often take advantage of the situation by suspending the power cord upwards.|$|E

30|$|In validating {{our results}} with two {{additional}} MD simulations using Na+ as counterion named sim-Na 1 and sim-Na 2, the binding processes of G-quadruplex and Na+ shown in Fig. S 1 confirmed our findings {{in that the}} binding processes of Na+ and K+ are similar, and binding of Na+ and K+ produces comparable effects on G-quadruplex conformations (Figs. S 2 and S 3).

40|$|The {{academic}} {{study of}} motorcycle racing represents {{a relatively new}} area of research. While numerous {{studies have been conducted}} on motorcycle gangs, no studies have investigated the serious leisure world of the motorcycle racer, a sport in which motorcyclists may reach speeds in excess of 200 km/hour, with accidents likely to result in serious injury or death. A small sample of eight motorcycle road racers who, {{at the time of this}} research, were competing at the national level of the sport in Australia were interviewed by telephone with the conversations recorded for transcription and content analysis. An exploratory qualitative research design underpinned by grounded theory and involving the use of an interview schedule composed of open-structured interviews gave each rider the freedom to outline their own understandings and interpretations of how they engaged in their chosen sport. Common themes that emerged from their personal stories included a discussion of what one racer referred to as a ‘‘rider hierarchy’’ within the motorcycle road racing fraternity, which recognised different skills and experience levels among riders. The novice rider was placed at the <b>bottom,</b> <b>entry</b> level with the factory rider at the top. After analysis of the study data, a model was developed to describe the rider hierarchy as it was perceived by the study respondents...|$|E
