30|$|For {{the other}} three months i.e. April, July and October, the results plotted in graphs (Fig.  8 b–d) show a {{positive}} correlation between increase in temperature and decrease in snow cover. Maximum changes have <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the month of October. For the month of April, minimum snow cover <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2004 (56, 236  km 2) and maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2002 (114, 588  km 2). For July, the minimum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2007 (7881  km 2) and the maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2003 (25, 851  km 2). Again, for the month of October, the minimum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2007 (12, 347  km 2) and the maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2002 (84, 551  km 2). In case of temperature, the minimum in the month of April <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2006 (− 3.81  °C) and maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2007 (0.81  °C). In case of July, the minimum and maximum temperatures <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 2004 (7.20  °C) and 2006 (8.85  °C), respectively. On the other hand, for the month of October, the minimum temperature <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2002 (− 0.67  °C) and maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2011 (1.43  °C). Apart from the role of temperature, other factors should also be taken into account to explain the reason behind the difference in snow melt trend of the other 2  months from that of January. For example, if the snow is older, its albedo will be lower and in such situation it absorbs more solar radiation. Again, if the temperature variation is not significant, snow melts faster in the windy condition than in the calm conditions. However, temperature being a dominant factor, this study evaluated the impact of increase in temperature on the snow cover.|$|R

5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to <b>be</b> <b>observed.</b> <b>In</b> many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680.

5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to <b>be</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens {{typically}} live 6 {{times longer than}} the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
