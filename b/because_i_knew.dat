500|$|From the outset, Euston {{intended}} to create {{two versions of}} the story; a four-part serial for broadcast on UK television and a 100-minute film, The Quatermass Conclusion, for distribution abroad. While writing the scripts, Kneale was [...] "careful not to pad, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that was the obvious thing, but to write in material which can be removed". There is one major deviation between the two versions; in the film version, the scene where Quatermass, separated from Annie Morgan while transporting Isabel to London, encounters a band of elderly people living in a scrapyard is completely absent; this meant that {{two versions of the}} hospital scene where Isabel dies were shot—one with Quatermass present (the film version) and one without (the television version). There was little interest among film distributors in The Quatermass Conclusion, and it received only a limited theatrical release.|$|E

500|$|In her 2014 biography, Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs {{argues that}} it is {{unlikely}} that Solanas appeared at the Chelsea Hotel looking for Girodias. Fahs states that Girodias may have fabricated the account in order to boost sales of the SCUM Manifesto, which he had published. Fahs states that [...] "the more likely story ... places Valerie at the Actor's Studio at 432 West Forty-Fourth Street early that morning." [...] Actress Sylvia Miles states that Solanas appeared at the Actor's Studio looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Miles said that Solanas [...] "had a different look, a bit tousled, like somebody whose appearance is the last thing on her mind." [...] Miles told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon. Miles said that she accepted a copy of the play from Solanas and then [...] "... shut the door <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she was trouble.

500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s.

500|$|While officially {{the matter}} was {{considered}} closed, many individual MPs had doubts, although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage. Wigg later said that he left the House that morning [...] "with black rage in my heart <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what the facts were. I knew the truth." [...] Most newspapers were editorially non-committal; only The Guardian, under the headline [...] "Mr Profumo clears the air", stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value. Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re-emergence of Keeler, in Madrid. She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused, adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent {{and that she had}} many friends in important positions. She claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date. She was required to forfeit her recognizance of £40, but no other action was taken against her.|$|E
500|$|Higgins {{started writing}} tracks for her second album {{as soon as}} she had {{finished}} recording The Sound of White, which was released in 2004. She said, [...] "I started quite early <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there would a lot of pressure for the second album and I didn't want to write songs under anyone's stopwatch." [...] "100 Round the Bends" [...] was written while she was still recording the first album. During 2006, Higgins spent six months living in Broome, Western Australia, away from the distractions of the entertainment industry. Here she was able to relax and focus on creating new material for her next album. The landscape around Broome inspired the lyrics for [...] "Going North". She said, [...] "It was the first place I'd ever felt honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country". The lyrics for [...] "Steer" [...] were inspired when Higgins looked up at the night sky on a Broome beach: [...] "It dawned on me how small we are, how short life is ... I felt so liberated to have finally figured that out." ...|$|E
500|$|Brownlee was {{the only}} lawyer in a {{government}} composed primarily of farmers, {{and the rest of}} the cabinet drew heavily on his expertise. Its reliance on him extended beyond legal issues to such matters as how to write a business letter. Greenfield was among the most dependent, and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorney-general for a draft response; Greenfield often signed the draft and sent it out unchanged. [...] The premier eventually relied on Brownlee so heavily that Brownlee set the agenda for cabinet meetings. [...] The government also relied on Brownlee in the legislature, where it found itself under relentless attack from the John R. Boyle-led Liberals. [...] Brownlee had the widest debating experience of the UFA members, and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks. [...] His maiden speech was typical of him: [...] "I came into this House with considerable trepidation, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that sitting opposite would be the former giants of this House, men with ability, experience, and skill.

500|$|The {{military}} films generated {{only enough}} revenue to cover costs, and the feature film Bambiwhich {{had been in}} production since 1937underperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office. On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio and Fantasia, the company had debts of $4million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss {{the future of the}} company, the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told his executives, [...] "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> we were lending them money far above the financial risk.... They're good this year, they're good next year, and they're good the year after.... You have to relax and give them time to market their product." [...] Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E
500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet.

500|$|In February 2010, Robyn {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with Swedish magazine [...] that she would release three albums during 2010. She noted that it had been five years since she released her last effort, Robyn (2005), and that she had not been in the studio [...] "properly" [...] since then. She explained that {{she did not want to}} wait until all the songs had been recorded; she rather wanted to split up the songs in three different releases. She chose to name the trilogy Body Talk after a gay club in London that a friend of hers owns, commenting that the title [...] "tickles [...] imagination". In June 2010, the first in the trilogy, Body Talk Pt. 1, was released, and was quickly followed by the announcement of Body Talk Pt. 2. The album's lead single, [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and the track [...] "Indestructible", were among the first songs to be recorded for the trilogy. Robyn said that [...] "we saved them for later <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> they would be singles, or could be singles, and I wanted them to get that chance." [...] "Hang with Me" [...] was originally recorded in 2002, by Klas Åhlund's then-wife, Paola Bruna, for her album Stockcity Girl.|$|E
500|$|While von Stauffenberg {{listens to}} Richard Wagner's [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] in the film, {{in reality the}} colonel hated Wagner. In addition, von Stauffenberg's elder brother Berthold was also omitted from the film. Bryan Singer {{purposely}} left out some of von Stauffenberg's [...] "macho" [...] moments in writing the character, such as the colonel's refusal of morphine to avoid addiction. He explained the removals, [...] "There were things I actually left out <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> people would think we were making them up ... imagine Tom Cruise saying 'No morphine!' People would think it's a contrivance." [...] In the film, von Haeften steps {{out in front of}} von Stauffenberg when he faces the firing squad, but when filmmakers attempted to reconstruct the scene based on eyewitness testimony and photographs, they discovered that the shots that killed von Haeften would also have killed von Stauffenberg, who was actually shot shortly after. Another alteration was to the portrayal of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, played in the film by Kevin McNally. Goerdeler was written in the film to be antagonistic, dramatically representing the friction and conflict that existed within the conspiracy, though filmmakers considered him a [...] "much more moral character" [...] in reality.|$|E
500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting.

The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
