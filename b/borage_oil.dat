40|$|Borage (Borago officinalis L.) {{seed oil}} {{has been used}} as a {{treatment}} for various degenerative diseases. Many useful properties of this oil are attributed to its high gamma linolenic acid content (GLA, 18 : 3 v- 6). The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the safety and suitability of the use of <b>borage</b> seed <b>oil,</b> along with one of its active components, GLA, with respect to DNA integrity, and to establish possible in vivo toxic and in vitro cytotoxic effects. In order to measure these properties, five types of assays were carried out: toxicity, genotoxicity, antigenotoxicity, cytotoxicity (using the promyelocytic leukaemia HL 60 cell line), and life span (in vivo analysis using the Drosophila model). Results showed that i) <b>Borage</b> seed <b>oil</b> is not toxic to D. melanogaster at physiological concentrations below 125 ml/ml and the studies on GLA indicated non-toxicity at the lowest concentration analyzed ii) <b>Borage</b> seed <b>oil</b> and GLA are DNA safe (non-genotoxic) and antimutagenic compared to hydrogen peroxide, thereby confirming its antioxidant capacity; iii) <b>Borage</b> seed <b>oil</b> and GLA exhibited cytotoxic activity in low doses (IC 50 of 1 ml/ml and 0. 087 mM, respectively) iv) Low doses of <b>borage</b> seed <b>oil</b> (0. 19 %) increased the health span of D. melanogaster; and v) GLA significantly decreased the life span of D. melanogaster. Based on the antimutagenic and cytotoxic effects along with the ability to increase the health span, we propose supplementation with <b>borage</b> seed <b>oil</b> rather than GLA, because it protects DNA by modulating oxidative geneti...|$|R

50|$|In the {{inflammatory}} response, {{two other}} groups of dietary essential fatty acids form cascades that parallel and compete with the arachidonic acid cascade. EPA (20:5 &omega;-3) provides the most important competing cascade. It is ingested from oily fish, and algae oil or derived from dietary alpha-linolenic acid found in, for instance, walnuts, hemp oil and flax oil. DGLA (20:3 &omega;-6) provides a third, less prominent cascade. It derives from dietary GLA (18:3 &omega;-6) found in, e.g. <b>borage</b> <b>oil.</b> These two parallel cascades soften the inflammatory promoting effects of certain eicosanoids made from AA. Low dietary intake of these less inflammatory promoting essential fatty acids, especially the ω-3s, is correlated {{with a variety of}} inflammation-related diseases.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} proportions of <b>borage</b> <b>oil</b> on the in vitro transcutaneous delivery of tamoxifen were studied, {{with the aim}} of developing a gel capable of the simultaneous delivery of tamoxifen and γ linolenic acid across (breast) skin. Supplementary work probed 1 H NMR spectral data for tamoxifen in the presence of different proportions of polyunsaturated or unsaturated fatty acids. Typical, non-aqueous gels were modified to contain 1 % tamoxifen and three levels of <b>borage</b> <b>oil</b> (∼ 25 % γ linolenic acid) and the transcutaneous delivery of both tamoxifen and GLA across full thickness skin determined in vitro. Both tamoxifen and γ linolenic acid permeated the skin with the ratio of moles being consistent at approximately 4 : 1. This was irrespective of time, amount of <b>borage</b> <b>oil</b> contained in the formulation (above a minimum) and the presence of other (unsaturated) excipients: mineral oil, Miglyiol 810 N, white soft paraffin, PEG 400 and Cabosil M 5. Dose-dependent downfield shifts of tamoxifen aromatic protons were observed in the presence of <b>borage</b> <b>oil</b> and linolenic acid (γ and α), but not saturated triacyl glycerol. The permeation data suggested vehicular complexation between tamoxifen and polyunsaturated constituents of <b>borage</b> <b>oil</b> and that such complexes permeated the skin intact. The 1 H NMR data supported the hypothesis that such complexation was a consequence of preferential π–π orbital interactions between the phenyl groups of tamoxifen and the multiple double bonds of GLA. The mechanism for the permeation of intact complexes across skin remains to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|A key {{objective}} of the work underlying this thesis was to characterise <b>borage</b> <b>oil</b> for use in pharmaceutical applications and health products. This involves quantitative and qualitative determination of sterols, fatty acids and pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are important indicators of its purity, activity and toxicity, respectively. Another objective was to develop analytical methods for quantitative and qualitative determination of sterols, fatty acids and pyrrolizidine alkaloids, with a special emphasis on developing reliable and robust methods for use on a routine basis. Interest in <b>borage</b> <b>oil</b> is mainly due to its high content of the polyunsaturated fatty acid, gamma linolenic acid, which might affect various medical disorders as a precursor to the anti-inflammatory 1 -series prostaglandins.

This study focused on the screening of microbial strains with suitable lipase activity for enrichment of GLA by selective hydrolysis of the <b>borage</b> <b>oil</b> (21. 6 % of GLA/total fatty acids).
