5|$|In 1986, after {{protracted}} negotiations, the recovered {{bills were}} divided equally between Ingram and Northwest Orient's insurer; the FBI retained 14 examples as evidence.

5|$|The Lords {{would only}} be able to delay money bills for one month, {{effectively}} ending their ability to do so. These were defined as any public bill which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof. It did not however, cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures. Some Finance <b>Bills</b> <b>have</b> not fallen within this criterion; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation <b>Bills</b> <b>have.</b> The Speaker of the House of Commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill, endorsing it with a Speaker's certificate. The Local Government Finance Bill 1988, which introduced the Community Charge ("Poll Tax"), was not certified as a Money Bill and was therefore considered by the Lords. Whilst Finance Bills are not considered Money Bills, convention dictates that those parts of a Finance Bill dealing with taxation or expenditure (which, if in an Act alone, would constitute a Money Bill) are not questioned.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{some members}} of Congress were taking action to {{reschedule}} the drug legislatively. In 1981, the late Rep. Stuart McKinney introduced a bill to transfer cannabis to Schedule II. It was co-sponsored by a bipartisan coalition of 84 House members, including prominent Republicans Newt Gingrich (GA), Bill McCollum (FL), John Porter (IL), and Frank Wolf (VA). After the bill died in committee, Rep. Barney Frank began annually introducing nearly identical legislation.

25|$|Under 2017 American Health Care Act (AHCA) {{legislation}} {{under the}} House and Senate, both versions of proposed Republican <b>bills</b> <b>have</b> proposed cuts to Medicaid funding on differing timelines.

25|$|Though the {{two teams}} are in {{different}} divisions and did not start playing each other until after 1972, match-ups between the Bills and the Cleveland Browns occasionally get heated up due to the proximity and similarity between the cities of Buffalo and Cleveland. Like the Bills-Jets rivalry, the Bills and Browns often share bad luck and have had their share of ugly games. However, {{there have been other}} occasions when both teams have been competitive such as in the 1980s and most recently in 2007 and 2014. The rivalry also gained heat when former Bills safety Donte Whitner was with the Browns. The Browns currently lead the series 12-9, including a playoff win in 1990, though the <b>Bills</b> <b>have</b> outscored the Browns in the series.|$|E
25|$|Between 2004 and 2017, 22 {{same-sex}} marriage related <b>bills</b> <b>have</b> {{been introduced in}} the Parliament of Australia, none of which have passed into law. In December 2013, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) passed legislation which briefly legalised {{same-sex marriage}} within the territory, prompting {{the federal government to}} launch a constitutional challenge in the High Court. The High Court struck down the ACT legislation on the basis that the law was inconsistent with federal legislation, which defines marriage as {{between a man and a}} woman. The current Coalition Government proposed to hold a plebiscite on same-sex marriage in 2017, though this was rejected twice by the Australian Senate, in November 2016 and August 2017. A nationwide voluntary survey by postal mail on same-sex marriage was held between 12 September and 7 November 2017.|$|E
25|$|The Bills rivalry had {{its roots}} {{back to the days}} of the AAFC, when there was a team from Buffalo with the same name in that league. The Browns and AAFC Bills played six games, {{including}} a league championship game, before the Browns were selected to merge into the NFL and the Bills left out. After the current incarnation of the Bills joined the NFL, the Browns and <b>Bills</b> <b>have</b> played each other from time to time. Though the Browns and Bills are in different AFC divisions, a mellow rivalry has since developed between the teams due to the similarities between Buffalo and Cleveland and shared misfortune between the teams. There have been some competitive moments between the Bills and Browns as well, such as a playoff game in 1990 and two games with playoff-implications in 2007 and 2014.|$|E
