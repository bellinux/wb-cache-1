50|$|These {{plants have}} many uses. <b>Broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius) {{used to be}} called butter dock because its large leaves were used to wrap and {{conserve}} butter.|$|E
50|$|The dock leaves contain {{oxalic acid}} and the roots contain tannic acid. <b>Broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> leaves {{have been used}} to soothe burns, blisters, and nettle stings. A tea {{prepared}} from the root was thought to cure boils.|$|E
40|$|Creeping thistles, {{couch grass}} and <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>docks</b> cause {{more and more}} trouble in organic agriculture. In order to keep them at bay, a stubble {{cultivation}} adapted to the soil type and crop rotation needs to be developed. Just after the harvest {{is the best time}} to weaken the root weeds. Nowadays, many different machines are available, such as disc harrows, flat cultivators and skimmers. Each of the three types provides a soil-preserving alternative to the plough. However, which machine is best for which soil and crop rotation? The video helps to answer this question. It shows the functionalities as well as the strengths and weaknesses of different machines that can be used for stubble cultivation. Organic farmers talk about their soil type and their experiences with stubble cultivation and the different machines...|$|R
50|$|Rumex crispus - {{curly dock}} - {{is very similar}} in {{appearance}} but with thinner and wavier leaves. In more detail, the calyx of curly dock has smooth margins while the calyx of <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> has horned margins.|$|E
50|$|In Western Europe, dock {{leaves are}} a {{traditional}} remedy for {{the sting of}} nettles, and suitable larger docks (such as <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> R. obtusifolius or curled dock R. crispus) often grow conveniently in similar habitats to the common nettle (Urtica dioica).|$|E
50|$|Rumex obtusifolius, {{commonly}} known as bitter dock, <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock,</b> bluntleaf dock, dock leaf or butter dock, is a perennial weed in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to Europe but can now {{be found in the}} United States and many other countries around the world such as Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The main {{weaknesses}} of <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> are its poor competition, crowding causes flowering to be delayed {{for up to}} three years, and its susceptibility to disturbance. Frequent tilling will disrupt the roots and kill the older plants and seedlings. The plant also thrives in moist environments and improved drainage can also help control its growth.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> is {{designated}} an [...] "injurious weed" [...] {{under the}} UK Weeds Act 1959. It {{has been an}} invasive species of the Great Lakes region of North America where it was first sighted in 1840. [...] Livestock {{have been known to}} get sick after feeding on it. But eradicating the plants is difficult. The perennial plant can have a deep taproot.Seeds have toothed wing structures, allowing them to be dispersed by wind or water, and also allow them to attach to animals or machinery to be spread great distances. They can lie dormant for years before germination, making vigilant pulling or tilling essential.|$|E
40|$|<b>Broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> is {{a common}} and {{troublesome}} grassland weed with a wide geographic distribution. In conventional farming the weed is normally controlled by using a selective herbicide, but in organic farming manual removal is the best option to control this weed. The objective of our work {{was to develop a}} robot that can navigate a pasture, detect <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock,</b> and remove any weeds found. A prototype robot was constructed that navigates by following a predefined path using centimeter-precision global positioning system (GPS). <b>Broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> is detected using a camera and image processing. Once detected, weeds are destroyed by a cutting device. Tests of aspects of the system showed that path following accuracy is adequate but could be improved through tuning of the controller or adoption of a dynamic vehicle model, that the success rate of weed detection is highest when the grass is short and when the <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> plants are in rosette form, and that 75 % of weeds removed did not grow back. An on-farm field test of the complete system resulted in detection of 124 weeds of 134 encountered (93 %), while a weed removal action was performed eight times without a weed being present. Effective weed control is considered to be achieved when the center of the weeder is positioned within 0. 1 m of the taproot of the weed—this occurred in 73 % of the cases. We conclude that the robot is an effective instrument to detect and control <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> under the conditions encountered on a commercial farm. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

40|$|A {{control method}} for <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius) with hot steam was tested in grasslands in Switzerland. More than 700 plants {{were treated with}} a mixture of hot water and steam at a {{temperature}} of 120 °C and a pressure of 30 bar.

40|$|Abstract Seeds {{of eight}} plant species were fed to four penned goats on three {{separate}} occasions. The faeces were collected over subsequent days, then seeds were recovered and tested for viability. Less than 10 % of the ingested seeds survived {{passage through the}} goats for five of the species, though 32. 3 % of <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius) seeds and 19. 2 % of gorse (Ulex europeaus) seeds were excreted undigested. The percentage of viable seeds ingested that remained viable when excreted ranged from 25. 7 % for <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> to 0. 5 % for variegated thistle (Silybum marianum). A large proportion of recovered seeds was excreted within 24 h of ingestion, and all seeds had passed through the goats within 72 h. Grazing by goats of weed seed-heads is generally seen as beneficial due to large decreases {{in the number of}} viable seeds added to the soil. However, as all species established from intact goat dung, potential exists for dispersal of weeds to new areas, especially by feral goats...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} field trials on {{controlling}} <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius) {{by means of}} microwave technology are presented. Two microwave prototypes of differing output levels {{were used in the}} tests under different site and weather conditions. In general, microwave technology is suitable for causing long-term damage to the roots of dock plants and preventing resprouting. The required length of treatment, and hence the energy to be applied, were revealed as problematic. With increasing heat output, the heating time evidently decreases linearly, which harbours optimisation potential. For an 18 kW-heat-output microwave device, the current required heating time to achieve an 80...|$|E
40|$|The <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius) is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} weed of cultivated grasslands. Since the dock leaf beetle (Gastrophysa viridula) can defoliate docks extensively, if occurring in sufficient high densities, it {{is considered to be}} a potential part of a biocontrol strategy against R. obtusifolius. Our study aimed at investigating the influence of precipitation on the distribution of G. viridula. For that, 635 questionnaires were sent out to organic farmers and surveys were conducted on 39 farms in Lower Austria. The results showed G. viridula preferring regions with sufficient precipitation. These observations confirmed laboratory results reported in literature and should be considered in a concept for the enhancement of dock beetle populations as part of an organic dock regulation strategy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} on an organic dairy farm in Manawatu, New Zealand, to determine how well perennial weeds are controlled during pasture renewal. Changes in weed populations were monitored following three different non-chemical methods of regrassing. Regrassing by planting pasture 4 weeks after ploughing the old pasture (“grass-to-grass”) was compared for spring and autumn cultivation. The third method involved ploughing in spring, growing turnips over summer then regrassing in autumn. All three techniques caused signiicant increases in <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius) and creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens) populations. Although both these species regrew from vegetative organs, it was the establishment of new seedlings following cultivation that appeared to increase populations most. This build-up of dock seedlings occurred more when using a crop than just grass-to-grass systems. A 2 -week fallow after ploughing gave better control of perennial weeds than having no fallow, but a 4 -week fallow gave little further improvement...|$|E
40|$|In organic farming, {{the control}} of <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusi-folius) via hot-water {{treatment}} of the upper root region (hypocotyl) is a new alternative to the current standard control method involving manual digging-out of the roots. This comparative study looks at five different hot-water application techniques. The aim is to optimise the control method in terms of water and energy requirement to obtain a mortality rate of the treated plants of at least 80 %. The studied param-eters were the application, the amount of water, the water tempera-ture, the soil moisture content and the soil type. In total, 813 plants of varying size were treated (120 - 225 plants per treatment). The success of each treatment was rated 12 weeks after it was applied. Based on the results, the preferred treatment in terms of water and energy requirement was a commercially available rotary nozzle. With this noz-zle, for example, at 40 vol. - % soil moisture, 1. 6 L of water at a temper-ature of 90 °C was necessary for successful Rumex control. The rotary nozzle {{could be used as}} a non-contact system, and was therefore the most user-friendly of the application techniques examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (BLD) on nutritive value and {{fermentation}} process of grassland fo­ra­ges was studied {{together with the}} effect of formic acid addition (4. 0 vs. 2. 0 l. t− 1) and inoculation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Herbage of dock exhibits low DM content, crude protein and fibre contents, yet its NEL concentration is low. Despite of the low DM content in BLD silages, the fermentation process was successful, but the si­la­ges show significantly higher contents of lactic acid (176. 5 %), acetic acid (198. 2 [*]%) and lover pH va­lues (4. 24 vs. 4. 39) as compared with than the grass silage. Silages made of dock do not contain bu­ty­ric acid and exhibit low rates of proteolysis (9. 2 [*]% NH 3 from total N). Addition of formic acid shows {{in the group of}} assessed silages significant reduction content of lactic acid (− 6. 5 [*]%) and acetic acid (− 9. 3 [*]%) and significant decrease of pH value (− 0. 05). The use of probiotic preparation leads to significantly higher lactic acid production (+ 39. 3 [*]%) and to lover pH value (− 0. 23) as compare with control without additions...|$|E
40|$|In {{perennial}} grasslands R. obtusifolius (<b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock)</b> {{is often}} surrounded by certain plant species. Thus, it is hypothesized {{for the current}} study that Rumex can affect their neighbouring plant species by allelopathic interactions. To test this hypothesis, {{in a series of}} laboratory and field experiments aqueous extracts of green R. obtusifolius leaves were sprayed on seeds of 14 herbaceous plant species (graminoids, non-leguminuous forbs and leguminuous forbs) commonly native to perennial grasslands and its effects on seed germination compared with those with tap water spraying. An allelopathic effect was defined as inhibitory influence of Rumex extracts on seed germination relative to tap water. Generally, results of the laboratory experiments showed a species-specific susceptibility of grassland species to Rumex extracts; no species was promoted by Rumex extracts. All grasses tested were heavily inhibited by Rumex extracts, herbs and legumes varied from not affected until heavily inhibited. Spraying of Rumex extracts in the field had no effect on germination of these species. The results could be considered in designing seeding mixtures for resowing sward damages to especially contain species not susceptible to Rumex allelopathy (e. g. Trifolium pratense, T. repens, Plantago lanceolata) that would thus be assumed to be more competitive against R. obtusifolius regrowing in these grasslands...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether converting to organic farming increases weed problems, a trial at Massey University in New Zealand split a dairy farm in half, with one half farmed conventionally for 10 {{years and the}} other half farmed using organic principles. Weed populations in selected paddocks of each farmlet were studied for 8 years to determine how these populations would differ between the two systems. After 10 years, weed problems differed little between the two farmlets. Both still had <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius L.) and hairy buttercup (Ranunculus sardous Crantz) as their main weed species. Weeds were most noticeable in pastures in the year following regrassing activities for either farmlet, but being unable to use glyphosate during seed-bed preparation or use selective herbicides after sowing of new swards, meant weeds were sometimes worse in organic pastures after resowing than in conventional pastures. These weed problems were dealt with over the first few years after resowing by good grazing management, and ensuring pastures were dense once the annual species hairy buttercup had flowered and died, thus minimising any further establishment. Re- sults from the trial suggest that weeds need not be an impediment to organic dairying. falseThe full proceedings is available at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} three experiments {{on the control}} of <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock.</b> Experiment 1 : Dock seeds were ensiled in grass silages of different dry matter percentages; 23, 34 and 60 % respectively. All silages showed a decline of seed vitality in time. Grass clover with dock seeds should be ensiled at a low dry matter percentage or remain in the silage bin {{for a longer period}} than 8 weeks. Experiment 2 : In a potassium fertilisation trial on grass clover the development of dock was followed. After two years of potassium fertilisation, the number of dock and the root mass was not significant different between the fertilised and the unfertilised plots. It is concluded that potassium fertilisation at a low potassium status does not positively influence the dock development. Experiment 3 : In a resown grass clover, dock seedlings were cut at three frequencies; 2, 4 and 6 weeks. After 3 months the number of seedlings had decreased the same in all treatments. However the root biomass of the seedlings was significantly affected. It is concluded that frequent cutting has a negative effect on root biomass but should be practised for a longer period than 12 weeks to have an effect on seedling numbers...|$|E
40|$|Labour-intensive manual digging {{with various}} sorts of spades or forks {{is the most}} common {{technique}} to control <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius). Machines for removing roots exist, but are not in use. The process leaves undesired holes in the ground and large quantities of soil have to be removed. An invention for separating the fertile soil from the roots directly in the field and refilling the holes thus created would represent a significant advance. Agroscope Reckenholz-Tänikon ART has developed a separation unit to improve the mechanical weeding process. The separator unit consists of three paired rotary brushes (d = 200 mm,l = 250 mm) and an oscillating sieve (surface: 200 x 500 mm, gaps: 15 x 500 mm). In the summer 2011 a self-propelled unit dug out 174 Rumex obtusifolius plants on grassland on the experimental farm in Tänikon. The cleaned soil was used in situ to refill the holes created. The weight of both the excavated and cleaned soil was recorded. A RTK-GPS device enabled the exact position of plants to be located. Three months after treatment, the treaded places had been evaluated. In 160 cases (92 %) where Rumex plants had been removed at the same positions no plants regrew. The used standard adjustment could separate 55 to 80 % of the total excavation, depend on field condition. Disadvantages are the transport of 1. 2 kg of soil and root material per plant in average and high efforts on machine construction...|$|E
40|$|<b>Broad-leaved</b> <b>dock</b> (Rumex obtusifolius L., Polygonaceae) is an agronomically {{important}} {{perennial weed}} causing decreases in pasture yields and fodder quality. Non-chemical control measures for dock are often limited to frequent pulling and cutting, additionally {{it is usually}} avoided by grazing animals. Here, the regeneration of R. obtusifolius in a Rumex-infested grassland grazed by a sheep breed that explicitly feeds on dock (Ovis aries L. cv. East Prussian Skudden) was compared to cutting. Therefore, regeneration of 90 R. obtusifolius plants of three different size classes was monitored in three plots during three grazing and cutting cycles. Plant height and number of fruit-stands of regrown R. obtusifolius was significantly lower, number of leaves significantly higher after grazing than after cutting, while plant diameter was unaffected. Initially medium and large-sized plants (> 40 cm diameter) were significantly more sensitive to grazing or cutting than initially smaller sized plants. Soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations {{in the vicinity of}} R. obtusifolius correlated with some regrowth parameters but were not affected by grazing or cutting. Sheep-grazed grassland communities comprised fewer legumes (p= 0. 002), more grasses (p= 0. 010) and fewer sward gaps (p= 0. 025) than cut grassland. At the end of the experiment, abundance of R. obtusifolius in sheep grazed plots was lower than in cut plots (p= 0. 089) suggesting that regrowth potential of this weed was depleted by continuous grazing and higher sward density. In conclusion, these data suggest that sheep could be considered in grassland management schemes to both directly and indirectly control Rumex infestations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the economic impacts of summer drought on Swiss grassland production. We combine field trial data from drought experiments {{in three different}} grasslands in Switzerland with site-specific information on economic costs and benefits. The analysis focuses on the economic implications of drought effects on grassland yields as well as grassland composition. In agreement with earlier studies, we found rather heterogeneous yield effects of drought on Swiss grassland systems, with significantly reduced yields {{as a response to}} drought at the lowland and sub-alpine sites, but increased yields at the wetter pre-alpine site. Relative yield losses were highest at the sub-alpine site (with annual yield losses of up to 37 %). However, because income from grassland production at extensive sites relies to a large extent on ecological direct payments, even large yield losses had only limited implications in terms of relative profit reductions. In contrast, negative drought impacts at the most productive, intensively managed lowland site were dominant, with average annual drought-induced profit margin reductions of about 28 %. This is furthermore emphasized if analyzing the farm level perspective of drought impacts. Combining site-specific effects at the farm level, we found that in particular farms with high shares of lowland grassland sites suffer from summer droughts in terms of farm-level fodder production and profit margins. Moreover, our results showed that the higher competitiveness of weeds (<b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock)</b> under drought conditions will require increasing attention on weed control measures in future grassland production systems. Taking into account that the risk of drought occurrence is expected to increase in the coming years, additional instruments to cope with drought risks in fodder production and finally farmers’ income have to be developed...|$|E

V poskusu smo proučevali kalivost svežega semena, kalivost semena, namočenega v prašičjo in govejo gnojevko po 2., 4. in 19. tednih, ter kalivost semena, najprej namočenega v vampni sok in nato še v gnojevki. Kalilne poskuse smo izvajali v kalilni omari, v petrijevkah, v katere smo namestili tri slojni filtrirni papir in prilili 25 ml deionizirane vode. V vsako petrijevko smo položili 30 semen topolistne kislice vsakega obravnavanja, v štirih ponovitvah. Po potrebi smo semenom v petrijevkah tekom trajanja poskusa dodali deionizirano vodo. Ugotavljamo, da se z daljšanjem časa izpostavljenosti semena gnojevkam manjša delež kalivosti, da kombinacija namočenosti semena v vampnem soku in nato še v gnojevki značilno zmanjša življenjsko sposobnost semena topolistne kislice.

Germination trials were performed in a growth chamber, in a Petri dish. Three layers of filter paper were applied to them and 25 ml of deionized water was added. In each Petri dish, we placed 30 seeds of broad -leaved dock of each treatment in four repetitions. If necessary, deionized water {{was added to the}} seeds in the Petri dishes during the experiment.

40|$|Eucolaspis Sharp 1886 {{includes}} {{a group of}} native beetle species, {{one or more of}} which infest exotic fruit crops. Economic losses suffered by organic apple orchards in Hawke’s Bay prompt a revisit to ecological basics of the beetle. Taxonomic, behavioural and ecological knowledge gaps are addressed in the current research project. Phylogenetic analysis, based on cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 region of mitochondrial DNA, revealed that only one genetic lineage infests apples in Hawke’s Bay and that there are only three putative species in mainland New Zealand with another separate species on Three Kings Islands. These findings are well supported by differences in male genitalia shape. Morphometric analyses also supported the phylogeny to some extent. The current findings on host location show that Eucolaspis sp. “Hawke’s Bay” beetles use plant odours to detect and discriminate host and non-host plants. The beetles were attracted to fresh leaf / fruit odour of apple and blackberry, but not to either clover or <b>broad-leaved</b> <b>dock.</b> The beetles were not able to distinguish between damaged and undamaged host plants and between closely related species of host plants just by olfaction. Irrespective of the geographical origin and ancestral host plant, beetles preferred to feed on blackberry over apple. Emergence sex ratio in Eucolaspis sp. “Hawke’s Bay” is found to be female-biased (0. 35), whereas adult sex ratio in the active population on foliage was slightly male-biased (0. 55) in organic apple orchards in Hawke’s Bay. No evidence for a short-range sex pheromone was found through olfactometer bioassays. All the mating attempts in mating bioassays proceeded only after either antennal contact or licking of female’s elytra by the male. Ablating antennae didn’t impair mating, but significant delay was observed in locating the female. Males attempted to mate with intact and washed female cadavers, 45 % and 35 % respectively of the tested males, whereas no mating attempts were initiated towards male cadavers. Males of Eucolaspis sp. “Hawke’s Bay” appear to utilize both contact sex pheromones and vision in locating potential female mates. It was found in the current study that endogeic macro-invertebrates were more abundant in orchards that historically had high bronze beetle incidence, whereas epigeic macro-invertebrates were more abundant in orchards that had historically low bronze beetle incidence. It may be that abundant surface-dwelling generalist predators in low bronze beetle orchards control bronze beetle from establishing in these orchards. However, this could only be confirmed by further research on specific predation of spiders and other generalist predators on bronze beetle. A phenology model for adult emergence is proposed based on threshold temperature (4. 69 ± 0. 89 0 C), degree-days (237 ± 22 0 C days) and biofix date of September 11 th.
