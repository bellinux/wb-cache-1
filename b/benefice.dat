5|$|Hugh's {{register}} of ordinations still survives, {{and is in}} the Lincoln cathedral archives. Parts of this were published by Alfred Gibbons in 1888, and others in 1904 by the Canterbury and York Society. These records give not only the name of the person receiving a <b>benefice,</b> but what the clerical status of each new <b>benefice</b> holder was.|$|E
5|$|The parish was {{previously}} a single parish <b>benefice</b> (under a vicar), but from 2012 {{has been in}} the <b>Benefice</b> of Llanbadarn Fawr and Elerch and Penrhyncoch and Capel Bangor, in the deanery of Llanbadarn Fawr, in the archdeaconry of Cardigan, of the Diocese of St David's.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1345, he {{was granted}} a canonry in the diocese of Dunkeld with {{expectation}} of a prebend, but {{does not appear to}} have obtained this in practice, although he did obtain a different Dunkeld canonry with prebend on 12 May 1352. This he retained until his consecration as Bishop of Dunblane in 1361. Walter also obtained a fourth prebend in this period. He had been pursuing a <b>benefice</b> in the diocese of St Andrews, and while he was granted this on 28 March 1351, the grant was still not effective by 16 April 1353, when he {{was granted a}} prebend in the diocese of Moray instead. This was not effective either, but Walter did eventually obtain a St Andrews diocese <b>benefice,</b> namely the church of Inverarity in Angus, which had become vacant on the death of its incumbent, William de Coventre, probably Walter's older brother. On 7 December 1345, Walter was appointed (provided) as Archdeacon of Dunblane, his most substantial <b>benefice</b> to date, but the appointment {{does not appear to have}} been carried through.|$|E
50|$|The English {{concordat}} {{limited the}} granting of papal dispensations for holding a plurality of <b>benefices</b> to men of noble birth or high scholarship. No such grants would be issued as favours for the courtiers of secular or ecclesiastical lords. Dispensations allowing clerics to live away from their <b>benefices</b> or allowing laymen to hold <b>benefices</b> for grace periods before taking holy orders were revoked. The appropriation of <b>benefices</b> {{for the use of}} monasteries, collegiate churches or cathedral chapters was prohibited without the approval of the local bishop.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 June 1339, Pope Benedict XII {{wrote to}} the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Winchester, and the Bishop of Paris, issuing a mandate for them to protect Cardinal Gaillard de La Mothe against those who molest him, {{touching}} his <b>benefices</b> and possessions in their dioceses. [...] This indicates that, {{in addition to the}} <b>benefices</b> already noted, Gaillard also had <b>benefices</b> in Canterbury, Winchester and Paris.|$|R
50|$|The church itself {{supported}} some musicians through <b>benefices.</b> Musicians {{tried to}} attain the best <b>benefices</b> during their careers, as well as gathering more than one. In this way, musicians could guarantee their continued financial support. However, because <b>benefices</b> included an ecclesiastical post, married musicians could not benefit from them. Also, political turmoil, such as war or the seizure of lands, could interfere with the payment of <b>benefices</b> to a recipient. Church patronage of music {{can also be seen}} in the musical training given to boys who were educated at ecclesiastical institutions. They received education in grammar and music in return for singing with the chapel when needed.|$|R
5|$|St Botolph's Church is {{the parish}} {{church of the}} <b>benefice</b> of Quarrington with Old Sleaford, which {{encompasses}} most of the village of Quarrington in the English non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire. The <b>benefice</b> is a rectory and falls within the deanery of Lafford and the archdeaconry and diocese of Lincoln; the priest-in-charge is the Reverend Mark Stephen Thomson, who took over from the Reverend Sandra Rhys Benham in 2016. Dedicated to St Botolph, the church is on Town Road. The rectory was constructed in about 2000 and has a study area used as the parish office.|$|E

5|$|Walter's {{first known}} benefices were a canonry (with prebend) in the Collegiate Church of Abernethy and a prebend in {{the diocese of}} Ross, {{northern}} Scotland, which he was holding by 12 April 1345. None of these benefices, neither parish nor office, are known by name. While Walter would retain his Ross <b>benefice</b> until becoming Bishop of Dunblane, he lost his Abernethy <b>benefice</b> at some point between 20 December 1348 and 28 March 1351. During that period he obtained another unnamed prebend {{in exchange for the}} Abernethy prebend. Walter is only the second known canon of Abernethy Collegiate Church.|$|E
5|$|Some of Josquin's compositions, {{such as the}} {{instrumental}} Vive le roy, have been tentatively dated to the period around 1500 {{when he was in}} France. A motet, Memor esto verbi tui servo tuo ("Remember thy promise unto thy servant"), was, according to Heinrich Glarean writing in the Dodecachordon of 1547, composed as a gentle reminder to the king to keep his promise of a <b>benefice</b> to Josquin, which he had forgotten to keep. According to Glarean's story, it worked: the court applauded, and the king gave Josquin his <b>benefice.</b> Upon receiving it, Josquin reportedly wrote a motet on the text Benefecisti servo tuo, Domine ("Lord, thou hast dealt graciously with thy servant") to show his gratitude to the king.|$|E

50|$|Dispensation, {{enabling}} a {{clerk to}} hold several ecclesiastical dignities or <b>benefices</b> {{at the same}} time, {{was transferred to the}} Archbishop of Canterbury by the Peterpence, Dispensations, &c. Act 1534, certain ecclesiastical persons having been declared by a previous statute (of 1529) to be entitled to such dispensations. The system of pluralities carried with it, as a direct consequence, systematic non-residence on the part of many incumbents, and delegation of their spiritual duties in respect of their cures of souls to assistant curates. The evils attendant on this system were found to be so great that the Pluralities Act 1838 was passed to abridge the holding of <b>benefices</b> in plurality, requiring that no person should hold under any circumstances more than two <b>benefices</b> and such privilege was subject to the restriction that both <b>benefices</b> must be within 10 mi of each other.|$|R

5|$|After Foliot's failed {{candidacy}} as bishop, in February 1216 John {{appointed him}} to the <b>benefice</b> of Colwall in Herefordshire, the king having {{the ability to make}} the appointment because Giles de Braose, the Bishop of Hereford, who would normally have made the appointment, had recently died. Also from this time comes Foliot's patronage of Robert Grosseteste, the theologian and future Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After the Reformation, a {{separate}} parish likewise dedicated to St Bartholomew was granted {{in favour of}} St Bartholomew's Hospital â€” named St Bartholomew-the-Less, it remained under the hospital's patronage, unique in the Church of England, until 1948 when the hospital was nationalized in the National Health Service. The church <b>benefice</b> is nowadays joined again with its ancient partner, the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great.|$|E
5|$|St Denys' Church is {{the parish}} {{church of the}} <b>benefice</b> of Sleaford (formerly called New Sleaford), which {{encompasses}} most of the market town of Sleaford in the English non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire. The <b>benefice</b> is a vicarage and falls within the deanery of Lafford and the archdeaconry and diocese of Lincoln; as of 2015, the vicar is Rev. Philip Anthony Johnson, who was appointed in 2013. The church is located next to (and faces onto) the market place at the town centre. It is dedicated to St Denys; the Victorian clergyman and local historian Edward Trollope stated {{that this is a}} medieval form of St Dionysius, but does not elaborate on which of the several saints called Dionysius this refers to. According to a pamphlet published by the parochial church council, St Denys is a medieval composite of Dionysius of Paris, Dionysius the Areopagite and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.|$|E

Notably, the future Archbishop of Canterbury and {{chaplain}} to King CharlesII, John Tillotson, preached his first sermon at the church in 1661. Major restoration work was done to the church in 1886, and a large amount of the Chancel woodwork dates from this period.
