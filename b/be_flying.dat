5|$|After the ASTP {{mission was}} completed, Lunney became {{manager of the}} Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program. During this period, it was {{anticipated}} that NASA's space shuttle fleet would <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> very frequent missions, and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government {{organizations such as the}} Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied, and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle. During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close to the ground. As AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|This work {{led to an}} {{interesting}} discovery. When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed, it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds. However, the aircraft would <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> as much as four times as fast. Thus its most economical cruise speed, in terms of fuel per mile, was its maximum speed. This was entirely unexpected and implied {{that there was no}} point in the dash concept; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach3, it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed. The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible, but by March1957, engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was.|$|E

5|$|Although the VC held {{a greater}} {{portion of the}} Ngok Tavak garrison, {{particularly}} on the eastern side, their attack was stalled. After the 40th Battalion had overrun the command post, they tried to advance on the landing zone where allied soldiers {{had set up a}} strong position from fortified underground bunkers, which the VC had failed to detect in their previous reconnaissance patrols. At 04:20, an AC-47 gunship from the 4th Air Commando Squadron was reported to <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> over the garrison, so White directed the aircraft to fire down on VC-held positions around the perimeter. After he had shouted warnings to the Marines and the Nungs, White approved the aircraft to fire on the position area of the 105mm howitzers. The arrival of the AC-47 enabled the allied forces to hold their last remaining ground, and repulse the final attack. By 05:30, fighting in and around Ngok Tavak was limited to the hurling of grenades, and random fire on any movement that was believed to be that of the VC. In one of their final attempts to overcome the last allied position, the VC set off tear gas of such low density that it had little effect on most of the allied soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be present or absent at different times of the year, although this appears to result from nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the Universe can remain constant {{only if the}} Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe {{is known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster than the speed of light.|$|E

25|$|One {{was that}} an {{aircraft}} flying from Alaska to California would <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> right {{over some of the}} best developed shipping lanes available. By offloading as early as possible to some other mode of transport—tankers or pipelines—the amount of fuel burned would be greatly reduced. More importantly, this freed the aircraft to return to for another load more rapidly than if it flew all the way to California, meaning that a single aircraft could deliver more cargo in a given time. This had been noticed in the earlier studies, but the full impact had not been appreciated.|$|E

He anticipated increased air support from American fighter-bombers because the Operation Rolling Thunder air campaign against North Vietnam had stood down, freeing up those air strikes for use in Laos. Additionally, the 56th Special Operations Wing based at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand had three A-1 Skyraider squadrons available. The Royal Lao Air Force would also <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> its T-28s from Vientiane; debuting in combat were Hmong pilots.

As the airship approached again, Dublin and Sydney turned about to attack. In response, the Zeppelin's commander began a high-level bombing run on Dublin, but fast manoeuvres from the cruisers frustrated these efforts and the Zeppelin's attention turned instead to Obdurate, dropping three bombs which achieved near misses. This {{was followed by a}} further attack on Sydney, with between ten and twelve bombs being dropped but missing due to the cruiser's wild evasive manoeuvres. Sydney returned fire with her anti-aircraft guns but the aircraft proved to <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> too high to be successfully engaged.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 1941, the Women’s Division of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was created. By {{the end of}} the war it totalled some 17,000 members. The RCAF did not train {{their female}} {{recruits}} to <b>be</b> <b>flying</b> instructors or combatants, although their direct spirit of participation is best described by the division’s slogan, “We serve that men may fly”. They were initially trained for clerical, administrative and support roles. As the war continued, however, women would also work in other positions like parachute riggers and laboratory assistants, and even in the very male-dominated electrical and mechanical trades. Many RCAF-WD members were sent to Great Britain to serve with Canadian squadrons and headquarters there.|$|E
