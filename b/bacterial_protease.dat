40|$|Abstract <b>Bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> play an {{important}} role in a broad spectrum of processes, including colonization, proliferation and virulence. In this respect, <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> are potential biomarkers for bacterial diagnosis and targets for novel therapeutic protease inhibitors. To investigate these potential functions, the authors designed and used a protease substrate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) -library comprising 115 short D- and L-amino-acid-containing fluorogenic substrates as a tool to generate proteolytic profiles for a wide range of bacteria. Bacterial specificity of the D-amino acid substrates was confirmed using enzymes isolated from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Interestingly, <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> that are known to be involved in housekeeping and nutrition, but not in virulence, were able to degrade substrates in which a D-amino acid was present. Using our FRET peptide library and culture supernatants from a total of 60 different bacterial species revealed novel, bacteria-specific, proteolytic profiles. Although in-species variation was observed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Staphylococcus aureus. Overall, the specific characteristic of our substrate peptide library makes it a rapid tool to high-throughput screen for novel substrates to detect bacterial proteolytic activity...|$|R

5000|$|Kexin (...) is a prohormone {{processing}} protease {{found in}} the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae). It catalyzes the cleavage of -Lys-Arg- and -Arg-Arg- bonds to process yeast alpha-factor pheromone and killer toxin precursors. The enzyme is encoded by the yeast gene KEX2, and usually {{referred to in the}} scientific community as Kex2p. It shares structural similarities with the <b>bacterial</b> <b>protease</b> subtilisin.

5000|$|IDE {{was first}} {{identified}} by {{its ability to}} degrade the B chain of the hormone insulin. This activity was observed over sixty years ago, though the enzyme specifically responsible for B chain cleavage was identified more recently. [...] This discovery revealed considerable amino acid sequence similarity between IDE and the previously characterized <b>bacterial</b> <b>protease</b> pitrilysin, suggesting a common proteolytic mechanism.

40|$|Elastin is a {{fibrous protein}} that confers {{elasticity}} to tissues such as skin, arteries and lung. It is extensively cross-linked, highly hydrophobic and insoluble. Nevertheless, elastin can be hydrolysed by <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> in infectious diseases, resulting in {{more or less}} severe tissue damage. Thus, development of substrates able to reliably and specifically detect pathogen-secreted elastolytic activity is needed to improve the in vitro evaluation of the injury that <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> may provoke. In this work, two human biomimetic elastin polypeptides, HELP and HELP 1, {{as well as the}} matrices derived from HELP, have been probed as substrates for elastolytic activity detection. Thirty strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients were analyzed in parallel with standard substrates, to detect proteolytic and elastolytic activity. Results point to the HELP-based 3 D matrix as an interesting biomimetic model of elastin to assess bacterial elastolytic activity in vitro. Moreover, this model substrate enables to further elucidate the mechanism underlying elastin degradation at molecular level, as well as to develop biomimetic material-based devices responsive to external stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{produce a}} range of {{proteolytic}} enzymes, for which a number human equivalent or structurally similar examples exist and {{the primary focus of}} this study was to analyse the published literature to find proteolytic enzymes, specifically endoproteses and to examine the similarity in the substrates that they act on so as to predict a suitable structural motif which can be used as the basis for preparation of useful prodrug carriers against diseases caused by specific bacteria like Salmonella. Also, the similarities between the <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> and the action of human matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), together with the MMP-like activity of bacterial endoproteases to activate human MMPs, were also analysed. This information was used to try to identify substrates on which the MMPs and <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> act, to aid the design of oligopeptide prodrug carriers to treat cancer and its metastatic spread. MMPs are greatly involved in cancer growth and progression, a few MMPs and certain proteases share a similar type of activity in degrading the extra cellular matrix (ECM) and substrates including gelatin. Our primary targets of study were to identify the proteases and MMPs that facilitate the migration of bacteria and growth of tumour cells respectively. The study was thus a two-way approach to study the substrate specificity of both <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> and MMPs, thereby to help in characterisation of their substrates. Various bioinformatics tools were used in the characterisation of the proteases and substrates as well as in the identification of possible binding sites and conserved regions in {{a range of}} candidate proteins.

50|$|The {{potential}} role of ADEPs {{in combating}} antibiotic drug resistance is postulated {{due to their}} novel mode of action that other antibiotics are not known to use, activation of casein lytic protease (ClpP) which is an important <b>bacterial</b> <b>protease.</b> Most antibiotics work through inhibitory processes to establish cell death, while ADEPs actually work through activation of the protease to cause uncontrolled protein degradation, inhibition of cell division, and subsequent cell death. They largely affect Gram-positive bacteria and could be of great use to target antibiotic resistant microbes such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (PRSP), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and others. Despite the potential use of ADEP, possible resistance has been examined in certain species.|$|E
50|$|Protein HtrA2, {{also known}} as Omi, is a mitochondrially-located serine {{protease}}. The human protein Serine protease HTRA2, mitochondrial is 49kDa in size and composed of 458 amino acids. The peptide fragment of 1-31 amino acid is the mitochondrial transition sequence, fragment 32-133 amino acid is propertied, and 134-458 is the mature protein Serine protease HTRA2, mitochondrial, and its theoretical pI of this protein is 6.12. HtrA2 shows similarities with DegS, a <b>bacterial</b> <b>protease</b> present in the periplasm of gram-negative bacteria. Structurally, HtrA2 is a trimeric molecule with central protease domains and a carboxy-terminal PDZ domain, which is characteristic of the HtrA family. The PDZ domain preferentially binds C-terminus of the protein substrate and modulate the proteolytic activity of the trypsin-like protease domain.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{alternative}} splicing, The human protein Insulin-degrading Enzyme has two isoforms. Isoform1 is ~118 kDa {{in size and}} composed of 1019 amino acids while the isoform 2 is ~45.2 kDa in size and composed of 464 amino acids (missing 1-555 amino acids). The calculated theoretical pI of this protein isoform is 6.26.Structural studies of IDE by Shen et al. have provided insight into the functional mechanisms of the protease. Reminiscent of the previously determined structure of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>protease</b> pitrilysin, the IDE crystal structure reveals defined N and C terminal units that form a proteolytic chamber containing the zinc-binding active site. In addition, it appears that IDE can exist in two conformations: an open conformation, in which substrates can access the active site, and a closed state, in which the active site is contained within the chamber formed by the two concave domains. Targeted mutations that favor the open conformation result in a 40-fold increase in catalytic activity. Based upon this observation, it has been proposed that a possible therapeutic approach to Alzheimer’s might involve shifting the conformational preference of IDE to the open state, and thus increasing Aβ degradation, preventing aggregation, and, ideally, preventing the neuronal loss that leads to disease symptoms.|$|E

Among the <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases,</b> a predominant role in spoilage of dairy products seems to be played by the thermostable metallo-protease AprX, which is produced by various strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Differences in AprX enzyme activity among different strains were highlighted, but the most proteolytic strains were not identified. In this study, {{the presence of the}} aprX gene was evaluated in 69 strains isolated from food matrices and 18 reference strains belonging to the P. fluorescens group, which had been previously typed by the multi locus sequence typing method. Subsequently, a subset of reference strains was inoculated in ultra-high temperature milk, and the expression of the aprX gene was evaluated at 22 and 6 °C. On the same milk samples, the proteolytic activity was then evaluated through Azocasein and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid solution assays. Finally, to assess the applicability of the former assay directly on dairy products the proteolityc activity was tested on industrial ricotta samples using the Azocasein assay. These results demonstrate the spread of aprX gene in most strains tested and the applicability of Azocasein assay to monitor the proteolytic activity in dairy products...|$|R

30|$|Proteolytic enzymes such as proteases are {{required}} for removal of proteins during chitin extraction from seafood waste. Plants, animals and microbes are the main sources of proteolytic enzymes. Various proteases like papain, trypsin, pepsin, devolvase, alcalase and pancreatin may be employed to remove proteins from shells and minimize the depolymerization and deacetylation during isolation of chitin. Accessibility for the enzymes can be modified by performing the deproteination either before or after demineralization step. In deproteination step, both crude and purified extracted enzymes can be used. However, purified enzymes are expensive in comparison to crude enzymes. Crude enzymes are mostly obtained from fish viscera and bacteria. Among these, <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> are more common. In majority of fish producing countries, 50 % of by-product represents seafood harvest which is not utilized, discarded and rejected as waste (Rao et al. 1998). Therefore, it could be fascinating to employ crude enzymes for extraction of chitin to {{lower the cost of}} the process along with conserving the environment. Various studies have shown the use of <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> for carrying out deproteinization. Synowiecki and Al-khateeb (2000) carried out enzymatic deproteinization of shrimp waste which was already demineralized to obtain a nutritionally valuable protein hydrolysate and chitin.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoenzymes in cystic fibrosis lung infection in the presence and absence of specific serum antibodies. In sputa of 21 cystic fibrosis patients, concentrations of P. aeruginosa proteases and exotoxin A were determined by sensitive radioimmunoassays. In all sputa, detection of exoenzymes was negative (less {{than or equal to}} 10 ng). Positive serum antibody titers to bacterial exoenzymes were found in the majority of patients. Purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations from the sera of two patients revealing specific antibody titers to the <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases</b> neutralized these enzymes at ratios of 1, 000 : 1 to 5, 600 : 1 (wt/wt). Above the neutralizing capacity of IgG, proteases caused cleavage of IgG; below that level, no enzymatic activity was observed. In vitro incubation of P. aeruginosa elastase, alkaline protease, or exotoxin A with elastase derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes showed that polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase: (i) was cleaved by bacterial elastase, (ii) was not inactivated by alkaline protease, and (iii) inactivated exotoxin A. The results suggest that soon after the onset of P. aeruginosa lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients, <b>bacterial</b> <b>proteases,</b> but not exotoxin A, become important virulence factors.
