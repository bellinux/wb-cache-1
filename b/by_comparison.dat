5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress the state had made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. <b>By</b> <b>comparison,</b> Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E

Effects of the inconsistency of the geostrophic wind field with the equations of motion are also quantitatively isolated <b>by</b> <b>comparisons</b> of semi-geostrophic predictions with predictions made with wind fields which satisfy the balance equation. It is concluded that the principal fault of the conventional geostrophic approximation lies in the violation of the continuity equation.

30|$|Among {{the domains}} of {{contingent}} self-worth identified by Crocker and Wolfe (2001), ACSW is defined as self-esteem that is dependent on one’s appearance or how one looks. ACSW reflects a concern about fulfilling or exceeding the standard of physical attractiveness that the individual believes is essential {{to feel good about}} oneself. People with high ACSW will feel more threatened <b>by</b> <b>comparisons</b> with physically attractive persons but may feel less threatened <b>by</b> <b>comparisons</b> with those who have a successful career. ACSW is negatively related to appearance self-esteem—namely, the extent to which individuals are satisfied with their physical appearance (Noser and Zeigler-Hill 2014). That is, as one’s ACSW, the dependence on other’s approval for one’s appearance self-esteem, goes higher, the self-esteem about appearance actually lowers (Crocker and Luhtanen 2003).|$|R
