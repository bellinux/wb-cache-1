5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when <b>back-mounted.</b> Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
25|$|The {{commonly}} used configurations for multiple cylinders are to either carry the bottom gas in <b>back-mounted</b> cylinders of sufficient total volume, either manifolded or independent, {{and the other}} mixes in sling-mounts clipped off {{to the sides of}} the diver's harness on D-rings, or to carry all gases in side-mounted cylinders.|$|E
25|$|Bailout gas for a <b>back-mounted</b> {{configuration}} may {{be carried}} {{in a variety of}} ways in a bailout cylinder. The most popular being as a sling cylinder, a pony cylinder strapped to the primary back mounted cylinder, or in a small cylinder (Spare air) supported by a pocket attached to the buoyancy compensator. When more than one cylinder of the same mix are side-mounted, the cylinders not in use function as bailout sets, provided they contain enough gas to get the diver safely to the surface.|$|E

5000|$|The attacking wrestler {{stands behind}} the {{opponent}} who is either sitting or lying face down, they pull the opponent into an inverted facelock, often hooking the opponent's near arm with their free arm. The attacker then pulls backwards and up, wrenching the opponent's neck and spine. If the opponent is sitting, the wrestler can press their knee into the opponent's back, adding pressure. Innovated by Tatsumi Fujinami and popularised in the United States by Último Dragón. A standing variation of this move {{was used by}} The Undertaker calling it [...] "Takin' Care of Business". Low Ki once used a version from a <b>back-mount</b> position called the [...] "Dragon Clutch".|$|R
25|$|Once {{the bell}} {{is at the}} correct depth, the final {{adjustments}} to pressure are made and after final checks, the supervisor instructs the working diver(s) to lock out of the bell. The hatch {{is at the bottom}} of the bell and can only be opened if the pressure inside is balanced with the ambient water pressure. The bellman tends the working diver's umbilical through the hatch during the dive. If the diver experiences a problem and needs assistance, the bellman will exit the bell and follow the diver's umbilical to the diver and render whatever help is necessary and possible. Each diver carries <b>back-mounted</b> bailout gas, which should be sufficient to allow a safe return to the bell in the event of an umbilical gas supply failure.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} used scuba set uses a [...] "single-hose" [...] open circuit 2-stage demand regulator, connected to a single <b>back-mounted</b> high-pressure gas cylinder, with the first stage connected to the cylinder valve and the second stage at the mouthpiece. This arrangement differs from Emile Gagnan's and Jacques Cousteau's original 1942 [...] "twin-hose" [...] design, known as the Aqua-lung, in which the cylinder pressure was reduced to ambient pressure {{in one or two}} stages which were all in the housing mounted to the cylinder valve or manifold. The [...] "single-hose" [...] system has significant advantages over the original system for most applications.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{bailout bottle}} is {{generally}} applied by [...] surface supplied divers to the scuba set carried {{as an alternative}} breathing gas supply {{in case of a}} failure of the surface supplied breathing gas. The capacity of these <b>back-mounted</b> bailout cylinders must be sufficient to get the diver from the underwater worksite to a place of safety where more breathing gas is available, either the surface, or a diving bell or lockout submersible. and can be fairly small (7 L) or quite large (twin 12 L set), depending on the depth and duration of the dive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{roots of}} Unified Team Diving's {{philosophy}} and principles {{can be found}} in the Hogarthian/DIR equipment configuration and its covenants. Hogarthian was a minimalist approach to a gear configuration in the early 1990s but those that adhered to it, still kept an diving ideology of [...] "each diver" [...] should configure their own way. DIR built upon the Hogarthian configuration by adding an element of standardization (late 1990s till now) - mainly because of a large scale projects such as Wakulla. In 2007, UTD decided to build upon its founders' roots for the previous 13 years in Hogarthian and DIR, and evolve the system to the next generation - unification. UTD wanted to keep its standardization and minimalist approach with the [...] "tool" [...] of open-circuit <b>back-mount</b> (DIR) but increase the [...] "tool set", venturing into side-mount and closed circuit rebreathers. The goal was to unify these three configurations into one system while remaining consistent, scalable and interchangeable. The intention was to drive the industry forward, by being inclusive and not exclusive. UTD describes these as the core elements in the UTD 10 covenants.|$|R
40|$|Light level geolocators, {{also known}} as GLS loggers, are {{electronic}} devices intended for tracking the location of wide-ranging animals using ambient light to estimate latitude and longitude. Miniaturized geolocators {{that can be used}} on relatively small migratory birds have recently become available, but {{little is known about the}} potential harmful effects of geolocators on birds. We examined the possible effects of 1. 5 -g geolocators (dimensions: 21 x 6. 5 x 9 mm) on the breeding success and survival of migratory Lesser Kestrels (Falco naumanni). During the 2007 breeding season, kestrels were fitted with geolocators using two attachment methods (Teflon wing harnesses and darvic bands), and geolocators were removed in 2008 after the birds returned to the breeding grounds. We found no differences in the breeding success of control and tagged pairs during the 2007 breeding season, but tagged pairs had greater fledgling mortality in the following breeding season. Furthermore, nestlings of tagged individuals had higher triglyceride and uric acid concentrations in their blood than control nestlings during the breeding season following tagging. As for return rates, 75 % of tagged birds came back to the colony after the nonbreeding period, a proportion similar to that reported in previous studies. Although <b>back-mounts</b> are slightly heavier and require more skill to attach, we recommend their use on small migratory raptors because most leg-mounted geolocators in this study were damaged or rendered useless by dirt obscuring the light sensor...|$|R
2500|$|For Series 8, new {{versions}} of Matilda, Shunt, Dead Metal, and Sir Killalot have been constructed. They are considerably heavier with improved weaponry. All the house robots are over [...] in weight, and Sir Killalot now weighs [...] Visually, all four look {{similar to their}} predecessors, but with significant differences: Dead Metal's head has been enlarged with glowing eyes, Matilda's <b>back-mounted</b> fins have been replaced with smaller crocodilian scales, spikes appear on her frill, her eyes are now red and her whole head section now flips up; Shunt has enlarged wheel protectors and metal chimneys replacing the smokestack; and Sir Killalot's armour and helmet has been entirely redesigned. The other house robots did not return for this series.|$|E
2500|$|Scorpion's {{signature}} finisher {{from the}} original game up until Mortal Kombat 4 was his [...] "Fire Breath" [...] Fatality, in which he removes his mask to reveal a skull right before immolating his opponent. A variation of this finisher was included in MKII: entering a different button/joystick combination added the spoken [...] "Toasty!" [...] phrase that simultaneously appeared on the screen. While the [...] "Fire Breath" [...] was brought back for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe in 2008, his spear has otherwise served as his primary tool in his Fatalities in the three-dimensional games, from impaling his opponents through the head and then decapitating them in Deadly Alliance, using it to yank off their limbs in Deception, and plunging it into their chest before kicking them through a portal that left nothing but a skinned corpse hanging from the spear's chain in MK2011 ("Nether Gate"). His second Fatality in the reboot, [...] "Split Decision", had Scorpion using one of his <b>back-mounted</b> swords to hack his opponent to pieces.|$|E
2500|$|Goemon {{appears in}} the video game series Samurai Warriors and Warriors Orochi (where he is a self-proclaimed king of thieves, {{wielding}} a giant mace and a <b>back-mounted</b> cannon), {{as well as in}} the video games Blood Warrior, Kessen III, [...] (depicted as a giant bandit hero, also carrying a cannon and seeking to plunder Nobunaga's castle), Shall We Date?: Ninja Love (a romance option or the player character), Shogun Warriors, and Throne of Darkness, where he has been spared by Tokugawa Ieyasu on the condition that he would join the onimitsu. Goemon was a subject of several pre-WWII Japanese films such as Ishikawa Goemon Ichidaiki and Ishikawa Goemon no Hoji. He is a villain in Torawakamaru the Koga Ninja, and a tragic antagonist in Fukurō no Shiro (and in its remake Owls' Castle, played by Takaya Kamikawa). He also {{appears in the}} taiga drama series Hideyoshi, the film Roppa no Ôkubo Hikozaemon, the manga series Kaze ga Gotoku, and the manga and anime series Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo. Goemon is Yusuke Kitagawa's starting Persona in Persona 5. His primarily attacks with ice elemental magic and physical skills. He wields giant pipe as his weapon.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cylinder}} {{is usually}} worn on the back. [...] "Twin sets" [...] with two low capacity <b>back-mounted</b> cylinders {{connected by a}} high pressure manifold were {{more common in the}} 1960s than now for recreational diving, although larger capacity twin cylinders ("doubles") are commonly used by technical divers for increased dive duration and redundancy. At one time a firm called Submarine Products sold a sport air scuba set with three manifolded <b>back-mounted</b> cylinders. Cave and wreck penetration divers sometimes carry cylinders attached at their sides instead, allowing them to swim through more confined spaces.|$|E
50|$|Technical divers have {{generally}} used a redundant gas supply system, either isolation-manifolded or independent <b>back-mounted</b> cylinders. Recreational divers have traditionally resorted to using buddy supplied gas, or relatively small bailout ‘pony cylinders’ or ‘ascent bottles’ for out-of-air emergencies. Whether {{attached to the}} primary cylinder, or slung at the chest, these cylinders often present problems with stability and streamlining, whilst not always providing more than a bare minimum supply of air for emergency ascent. Sidemount diving with two equal-sized cylinders helps resolve stability and streamlining issues, and can ensure that an adequate redundant reserve of air is maintained, similar to <b>back-mounted</b> twins.|$|E
50|$|Specialized sidemount {{harnesses}} {{are available}} 'off-the-shelf' commercially. Some {{of these are}} designed specifically for sidemounting only, but others are 'hybrid' designs, enabling the diver to swap between sidemount and <b>back-mounted</b> cylinders, as needed.|$|E

His strength, reflexes and endurance have all been enhanced by his armor and he can fly at sub-sonic speeds. The suit is also air conditioned to prevent discomfort for the operator. The Firepower armor contains a vast array of sensors and an impressive array of weapons including four <b>back-mounted</b> surface-to-air missiles (and additional missiles mounted on leg hardpoints), chest-mounted heat beam lasers, mini-grenades and arm-mounted concussive cannons. The armor can also fire a small tactical nuclear missile known as Terminax from a <b>back-mounted</b> launch tube.

5000|$|A {{backplate}} is {{a structure}} onto which the <b>back-mounted</b> diving cylinders are mounted, usually linking the buoyancy compensator {{with the weight}} of the diving cylinders and provided with a harness of straps which secures the scuba set to the diver's back. A backplate is generally used with a back inflation (wing) type buoyancy compensator, but can also be used without any buoyancy compensator.|$|E
50|$|Unlike <b>back-mounted</b> cylinders, the sidemount diver has {{immediate}} access to, and can see, the regulators and tank valves of their cylinders.

50|$|The sidemount diver {{typically}} operates {{two independent}} tanks for 'bottom gas' during a dive. Compared with <b>back-mounted</b> double cylinders and an isolation manifold, {{the use of}} independent cylinders requires additional gas management skills. The sidemount diver has to swap regulators at planned intervals {{to ensure that the}} use of gas is balanced from both cylinders - thus ensuring good balance and trim in the water, whilst preserving a sufficient supply of air for emergency sharing.|$|E
5000|$|FAB 1 was {{modified}} by Brains, {{the inventor of}} the Thunderbirds machines, to include weaponry and gadgetry such as front- and <b>back-mounted</b> machine guns (although grappling hooks are seen to shoot out of the rear in the episode [...] "The Perils of Penelope"). The car is also equipped with a smoke screen canister and oil slick dispenser, extendable tyre-studs (for increased traction), and hydrofoils (or outriggers; for travel on water and snow, respectively).|$|E
50|$|Sidemount diving {{configuration}} {{places the}} cylinders under the diver’s armpits, {{in line with}} their body, allowing the diver to pass through smaller restrictions than would be possible with <b>back-mounted</b> cylinders.
