The cloud radio access network (Cloud-RAN) presents a promising method for alleviating both capital and interference in UDNs, while providing high energy efficiency and capacity. Virtualized network technology is a key technology of resource management and scheduling in the fifth generation (5 G) mobile communication networks [5, 6]. Virtualized network technology allows why Cloud-RAN to integrate centralization and virtualization into its architecture. The resources can be better managed and dynamically coordinated on demand on a pool level because Cloud-RAN centralizes all <b>base</b> <b>band</b> <b>units</b> (BBU) to form a pool, and remote radio heads (RRH) provide basic wireless signal coverage. In practice, the front haul and back haul of Cloud-RAN are often constrained by capacity and delays.

Specifically, in the next generation of mobile communication 5 G, cloud computing is supposed to be applied to radio access network.

We formulate the problem as a coalition formation game in partition form. In the process of coalition formation, each RRH can join or leave one coalition to maximize its own individual utility while taking into account the coalition utility at the same time. Moreover, the convergence and stability of the resulting coalition structure are studied.

In CRAN, the traditional base stations (BSs) are decoupled into remote radio heads (RRHs) and <b>base</b> <b>band</b> <b>units</b> (BBUs) that are respectively responsible for radio and baseband functionalities. The RRHs are geographically proximated whereas the the BBUs are pooled in a centralized cloud named BBU pool.

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of new mobile devices and applications, the demand for ubiquitous wireless services has increased dramatically in recent years. The explosive growth in the wireless traffic requires the wireless networks to be scalable {{so that they can}} be efficiently extended to meet the wireless communication demands. In a wireless network, the interference power typically grows with the number of devices without necessary coordination among them. On the other hand, large scale coordination is always difficult due to the low-bandwidth and high-latency interfaces between access points (APs) in traditional wireless networks. To address this challenge, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has been proposed, where a pool of <b>base</b> <b>band</b> <b>units</b> (BBUs) are connected to the distributed remote radio heads (RRHs) via high bandwidth and low latency links (i. e., the front-haul) and are responsible for all the baseband processing. But the insufficient front-haul link capacity may limit the scale of C-RAN and prevent it from fully utilizing the benefits made possible by the centralized baseband processing. As a result, the front-haul link capacity becomes a bottleneck in the scalability of C-RAN. In this dissertation, we explore the scalable C-RAN in the effort of tackling this challenge. In the first aspect of this dissertation, we investigate the scalability issues in the existing wireless networks and propose a novel time-reversal (TR) based scalable wireless network in which the interference power is naturally mitigated by the focusing effects of TR communications without coordination among APs or terminal devices (TDs). Due to this nice feature, it is shown that the system can be easily extended to serve more TDs. Motivated by the nice properties of TR communications in providing scalable wireless networking solutions, in the second aspect of this dissertation, we apply the TR based communications to the C-RAN and discover the TR tunneling effects which alleviate the traffic load in the front-haul links caused by the increment of TDs. We further design waveforming schemes to optimize the downlink and uplink transmissions in the TR based C-RAN, which are shown to improve the downlink and uplink transmission accuracies. Consequently, the traffic load in the front-haul links is further alleviated by the reducing re-transmissions caused by transmission errors. Moreover, inspired by the TR-based C-RAN, we propose the compressive quantization scheme which applies to the uplink of multi-antenna C-RAN so that more antennas can be utilized with the limited front-haul capacity, which provide rich spatial diversity such that the massive TDs can be served more efficiently...|$|R

In this contribution, we extend our approach considering also the interfering links to fade according to the 3 GPP 3 D channel model.

40|$|Power {{is a major}} design {{concern of}} today 2 ̆ 7 s {{networked}} computing systems, from low-power battery-powered mobile and embedded systems to high-power enterprise servers. Embedded systems are required to be power efficiency because most embedded systems are powered by battery with limited capacity. Similar concern of power expenditure rises as well in enterprise server environments due to cooling requirement, power delivery limit, electricity costs as well as environment pollutions. The power consumption in networked computing systems includes that on circuit board and that for communication. In the context of networked real-time systems, the power dissipation on wireless communication is more significant than that on circuit board. We focus on packet scheduling for wireless real-time systems with renewable energy resources. In such a scenario, it is required to transmit data with higher level of importance periodically. We formulate this packet scheduling problem as an NP-hard reward maximization problem with time and energy constraints. An optimal solution with pseudo polynomial time complexity is presented. In addition, we propose a sub-optimal solution with polynomial time complexity. Circuit board, especially processor, power consumption is still {{the major source of}} system power consumption. We provide a general-purposed, practical and comprehensive power management middleware for networked computing systems to manage circuit board power consumption thus to affect system-level power consumption. It has the functionalities of power and performance monitoring, power management (PM) policy selection and PM control, as well as energy efficiency analysis. This middleware includes an extensible PM policy library. We implemented a prototype of this middleware on <b>Base</b> <b>Band</b> <b>Units</b> (BBUs) with three PM policies enclosed. These policies have been validated on different platforms, such as enterprise servers, virtual environments and BBUs. In enterprise environments, the power dissipation on circuit board dominates. Regulation on computing resources on board has a significant impact on power consumption. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is an effective technique to conserve energy consumption. We investigate system-level power management in order to avoid system failures due to power capacity overload or overheating. This management needs to control the power consumption in an accurate and responsive manner, which cannot be achieve by the existing black-box feedback control. Thus we present a model-predictive feedback controller to regulate processor frequency so that power budget can be satisfied without significant loss on performance. In addition to providing power guarantee alone, performance with respect to service-level agreements (SLAs) is required to be guaranteed as well. The proliferation of virtualization technology imposes new challenges on power management due to resource sharing. It is hard to achieve optimization in both power and performance on shared infrastructures due to system dynamics. We propose vPnP, a feedback control based coordination approach providing guarantee on application-level performance and underlying physical host power consumption in virtualized environments. This system can adapt gracefully to workload change. The preliminary results show its flexibility to achieve different levels of tradeoffs between power and performance as well as its robustness over a variety of workloads. It is desirable for improve energy efficiency of systems, such as BBUs, hosting soft-real time applications.
