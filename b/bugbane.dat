This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall <b>bugbane,</b> Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog blueberry, highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E

40|$|Tall <b>bugbane</b> {{is in the}} Ranunculaceae (buttercup) family. It is one of six Cimicifuga {{species in}} North America. There are no {{recognized}} infraspecific taxa. The taxonomy of the Cimicifuga genus is currently under review and may be included under the genu Actaea, in which case tall <b>bugbane</b> would {{be referred to as}} Actaea elata. Description Perennial, large-leafed understorey plant that stands 1 – 2 m tall. Stems are branched above and leaves are bi-ternate with 9 – 17, cordate to ovate, often palmate leaflets, which are usually three-lobed. This species has a dark, tuberous, horizontal rhizome. The inflorescence is a simple to compound raceme with 50 – 900 small, white, closely crowded flowers. Individual flowers are radially symmetrical and apetalous, and sepals are white or pinkish, falling off at once. Fruits are follicles, 9 – 12 mm long, subsessile, appearing singly in the upper flowers, but in two’s, and rarely, three’s on the lower raceme. Follicles each contain approximately 10 red to purple-brown seeds...|$|E
40|$|Perennial with {{a cluster}} of fibrous roots from a short simple caudex or crown. Stem solitary, erect, mostly 16 to 48 inches tall, {{generally}} branched only above. Basal and lowermost cauline leaves long-petiolate, the blade 2 to 6 inches wide, palmately 5 to 7 parted or palmately compound, the segments or leaflets sharply toothed and sometimes shallowly lobed, or some of them (especially the two lateral ones in a 5 -parted leaf) often more or less deeply bifid. Cauline leaves usually several, gradually reduced upwards and becoming sessile. Ultimate umbels about inch wide at anthesis, greenish-white, subtended by a few narrow bractlets, mostly 15 to 25 flowered, the staminate flowers more numerous than the perfect ones, or some umbellets all staminate. Calyx lobes firm, lance-triangular, attenuate, slightly connate at the base. Styles elongate, often persistent and longer than the prickles of the fruit. Fruits ovoid, 1 / 8 to inch long, 1 / 8 to inch wide, covered with numerous uncinate basally thickened prickles, the lower ones rudimentary. Mericarps subterete in cross-section. Identification Tips: Sanicula marilandica has fibrous roots and greenish white flowers, whereas the other species of Sanicula in our range have taproots and yellow or purple flowers.

40|$|Cimicifuga elata (tall <b>bugbane)</b> is a Species of Concern {{with the}} U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{and it is}} {{considered}} by Natural Heritage programs in Oregon and Washington to be endangered. Since the species occurs in forests, its conservation could conflict with other forest uses such as timber harvest. It has been postulated that the species is dependent on old-growth coniferous forests. The objectives {{of this study were}} to compare populations of this species among sites with differing forest-management histories. In contrast to previous reports, we found that C. elata in uncut old-growth forest was smaller and less reproductive than in clearcuts, probably because plants responded well to additional light in cut-over areas. Plants in areas with other management histories, such as second growth and thinned stands (both > 70 years old), were intermediate in size. Population structure also differed among management types. Herbivory by deer and elk was more frequent in clear cuts andedges than in unmanaged old-growth forests. No populations were known {{at the time of this}} study from second growth forests of moderate age (20 - 30 years), and it is possible that competing vegetation excludes C. elata from clearcuts after a few years. Management actions that retain hardwoods, thin stands, or create gaps may improve at least short-term conditions for this speciesKaye and Kirkland "Effects of timber harvest on Cimicifuga elata, a rare plant of western forests.
