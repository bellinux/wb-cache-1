5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>as</b> shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction}} as the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, C.F. Theodor Steinweg (H.E. Steinweg's son) {{changed his}} name to C.F. Theodore Steinway, and served as the leader and chief {{technician}} of Steinway & Sons for fifteen years. He did not like living in the US, so he kept his home in Braunschweig and traveled <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>as</b> needed. In 1880 he stopped traveling overseas and started a new Steinway & Sons piano factory in Hamburg, competing with his father's old firm, now called Grotrian-Steinweg, in making pianos for European customers. After establishing the business, Steinway retired to Braunschweig for his last years. He died in 1889, leaving his collection of pianos to the city's museum. The Hamburg factory proved successful in competing against Grotrian-Steinweg—both companies were known for producing premium pianos.|$|E

25|$|At {{any given}} instant, the {{electron}} will naturally be pushed towards the lower-voltage {{side of the}} tube. The electron will then oscillate <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>as</b> the voltage changes. At the same time, a strong magnetic field is applied, stronger than the critical value in the original design. This would normally cause the electron to circle back to the cathode, but due to the oscillating electrical field, the electron instead follows a looping path that continues toward the anodes.|$|E
25|$|The ninth {{match was}} between Lex Luger and Goldberg. Goldberg {{dominated}} Luger {{from the start}} of the match. As Goldberg attacked Luger outside, Luger pushed Goldberg's shoulder into the ringpost. They went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>as</b> Buff Bagwell and The Sarge came down to be in Goldberg's corner. Luger hit Goldberg with brass knuckles, and Bagwell performed a Buff Blockbuster to Goldberg, seemingly by accident. Luger attempted to apply the Torture Rack, but Goldberg blocked it. Bagwell attacked Bruce outside as Goldberg pinned Luger after a spear and a Jackhammer to win the match. After the match, Bagwell attacked Goldberg with a steel chair, and revealed his alliance with Luger.|$|E

25|$|After {{the carbon}} dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the {{decarboxylation}} step (below right), the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the deprotonation of that oxygen off the alpha carbon (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The {{lone pair of electrons}} moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This lone pair of electrons abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that we can say that the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step is because they are helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>as</b> long as they are close enough to the substrate.|$|E
25|$|An {{oscillating}} {{engine was}} {{a type of}} direct-acting engine {{that was designed to}} achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>as</b> the crankshaft rotated, hence the term oscillating. Steam was supplied and exhausted through the trunnions. The oscillating motion of the cylinder was usually used to line up ports in the trunnions to direct the steam feed and exhaust to the cylinder at the correct times. However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the timing to be varied to enable expansive working. (As, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen.) This compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|E

To maintain secrecy of the episode's plot, the model shark was given the codename [...] "Clive". The scenes in which the characters ride through the air in a sleigh pulled by one of the flying sharks was filmed in front of a greenscreen.

500|$|Weishampel {{developed}} his model {{with the aid}} of a computer simulation. Natalia Rybczynski and colleagues have updated this work with a much more sophisticated three-dimensional animation model, scanning a skull of E. regalis with lasers. They were able to replicate the proposed motion with their model, although they found that additional secondary movements between other bones were required, with maximum separations of [...] between some bones during the chewing cycle. Rybczynski and colleagues were not convinced that the Weishampel model is viable, but noted that they have several improvements to implement to their animation. Planned improvements include incorporating soft tissue and tooth wear marks and scratches, which should better constrain movements. They note that there are several other hypotheses to test as well. Further research published in 2012 by Robin Cuthbertson and colleagues found the motions required for Weishampel's model to be unlikely, and favored a model in which movements of the lower jaw produced grinding action. The lower jaw's joint with the upper jaw would permit anterior–posterior motion along with the usual rotation, and the anterior joint of the two halves of the lower jaw would also permit motion; in combination, the two halves of the lower jaw could move slightly <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>as</b> well as rotating slightly along their long axes. These motions would account for the observed tooth wear and a more solidly constructed skull than modeled by Weishampel.|$|E
500|$|Throughout January 1944, AirSols {{aircraft}} {{based in}} the Solomon Islands and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft based on Kiriwina kept up a sustained air offensive against Rabaul. Under steady and relentless pressure, the Japanese air defence began to weaken, allowing a landing {{to be made on}} 15 February by New Zealand troops on the Green Islands, which lie little more than [...] from Rabaul. On 16 and 17 February, the US Pacific Fleet's Task Force 58 attacked the main Japanese base at Truk. Most Japanese aircraft were recalled to defend Truk and 19 February saw the last significant interception of Allied aircraft over Rabaul. Meanwhile, on 13 February, General MacArthur had issued orders for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands, codenamed Operation Brewer, which was now scheduled for 1 April. Forces assigned included the 1st Cavalry Division; No.73 Wing RAAF, providing close air support; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR); the US Marines' 1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion; and US Naval Construction Battalions ("Seabees") to build the naval base—a total of 45,000personnel. However, on 23 February 1944 three Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bombers flew low over Los Negros. The airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands had been evacuated. Lieutenant General George Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, went to MacArthur and proposed that the unoccupied islands be quickly taken by a small force.

500|$|The show {{began with}} a gothic cathedral setting, which was {{developed}} by Tait Towers, a production management company. They used ScreenWorks 10mm video screens [...] with an integrated active cooling system designed to dissipate captured heat from LED tiles. The main screens could move up and down, thus creating a moving cathedral setting and steps. Onstage several dancers wearing buddhist and Christian monks' robes swung a giant thurible <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>as</b> it burnt incense and appeared to cleanse the venue. The Kalakan Trio then appeared dressed in religious robes with huge head dresses, chanting excerpts from [...] "Lekhah Dodi", as the backdrop screens showed a huge cross with the letters MDNA. The religious chants eventually morph into chants of Madonna's name, as the two main backdrop screens split open to reveal a giant confessional, covered by a scrim at the front. Madonna was present inside kneeling down and praying, while the confessional was lowered to the stage with the song's opening monologue in the background. The singer was decked in a gold crown with a black veil, a tight black shirt with a leopard-printed bra peeking out from the top, leather arm bands and black skinny jeans and black high-heel boots. Madonna pretended to smash and break through the glass window of the confessional with a large rifle and proceeded to perform the song accompanied by a troupe of shirtless dancers wearing high heels, doing a choreography similar to the song's music video. The song was arranged to include musical elements of [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) and [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008). Moving blocks and contortionist dancers dressed up as gargoyles were also present in the performance. [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] ended with Madonna grabbing another rifle and pretending to shoot at the crowd, giving way to the second performance of the show, [...] "Revolver". The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012 shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena, were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E
