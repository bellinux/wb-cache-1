Allowing mothers and their infants uninterrupted skin to skin contact for at least the first 30 minutes following delivery and keeping mothers and babies close are two of the practices that have been shown to encourage breastfeeding initiation. <b>Bedding-in</b> (bed-sharing on the postnatal ward) is an obvious extension to skin-to-skin contact and a way of ensuring that mothers and their infants stay close. <b>Bedding-in</b> also has a number of other benefits in that it can facilitate bonding and assists in post partum rest for mothers. This randomised control trial investigated the effects of <b>bedding-in</b> compared to rooming-in on breastfeeding initiation, mother-infant contact, maternal responsiveness, midwifery assistance and infant safety required on the first post-natal night. In addition, a relatively new infant sleep condition (clip on crib) was assessed to determine whether infants and their mothers allocated to this condition behaved more like the <b>bedding-in</b> group or the rooming-in group. This presentation will concentrate on breastfeeding initiation in the three groups only. Mothers were recruited via breast-feeding workshops held within the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, when they were approximately 37 weeks gestation. Following vaginal delivery (without the use of intramuscular opiate analgesics) the behaviors and interaction of the mothers and their babies were recorded on the post-natal ward using infra-red video equipment.

30|$|Conventional PE is sterilized by gamma {{irradiation}} in air. This process {{offers the}} benefits of molecular cross-linking but can also produce free radicals that, {{in the presence of}} air, oxidize [13]. Oxidation decreases resistance of the biomaterial, resulting in degradation and brittle PE, and thus may increase wear [14]. PE wear is multifactorial: among the different factors associated with wear are a patient’s higher activity level, a big femoral-head diameter or thin PE liners, vertical orientation of the acetabular cup, or the use of modular uncemented cups [15, 16]. When PE wear is evaluated on radiographs, penetration of the femoral head into the PE liner is examined. The different radiographic methods of evaluating PE wear include manual [17 – 20] and digitized methods using two- and three-dimensional techniques [15, 21 – 23]. All these techniques suffer from different degrees of error and are of limited value, as they have only been validated in a laboratory model but not in vivo studies [24]. Sychterz et al. assessed the time pattern of PE wear on X-rays and reported different findings; they observed that femoral-head penetration into the PE liner is due to two different phenomena: the so-called <b>bedding-in</b> process, which is the result of creep and settling of the liner into the cup; and true wear, which is due to the removal of particles [22, 25]. <b>Bedding-in</b> occurs in the first two postoperative years and true wear over time. These results have recently been confirmed by different authors [26, 27].|$|E
40|$|The poor {{performance}} of Metal-on-Metal (MoM) bearings has to date been blamed on “adverse loading” conditions. Studies {{have focused on}} the effect of cup inclination and microseparation on gravimetric wear rates and highlighted the importance of surgical technique when implanting such devices. Up to four fold increase in the wear rates of MoM bearings subjected to microseparation has been reported during the <b>bedding-in</b> period. The contribution of corrosive processes to overall material degradation during adverse loading has not previously been investigated. In the present study 28 mm HC CoCrMo alloy Total Hip Replacements were tested to 1 Mcycles under standard gait and severe microseparation conditions in an electrochemically instrumented hip simulator. An order of magnitude increase in material lost as a result of oxidation was noted (0. 234 to 2. 044 mm 3 /Mcycle) during microseparation.

40|$|High-performance space-based optical systems {{typically}} require {{structures that}} exhibit {{high levels of}} dimensional stability over their lifetimes. To better understand the mechanisms for dimensional instability, a novel series of tests were carried out at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory on a breadboard high-stability optical bench structure. Goals of the testing were to assess the relative stability {{of a pair of}} reference surfaces and to determine the contributions of various structural elements and joints to dimensional instability. The breadboard was subject to an intensive environmental test campaign that included thermal cycling under vacuum and random vibration testing. Metrology was performed throughout the campaign to assess the dimensional stability response to the various environmental loads. The metrology requirement was challenging, with measurements of micron-level displacement and arcsecond- level tilt over 1 -meter distances being necessary in situ during environmental testing. This issue was resolved using a combination of techniques: a contacting coordinate measurement machine, laser interferometry, and optical autocollimation. The greatest levels of instability were produced by random vibration testing, though evidence of a <b>bedding-in</b> process implies that vibratory conditioning could be used to improve stability...|$|E
30|$|In another study, we {{evaluated}} two different generations of a cementless cup to assess clinical and radiological results over a minimum follow-up of 10  years [30]. We compared 83 Harris-Galante I and 93 Harris-Galante II hemispherical uncemented cups (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) with a conventional PE liner sterilized by gamma irradiation in air using 32 - and 28 -mm femoral-head diameters, respectively. Nine Harris-Galante I cups and two Harris-Galante II cups were revised due to aseptic loosening or PE problems. When we analyzed the lineal PE wear using the above-described method, we {{observed that the}} initial PE wear at 6  months after surgery was greater for the first-generation cup, although the mean wear was similar in both cups. Mean femoral-head penetration at 6  week after surgery was 0.15  ±  0.05  mm for the Harris-Galante I cup and 0.12  ±  0.03 for the Harris-Galante II cup (P <  0.001); but mean wear was 0.13  ±  0.23  mm/year for the Harris-Galante I cup and 0.11  ±  0.10 for the Harris-Galante II cup (P =  0.740). The appearance of radiolucent lines and osteolysis was related to a greater initial wear, greater mean wear, and greater wear {{at the end of}} follow-up. Most metallic shells in both groups showed stable fixation. The so-called second-generation cups had a lower initial PE wear that resulted in less PE wear at the latest the follow-up, but the overall wear rate was similar in both groups despite the different femoral-head sizes and the improved locking mechanism. In both studies, we confirmed that the most important factor to affect the long-term result of a THA, especially in the uncemented cups, is PE wear rather than bone fixation, which usually is not a problem. We also observed the <b>bedding-in</b> or creep process that occurs when we sequentially analyzed penetration of the femoral head into the PE liner, described by Sychterz and others. Factors that influence PE wear, such as a vertical cup position or thin liner (like the ACS system) are also described, as well as other factors related to the design, such as a locking mechanism of the cup to the PE liner or the femoral-head size not influencing the mean wear but only the initial <b>bedding-in</b> process. This last observation could be examined by the probability that liner thickness and cup settling into the liner as well as PE creep that occur during the first postoperative 2  years are more important for final wear than other factors.|$|E

40|$|Many {{hospitals}} make {{a commitment}} to institute 'baby-friendly' initiatives on post-natal wards. Bed sharing (<b>bedding-in)</b> is one of these initiatives. By allowing mothers to comfort, feed and care for their babies in bed, bed sharing may assist the establishment of breastfeeding while helping mothers to get more rest. The effects of skin-to-skin contact and suckling within a short time of birth are well known, but research into the optimal method for reinforcement of these practices over the subsequent days has rarely included research on bed sharing. Currently, there is no published research on any negative effects for mothers and infants in the postnatal period. There are no data, for instance, on which to make judgements as to the safety of mothers and babies when bed sharing after exhausting deliveries. In the present article, the preliminary results of a randomized controlled study of bedsharing on a postnatal ward are reported. Nighttime infrared video recordings are used to examine mother and baby behaviour on the first and second postnatal nights for mothers experiencing vaginal deliveries without the use of opiate analgesics during labour. When completed, the current study will be able to address important, unanswered questions about bed sharing as a caregiving strategy on the postnatal ward...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{current work}} aims to {{describe}} a methodology to test brake friction materials through a braking tribometer, which is integrated by an electromagnetic induction heater. This technology allows to characterize the isolated effect of load and temperature on friction. Characteristics of the main machines and procedures for testing friction materials are evaluated, paying particular attention {{with regard to the}} effect of load and temperature on friction. Experimental methodology consisted of performing brakings under 3 levels of load and 4 levels of temperature. Results from the experiments show that coefficient of friction decreases considerably when temperature is higher than 300 °C. It was also observed that the effect of load on friction varies according to the friction material evaluated. About the number of braking applications at each temperature level, it has been verified that at temperatures of 200 °C, 300 °C and 350 °C, three braking are able to characterize the friction behavior. However, when temperature is 100 °C, at least 10 brakings are required in order to obtain satisfactory results. The reason for that is due to the <b>bedding-in</b> and also recovery effect of friction, which occurs immediately after to the brake friction material to be subjected to high temperatures (300 °C or higher) ...|$|E

40|$|Mooring ropes are {{essential}} components of offshore installations, and synthetic ropes are increasingly preferred {{because of their}} favourable cost to weight ratios. In-service condition of these materials is traditionally monitored through costly visual inspection, which adds to the operating costs of these structures. Acoustic Emissions (AE) are widely used for condition-monitoring in air, and show great potential underwater. This paper investigates the AE signatures of synthetic mooring ropes subjected to sinusoidal tension-tension loading in a controlled environment, using a large-scale dynamic tensile test rig. With a linear array of 3 broadband (20 Hz to 50 kHz) hydrophones, four main signatures are identified: low-to high frequency, low-amplitude signals (50 Hz to 10 kHz), low-amplitude broadband signals (10 kHz to 20 kHz), high amplitude signals (10 Hz to 48 kHz) and medium-amplitude signals (500 Hz to 48 kHz). These AE types are related to different stages of rope behaviour, from <b>bedding-in</b> to degradation and failure. The main findings are that the failure location and breaking load can be identified through the detection of AE. The occurrence of high amplitude AE bursts {{in relation to the}} applied tensile load allows the detection of an imminent failure, i. e. prior to the failure event.

40|$|Although {{used for}} the station-keeping of {{offshore}} equipment for several decades, synthetic ropes have only recently been used for marine renewable energy (MRE) devices. The fundamental mooring load differences between these two applications necessitate the detailed quantification of mooring component performance. Of particular importance for lifecycle analysis, installation and maintenance operations is the evolution of synthetic component performance over time due to load history and fatigue mechanisms. Changes to the stiffness and damping properties of these materials will affect the global response of the device if the mooring system and device responses are closely coupled. To address these uncertainties, tension experiments have been conducted on Nylon parallel-stranded rope samples at IFREMER {{as part of a}} MERiFIC (Marine Energy in Far Peripheral and Island Communities) consortium.

Considerable effort is being invested {{in the search for}} materials which, by wearing less, will release fewer particles. In this research the role of joint wear simulators is paramount. The wear debris from 26 simulator tests of hip prostheses was extracted from the bovine serum lubricant and sized using a laser diffraction technique. The influence on particle size of a broad range of parameters was examined. The parameters considered included the <b>bedding-in</b> phenomenon, the femoral head material and roughness and physiological versus simplified load cycles and wear paths. The physiological wear simulators produced a similar size distribution of {{wear particles}} to that produced by implanted joints. Head material had no effect on this observation. Simplifying the loading cycle or wear path independently made no impact on this finding. This remained the case when simplified load and wear path were combined in one test. The effect of head roughness was pronounced with an increase in minimum particle size with increasing roughness. Joint simulators remain the optimal method for assessing new joint materials and designs. However, their use to characterise joints in terms of wear rate solely should be guarded against. Instead focus should be concentrated on a combination of the size and amount of the wear debris created. In this way the "loosening hazard" of a joint can be distilled...|$|E

There is thus a need for a performance related seal design method, with a more scientific foundation. This study aims to address this challenge through the investigation of the failure mechanisms of seals with the aim of simulating its manifestation using an accelerated pavement tester, the Model Mobile Load Simulator (MMLS 3). Based on this investigation and an analysis of the capabilities of the MMLS 3, seal stone embedment was identified as the target failure mechanism. Three key seal design variables were prioritised in the study and identified as directly influencing the embedment of the stones in a seal. To this end, a seal testing setup was developed along with an analysis procedure to measure and quantify the embedment of the stones in a seal.

40|$|Low-cost Earth-imaging {{instruments}} typically require {{high performance}} structures {{to ensure that}} critical alignments of optical components are maintained between the assembly phase, and the on-orbit operational phase. There {{are a number of}} threats to structural dimensional stability, including thermal cycling, moisture desorption and launch vibrations. This last area {{is the subject of this}} thesis. The main aim of the research described here is to better understand the effects of random vibration on the dimensional stability of precision structures. The first part of this research considered the degree to which random vibration is a problem - this was assessed by comparing its effects on dimensional stability with those of other typical environmental stressors. This was accomplished by performing a series of environmental tests on an optical breadboard structure, and measuring the dimensional stability throughout. These tests showed that random vibration could indeed pose a significant threat. The second part of the research aimed to better understand the dimensional stability response of specific structural elements - namely materials and bolted joints - to random vibration. This required the development of novel test setups and metrology techniques. Controlled tests were performed in both these structural areas, and a number of useful conclusions were drawn. The final part of the research was to investigate the empirical results using FEA methods. A significant challenge was to develop a modelling technique that is capable of predicting dimensional stability responses to random vibration. In the case of the material tests, the response of the test samples was correctly predicted using FEA with cyclic plasticity properties and parameters identified from static tests. This research has produced a number of relevant findings for spacebased stable optical bench structures.

40|$|Contact mechanics, {{wear and}} {{tribology}} of hip implant devices {{have been studied}} since early implantations {{and the performance of}} the devices are becoming increasingly important. Wear and surface damage of these bearing surfaces occur through normal gait loading conditions. However, in addition to this, stripe wear patterns are observed on patient implant retrievals and following hip simulator studies. Novel computational and theoretical methods were used and developed based on advanced computer aided engineering techniques and the finite element method. Hip joint modelling and numerical methodologies of mechanical wear simulations were studied through a newly proposed scripting method. Shakedown theory and maps were referred to for studying the biotribology and contact mechanics of hip resurfacing devices under cyclic normal, severe and edge loading conditions. Through implicit and explicit finite element modelling lateral displacement and laxity based microseparation models were developed. The contact pressure under edge loading conditions was at least a factor of 2 larger than under normal loading conditions. The wear rates of both the femoral head and acetabular cup during the <b>bedding-in</b> period were between 1 - 3 mm 3 /mc (million cycles) and 80 - 110 mm 3 /mc based on a steady-state wear coefficient. Results showed that modelling and verifying the contact and stress results under edge loading conditions required more careful computational modelling than for normal loading conditions. The high contact pressures observed during simulations of microseparation models were consistent with the high level of wear and surface damage observed in experimental simulator studies and from patient retrievals. These methods can therefore be used as a technique to simulate wear of hip implant devices. Shakedown assessments showed that under normal, as well as edge loading and severe loading conditions the hip device remained below the elastic shakedown region of a rolling and sliding shakedown map, which is ideal for minimal surface contact and subsurface damage...|$|E

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{theories of}} heat generation and transfer at the friction interface of a brake assume either matching or not matching surface temperatures {{by having a}} varying or uniform heat partition ratio respectively. In the research presented the behaviour of heat partition has been investigated in a fundamental study based on experimental measurements of temperature and the associated modelling and simulation of heat transfer in a brake friction pair. For a disc brake, an important parameter that was identified from the literature study is the interface tribo-layer (ITL), which has been modelled as an equivalent thermal resistance value based on its thickness and thermal conductivity. The interface real contact area was also an important parameter in this investigation, {{and it has been}} found to affect heat partitioning by adding its own thermal resistance. A 2 -dimensional (2 D) coupled-temperature displacement Finite Element (FE) model is presented, based on which a novel relationship which characterises the total thermal resistance (or conductance) at the friction interface has been characterised based on the ITL thermal properties, the contact area, and the contact pressure at the interface. Using the model the effect of friction material wear on the total thermal resistance (or conductance) at the friction interface was predicted and a comparison of the Archard and Arrhenius wear laws in predicting the wear of a resin bonded composite friction material operating against a cast iron mating surface is presented. A 3 -dimensional (3 D) model is also presented. This model has represented a small scale disc brake test rig which has been used in parallel with the simulation for validation in a drag braking scenario. Two simulation conditions with different pad surface states were investigated, the first having a nominally flat surface, and the second an adjusted (worn) pad surface based on <b>bedding-in</b> data. The Arrhenius wear model was applied to significance of including wear on the total thermal resistance at the friction interface over a short brake application. A sensitivity analysis on the interface thermal conductance, the location of heat generation, and the magnitude of contact pressure has identified the importance of each factor in determining the total thermal resistance (or conductance) at the friction interface during any friction brake application. It is concluded that the heat partitioning is insensitive on the location of heat generation, and that the most sensitive parameter is the contact pressure.

40|$|Total hip {{replacement}} {{is one of}} the most frequently performed and successful surgical procedures. Its most common modes of failure identified in joint registries are dislocation in the short term and aseptic loosening associated with wear and osteolysis in the long term. Therefore, the ideal articulation would have both a low incidence of dislocation and low wear. Metal-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene (HXLPE) articulations of 36 mm diameter have been demonstrated in a randomised controlled trial to have a significantly lower incidence of dislocation at one year postoperatively compared to 28 mm articulations. Historically, large articulations (femoral head size ≥ 32 mm) have been associated with increased wear rates of conventional polyethylene compared to smaller articulations. Advances in polyethylene manufacture with cross-linking for clinical use in total {{hip replacement}}s has significantly reduced early wear rates compared to conventional polyethylene. This has prompted reconsideration of the ideal femoral head size to enhance the longevity of articulations. This study aims to compare the wear of 36 mm and 28 mm metal-on-highly crosslinked polyethylene total hip replacements through a post hoc analysis of radiographs of patients enrolled in the randomised controlled trial referred to above. Comparison of wear rates between cohorts was undertaken by use of computer-assisted analysis (PolyWare™) of patient radiograph sets. Radiograph sets for 326 patients, 164 with 28 mm and 162 with 36 mm articulations, were analysed. 36 mm metal-on-HXLPE articulations were found to have a statistically significant higher magnitude of <b>bedding-in</b> and creep at three but not twelve months when compared to the 28 mm cohort. The mean annual two-dimensional wear rate from 1 year until final radiograph was 0. 00 mm/yr for both cohorts. There were no differences between 36 mm to 28 mm cohorts in mean annual volumetric wear rates or significant differences in the proportion of patients in each cohort with two-dimensional wear rates ≥ 0. 1 mm/yr or volumetric wear rates ≥ 80 mm³/yr. These wear rates have previously been associated with osteolysis when using metal-on-conventional polyethylene articulations. While the use of large articulations had been reported to be associated with comparatively greater wear rates of articulations incorporating conventional PE, this appears not to apply to large articulations incorporating HXLPE. The low wear rates measured combined with the findings of the RCT of a significantly reduced incidence of dislocation at one year of 36 mm compared to 28 mm articulations, support the use of 36 mm metal-on-highly cross-linked polyethylene articulations. Longer term follow-up is required to assess whether low wear rates are maintained for both 36 mm cohorts and whether wear of HXLPE is associated with the development of periprosthetic osteolysis.

40|$|Background: Osteolysis {{resulting}} from wear debris production from the bearing surfaces {{is a major}} factor limiting long-term survival of hip implants. Oxidized zirconium head on crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) is a modern bearing coupling. However, midterm in vivo wear data of this coupling are not known. Questions/purposes: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate in vivo whether the combination of an oxidized zirconium femoral head on XLPE produces less wear than a ceramic head on XLPE or a ceramic head on conventional polyethylene (CPE) couplings and whether any of these bearing combinations results in higher hip scores. Methods: Between 2003 and 2007, we performed 356 total hip arthroplasties in 288 patients; of those, 199 (69. 1 %) patients (199 hips) were enrolled in what began as a randomized trial. Unfortunately, after the 57 th patient, the randomization process was halted because of patients’ preference for the oxidized zirconium bearing instead of the ceramic after (as they were informed by the consent form), and after that, alternate allocation to the study groups was performed. Hips were allocated into four groups: in Group A, a 28 -mm ceramic head on CPE was used; in Group B, a 28 -mm ceramic head on XLPE; in Group C, a 28 -mm Oxinium head on XLPE; and in Group D, a 32 -mm Oxinium head on XLPE. The authors prospectively collected in vivo wear data (linear wear, linear wear rate, volumetric wear, and volumetric wear rate) using PolyWare software. Preoperative and postoperative clinical data, including Harris and Oxford hip scores, were also collected at regular intervals. Of those patients enrolled, 188 (95 %) were available for final followup at a minimum of 7 years (mean, 9 years; range, 7 – 12 years). Results: All bearing surfaces showed a varying high <b>bedding-in</b> effect (plastic deformation of the liner) up to the second postoperative year. At 5 years both oxidized zirconium on XLPE groups showed lower (p < 0. 01) volumetric wear (mean ± SD mm 3) and volumetric wear rates (mean ± SD mm 3 /year) (Group C: 310 ± 55 – 206 ± 55 mm 3 /year, Group D: 320 ± 58 – 205 ± 61 mm 3 /year) when compared with ceramic on CPE (Group A: 791 ± 124 – 306 ± 85 mm 3 /year) and ceramic on XLPE (Group B: 1420 ± 223 – 366 ± 88 mm 3 /year) groups. For those patients who had completed 10 years of followup (20 patients [44. 5 %] of Group A, 21 [45. 7 %] of Group B, 23 [47. 9 %] of Group C, and 22 [44. 9 %] of Group D), at 10 years, both oxidized zirconium on XLPE groups also showed lower (p < 0. 01) volumetric wear (mean ± SD mm 3) and volumetric wear rates (mean ± SD mm 3 /year) (Group C: 356 ± 64 to 215 ± 54 mm 3 /year, Group D: 354 ± 50 to 210 ± 64 mm 3 /year) when compared with ceramic on CPE (Group A: 895 ± 131 to 380 ± 80 mm 3 /year) and ceramic on XLPE (Group B: 1625 ± 253 to 480 ± 101 mm 3 /year) groups. When wear rates of both oxidized zirconium groups were compared, no differences were found at any time interval with the numbers available. Two hips (one from Group A and one from Group B) are scheduled for revision as a result of wear and osteolysis. There were no differences in hip scores among the groups with the numbers available. Conclusions: In this study, in vivo wear parameters were lower when the combination of an oxidized zirconium head on XLPE liner was used at an average of 9 years (range, 7 – 12 years) followup. Further larger-scale clinical studies should confirm these findings and evaluate osteolysis and revision rates in association with the use of this bearing coupling.

40|$|Vibration and {{cavitation}} can {{be generated}} in many ways and serve many useful purposes. This study describes physical aspects of useful vibration and cavitation for {{a broad spectrum of}} applications at atmospheric or elevated pressures. After a review of available devices, hydrodynamic vibrating-body-in-pipe tools as described in patents by Ivannikov are identified as having a major potential and being largely unexplored. Major advantages of these tools are simplicity of construction, scalability, powerful effects and attractive frequency range for well cleaning applications. Self induced vibration with a free body colliding with the pipe wall causes alternating flow around the body with a water hammer effect that enhances the vibration and cavitation. Cavitation can thus be generated at lower flow rates and at higher backpressures than with passive tools such as orifices. Cavitational collapse at high backpressure creates exceptionally strong effects, giving access to novel applications. At backpressures where even water hammer enhanced cavitation ceases to exist, very strong vibrations persist to pressure levels encountered in deep wells. This unique dual enhanced vibration and cavitation behaviour of the tools is the key to vibrating-body-in-pipe technology for which the new name VibroCav was coined. The study focuses on VibroCav tools with balls, except for one series of tests with a so-called flip-flop body. Exploratory tests in a 350 bar test circuit in Assen lead to the design of a 50 bar laboratory closed test circuit installed in the 3 ME lab in Delft with facilities to apply up to 10 bar backpressure and up to 40 bar pressure differentials over the tools. In the 50 bar test circuit many experiments were carried out, firstly with bottom supported balls in a straight pipe and secondly with hanging balls in a pipe with a conical outlet allowing remote adjustment of the gap between the ball and the pipe wall. The influence of water composition, gas content and various ball materials was tested. Selected high backpressure test were carried out with a 350 bar closed test circuit in Drachten. A total of 29 field trials on an industrial scale were carried out for cleaning the porous media around water and oil wellbores under widely varying conditions and 5 field trials were done to evaluate the potential of the technology for the removal of scale deposits in wellbores. The laboratory experiments with the 50 bar test circuit delineated various operational modes of the VibroCav tools as function of flow rate and backpressure with regimes designated as (i) vibration only, (ii) active cavitation always combined with vibration, (iii) no vibration and passive cavitation and (iv) no vibration and no passive cavitation. The vibration regime persists to the maximum backpressure that could be reached and probably to much higher pressures, however at high flow rate conditions and a narrow gap vibration ceases when the Re value increases beyond the point of drag reduction due to shifting of the boundary separation point (Re approximately 3 x 105 for unbounded flow). Active cavitation is just as passive cavitation subdued by increasing backpressure; but in this test circuit it has still been observed at a backpressure of 63 barg. With a bottom supported tool as used in this test circuit a significant path downstream of the ball is obscured and active cavitation closer to the gap might still exist. This is the basis for the expectation that for this tool active cavitation may survive up to 100 barg backpressure. Tools with a hanging ball, in which cavitation is more clearly visible, were not tested at such high backpressures. The influence of water quality and gas content proved to be insignificant. Lightweight balls showed in bottom supported tools violent vibration and strong active cavitation but were easily damaged by the high contact forces between the ball and the support. With hard steel balls and softer steel supports, <b>bedding-in</b> is observed due to contact forces beyond the elastic limit of the support. If the ball is softer than the support, the ball flattens, breaks or is otherwise damaged by the support. The field trials for cleaning porous media around wellbores combined with theoretical analysis provided valuable semi-quantitative understanding of the influence of frequency, source directivity, source energy, wellbore geometry and permeability damage on the penetration depth of sources for vibration based well cleaning. The most significant wave energy for cleaning porous media is provided by the slow Biot wave, which is a compressional wave in fluid in the interconnected pore network. The higher the virgin permeability of the rock and the lower the wave frequency the better is the penetration depth. Permeability deterioration due to pore fouling reduces the penetration depth of the cleaning treatment and with progressive fouling the pore damage may get out of reach of the cleaning tools. The limited number of scale removal trials showed significant potential of the VibroCav tools due to the combination of physical hammering, jetting, wave energy and shock waves of collapsing cavitation bubbles. The study provides a solid basis for a scientifically founded continuation of the development of VibroCav technology for many areas of application in several industrial sectors and should be regarded as the precursor for a range of innovating techniques. 3 MEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
