25|$|The dye {{substance}} is a mucous secretion from the hypobranchial gland {{of one of}} several species of medium-sized predatory sea snails that {{are found in the}} eastern Mediterranean Sea. These are the marine gastropods Bolinus brandaris the spiny dyemurex, (originally known as Murex brandaris Linnaeus, 1758), the <b>banded</b> <b>dye-murex</b> Hexaplex trunculus, the rock-shell Stramonita haemastoma, and less commonly a number of other species such as Bolinus cornutus. The dye is an organic compound of bromine (i.e., an organobromine compound), a class of compounds often found in algae and in some other sea life, but much more rarely found in the biology of land animals.|$|E
50|$|Hexaplex trunculus (also {{known as}} Murex trunculus, Phyllonotus trunculus, or the <b>banded</b> <b>dye-murex)</b> is a {{medium-sized}} species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk {{in the family}} Muricidae, the murex shells or rock snails.|$|E
50|$|Sea snails of {{the species}} <b>Banded</b> <b>dye-murex</b> Hexaplex trunculus were also used to produce a purple-blue or indigo dye. In both cases, the mollusks secrete the dye in the mucus of their hypobranchial glands.|$|E
50|$|The {{dog-whelk}} {{can be used}} {{to produce}} red-purple and violet dyes, like its Mediterranean relations the spiny dye-murex Bolinus brandaris, the <b>banded</b> <b>dye-murex</b> Hexaplex trunculus and the rock-shell Stramonita haemastoma which provided the red-purple and violet colours that the Ancient World valued so highly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a historical {{overview of the}} importance of the red dye found in spiny dye-murices (Bolinus brandaris) and its production in Taranto, one of the most industrious Greek colonies founded in southern Italy in the 8 th century BC and renowned for its luxury products. Written evidence as well as numismatic and archaeological sources dating from the 5 th century BC to the 5 th century AD have been analysed in this context to identify purpura rubra Tarentina. In addition, the results of a series of dye experiments with hypobranchial glands from the same species are treated in order to detect chromatic properties and potential manufacturing processes for Tarentine Red. The methods for vatting the dye glands are discussed in relation to historical validity and chromatic outcome. To conclude, comparisons are drawn between the colour characteristics of Bolinus brandaris and Hexaplex trunculus (<b>banded</b> <b>dye-murex),</b> and the possibility of mixing both dyes is taken into consideration. The synthesis of historical and experimental approach finally shows that purpura rubra Tarentina can potentially be identified with purple dye extracted from Bolinus brandaris...|$|E
40|$|Most mollusc species {{producing}} the purple colour {{belong to the}} gastropod family Muricidae, as it was originally understood. Later, this family was split up into several families, into subfamilies, genera and subgenera. This nomenclature splitting {{has resulted in a}} situation that, for non-specialists, may seem rather confusing. For example, the names Murex trunculus, Hexaplex trunculus and Trunculariopsis trunculus all pertain to one and the same species, the <b>banded</b> <b>dye-murex,</b> nowadays generally called Phyllonotus trunculus. A very important point is that no animal of the purple-producing species contains any purple pigment {{as long as it is}} alive and well. Snails have near the periphery of the body, a cavity called the mantle cavity, which is in direct contact with the outer world, and in which some organs, for example the gills and the genital opening, are located. ln this mantle cavity, most of the marine snails also have a gland, called the hypobranchial gland, the location of which is indicated in the sketch of a dissected spiny dye-murex, Phyllonotus (Bolinus, Murex) brandaris (fig. 12). ln this hypobranchial gland the species we are concerned with here produce a whiteish viscous secretion...|$|E
