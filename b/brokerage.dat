In addition, clients of global <b>brokerages</b> have higher long-term and smaller medium (intramonth) and short (intraday) term profits than clients of local <b>brokerages.</b> This suggests that clients of local <b>brokerages</b> have a short-lived information advantage, but that clients of global <b>brokerages</b> are better at picking long-term winners. Finally, domestic clients of global <b>brokerages</b> have higher profits than foreign clients of global <b>brokerages,</b> suggesting {{that the combination of}} local information and global expertise leads to higher profits. The question of whether domestic investors have better information than foreign investors is increasingly controversial. There are arguments that support both sides of the issue. One argument is that domestic investors have an advantage because information does not have to travel over physical, linguistic, or cultural distances. Conversely, foreign investors may have an information advantage because they have a significant amount of investment experience and expertise. Formal empirical evidence on this issue is also mixed. While Choe, Kho, and Stulz (2001) using Korean data, and Hau (2001 a) using German data find that foreigners are at a disadvantage, Seasholes (2000) usin...|$|R

5|$|Grant's {{second term}} saw renewed {{economic}} turmoil. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York <b>brokerage</b> house, collapsed after {{it failed to}} sell all of the bonds issued by Jay Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for {{advice on how to}} resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873. Grant believed that, as {{with the collapse of the}} Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company's {{status was}} bolstered {{when it became}} one of the first 12 {{companies}} to be listed on the inaugural Dow Jones Industrial Average, compiled in May 1896. However, it was not long before TCI was eclipsed by its principal competitor, the United States Steel Corporation, a huge conglomerate formed in 1901 out of the enormous Carnegie and Federal steel empires. By the time of the Panic of 1907, U. S. Steel felt confident enough to launch a takeover bid of its Southern rival. On the morning of Saturday November 2, banker and tycoon J. P. Morgan, one of the founders of U. S. Steel, convened a meeting in his library and there suggested that U. S. Steel purchase the stock of an insolvent Wall Street <b>brokerage</b> firm, Moore and Schley, which had secured huge loans against 6 million TCI shares. This was not an entirely selfish gesture, as Morgan recognised that the failure of Moore and Schley would send investor confidence in the markets into a nose-dive. E. H. Gary, president of U. S. Steel, agreed in principle to this transaction, yet argued that without careful political maneuvering the deal would be seen by Congress as an effort to create a monopoly and thereby encounter troublesome federal anti-trust litigation. Morgan himself had been burnt by crusading Washington trust-busters in 1902 when his Northern Securities Company had been forcibly broken up by the government in a landmark test case.|$|E
