5|$|Without a peace treaty, MacArthur {{decided not}} to resign {{while at the same}} time writing letters to Wood saying he would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> accept the Republican {{nomination}} if it were offered to him. In late 1947 and early 1948, MacArthur received several Republican grandees in Tokyo. On 9 March 1948 MacArthur issued a press statement declaring his interest in being the Republican candidate for president, saying he would be honored if the Republican Party were to nominate him, but would not resign from the Army to campaign for the presidency. The press statement had been forced by Wood, who told MacArthur that it was impossible to campaign for a man who was not officially running for president, and that MacArthur could either declare his candidacy or see Wood cease campaigning for him. MacArthur's supporters made a major effort to win the Wisconsin Republican primary held on 6 April 1948. MacArthur's refusal to campaign badly hurt his chances and it was won to everybody's surprise by Harold Stassen. The defeat in Wisconsin followed by defeat in Nebraska effectively ended MacArthur's chances of winning the Republican nomination, but MacArthur refused to withdraw his name until the 1948 Republican National Convention which was won by Governor Thomas Dewey of New York.|$|E

Before 2004, all lecturers in public tertiary institutions were required to have some post-graduate award as a qualification. In October 2004, this requirement was removed and the Higher Education Ministry announced that industry professionals who added value to a course could apply for lecturing positions directly to universities {{even if they did}} not have postgraduate qualifications. To head off possible allegations that the universities faced a shortage of lecturers, Deputy Higher Education Minister Datuk Fu Ah Kiow said [...] "This is not because we are facing a shortage of lecturers, but because this move will add value to our courses and enhance the name of our universities...

Goltz welcomed the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, which {{should come as no}} surprise given that most of the officers leading the revolution were men he had personally trained. Goltz wrote about this revolution of 1908: [...] "The great Revolution of 1908 is the work of…Young Turks and in particular young officers. Most of them were in their 30s or even younger…They were the saviors of the fatherland." [...] Writing in response to Goltz’s article praising the revolution, one Unionist Major Ali Fuad wrote: [...] "This article written by our Honorable Master should be repeatedly read by all soldiers from field marshal to lieutenant … it always should be read ... and should be taken as a guide in all our efforts and initiatives. … I assure you, Honorable Master … that we shall stick exactly to your advice and we shall regard it as our guide."

2500|$|Khrushchev often {{claimed to}} possess a vast arsenal of nuclear-tipped ICBMs, and while disclaiming any {{intention}} of starting a war, maintained that he would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> turn a conventional war into a nuclear one if war did come. The U-2 spy flights, which were intended to discover if the Soviet Union really did have the nuclear arsenal that it claimed to have, only started in July 1956, {{and it was not}} until February 1959 that it firmly established that Khrushchev had vastly exaggerated his nuclear strength. In fact, the supposedly huge Soviet arsenal of ICBMs, with which Khrushchev would wipe out the cities of Britain, France, Israel, and if necessary the United States consisted only of four Semyorka missiles stationed at a swamp south of Arkhangelsk. From the viewpoint of Eisenhower, in 1956 he {{had no way of knowing}} for certain whether Khrushchev's nuclear braggadocio was for real or not. Earlier in 1956, Dulles had warned Eisenhower that Khrushchev was [...] "the most dangerous person to lead the Soviet Union since the October Revolution" [...] as Khrushchev was [...] "not a coldly calculating person, but rather one who reacted emotionally. He was obviously intoxicated much of the time and could be expected to commit irrational acts." [...] Khrushchev later admitted in his memoirs that he was not seriously [...] "thinking of going to war" [...] in November 1956 as he claimed at the time as he lacked the necessary ICBMs to make good his threats.|$|E
