5|$|Before 1897, {{there had}} been a ferry at Grovehill, and a {{shipyard}} on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr. To assist his workers to reach the shipyard, Scarr designed and built a ferry bridge, which cost him £300. It consisted of a large rectangular pontoon, above which was fitted a bridge deck with handrails. Two jack screws enabled the deck to be raised or lowered in relation to the pontoon, so that it remained at approximately the same height, whatever the state of the tide. On the eastern bank, Scarr constructed a variable-height landing, but the landing on the west bank was constructed by Beverley Council, and was fixed. Scarr campaigned to have a variable landing here as well, and was prepared to fund it, but his requests were always rejected. The fixed landing made access to the bridge difficult at high tides. When a boat needed to pass, the west end was freed, and the pontoon swung round to lie parallel to the bank, either upstream or downstream, depending {{on the state of the}} tide. It would then be winched back into position by a small <b>barrel</b> <b>winch.</b> At night the bridge was closed and moored beside the bank.|$|E
50|$|A tunnel was {{successfully}} constructed under {{the river in}} 2001. The 6.2 mi long sewer runs from the city centre to a treatment works at Salt End. It was excavated using two tunnelling machines, which were manufactured in Canada and were named Maureen and Gloria. The tunnel was officially opened on 21 August 2001, when a Mini car was driven through it, recreating scenes from the film The Italian Job.Before 1897, {{there had been a}} ferry at Grovehill, and a shipyard on the east bank, owned by Joseph Scarr.

40|$|Photograph of {{the deck}} of an {{unidentified}} sailing ship tied up at the long wharf of Port Los Angeles, ca. 1905. A sailor holding onto a large rope {{looks up at the}} camera. The rigging and masts of the ship fill the sky overhead. Visible on deck are <b>winches,</b> <b>barrels,</b> a lifeboat, and various storage compartments. On the dock along {{the left side of the}} ship is a derrick for moving freight. Part of the ocean and the coast in the distance are visible above the gunwales of the ship...|$|R
5000|$|Diamond {{drilling}} is {{much slower}} than reverse circulation (RC) drilling {{due to the}} hardness of the ground being drilled. Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock. Techniques vary among drill operators and what the rig they are using is capable of, some diamond rigs need to drill slowly to lengthen the life of drill bits and rods, which are very expensive and time consuming to replace at extremely deep depths. As a diamond drill rig cores deeper and deeper the time consuming {{part of the process}} is not cutting 5 to 10 more feet of rock core but the retrieval of the core with the wire line & overshot tool.Core samples are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut. An [...] "overshot" [...] attached {{to the end of the}} winch cable is lowered inside the rod string and locks on to the backend (aka head assembly), located on the top end of the core <b>barrel.</b> The <b>winch</b> is retracted, pulling the core tube to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the core tube when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube.|$|R
