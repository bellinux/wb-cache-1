5|$|A {{series of}} superb club cricket {{performances}} removed {{any doubt that}} Wills would play for Victoria in the next intercolonial against New South Wales, scheduled for March 1872 on the MCG. Before the game, representatives from both colonies met and entered into a <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> designed to call Wills. When he opened the bowling, Wills became the first cricketer to be called for throwing in a top-class Australian match. He was called two more times in two overs, and did not bowl again. He was again no-balled when a Victorian side under his captaincy lost to a combined XIII from New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia late in 1872.|$|E

Gillard and Immigration Minister Chris Bowen {{said they were}} close to signing a <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> which would result in 800 asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat being taken to Malaysia instead. Australia would take 4,000 people from Malaysia who have previously been assessed as being refugees. However, on 31 August, the High Court ruled that the agreement to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it not proceed. Australia would still accept 4,000 {{people who have been}} assessed as refugees in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace. However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated airlines to operate services.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, {{a crisis}} erupted in Albania after the {{collapse}} of several massive pyramid schemes, which resulted in social deterioration and violence in the country. An imposition of a curfew and a state of emergency on 2 March provoked a popular rebellion, causing concern in Italy, which feared another large-scale migration flow. Albanian migration to Italy reached its peak {{in the latter half of}} March, bringing great pressure to Italian accommodation centers and provoking a strong reaction in Italian public opinion. Italy had been operating under a <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> with Albania to board Albanian vessels whenever encountered starting on 3 April 1997 and Albanian would-be migrants going to Italy would be sent back to Albania, in exchange for Italian financial, police, and humanitarian assistance to the country. A military Operation White Flags was established in the international waters of the Strait and implemented a de facto naval blockade.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the UNTAC {{administration}} had banned forest logging and timber exports, a major industry and source of foreign earnings. In October 1993, Ranariddh issued {{an order to}} lift the ban on a temporary basis so as to allow trees that were already felled to be exported for timber. The Khmer Rouge still controlled large tracts of forests in the regions of western and northern Cambodia bordering Thailand, and helped finance its operations by selling timber to Thai forestry companies The Cambodian government was unable to impose its will in Khmer Rouge territory, and was eager to regain the logging revenues. In January 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen signed a <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The agreement provided for felled trees to be legally exported to Thailand on a temporary basis until 31 March 1994. The agreement also arranged for specially-designated customs zones to be created within Thai territory, which allowed Cambodian custom officials to inspect the logs and collect export duties.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August 1987, Braathens SAFE re-entered the market, {{flying in}} {{parallel}} with SAS to Tromsø and Oslo. For the first time, the scheduled flights to Oslo were offered as day flights instead of the night flights offered by SAS. In 2002, after SAS bought Braathens, the subsidiary took over all flights to Longyearbyen for the group. From May 2004, they merged to SAS Braathens, that again became SAS from 1 June 2007. From 1 April to 1 November 2004, Norwegian Air Shuttle introduced three weekly services to Longyearbyen to Tromsø and Oslo, using Boeing 737-300 aircraft, but the service was terminated due to low loads. A new service was started on 27 March 2008, with two direct services to Oslo, using larger Boeing 737-800 aircraft. but again the route was terminated later the same year. , Norwegian is again flying to Svalbard from Oslo.

40|$|Coordination {{of social}} {{security}} by <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> on social security is a specific area of international law that is essential to pay attention to. Czech Republic has up to now signed 16 <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> that are valid in their entirety. This thesis focuses on these 16 <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> and compares them with Regulation (EC) 883 / 2004 which became valid as the Czech Republic became member of European Union and which replaced <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> that were concluded with member states of European Union. The aim of this thesis is to perform a detailed analysis and to answer on following questions that {{are directly related to}} this issue. Firstly the thesis focuses on personal scale and answers a question of who is covered by <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements.</b> Secondly the thesis focuses on material scale and answers a question of what subsystems are covered by agreements and compares them with the principles applied by Regulation (EC) 883 / 2004. Finally the thesis deals with a question of a future possible approach to coordination {{of social security}} in a global scale. It can be concluded that <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> concluded by the Czech Republic are each unique legal instruments. Therefore it is essential to study each agreement separately and not to make conclusions based on general knowledge of the issue...|$|R

5|$|By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular {{that several}} {{countries}} stated that a <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> {{would have to}} be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen-year concession on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, {{but at the same time}} he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{globalization}} is increasing {{the cooperation of}} states in the international marketplace. Labour mobility is a key area that has proven difficult to liberalize due to its complex nature and sovereign border controls. As a proponent of free trade Canada has sought to establish the rules of trade in multilateral agreements though more recently has turned to <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements.</b> However, the proliferation of <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> is seen by economic scholars to frustrate the more efficient multilateral agreements. Comparing the technical language within various agreements reveals that a consistent trend to deepen Canada’s commitments in bilateral arrangements is not found. Rather, <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> have served to broaden trade globally. This finding suggests that <b>bilateral</b> trade <b>agreements</b> do not complicate the liberalization process to the extent proposed by multilateralists. In this light, <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> are considered to support Canada’s multilateral objectives by acting as building blocks and creating new trade partners...|$|R
