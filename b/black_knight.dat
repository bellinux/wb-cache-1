5|$|Most of the {{technology}} and systems used on Black Arrow had already been developed or flight-proven on the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight</b> rocket, or the Blue Steel missile. Black Arrow was designed to reuse as much technology from the earlier programmes as possible {{in order to reduce}} costs, and simplify the development process. Many senior staff of the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight</b> programme transferred directly to Black Arrow, including the Chief Missile Scientist, Roy Dommett, the Chief Design Engineer, Ray Wheeler and the Deputy Chief Engineer, John Underwood.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{supposedly}} {{haunted by the}} <b>Black</b> <b>Knight,</b> who wears the armour and regalia of the Order of St. John, and resembles Grand Master de Vilhena. In the 1940s, the knight began to appear {{out of thin air}} near the ruins of the Chapel of St. Anthony of Padua, which had just been bombed in World War II. The apparition was reportedly seen by Maltese and English men within the fort. When the rubble from the ruined chapel began to be cleared, the workmen reported that the knight was supervising their work. When the crypt beneath the chapel was opened, it was found that it had been vandalized, and the remains of knights which had been buried there were scattered around. After the crypt was restored and the bones were reburied, the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight</b> stopped appearing. In 1980, the crypt was vandalized for a second time, and the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight</b> reportedly began to appear again.|$|E
5|$|Black Arrow {{originated}} from {{studies by the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment for carrier rockets based on the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight</b> rocket, with the project being authorised in 1964.

5000|$|As the 6059 Knights Stronghold and 6057 Sea Serpent {{featured}} the Black Falcons, this {{suggested that the}} two factions were rivals, particularly in Knights Stronghold where the <b>Black</b> <b>Knights</b> defend the gates against a Black Falcons siege. The <b>Black</b> <b>Knights</b> were also opponents to the Wolfpack Renegades (the 1992 catalogue diorama shows <b>Black</b> <b>Knights</b> soldiers pursuing a Wolfpack Renegade wagon, while the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight's</b> Castle contains a Wolfpack figure as a prisoner) and Dragon Masters (the 1993 catalogue diorama shows Majisto the Wizard on a dragon engaging the <b>Black</b> <b>Knights).</b> Like the <b>Black</b> Falcons and Lion Knights/Crusaders ...|$|R

50|$|The Wolfpack {{was one of}} the {{official}} opponents of the <b>Black</b> <b>Knights</b> during its short run, as the 1992 catalogue diorama shows <b>Black</b> <b>Knights</b> soldiers pursuing a Wolfpack Renegade wagon, while the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight's</b> Castle contains a Wolfpack figure as a prisoner. Unlike the Forestmen who were never stated as being good or evil, most Lego literature implied that the Wolfpack were amoral outlaws.|$|R
5|$|According {{to popular}} tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was {{lord of the}} manor in the mid-14thcentury and known as the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight,</b> was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first {{recorded}} occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|All four {{launches}} {{were conducted}} from Launch Area 5B at the Woomera Prohibited Area in Australia, which {{had previously been}} used as a test site for the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight</b> rocket. During the development programme, launch sites in Barbados, Uist and Norfolk were also considered. The launch sites at Uist and Norfolk were rejected because the former was too remote, while there was a risk that a rocket launched from the latter might drop spent stages on an oil rig in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|The move 6.Nf3 {{controls}} the e5-square {{in order to}} prepare the push f4–f5. Unlike after 5...Nec6, White {{does not have to}} fear 6...Bc5?!, which encounters difficulties after 7.f5! Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the <b>black</b> <b>knight</b> is already in danger of being lost to Qd1–g4 or Qd1–h5. Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn. One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.|$|E

5|$|The rook is {{then used}} to support a piece attack against White's castled King. Black can easily get several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The queen's arrival on the h4-square is {{facilitated}} {{by the absence of}} a white knight on the f3-square (that would otherwise cover the h4-square) and of a <b>black</b> <b>knight</b> on the f6-square (that would block the way for the black queen). If White tries to defend with h2–h3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's {{principal}} large-scale {{early works}} were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The <b>Black</b> <b>Knight,</b> King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on {{the qualities of}} his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, {{appeared to be a}} sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{house in}} Lower Broadheath where Elgar was born {{is now the}} Elgar Birthplace Museum, devoted to his life and work.

Carice left Elgar manuscripts to musical colleges: The <b>Black</b> <b>Knight</b> to Trinity College of Music; King Olaf to the Royal Academy of Music; The Music Makers to Birmingham University; the Cello Concerto to the Royal College of Music; The Kingdom to the Bodleian Library; and other manuscripts to the British Museum.

Firion, Maria, and Guy are rescued by Princess Hilda, who has established a rebel base {{in the town of}} Altair after her kingdom of Fynn was invaded by the Emperor. Hilda denies their request to join the rebel army because they are too young and inexperienced. The three set off for Fynn in search of Leon; there they find a dying Prince Scott of Kashuan, Hilda's fiancé, who informs them that a former knight of Fynn, Borghen, betrayed the rebellion and became a General in the Imperial army. The party returns to Altair to inform Hilda. She allows the group to join the rebellion and asks them to journey north to find mythril, a metal which could be used to create powerful weapons. The party makes its way north to the occupied village of Salamand, saves the villagers forced to work in the nearby mines, and retrieves the mythril.|$|E
5|$|There are forty six {{characters}} encountered {{through the}} story that can be recruited, each offering their own contribution to the story.

The <b>Black</b> <b>Knight’s</b> Pawn is distraught; his {{conscience}} is plaguing him; he feels a strong desire for absolution. The Fat Bishop suggests that the only course of action is for the <b>Black</b> <b>Knight’s</b> Pawn to kill the White Bishop’s Pawn—then he would be guilty of murder, a crime that is forgivable because it is listed in the book.

Arthur leaves after his encounter becomes a discussion about African and European swallows. Arthur encounters a <b>Black</b> <b>Knight,</b> who will not let them cross a small bridge.
