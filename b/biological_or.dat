5|$|An {{only child}} (single child) is one without any <b>biological</b> <b>or</b> adopted {{brothers}} or sisters. Single children are stereotypically portrayed as spoiled, self-centered, and selfish. Only children often perform better {{in school and}} in their careers than children with siblings.|$|E

The East Timorese Government {{has no plans}} to acquire nuclear, <b>biological</b> <b>or</b> chemical weapons. The country also became a party to the Ottawa Treaty, which bans anti-personnel mines, in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want the FBI {{to get the job}} done fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any <b>biological</b> <b>or</b> chemical agents in the subway.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen is not {{an energy}} resource, except in the {{hypothetical}} context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, <b>biological,</b> <b>or</b> electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland made {{detailed}} {{plans to}} acquire and test nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Less {{than two weeks}} after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Swiss government started studying the possibility of building nuclear weapons, and continued its military nuclear program for 43 years until 1988. It has since signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Switzerland never possessed <b>biological</b> <b>or</b> chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|This German {{immigrant}} {{described himself}} as the Associate Professor of Medical Psychology, Director of the Orgone Institute, President and research physician of the Wilhelm Reich Foundation and discoverer of <b>biological</b> <b>or</b> life energy. A 1940 security investigation was begun {{to determine the extent}} of Reich's communist commitments. A board of Alien Enemy Hearing judged that Dr. Reich was not a threat to the security of the U.S. In 1947, a security investigation concluded that neither the Orgone Project nor any of its staff were engaged in subversive activities or were in violation of any statute within the jurisdiction of the FBI.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control {{in order to keep}} its populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can be very difficult to eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, <b>biological</b> <b>or</b> chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|After {{coming of}} age, the Avatar is sent by Garon to inspect a Hoshidan {{fortress}} above the Bottomless Canyon. However, one of Garon's men, Hans, provokes {{a battle with}} the Hoshidans and throws the Avatar's mentor Gunter into the Canyon. The Avatar is found and captured by Hoshidan soldiers, who recognize them as a long-lost member of the Hoshidan royal family. The Avatar is brought to meet their blood relatives and Azura at the capital city. However, soldiers attack the city and a hooded assassin attempts to kill the Avatar. Mikoto shields them {{at the cost of}} her life. In the aftermath, the Avatar comes into possession of a legendary sword called Yato, said to belong to the one who will save the world. In the opening battle between the two kingdoms, the Avatar's two families meet, and the Avatar is forced to choose between siding with Hoshido and Nohr. In the Birthright and Conquest routes, the Avatar chooses either their <b>biological</b> <b>or</b> adopted family, respectively. This causes them to be denounced by the other side, and they are gradually forced to fight them.|$|E

Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family. The age group for parents ranges from teenage parents to grandparents who have decided to raise their grandchildren, with teenage pregnancies fluctuating based on race and culture. Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|R
