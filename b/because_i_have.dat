When the battle commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest, but collapsed within a short distance. His last words, according to Herodotus, were, [...] "I grieve not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to die for my country, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not lifted my arm against the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Dexter's Laboratory premiered to {{widespread}} critical acclaim. One of Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen's favorite animated shows was Dexter's Laboratory.

500|$|Ghosts of Onyx author Eric Nylund had {{previously}} written {{two of the}} three past Halo novels, [...] and , and went to Halos developer Bungie with an outline of {{what he wanted to do}} next. According to Nylund, Bungie gave him room to write the story as long as he accomplished some [...] "very specific [...] goals", sometimes making changes to the Halo universe to incorporate his ideas. However, he acknowledged the difficulty of fitting his story into the rest of the Halo universe was far greater for Ghosts of Onyx than the other novels as more of the story had been made public and was no longer able to be modified. Nylund mentioned in an interview with IGN that writing a Halo novel had both its positive aspects and drawbacks. [...] "It's better <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> all these great toys and characters to play with," [...] Nylund stated in an interview, [...] "It's not so good <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to work and play well with other parts of the intellectual property so everything meshes." ...|$|E

In May, the Pakistani Army moved into the region to regain control during the Second Battle of Swat. Mingora was evacuated and Yousafzai's family was displaced and separated. Her father went to Peshawar to protest and lobby for support, while she was sent into the countryside to live with relatives.

500|$|Larter took on {{the title}} role in Marigold (2007), {{alongside}} Salman Khan. The film was released in August 2007 and revolved around an American actress (Larter) who goes to India and gets {{caught up in the}} exotic world of Bollywood. Filming took place in North India and London, commencing in June 2004. In an interview with the BBC, Larter remarked this role was [...] "an opportunity to overcome my fear of singing and dancing <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no professional training [...] I really focused on the character and loved this journey she went on and the experiences she had." [...] She was paid a seven-figure salary for her part in the film.|$|E

But we say to our friends outside: do not ask for pardon, do not ask for amnesty. Socialist civilization should not begin with an act of cowardice. We demand a condemnation, we do not ask for mercy.

500|$|On 2 October 2008 it was {{reported}} that Nick Cotton, played by John Altman would return to EastEnders in Christmas 2008. After spending time in Walsall, Nick would return with an eight-year-old daughter, Dotty. The part of Dotty was cast to Molly Conlin, speaking of her casting, Conlin said, [...] "I'm really excited about it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always wanted to be in EastEnders." [...] Conlin was considered too old for the part of Tiffany Dean which she a previously auditioned for but she succeeded in impressing the producers, who offered her the role of Dotty instead. The part of Tiffany went to Maisie Smith. Dotty was originally eleven years old, but on Conlin's casting, they changed her age to seven. Introduced as a guest character by Santer she made her first appearance on 25 December 2008.|$|E

500|$|Stevenson {{described}} {{the character of}} Marion as [...] "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone has made her [...] "become quite idiotic and eccentric". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that [...] "Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right" [...] which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away. Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying [...] "it is easier for me than someone like Marion <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had 14 years experience". Richards spoke {{of the character of}} April, saying that [...] "the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life. [...] doesn't feel connected to anybody and she struggles to know who she is".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music {{publishing}} company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. This deal {{gave him the}} rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others. In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the Associated Press in Tokyo, where he said: [...] "I've been {{in the entertainment industry}} since I was 6 years old, and as Charles Dickens would say, 'It's been the best of times, the worst of times.' But I would not change my career ... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, I take it in stride <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me." [...] That month, Jackson visited a U.S. Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet over 3,000 U.S. troops and their families. The hosts presented Jackson with a Certificate of Appreciation.|$|E
500|$|Matt Pryor {{continued}} {{as part of}} The New Amsterdams, an acoustic alt-country group he had formed in 2000, expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving-door lineup. In 2007 he formed The Terrible Twos, a children's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records. Regarding the decision to make a children's album directly after the split, Pryor said [...] "I {{wanted to do it}} anyway <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> kids and I want to write songs for them, but nobody {{is going to be like}} 'this isn't as good as the old stuff.' It's immune to punk criticism." [...] In July 2008, he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of Confidence Man, an alt-country release similar in sound to The New Amsterdams. After his second album, May Day, Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding The New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career, concluding the band's tenure with the release of Outroduction, a B-sides recording.|$|E

500|$|While {{he appears}} to have been {{attracted}} to young women throughout his life, and there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice, there is no suggestion that he ever had a sexual relationship with Betsy of any kind. He recorded in his diary in 1830 that [...] "it is best I have not married <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not noisy Children and can have nice Books, and Pictures etc". He suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life, and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout, although he was popular with fellow artists and students. Etty rarely socialised, preferring to concentrate on his painting; when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes, he indignantly replied that [...] "it fills up a couple of hours in the evening, I should be at a loss how else to employ".|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1937, Marie fell ill. Her {{personal}} physician, Dr. Castellani, determined she had pancreatic cancer, although her official diagnosis was cirrhosis of the liver. Marie {{had not been a}} drinker and, upon hearing the news, she reportedly said: [...] "then there must be a non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never in my life tasted alcohol." [...] She was prescribed a diet of cold foods, injections and bed rest. Marie was so weak at times that she could not even pick up a pen. In February 1938, she was sent to a sanatorium in Italy, in hopes that she might recover. There, she was visited by Nicholas and his wife, whom Marie eventually forgave for her transgressions. She was also visited by Princess Helen, whom she had not seen in nearly seven years, and Waldorf Astor. Marie was eventually transferred to a sanatorium in Dresden. Growing weaker and weaker, she requested that she be taken back to Romania, in order to die there. Carol denied her a journey by aeroplane, and she declined a medical flight offered by Hitler, instead choosing to return to Romania by train. She was brought to Pelișor Castle.|$|E
500|$|As {{winners of}} the 1979 FA Cup Final, Arsenal entered the European Cup Winners' Cup in the 1979–80 season. The club {{defeated}} Fenerbahçe, 1. FC Magdeburg and IFK Göteborg, before facing Juventus in the semi-finals. After conceding an early penalty scored by Antonio Cabrini, Arsenal defender David O'Leary was injured and substituted in the 20th minute, when Juventus striker Roberto Bettega tackled him. Marco Tardelli was later sent off for a foul on Liam Brady and in the 85th minute, Arsenal managed to score an equaliser through a mix-up between Frank Stapleton and Bettega; the Italian put the ball into his goal net. Neill in his post-match comments expressed his anger over Bettega's tackle after the game: [...] "I was shocked by a most vicious foul. I was shocked <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always had the greatest admiration for him." [...] A headed goal by substitute Paul Vaessen two minutes from the end, in the second leg was enough to take Arsenal into the 1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, where they faced Valencia in Brussels. A goalless draw after normal and extra time meant the final was to be decided on a penalty shootout, with Valencia winning 5–4.|$|E
