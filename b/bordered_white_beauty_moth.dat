5000|$|Literary critic Lynn Scott {{contends that}} the {{constant}} images of whiteness in The Bluest Eye serve to represent society's perception of beauty, but the idealization of <b>white</b> <b>beauty</b> standards ultimately proves to have destructive consequences and leads to Pecola's demise. Scott explains that superiority, power, and virtue are associated with beauty, which is inherent in whiteness in the novel. She further asserts that <b>white</b> <b>beauty</b> standards are perpetuated by visual images in the media as well as attitudes of the family. When Pauline first arrives in Lorain, she feels pressure to conform to <b>white</b> <b>beauty</b> standards and begins to develop a construct of femininity based on the actresses she watches in the movies. For example, she begins to model her hairstyle after Jean Harlow. Pecola is also surrounded by constant images of whiteness that perpetuate <b>white</b> <b>beauty</b> standards, including references to Shirley Temple and an image of Mary Jane that appears on her candy wrappers. Scott claims that Pecola, [...] "...is {{the victim of a}} power that values and classifies bodies according to norms established and disseminated by visual images". These images become a constant reminder of her inability to attain these <b>white</b> <b>beauty</b> standards. Pecola attempts to seek the power associated with whiteness, and in her attempt to conform to these cultural ideals, she develops a destructive desire for blue eyes. In addition to the <b>white</b> <b>beauty</b> standards promoted by the media, Harihar Kulkarni, an author of a book on African American feminist fiction literature, recognizes that these ideals are often transferred generationally. Kulkarni asserts that Pecola's feelings of inferiority are linked to Pauline's own diminished sense of self-worth which she has acquired due to her obsession with <b>white</b> <b>beauty</b> standards. This acceptance of inferiority and ugliness, which has been passed on generationally, makes Pauline complicit in Pecola's descent into madness and the psychological damage she experiences. In contrast, Claudia has maintained her self-esteem due to Mrs. MacTeer's refusal to surrender her sense of identity to white cultural standards. Ultimately, Pauline and Pecola develop a sense of shame and internalized self-hatred since they cannot achieve the beauty ideals that exist in society. This shame is particularly damaging for Pecola, because as Pecola strives to attain these unobtainable <b>white</b> <b>beauty</b> standards, she is consumed by her own destructive self-hatred, resulting in irreversible psychological damage.|$|R

40|$|The {{community}} {{composition of}} Carabid beetles, some species {{of which are}} known predators of pine <b>beauty</b> <b>moth,</b> was examined within a Scottish plantation forest. Sites differing in soil type and the species of trees planted were sampled with pitfall traps in most weeks of a 3 -year period. There were faunal differences between sites with lodgepole pine on deep peat and other sites in the study (lodgepole pine on iron-pan soil, species mixture of lodgepole and Scots pine, and pure stands of Scots pine). In general deep peat sites supported fewer species and individuals of carabids. Three Carabus species were implicated as likely predators of Panolis flammea pupae and each was less abundant on the sites with lodgepole pine. It is suggested that the susceptibility to pine <b>beauty</b> <b>moth</b> of lodgepole pine growing on deep peat substrates is at least partly attributable to impoverished predator faunas...|$|R

It argues that Ponds’ definition of a beauty only refers to physical standards, that is, women who have white skin and use both Ponds <b>White</b> <b>Beauty</b> Facial Foam and Foam Body Lotion. Further, television through Ponds advertising is considered as a commercial institution that supports the main idea of capitalism.
