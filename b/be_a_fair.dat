Captain Preston immediately called out most of the 29th Regiment, which adopted defensive positions in front of the state house. Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson was summoned to the scene, and was forced by the movement of the crowd into the council chamber of the state house. From its balcony he was able to minimally restore order, promising there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> inquiry into the shootings if the crowd dispersed.|$|E
5|$|England beat Argentina 1–0 in {{the last}} eight, with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header; the match was sullied by the first-half sending off of Argentinian midfielder Antonio Rattín, who refused to leave the pitch after being {{dismissed}} for dissent. In contrast to the previous games, the semi-final against Portugal proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> contest between two sides of talented players eager to attack {{from the start of}} the match. Yet there was panic in the buildup to the game as trainer Harold Shepherdson forgot to buy chewing gum, which Banks used to make his hands stickier and better able to handle the ball, and so Shepherdson had to run to a nearby newsagents to purchase gum as the teams were in the tunnel. Bobby Charlton scored two goals, but Portugal made a strong finish and won a penalty on 82 minutes after Jack Charlton handled the ball in the penalty area. Eusébio converted the penalty after sending Banks the wrong way, and the game finished 2–1 in England's favour. This was the first goal Banks had conceded for England in 721 minutes of regular play, since giving up Scotland's last goal after 81 minutes of the Home International clash in April. This remains a record for an England goalkeeper.|$|E

The importance of the credibility of these members among their own religious groups and in the larger society was raised. There were also differing opinions as to whether non-religious persons should be made members of the PCRH. Another concern was that the composition of the PCRH should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> representation of all the major religions in Singapore. It was pointed out that the diversity within religions such as Christianity made it difficult for fair representation and might lead to the exclusion of smaller and independent religious bodies.|$|E

25|$|Rather than accept court {{appointed}} counsel, Vanzetti {{chose to}} be represented by John P. Vahey, an experienced defense attorney, and James Graham, who was recommended by supporters. Frederick G. Katzmann, the Norfolk and Plymouth County District Attorney, prosecuted the case. The presiding judge was Webster Thayer, who was already assigned to the court before this case was scheduled. A few weeks earlier he had given a speech to new American citizens decrying Bolshevism and anarchism's threat to American institutions. He supported the suppression of functionally violent radical speech, and incitement to commit violent acts.

National Chief of the AFN, Phil Fontaine, said the package was meant to cover [...] "decades in time, innumerable events and countless injuries to First Nations individuals and communities". Justice Minister Irwin Cotler applauded the compensation decision noting that the placement of children in the residential school system was [...] "the single most harmful, disgraceful and racist act in our history". At an Ottawa news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan said: [...] "We have made good on our shared resolve to deliver what I firmly believe will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> and lasting resolution of the Indian school legacy." ...|$|E

When peace was announced following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Gage began lobbying for another posting, as he was [...] "very much [...] of this cursed Climate, and I must be bribed very high to stay here any longer". [...] In October 1763 the good news arrived that he would act as commander-in-chief of North America while Amherst was on leave in Britain. He immediately left Montreal, and took over Amherst's command in New York on 17 November 1763.

The US Senator Hillary Clinton joined with PMW for the release of the report written by PMW director Itamar Marcus and associate director Barbara Crook. Sen.

Mrs Fletcher said: [...] "I know he is ill and I think he should be returned to a prison in Libya so his family can visit him. The appeal could still go ahead in Scotland, but he could stay in prison in Libya. It's got to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> exchange, so Yvonne's case can be closed.

Critics {{of the decision to}} take down the exhibition denounced it as [...] "censorship". Naomi Klein and Aaron Maté wrote that it is [...] "part of a disturbing pattern to silence opposition to the expansionist Israeli occupation of the Occupied Territories".

Berry had appeared in a couple of films prior to being cast in Boomerang. However, after Berry performed her screen test, Murphy told Hudlin [...] "well, that's it. There's no need to see the other two actresses because she's the part." [...] Executives at Paramount Pictures were nervous about Robin Givens being cast in such {{a major role in the}} film, as she was disliked by many in the general public at the time because of her past relationship with Mike Tyson. Hudlin however, [...] "thought that actually made her perfect for the role, that she was this formidable person, and a match for Eddie Murphy, who also had an increpid reputation as a ladies' man.

It was a bad reaction on my part. If I had received any penalties because of it, it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> sanction, {{but it was not}} given. However, the sanction set after the game against the Pistons is totally unfair. I see it as a totally real play taken out of context in the game — absolutely nothing happened. It was an accidental blow. Without purposely trying to, I hit him. I apologized on the court. I also asked Carlos Delfino to give my apologies to him, so I don't understand why there is a sanction for something totally normal in a game." [...] In Nocioni's first NBA playoff game, he scored 25 points and grabbed 18 rebounds while playing all 48minutes. Due to his outstanding play, the sold-out United Center crowd in Chicago chanted his name. This game solidified Nocioni's status as a Chicago favorite.|$|E
