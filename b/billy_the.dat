5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, and <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid. Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E

5|$|Already {{a friend}} of the {{composer}} Aaron Copland, Britten encountered his latest works <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid and An Outdoor Overture, both of which influenced his own music. In 1940 Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, the first of many song cycles for Pears. Britten's orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto and Sinfonia da Requiem. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, Paul Bunyan, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden. While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese gamelan music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording. This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career.|$|E
5|$|On {{the fiftieth}} anniversary of VE Day in 1995, Betty is reunited with her wartime {{sweetheart}} <b>Billy.</b> <b>The</b> two marry several months later, and Gordon gives his mother away. They live happily together until Billy also dies {{of a heart}} attack in 1997. Betty becomes famous in Weatherfield for her hotpots, which come under scrutiny in the early 1990s when it is believed that they are contaminated. She is cleared of all wrongdoing when it is discovered that beer, not food, is responsible for a spate of stomach upsets. Betty acts as lady mayoress alongside mayor Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) when his wife Audrey (Sue Nicholls) has no interest in fulfilling her civic duties. This includes accompanying him to receive his OBE from the Queen, much to Audrey's chagrin.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and drew heavily from the {{conventions}} of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), and John Sturges' film The Magnificent Seven (1960). Sholay was also influenced by the westerns of Sam Peckinpah, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid (1973); and by George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery {{was inspired by a}} similar scene in North West Frontier (1959), and a scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in Once Upon a Time in the West. Some plot elements were borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973).|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Hawks {{returned}} to the screwball comedy genre with His Girl Friday, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. The film was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play The Front Page by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, which had already been made into a film in 1931 and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to Rudyard Kipling's India for Gunga Din in 1939. In 1941, Hawks made Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated World War I soldier. This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two Academy Awards (Best Actor and Best Editing), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for Best Director. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for Ball of Fire, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck. The film was written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett and is a playful take on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck {{to help them with}} modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the Howard Hughes-produced (and later directed) film The Outlaw, based on the life of <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid and starring Jane Russell. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood Production Code, Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.|$|E

25|$|With the {{publication}} in 1926 of Walter Noble Burns's book,"The Saga of <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid", the Kid's legend revived and was consolidated {{as a standard}} tale of the American Old West. The American movie director King Vidor, who had wanted to film a Western-themed movie for some time, was inspired when he read Burns's book, and felt that the Kid's story had considerable dramatic appeal. Following the commercial success of the first movie he directed for the Metro Goldwyn Mayer studio, The Big Parade (1925), {{he was able to}} obtain backing for a <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid production when Irving Thalberg, an executive at MGM, took an interest in his proposal. <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid, the first talking picture version of the legend, was released in 1930. The film featured former college football star Johnny Mack Brown in the title role and Hollywood character actor Wallace Beery as Pat Garrett, but it was a box office failure. Nevertheless, Vidor's <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid set the pattern for <b>Billy</b> <b>the</b> Kid movies for the next fifty years, as other filmmakers followed its formula and made the Kid an instrument of justified vengeance and his enemies the villains of the story.|$|E
