5|$|Interest rate parity {{rests on}} certain assumptions, the first being that capital is mobile - investors can readily {{exchange}} domestic assets for foreign assets. The second {{assumption is that}} assets have perfect substitutability, following from their similarities in riskiness and liquidity. Given capital mobility and perfect substitutability, investors {{would be expected to}} hold those assets offering greater returns, be they domestic or foreign assets. However, both domestic and foreign assets are held by investors. Therefore, it must <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> no difference can exist between the returns on domestic assets and the returns on foreign assets. That {{is not to say that}} domestic investors and foreign investors will earn equivalent returns, but that a single investor on any given side would expect to earn equivalent returns from either investment decision.|$|E

25|$|The many anecdotes about Democritus, {{especially}} in Diogenes Laërtius, attest to his disinterest, modesty, and simplicity, {{and show that}} he lived exclusively for his studies. One story has him deliberately blinding himself {{in order to be}} less disturbed in his pursuits; it may well <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> he lost his sight in old age. He was cheerful, and was always ready to see the comical side of life, which later writers took to mean that he always laughed at the foolishness of people.|$|E

25|$|In other {{situations}} the delusion {{may turn out}} to be true belief. For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.|$|E
25|$|Both {{regular and}} {{irregular}} involvement in sports leisure {{can result in}} heightened SWB. Serious, or systematic involvement in certain leisure activities, such as taekwondo, correlates with personal growth {{and a sense of}} happiness. Additionally, more irregular (e.g. seasonal) sports activities, such as skiing, are also correlated with high SWB. Furthermore, the relationship between pleasure and skiing is thought to be caused in part by a sense of flow and involvement with the activity. Leisure activities, such as meeting with friends, participating in sports, and going on vacation trips, positively correlate with life satisfaction. It may also <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> going on a vacation makes our lives seem better, but does not necessarily make us happier in the long term. Research regarding vacationing or taking a holiday trip is mixed. Although the reported effects are mostly small, some evidence points to higher levels of SWB, or happiness, after taking a holiday.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} {{known as}} food sovereignty views the business practices of multinational corporations {{as a form}} of neocolonialism. It contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations, particularly in the tropics. They also have the political clout to convert these resources to the exclusive production of cash crops for sale to industrialized nations outside of the tropics, and in the process to squeeze the poor off of the more productive lands. Under this view subsistence farmers are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations. Likewise, food sovereignty holds it to <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right. With several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries, technologies that include improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue. Many communities calling for food sovereignty are protesting the imposition of Western technologies on to their indigenous systems and agency.|$|E

25|$|Burges was {{descended from}} the Burges or Bruges family of Batcombe, Somerset, was {{probably}} born in 1589. He was a son of Robert Burges (d. 1626) of Stanton Drew, Somerset and Alice Benbrick. Burges had brothers James and John, who remained at Stanton Drew, and a sister Hester who married Samuel Sherman of Dedham, Essex. In 1611 he was entered at Oxford, but at what college is unknown. He was transferred to Wadham College, Oxford, and graduated B.A. on 5 July 1615, and thence migrated to Lincoln College, Oxford, {{of which he was}} a member when he graduated M.A. on 20 April 1618. He must have taken orders before graduation, if it <b>be</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> on 21 Dec. 1613 he obtained the vicarage of Watford, Hertfordshire, on the presentation of Sir Charles Morison. On 16 Jan. 1626 he was allowed to hold, along with Watford, the rectory of St. Magnus, London Bridge. This latter he resigned in 1641, his successor being admitted on 20 July. Soon after the accession of Charles I he was made one of the king's chaplains in ordinary, and on 16 June 1627 he was made B.D. and D.D. by his university.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{compared}} Eliot to Yeats.

[...] Eliot believed that such a system is stuck within time. Eliot was influenced by Yeats's reading of Dante. This appears in Eliot's Ash-Wednesday by changing Yeats's [...] "desire for absolution" [...] away from a humanistic approach. When Eliot wrote about personal topics, he tended to use Dante as a reference point. He also relied on Dante's imagery: the idea of the [...] "refining fire" [...] in the Four Quartets and in The Waste Land comes from Purgatorio, and the celestial rose and fire imagery of Paradiso makes its way into the series.|$|E
500|$|Central to Colbert's {{personality}} is his rigid belief that [...] "what I say is right, and [...] anyone else says {{could possibly be}} true", regardless of any evidence to the contrary.

He has further gone on to ascribe [...] "truthiness" [...] to other institutions including Wikipedia, which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to [...] "change reality". Colbert believes that if a majority of people want something to <b>be</b> <b>true,</b> <b>that</b> thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at global warming, Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the box office success of An Inconvenient Truth, a sign that [...] "the free market has spoken".|$|E
