25|$|Cynthia's {{return to}} her <b>birth</b> <b>family</b> {{captured}} the country's imagination. Tens of thousands of Texan families, and many more throughout the U.S., had suffered the loss of family members, especially children, in Indian raids. She was the granddaughter of a famous American patriot, a Marylander who had met a violent end in far-off Texas. This gained her special attention and gave hope {{to those who had}} lost relatives to the Comanche. In 1861, the Texas legislature granted her a league (about 4,400 acres) of land and an annual pension of $100 for the next five years, and made her cousins, Isaac Duke Parker and Benjamin F. Parker, her legal guardians.|$|E
25|$|Jedda, in the screenplay, is an Aboriginal girl {{adopted by}} a white station owner's wife to replace her own child that had died (coincidentally, the station owner's surname, McMann, is a {{variation}} of the Irish surname McMahon). Deliberately isolated from all contact with her <b>birth</b> <b>family</b> and relations, Jedda, is unsure of her identity until she meets Marbuck, a tribal Aboriginal man in trouble with the European system of justice. She is seduced by his intense didgeridoo playing but their elopement into the wilderness ends in tragedy when Marbuck's tribe rejects him for having broken its own laws regarding marriage.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the experiences of}} adult adoptees in New Zealand who have instigated a search for and established contact with members of their <b>birth</b> <b>families.</b> A qualitative research method, specifically that of grounded theory, {{was used for the}} collection and analysis of data. Data was gathered through in depth interviews and a study of the existing literature on search and adoption reunions. The present study focuses on the reasons for and expectations regarding searching and the psychological process involved for adult adoptees who have searched and contacted members of their <b>birth</b> <b>families.</b> The findings of the present study indicate that adult adoptee's search for their <b>birth</b> <b>families</b> in response to a life long need for personal identity. The actual psychological process of search {{can be seen as a}} series of stages, incorporating elements of adventure, cure and growth. Over time, the nature of the relationships established with birth relatives undergo changes and become less intense. Regardless of the current relationship with birth relatives, all the adoptees found that the process of search and reunion was beneficial and increased their sense of identity...|$|R
40|$|This review surveys sociological {{literature}} on intercountry adoption from 1997 to 2010. The analysis finds {{a preponderance of}} literature from the United States, reflecting its place as a major receiving country, and a focus on adoption experience organised by reference to the adoption triad: adoptive parents, adoptees, <b>birth</b> <b>families.</b> Reflecting the power imbalances in intercountry adoption, the voices and views of adoptive parents dominate the literature. There is an emerging literature generated by researchers who are intercountry adoptees, while <b>birth</b> <b>families</b> remain almost invisible in this literature. A further gap identified by this review is work which examines intercountry adoption as a global social practice and work which critically examines polic...|$|R
25|$|Mary Hanford Ford's {{earliest}} days are framed in two basic sets of facts. First, of her <b>birth</b> <b>family,</b> {{she was born}} on November 1, 1856, possibly to a mercantile/banker family in Meadville, Pennsylvania. The family was noted a year later in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The Kansas City Star obituary noted she had a brother, A.M. Finney, known from Charleston, West Virginia. That would make her father Asahel Clark Finney who spent the last working decade of {{his life as a}} partner in a Pennsylvania lumber company. Ford's mother may have been Mary Hanford Edson. Ford was said to have attended a private school or seminary and studied art and languages in Burlington, Vermont. It is not clear how or when Mary moved to the Kansas area ahead of her father in 1882. Secondly, of her married life, Ford was the second wife of Smith Moses Ford, marrying about October 8, 1878, when she was known as Minnie Finnie and was living in Winfield, Kansas. S.M. Ford was a former alderman, teacher, newspaper writer and eventually newspaper publisher. Their first child, Roland Ford, was born circa 1879.|$|E
500|$|Sherman's <b>birth</b> <b>family</b> was Presbyterian {{and he was}} {{originally}} baptized as such. [...] His foster family, including his future wife Ellen, were devout Catholics, and Sherman was re-baptized and later married in the Catholic rite. [...] According to his son Thomas, who became a Catholic priest, Sherman attended the Catholic Church until {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, but not thereafter. In 1888, Sherman wrote publicly that [...] "my immediate family are strongly Catholic. I am not and cannot be." [...] A memoirist reports that Sherman told him in 1887 that [...] "my family is strongly Roman Catholic, but I am not." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his second}} release, Khalid Mohammed's crime drama Fiza, Roshan played Amaan, an {{innocent}} Muslim boy {{who becomes a}} terrorist after the 1992–93 Bombay riots. Roshan appeared in the film to expand his horizons as an actor. Co-starring Karisma Kapoor and Jaya Bachchan, Fiza was moderately successful at the box office, and Roshan's performance earned him a second nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised him as the production's prime asset, commending his [...] "body language, his diction, his expressions, [...] his overall persona". Roshan next appeared in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's action drama Mission Kashmir (2000) alongside Sanjay Dutt, Preity Zinta, and Jackie Shroff. Set in the valley of Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani conflicts, the film addressed the topics of terrorism and crime, and was a financial success. Roshan was drawn to his complex role {{of a young man}} traumatised by the discovery that his adoptive father had been {{responsible for the death of}} his entire <b>birth</b> <b>family.</b> In Adarsh's opinion, Roshan [...] "brightens up the screen with his magnetic presence. His body language, coupled with his expressions, is sure to win him plaudits." ...|$|E

50|$|The Children's Rights Director in England {{found that}} 71% of adopted {{children}} {{thought it was}} important to know about their lives before adoption. Specific questions that these children wanted answers to included why they were adopted and why they could not stay with <b>birth</b> <b>families.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Another common {{feeling that}} {{many people who are}} adopted deal with is a feeling of guilt. This guilt is felt towards both their birth {{families}} as well as their adoptive families. They may feel guilty towards their <b>birth</b> <b>family</b> because in many ways, they have accepted their adoptive family as their own and would not want their <b>birth</b> <b>family</b> to be upset or jealous. Many adoptees call their adoptive parents [...] "mom" [...] and [...] "dad" [...] and refer to adoptive siblings as such, which adoptees feel may hurt their biological families, should they find out. The sense of guilt towards adoptive parents comes from curiosity about biological families. Adoptees often feel that any curiosity about their origins and their birth families may hurt their adoptive one. They believe that the adoptive family will feel a sense of betrayal for wanting to know about where they came from, especially if the adoption allows for access to such information. Adoptees may also fear that their adoptive family may love them less because of their curiosity.|$|E
2500|$|Realizing Cynthia had {{forgotten}} {{most of her}} English and would be unhappy if separated from the life she knew, some Rangers urged Ross to let her return to the Comanches, but he felt it best to try to return her to her <b>birth</b> <b>family.</b> He sent her and her child to Camp Cooper. He then notified her uncle, Colonel Isaac Parker. When Colonel Parker mentioned that his niece's name was Cynthia, she slapped her chest and said, [...] "Me Cincee Ann."

The psychiatrist said he would reduce the Effexor from 450 mg to 300 mg. He protested and quoted his own extensive research on the antidepressant. He said he read it shouldn't be reduced by more than 75 mg every three or four days, not 150 mg in one day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Morrison's {{portrayal}} of Emma has received praise, with some reviewers noting a feminist {{twist in the}} depiction of fairy tales and a strong female lead.

2500|$|In 1997, the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) was passed. This {{reduced the}} time {{children}} {{are allowed to}} remain in foster care before being available for adoption. The new law requires state child welfare agencies to identify cases where [...] "aggravated circumstances" [...] make permanent separation of child from the <b>birth</b> <b>family</b> the best option for the safety and well-being of the child. One of {{the main components of}} ASFA is the imposition of stricter time limits on reunification efforts. Proponents of ASFA claimed that before the law was passed, the lack of such legislation was the reason it was common for children to languish in care for years with no permanent living situation identified.|$|E
2500|$|In Argentina, {{normally}} {{only one}} family name, the father's paternal family name, is used and registered, as in English-speaking countries. However, {{it is possible}} to use both the paternal and maternal name. For example, if Ana Laura Melachenko and Emanuel Darío Guerrero had a daughter named Adabel Anahí, her full name could be Adabel Anahí Guerrero Melachenko. Women, however, do not change their family names upon marriage and continue to use their <b>birth</b> <b>family</b> names instead of their husband's family names. However, women have traditionally, and some still choose to use the old Spanish custom of adjoining [...] "de" [...] and her husband's surname to her own name. For example, if Paula Segovia marries Felipe Cossia, she might keep her birth name or become Paula Segovia de Cossia or Paula Cossia.|$|E
