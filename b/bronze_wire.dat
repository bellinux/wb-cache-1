40|$|The {{variation}} of Tc and Jc {{for a series}} of binary and ternary alloyed Nb 3 Sn wires of the RRP and PIT type has been investigated after fast neutron irradiation (E>; 0. 1 MeV) at the TRIGA reactor in Vienna up to a fluence of φt = 1. 4 × 1022 m- 2. In contrast to Ti alloyed bronze route Nb 3 Sn wires, where a maximum is observed at around 0. 4 × 1022 m- 2, {{it was found that the}} maximum of (Jc/Jc 0) versus φt in the present ternary alloyed wires was still not reached. A comparison with an earlier study on <b>bronze</b> route <b>wires</b> at RTNS-II shows that the variations of Tc versus φt and Jc versus φt do not scale: a substantially higher Jc value is now observed for the same Tc value. The degree of atomic ordering being comparable, the shift of the maximum of Jc/Jc 0 with fluence is attributed to radiation induced “defect clusters. ” Two observations are used for explaining the observed effect: (a) a shift of (Jc/Jc 0) max toward higher fields, observed for binary <b>bronze</b> <b>wires</b> with higher Sn contents and (b) by calorimetry, the average of the Tc distribution in the filaments of RRP and PIT wires is found to occur at values up to 1. 5 K higher than in <b>bronze</b> <b>wires.</b> The present data suggest that the effect of “defect clusters” is higher for wires with higher average Sn contents...|$|R

Another common generic name is screw thread insert (STI), although many users persist in calling them all by a prominent brand name, the registered trademark Heli-Coil. Applications include engine cylinder head repair after unintentional over-torquing or cross-threading of spark plugs strips the thread of the socket. Kits with matched tap and coil exist for this.

5000|$|Tanpuras come in {{different}} sizes and pitches: larger [...] "males", smaller [...] "females" [...] for vocalists, and a yet smaller version {{is used for}} accompanying sitar or sarod, called tamburi. These play at the octave {{so as not to}} drown out the soloist's lower registers. Male vocalists use the biggest instruments and pitch their tonic note (Sa), often at D, C or lower, some go down to B-flat; female singers usually a fifth higher, though these tonic notes may vary according to the preference of the singer, as there is no absolute and fixed pitch-reference in the Indian Classical music systems. One female singer may take her 'sa' at F, another at A, sitariyas tune mostly around C, sarodiyas around C, sarangiyas vary more between D and F, and bansuriyas mostly play from E. The male tanpura has an open string length of approximately one metre; the female is three-fourths of the male. The standard tuning is 5-8-8-1 (so do′ do′ do) or, in Indian sargam, Pa-sa-sa-Sa. For ragas that omit the fifth tone, pa, the first string is tuned down to the natural fourth: 4-8-8-1 or Ma-sa-sa-Sa. Some ragas require a less common tuning with shuddh or komal NI (7th major/minor), NI-sa-sa-SA or 7-8-8-1, or even with the 6th, Dha-s-s-S, major or minor. With a five-string instrument, the seventh or NI (natural minor or major 7th) can be added: PA-NI-sa-sa-SA (5-7-8-8-1)or MA-NI-sa-sa-SA (4-7-8-8-1). Both minor and major 7th harmonics are clearly distinguishable in the harmonic texture of the overall sound, so when the Ni - strings are tuned into these harmonics, the resultant sound will be perfectly harmonious. Usually the octave strings are in steel wire, and the tonic, 4th or 5th strings in brass or <b>bronze</b> <b>wire.</b> If a string will be tuned to the 6th or 7th, a steel string is advised instead.|$|E
40|$|Magnetization {{measurements}} are relevant tests for {{the characterization of}} superconductors. Practically {{they are the only}} measurements that allow estimating the critical current density at low fields of low temperature superconductors, the effective filament size and the hysteresis losses. For this purpose CERN, in collaboration with the University of Geneva, has carried out magnetization measurements on five types of Nb 3 Sn wires: three bronze route strands used in the ITER project; one Powder In Tube (PIT) and one Internal Tin (IT) wires used for developing next generation accelerator magnets. The field dependent magnetization has been determined using three setups: a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) and a special system used for the production control of LHC strands.

5000|$|Cataphracts {{were almost}} universally clad {{in some form}} of scale armor (φαλιδωτός Falidotos, {{equivalent}} to the Roman Lorica squamata) that was flexible enough to give the rider and horse a good degree of motion, but strong enough to resist the immense impact of a thunderous charge into infantry formations. Scale armor was made from overlapping, rounded plates of bronze or iron (varying in thickness from four to six millimeters), which had two or four holes drilled into the sides, to be threaded with a <b>bronze</b> <b>wire</b> that was then sewn onto an undergarment of leather or animal hide, worn by the horse. A full set of cataphract armor consisted of approximately 1,300 or so [...] "scales" [...] and could weigh an astonishing 40 kilograms or 88 pounds (not inclusive of the rider's body weight). Less commonly, plated mail or lamellar armor (which is similar in appearance but divergent in design, as it has no backing) was substituted for scale armor, while {{for the most part the}} rider wore chain mail. Specifically, the horse armor was usually sectional (not joined together as a cohesive [...] "suit"), with large plates of scales tied together around the animal's waist, flank, shoulders, neck and head (especially along the breastplate of the saddle) independently to give a further degree of movement for the horse and to allow the armor to be affixed to the horse reasonably tightly so that it should not loosen too much during movement. Usually but not always, a close-fitting helmet that covered the head and neck was worn by the rider; the Persian variants extended this even further and encased the wearer's entire head in metal, leaving only minute slits for the nose and eyes as openings.

40|$|The {{production}} of superconducting Nb 3 Sn multifilamentary wires with optimized critical currents requires a detailed knowledge of various processes, involving both the mechanical deformation {{and the reaction}} kinetics. The physical properties of the Nb 3 Sn phase are briefly reviewed, the precise knowledge of their variation {{as a function of}} the Sn content being essential for the optimization of the critical current density, Jc. The variation of the transition temperature Tc, the upper critical field, Bc 2 (0), and the normal state electric resistivity ρo, {{as a function of the}} Sn content, β, in the binary system Nb 1 −βSnβ is carefully analyzed. The effect of Ta, Ti and Ta + Ti additives to Nb 3 Sn on the physical properties is discussed in detail. Low temperature specific heat measurements are introduced for determining the Tc distribution inside Nb 3 Sn filaments while avoiding shielding effects. The microstructure of the superconducting phase in Bronze Route and Internal Sn Diffusion processed wires is studied, taking into account the unique microstructure of Bronze Route filaments, comprising an equiaxed and a columnar grain region, their areas being comparable. The Sn content increases gradually, from 18 to 22 at. % in columnar and from 22 to 25 at. % in equiaxed grains. Taking into account the equiaxed grains only in <b>Bronze</b> Route <b>wires,</b> it is found that the pinning force density FGB is essentially the same as in the superconducting part of Internal Sn and PIT wires. The lower values of the overall FGB in <b>Bronze</b> Route <b>wires</b> is due to the presence of columnar grains, with lower Tc and Bc 2. The presence of columnar grains also explains the deviation from linearity of the Kramer rule in <b>Bronze</b> Route <b>wires.</b> The mechanism leading to the variation of Jc vs. ε, where ε is the uniaxial applied strain, is correlated to the elastic tetragonal distortion of the A 15 phase in the filaments, caused by the matrix precompression or by Lorentz forces. The behavior of Jc (ε) is found to show systematic differences between Bronze Route and Internal Sn processed wires. Possible reasons for the stronger variation of Jc (ε) up to 21 T in Internal Sn wires are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Pulse tube {{refrigerators}} (PTR) are robust, rugged cryocoolers that do {{not have}} a moving component at their cold ends. They are often employed for cryogenic cooling of high performance electronics in space applications where reliability is paramount. Miniaturizing these refrigerators has been a subject of intense research interest because of the benefits of minimal size and weight for airborne operation and because miniature coolers would be an enabling technology for other applications. Despite much effort, the extent of possible PTR miniaturization is still uncertain. To partially remedy this, an investigation of the miniaturization of pulse tube refrigerators has been undertaken using several numerical modeling techniques. In support of these models, experiments were performed to determine directional hydrodynamic parameters characteristic of stacked screens of # 635 stainless steel and # 325 phosphor <b>bronze</b> <b>wire</b> mesh, two fine-mesh porous materials suitable for use in the regenerator and heat exchanger components of miniature PTRs. Complete system level and pulse tube component level CFD models incorporating these parameters were then employed to quantitatively estimate the effects of several phenomena expected to impact the performance of miniature PTRs. These included the presence of preferential flow paths in an annular region near the regenerator wall and increased viscous and thermal boundary layer thicknesses relative to the pulse tube diameter. The effects of tapering or chamfering the junctions between components of dissimilar diameters were also investigated. The results of these models were subsequently applied to produce successively smaller micro-scale PTR models having total volumes as small as 0. 141 cc for which sufficient net cooling was predicted to make operation at cryogenic temperatures feasible. The results of this investigation provide design criteria for miniaturized PTRs and establish the feasibility of their operation at frequencies up to 1000 Hz with dimensions roughly an order of magnitude smaller than those that have recently been demonstrated, provided that challenges related to their regenerator fillers and compressors can be addressed.

40|$|Tijekom ovogodišnje kampanje koja je uglavnom bila usredotočena na crkveni brod, istraženo je 118 grobova. Osim zanimljivih nalaza iz uglavnom kasnosrednjovjekovnih grobova, pronađeni su i drugi nalazi koji ukazuju na kompleksnost kontinuiteta istraživanog lokaliteta. Osobito su zanimljivi ulomci, vjerojatno, romaničkih kapitela jonskoga stila. Najstariji istraženi grobovi stariji su od crkve i pripadaju “groblju na redove”. Neki od njih imaju očuvanu grobnu arhitekturu. Još prije najstarijega groblja na ovome se prostoru nalazilo naselje o kojem svjedoče ostaci kulturnih slojeva pronađeni na terenu. Poslije završetka istraživanja arhitektonski su snimljeni ostaci otkrivene arhitekture koji su potom konsolidirani te konzervirani. In spring 2008, the Institute of Archaeolog y {{conducted}} the seventh stage of archaeological rescue excavations at the Stari grad site in Ivanec. This year’s quarterly excavations were also {{conducted at the}} initiative of the City of Ivanec. During the 2008 excavations, the church nave (Fig. 1) was completely excavated {{to the level of}} sterile soil. At the beginning of the excavations, a thick layer of yellow clay was distributed over almost the entire surface of the nave, on which a covering of unpolished stone tiles was laid. The threshold {{at the entrance to the}} church was excavated as well – the oldest part of the threshold and the door-post bases were made of a single piece of stone. The earliest burials were laid in the yellow clay layer. Two various bases of a yet unknown purpose were sunken into it along with the earliest excavated graves. The deceased found in them had their arms crossed over their chests or stomachs. All excavated graves were oriented in the east-west direction, and the deceased were laid on their backs with their heads turned westwards. The entire area under the yellow clay layer contained exceptionally mixed earth fillings. A group of younger graves, buried before the clay was laid, consists primarily of graves in which belt buckles were found, followed by those which damaged other younger graves when they were dug, and graves with traces of coffins. At this stage, the deceased were buried with their arms crossed over their chests or stomachs. In the middle phase, the deceased were buried with arms laid to their sides. In the graves of the middle group, there are no more coffin remains. Graves that had a stone covering on the burial rims are from the oldest stage. In the 2008 excavations, eight graves were found that were cut by the foundations of the church nave. It is important to point out that – similar to the previous year – the area of the sanctuary suggests the regular rows of burials of a row cemetery. In this oldest stage, the deceased were also laid with their arms parallel to their bodies. Where the new graves did not dig into the older layers, a layer of dark brown, exceptionally rich, hard and packed soil was identified first, with some charcoal and an admixture of crumbled mortar and little stones. Below it mostly a thin layer of mortar was found that is older than the excavated church. Under the mortar layer, a dark, almost black cultural layer remained partly preserved as well (SU 1000). In it, individual burials were found, along with smaller and larger pieces of house daub and fragments of pottery decorated by wavy lines. Out of the burials from SU 1000, the long and narrow imprints need to be pointed out, probably from beams. Below SU 1000, there was an equally compact and rich cultural layer, but brown (SU 1001). In it, plenty of daub fragments, some pottery fragments, and a fragment of blue glass, probably from a drinking glass, perhaps dating to Classical Antiquity – were found. Several smaller burials were identified as well. In the area north of the nave, six younger graves were excavated, as well. In some graves, belt pulleys were found. Child’s grave 177 (Fig. 3) was placed on a stone slab with a shallowly incised cross; the slab was damaged by the burial. This year, it was necessary to excavate the northern part of the sacristy, in which the sterile earth was somewhat deeper. Nine graves were excavated. In single graves, probably the remains of stone coverings were found. The burial of grave 105 merits special attention. The way, in which the bones from older graves are carefully arranged along its margins, and the fact that because of them the burial for this grave was obviously expanded, seem to speak in favour of greater care for the corporeal remains of deceased ancestors. In the fill of grave 105, a rather sufficient amount of medieval, but also of La Tène pottery was found. During the 2008 excavations, 399 sacks with finds were collected. They consisted mostly of ceramic vessel fragments, nails, parts of daub and glass. Another 808 sacks from various test digs were collected too. A total of 140 special finds was separated. Most of the metal artefacts originate from graves: several dozen belt buckles, various appliqués, clasps, pins and bronze rings. Extraordinary grave artefacts include an example of headgear, an armband made of woven <b>bronze</b> <b>wire,</b> and several animal teeth, probably from an amulet. Exceptional fragments of ceramic vessels, moulded stones, glass, stove tiles and similar pieces were selected as well. Also interesting is the find of Roman bricks with animal footprints. Apart from that, 13 samples of coins were found. Among those that were identified, the most notable are a silver Aquileia denarius of Patriarch Antonio II Panciere (1402 – 1411), a silver Vienna Pfennig of Albert V (probably from 1427), a find of the so-called Vierer of Maximilian I, minted in Hall, Tyrol (1490 – 1519), and a silver Hungarian denar of Ferdinand I from 1544. Still, the most attractive finds are two fragments originating from the Romanesque period at least. These are fragments of Ionian-style capitals (Fig. 2), of which one – found as a spolium in the north foundation of the church nave – had an incised spiral. At the conclusion of the excavations, draft documentation of all excavated nave foundations was made: ground-plans, views and cross-sections. All excavated foundations of the church nave were consolidated and conserved. After detailed cleansing, the walls were tuckpointed. The layers north of the nave that were not examined were covered by geotextile and then filled with a layer of fine sand. The collected material was stored in locked rooms belonging to the City, and a smaller part was stored in the facilities of the Institute of Archaeolog y (IARH) in Zagreb to be further analyzed. The selected metal artefacts will undergo cleaning and conservation. There are plans to conduct a C- 14 analysis of the bones from single selected graves, as well as of test digs of cultural layers...|$|E
50|$|One major {{aspect of}} his sculptural work {{is the use of}} new and unusual {{materials}} along with more traditional ones. He created sculptures of <b>bronze,</b> wood, <b>wire,</b> sheet metal, ceramics, enamel on metal, concrete, electrical cable, plastic and more. His aesthetic followed much of Umberto Boccioni’s 1912 Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture when said that sculpture should use and combine whatever materials needed to realize a piece. It also emphasized the abstract over the figurative. Much of his experimentation was based on his knowledge of chemistry from his early student days and {{made him one of the}} most experimental sculptors in 20th century Mexico. Examples include concrete, electrical cable and wire pieces such as Estela II, Máscara (1948) and El Nahual. The sculpture Napoleón is done in limestone; Diálogo is done in multicolored wood.|$|R
50|$|When {{used for}} radio broadcasting, the radio {{frequency}} power from the broadcasting transmitter is fed across the base insulator between the tower and a ground system. The ideal ground system for AM broadcasters comprises at least 120 buried copper or phosphor <b>bronze</b> radial <b>wires</b> at least one-quarter wavelength long and a ground-screen {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the tower. All the ground system components are bonded together, usually by welding, brazing or using coin silver solder to help reduce corrosion. Monopole antennas that use guy-wires for support are called masts in some countries. In the United States, the term “mast” is generally used to describe a pipe supporting a smaller antenna, so both self-supporting and guy-wire supported radio antennas are simply called monopoles if they stand alone. If multiple monopole antennas are used in order to control the direction of radio frequency (RF) propagation, they are called directional antenna arrays.|$|R
2500|$|Peter Grippe (August 11, 1912 – October 18, 2002) was an American sculptor, printmaker, and painter. As a sculptor, {{he worked}} in <b>bronze,</b> terracotta, <b>wire,</b> plaster, and found objects. His [...] "Monument to Hiroshima" [...] series (1963) used found objects cast in bronze sculptures to evoke the chaotic {{humanity}} of the Japanese city after its incineration by atomic bomb. Other Grippe Surrealist sculptural works address less warlike themes, including that of city life. However, his expertise extended beyond sculpture to ink drawings, watercolor painting, and printmaking (intaglio). He joined and later directed Atelier 17, the intaglio studio founded in London and moved to New York {{at the beginning of}} World War II by its founder, Stanley William Hayter. Today, Grippe's 21 Etchings and Poems, a part of the permanent collection at the Davis Museum and Cultural Center at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, is available as part of the museum's virtual collection.|$|R
