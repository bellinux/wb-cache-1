50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>caracara</b> (Daptrius ater) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the Falconidae family. Its genus Daptrius is often {{considered}} monotypic today, though some also include the red-throated caracara otherwise separated in Ibycter.|$|E
50|$|The red-throated caracara (Ibycter americanus) is {{a social}} species of bird of prey in the family Falconidae. It {{is placed in the}} {{monotypic}} genus Ibycter, or sometimes united in Daptrius with the <b>black</b> <b>caracara.</b> Unique among caracaras, it mainly feeds on the larvae of bees and wasps, but also takes the adult insects and fruits and berries.|$|E
50|$|Males average 20.1 in (51 cm) long, while females average 22.1 in (56 cm); {{they are}} {{distinguished}} from the <b>black</b> <b>caracara</b> by larger size and plumage that is mainly black, with the belly, tibal feathers, and undertail feathers being white. Both their faces and throats are bare with a few black feathers scattered on the throat; the exposed skin is red. Both male and female red-throated caracaras are similar in appearance. Males have a wing length of 35.55 cm, a tail length of 24.96 cm, a bill length of 2.5 cm, and a tarsus length of 5.41 cm. Females have a wing length of 35.93 cm, a tail length of 25.31 cm, a bill length of 2.58 cm, and a tarsus length of 5.62 cm.|$|E
30|$|The {{assemblage}} on altitudinal grasslands {{was similar}} to that found by Petersen et al. (2011). <b>Black</b> Vultures, <b>caracaras,</b> and American Kestrels were the most abundant species, while the Accipitridae (hawks, harriers, kites, and eagles) showed lower abundances. The dominance of one or two vulture species, and the Southern and Chimango caracaras, is a common pattern of abundance in many raptor assemblages in the grasslands of southern South America (Donázar et al. 1993; Bellati 2000; Carrete et al. 2009). The Accipitridae is usually not abundant, with a couple of profuse, generalist species along with some uncommon or rare ones.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} use of European hare (Lepus europaeus) {{carcasses}} by avian scavengers in Argentinean Patagonia. A total of 16 hare carcasses were placed in locations that could be observed without disturbing birds feeding on them. Six avian species fed on these carcasses: chimango caracara (Milvago chimango), crested <b>caracara</b> (Polyborus plancus), <b>black</b> vulture (Coragyps atratus), grey eagle-buzzard (Geranoaetus melanoleucus), red-backed hawk (Buteo polyosoma) and cinereous harrier (Circus cinereus). Turkey vultures (Cathartes aura), although abundant, never fed on the hare carcasses. The Andean condor also did not feed on the carcasses. Mammals visited hare carcasses on only two occasions. Of the hare carcasses, 69 % were fully consumed during the ®rst day of exposure and 25 % in two days. There {{was no difference in}} the time elapsed from the placement of the carcass and its detection by crested and chimango caracaras. There were similar time periods from detection to ®rst arrival, and time elapsed from ®rst arrival to the start of feeding at the carcass by crested and chimango caracaras. Hare body parts were consumed in different proportions by crested and chimango <b>caracaras</b> whereas <b>black</b> vultures consumed the whole carcass. Interspeci®c hierarchies at the carcass in a decreasing sequence of dominance were crested caracara> <b>black</b> vulture> chimango <b>caracara,</b> coinciding with that expected from a body mass perspective. The scavenging species that consume hare carcasses did not show a clear pattern denoting they were a highly interdependent assemblage in the way described for scavengers in Africa...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Black</b> <b>Caracara</b> is a {{widespread}} raptor in the Amazonian lowlands, mostly associated to riverine habitats. This bird is considered as a generalist scavenger that occasionally takes small prey and feeds on fruit. Here we report on Black Caracaras foraging on live small fish caught while moving upriver in the Rio Roosevelt rapids in the Amazonas state, northwestern Brazil. Fish were picked individually either with the bill or talons in a stretch of shallow water plenty of aquatic plants. This fishing behaviour seems unreported and adds another feeding mode to the already diversified portfolio of foraging strategies for the Caracarini...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Caracarini falcons {{are among}} the most {{versatile}} birds of prey, and their variable diet includes fishes, which may be taken as carrion. However, fishing behaviour is described for two species. Here we describe the Chimango Caracara (Milvago chimango) fishing at an estuary in Chile, Pacific coast of South America. The caracara flew and glided close to water surface, hovering on occasions. After such a hovering, the bird plunged and attempted to snatch a prey with its talons. If successful, the caracara carried the fish in its talons and landed on an adjacent beach where the prey was torn apart and eaten. The ‘glide-hover ’ technique of the Chimango Caracara differs slightly from the fishing recorded for the closely related Yellow-headed Caracara (Milvago chimachima), which plunges to the prey from a nearby perch (‘perch to water’). The <b>Black</b> <b>Caracara</b> (Daptrius ater) picks up fish individually with its bill or talons while staying on a river bank (‘ground foraging’). Thus, at least three fishin...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} many animals to access and exploit food is {{dependent}} on the ability to move. In the case of scavenging birds, which use soaring flight to locate and exploit ephemeral resources, the cost and speed of movement vary with meteorological factors. These factors are likely to modify the nature of interspecific interactions, as well as individual movement capacity, although the former are less well understood. We used aeronautical models to examine how soaring performance varies with weather within a guild of scavenging birds and the consequences this has for access to a common resource. Birds could be divided broadly into those with low wing loading that are more competitive in conditions with weak updraughts and low winds (<b>black</b> vultures and <b>caracaras),</b> and those with high wing loading that are well adapted for soaring in strong updraughts and moderate to high winds (Andean condors). Spatial trends in meteorological factors seem to confine scavengers with high wing loading to the mountains where theyout-compete other birds; a trend that is borne out in worldwide distributions of the largest species. However, model predictions and carcass observations suggest that the competitive ability of these and other birds varies with meteorological conditions in areas where distributions overlap. This challenges the view that scavenging guilds are structured by fixed patterns of dominance and suggests that competitive ability varies across spatial and temporal scales, which may ultimately be a mechanism promoting diversity among aerial scavengers.

40|$|Some {{bird species}} feed on {{external}} parasites, such as ticks and flies, {{on the body}} of mammals (hosts or clients). So called cleaner birds that occur in Brazil were reviewed recently, but gathering of significant new data indicates the need for an update and a brief reappraisal of such association. New records raise the number of known clients for some cleaning birds. The Southern Caracara (Caracara plancus) picks ticks on cattle, and the <b>Black</b> <b>Caracara</b> (Daptrius ater) picks ticks on capybaras. The Wattled Jacana (Jacana jacana) picks ticks, horseflies, arthropods and organic debris on capybaras, and tick-picking on capybaras by the Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) is substantiated by photographs. The Cattle Tyrant (Machetornis rixosa) deftly catches horseflies on capybaras, and these latter clients are recorded posing for the Giant Cowbird (Molothrus oryzivorus), which also pick parasites from the marsh deer. The Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis) definitely picks ticks directly on cattle. With the new records, some poorly documented or controversial issues in the literature are here confirmed, a hypothesis is validated, and a suggestion is invalidated...|$|E
