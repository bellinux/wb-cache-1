The next thing I knew some one tapped me on the shoulder. It was three o’clock, and I had been asleep for some hours. The {{regiment}} was again under arms, and was receiving ammunition from a pack-train which had come up from the rear. We pressed on until early dawn, when we were well in front of Santiago. Entrenchments were hastily thrown up, and we were ready for the enemy. The enemy did not give us much time for rest. They made an assault upon our position early in the morning, which we repulsed....|$|E
50|$|The typical Union soldier {{carried his}} musket, {{percussion}} cap box, cartridge box, a canteen, a knapsack, and other accouterments, {{in addition to}} any personal effects. By contrast, many Southern soldiers carried their possessions in a <b>blanket</b> <b>roll</b> worn around the shoulder and tied at the waist. They might have a wooden canteen, a linen or cotton haversack for food, and a knife or similar sidearm, {{as well as their}} musket.|$|E

It was dedicated in 1915 to the Confederate soldiers of Drew County who served in the American Civil War. The main sculpture, which is made of marble, depicts a uniformed Confederate soldier carrying a <b>blanket</b> <b>roll,</b> and wearing a scabbard. He stands with both hands on a rifle, whose butt end is on the ground. It measures 6 ft tall and about 20 in square, and stands on a marble base 20 ft high. It is inscribed as follows: ...|$|E

60|$|Tent of Mosquito-netting.--I {{have been}} {{informed}} of a sportsman in Ceylon, who took with {{him into the}} woods a cot with mosquito-curtains, as a protection not only against insects, but against malaria. He also had a <b>blanket</b> <b>rolled</b> at his feet: at 3 in the morning, when the chill arose in the woods, he pulled his blanket over him.|$|R
5000|$|Jim Klimesh, {{director}} of casino operations for Indiana's Empress Casino Hammond {{believes it is}} sometimes possible to control the dice with certain throws that do not hit {{the back wall of}} the craps table. One example is the [...] "army blanket roll", named after the playing surface of the dice games of American servicemen during World War II. In the army <b>blanket</b> <b>roll,</b> a player sets the dice on an axis and gently rolls or slides them down the table. If the shooter is successful, the dice will not leave the axis they are rolled on and will come to rest before hitting the back wall. A successful shooter would affect the odds significantly.|$|E
5000|$|Police {{were told}} by a {{neighbor}} girl that she saw Campbell sneaking around Renae Wicklund's yard with a knife that morning, and other neighbors observed him heading towards {{the house with a}} large <b>blanket</b> <b>roll</b> in his hands. It was also obvious that Campbell's getaway from the crime scene was extremely sloppy, with no attempt to conceal anything. A bloody hand print was found on a drinking glass in the Wicklunds' kitchen that matched his fingerprints, and a trail of Renae Wicklund's jewelry was running from {{the front door of the}} house down the walkway. Campbell's car had dried blood on the driver's side door handle, and the above-mentioned earring of Shannah's was found in the back seat. A pair of earrings belonging to Renae were found in Campbell's pants pockets when he was arrested. In addition, a fellow work-release resident directed police to a location along the banks of the Snohomish River where he and Campbell had been on the evening of April 14. Divers retrieved more jewelry and knick-knacks taken from the Wicklunds' home. When questioned by police, Don Hendrickson stated that [...] "the man who'd attacked Renae eight years earlier" [...] was the only possible perpetrator he could think of.|$|E

40|$|Previously {{fabricated}} {{electronic devices}} {{were used for}} vacuum manufacturing processes such as conventional semiconductor manufacturing. However, they are difficult to apply to continuous processes such as roll-to-roll printing, which results in very high device manufacturing and processing costs. Therefore, many developers {{have been interested in}} applying continuous processes to contact printing or noncontact printing technologies and they proposed various continuous printing techniques instead of conventional batch coating. In this paper, we proposed improved gravure offset printing process as one of the contact printing technique. We used etching pattern geometry with soft core <b>blanket</b> <b>roll</b> for printing of ultra fine line below the 10 um. Using this technique we obtained flexible metal grid mesh film as transparent conductive film...|$|E

50|$|From 8 July through 17, {{the entire}} brigade left the {{battlefield}} {{and moved to}} Richmond, where the men were allowed to take a well-deserved rest. On the 17th, however, {{the men of the}} Stonewall Brigade again packed their <b>blanket</b> <b>rolls,</b> shouldered arms and began marching northwards for a new campaign, this time against a new Federal Army being organized around Manassas Junction under General John Pope. On 9 August, the brigade would run into Pope at the Battle of Cedar Mountain. The 33rd Regiment fought fiercely throughout the battle, taking 17 casualties.|$|R
5000|$|A long backboard, {{also called}} a long spine board (LSB), is a reinforced, firm surface with several hand and strap holes along its lateral edges. [...] Other {{immobilization}} equipment consists of straps, or cravats, and cervical immobilization devices (CIDs). CIDs, which stabilize {{the neck and}} reduce movement, include a soft or rigid cervical spine immobilization collar, also called a c-collar or neck brace. [...] In addition to the c-collar, commercial head supports or substituted items, such as bulky <b>blankets,</b> <b>rolled</b> towels, or foam head blocks, are placed {{on each side of}} the head and then secured to the backboard with tape. [...] Straps are used to secure the torso (chest and pelvis) and extremities (arms and legs) to the backboard.|$|R
60|$|Sparrer ranged {{the four}} agate-ware plates, which were really shallow pans so that soup could be served in {{them as well}} as dry food, against a stick where they would get warm but not too hot to handle. The erbswurst was crumbled into the now boiling water, a handful of julienne, or {{evaporated}} vegetables cut in thin strips, was added, the pan of johnny-cake was put in the oven and the four boys gathered around to watch and wait with many a hungry sniff. The soup was soon ready, and Pat announced the first course. How good it did taste as they sat on their <b>blanket</b> <b>rolls</b> near enough to the fire to enjoy its warmth, each with a pan of the hot soup on his knees.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in the British Army {{during the}} French-And-Indian War (1754-1763), and {{continuing}} {{in use in}} various armies throughout the later 18th, 19th, and early 20th Centuries, {{up to and including}} the Soviet Red Army in their [...] "Great Patriotic War" [...] (1941-1945), the term en banderole referred to soldiers wearing either their greatcoat (heavy overcoat) or <b>blanket,</b> <b>rolled</b> up along its longer edge, draped over one shoulder and across their back and breast, and fastened—sometimes with a small bespoke strap, other times with a short length of simple rope—near their waist. The practice was begun by British light infantrymen fighting in North America during the Seven Years' War, known there as the [...] "French and Indian" [...] war, to make carrying their equipment more convenient to fighting in the heavily wooded terrain.|$|R
60|$|Darkness was {{settling}} {{down upon the}} mountains and the chill of the snow was in the air when Hetty Leger and Ingleby sat beside a crackling fire. Down in the great gorge beneath them the white mists were streaming athwart the climbing pines, and no sound broke the deep stillness but the restless stamping of the tethered pack-horses and the soft splash of falling water. Hetty had a brown <b>blanket</b> <b>rolled</b> about her, and there were hard red blotches where the mosquitoes had left their virus on the hand she laid upon it. Leger lay not far away, and his face was swollen, but Ingleby had escaped almost scatheless, as some men seem to do, from the onslaughts of the buzzing legions which had pursued them through the swampy hollows.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Australian sugar {{industry}} utilizes rolling almost exclusively for extraction of sucrose from prepared sugarcane. The feeding and extraction performance of rolling mills is strongly {{dependent on the}} friction coefficient between counter−rotating rolls and the fibro−porous sugarcane <b>blanket.</b> <b>Rolls</b> are circumferentially grooved and roughened with weld droplets to assist juice drainage and maximize friction between <b>rolls</b> and <b>blanket.</b> Previous investigators have performed experimental measurements of the friction coefficient between metal surfaces and prepared cane or bagasse. This article develops a multi−variate empirical regression equation based on the experimental measurements of previous investigators to describe the dependence of the interfacial friction coefficient on normal pressure, groove angle, and relative rubbing speed. The friction coefficient was found to decrease exponentially with increasing normal pressure, decrease linearly with increasing rubbing speed, and increase with decreasing groove angle in accordance with simple wedge theory...|$|R
60|$|Though the English are not greatly loved in any {{possessions}} of Spain, their gold has {{the power}} of rousing even the contemplative Canario out of his usual lethargy, and when the driver shouted, drowsy men hurried about the posada. The host had two good mules, and a vine-grower {{would be glad to}} act as guide, but there was, he said, a difficulty. He had only one saddle fit for a lady and with the deepest respect for the señora, he feared she was too old to venture over the perilous bridle paths at that time of night; with which opinion Mrs. Chatterton quite concurred. Lilian glanced at her aunt, and then toward the bare-legged peasant, who, with a great <b>blanket</b> <b>rolled</b> about his shoulders, stood, hat in hand, before her. There was a rude dignity about this vine-dresser which pleased her, and moving forward she kissed her aunt.|$|R

60|$|Among so {{many men}} there were {{naturally}} a few who were inclined to be insubordinate. These were speedily weeded out. The offenders were promptly seized, flogged, and expelled from the force, their places being supplied from among the peasants, {{many of whom were}} desirous of enlisting. Terence sent these off, save a few he selected, to Silveira, as his own force was quite as large as could properly be handled. With improved food and incessant drill the men rapidly developed into soldiers. Each carried a rough native <b>blanket</b> <b>rolled</b> up like a scarf over one shoulder. This was indeed the only point of regular equipment. They had no regular uniform, but they were all in their peasant dresses. There was no communication between them and Romana's forces, for the animosity between the two peoples amounted to hatred. The Portuguese would indeed have marched to attack them as willingly as they would have received the order to move against the French.|$|R
60|$|Edgar by {{this time}} had put on the dark-blue blouse, {{reaching}} down below the knee and girt by a belt at the waist, which forms the main article of dress of every Egyptian peasant. On his head was a brown cap of rough wool, of something of the same shape as a fez. These, {{and a pair of}} low Turkish shoes, completed his costume, underneath which he wore the European one, the trousers being rolled up above the knees, so as not to show. While the operation of dressing the wounds was going on, he went down into the village, and finding a shop where they sold such things, bought similar suits to his own for the two Arabs. When he returned, the sheik's wounds had been dressed, a <b>blanket</b> <b>rolled</b> up under his head, and he was looking altogether more comfortable. Edgar now told him his plan of carrying him off.|$|R
60|$|They ate their supper, and {{afterwards}} lay down with their <b>blankets</b> <b>rolled</b> about them, for it grew very cold as darkness crept up the valley. Like {{most of the}} other valleys, this one was walled in by steep-sided, pine-shrouded hills; but in this case there were no trees in the bottom of it, which, while very narrow, appeared several miles long. It was also nearly level, and the river wound through it in deep, still bends. There are not many valleys in that country in which heavy timber fails to grow, and those within reach of a market have been seized upon; for all ranch produce is in excellent demand, and the clearing of virgin forest is a singularly arduous task. In fact, there was only one reason why this strip of natural prairie had not already been claimed. Most of it was swamp. Nasmyth, who was quieter than usual, watched the filmy mist creep about it as the soft darkness rolled down the hillsides.|$|R

6000|$|But {{there were}} ample signs that I {{had not come}} upon a false scent. This was {{certainly}} where the man lived. Some <b>blankets</b> <b>rolled</b> in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In {{the middle of the}} hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood a small cloth bundle--the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil:-- ...|$|R
50|$|Inside a Powhatan house, bedsteads {{were built}} along both walls. They {{were made of}} posts put in the ground, about a foot high or more, with small cross-poles attached.
