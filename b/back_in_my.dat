500|$|Björk {{chose the}} title Post for two reasons. Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why I called them Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for me to move away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E
500|$|Having been {{watched by}} a number of clubs, Ingham joined newly {{promoted}} Premier League club Sunderland on 28 July 1999 for a £30,000 fee following a trial in February. He was loaned out to Third Division club Carlisle United on 1 October 1999, making his Football League debut the following day in a 1–1 home draw against Southend United. He finished the successful spell with seven appearances for Carlisle. He returned to Northern Ireland by rejoining former club Cliftonville on loan for {{the first three months of}} 2000–01 on 11 August 2000 to gain more first-team experience, saying [...] "That's why I jumped at the chance of three months <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old jersey. There was an option to join Lincoln City instead but they were only offering reserve games." [...] He finished this spell with 22 appearances, before being recalled by Sunderland in early January 2001. He made his Sunderland debut by starting in a 4–2 defeat away to Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup on 12 September 2001, which proved to be his only appearance of 2001–02. This appearance resulted in former club Cliftonville receiving a payment from Sunderland, which was agreed when he was transferred to Sunderland. He joined Stoke City of the Second Division on a one-month loan on 18 December 2001, where he failed to make any appearances after joining as cover for Neil Cutler following an injury to Gavin Ward.|$|E

2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abdul-Jabbar {{was well}} known for his {{trademark}} [...] "skyhook", a hook shot in which he bent his entire body (rather than just the arm) like a straw in one fluid motion to raise the ball and then release it at the highest point of his arm's arching motion. Combined with his long arms and great height——the skyhook was difficult for a defender to block without goaltending. It was a reliable and feared offensive weapon and contributed to his high lifetime field goal percentage of 0.559. He was adept at shooting the skyhook with either hand, which made him {{even more difficult to}} defend against, though as a right-handed player, he was stronger shooting the skyhook with his right hand than he was with his left. According to Abdul-Jabbar, he learned the move in fifth grade after practicing with the Mikan Drill and soon learned to value it, as it was [...] "the only shot I could use that didn't get smashed <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face".|$|E

2500|$|In 1977 Lynn {{recorded}} I Remember Patsy, {{an album}} dedicated {{to her friend}} and country pop singer Patsy Cline, {{who had died in}} a plane crash in 1963. The album covered some of Cline's biggest hits. The two singles Lynn released from the album, [...] "She's Got You" [...] and [...] "Why Can't He Be You", became major hits. [...] "She's Got You", which went to #1 by Cline in 1962, went to #1 again that year by Lynn. [...] "Why Can't He Be You" [...] peaked at #7 shortly afterward. Lynn enjoyed enormous success on country radio until the early 1980s, when a more pop-flavored type of country music began to dominate the market. She stayed within the country Top 10 until the mid 1980s; however, most of her music by the late 1970s had a slick pop sound to it. Lynn had her last No.1 hit in 1978 with [...] "Out of My Head and <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Bed".|$|E

It also became their fifteenth and final number one Adult Contemporary hit. The album also produced three other singles, including [...] "(Want You) <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Life Again", [...] "Those Good Old Dreams", and a remake of the Motown hit [...] "Beechwood 4-5789". The singles fared well on the adult contemporary charts. [...] "Beechwood 4-5789", the last single by the Carpenters {{to be released in}} Karen's lifetime, on her 32nd birthday. The album concluded with [...] "Because We Are in Love (The Wedding Song)", referring to Karen's marriage.

[...] He gained 5,861 yards during his three-year collegiate career. [...] Brazil was also regarded as a fine passer, an outstanding defensive player, and [...] "a vicious tackler and blocker." [...] Brazil contributed to the team's success {{in so many ways}} that Dorais once remarked, [...] "Brazil would be a valuable man to our team if he never touched the ball." [...] Dorais later said, [...] "As far as I'm concerned, there were only three great collegiate <b>backs</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lifetime -- Jim Thorpe, George Gipp and Lloyd Brazil." ...|$|R
