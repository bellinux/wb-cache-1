Their common principle is based on the empirical fact that after having applied a given current for a given number of seconds to the battery, the resulting voltage output is related to the battery's overall condition, when compared to a healthy battery's output.|$|R
50|$|Thermochromic inks or dyes are {{temperature}} sensitive compounds, {{developed in}} the 1970s, that temporarily change color with exposure to heat.

50|$|The cell was {{prepared}} {{by using a}} working electrode to assemble a half-cell configuration dry glove box with Li metal as an anode, ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate as an electrophile, and a Celgard 3501 membrane as a separator. Using Arbin BT-200 <b>Battery</b> <b>Tester,</b> the cell was electrochemically cycled at room temperature. By using a Solarton workstation, the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of cells were performed. A focus ion beam-scanning electron microscope {{was used to determine}} the morphology of the electrodes before and after the high rate pulse discharge (HRPD) cycling. After testing, pure PTMA and LiFePO4 electrode give a sharp redox peak and decrease the voltage gap between oxidation and reduction. Therefore, PTMA and LiFePO4 improve the rate and reversibility of the redox couples. Furthermore, the hybrid cathodes have a lower charge-transfer resistance, allowing easier migration of Li ions through the electrode interface. Moreover, PTMA/LiFePO4 has a longer life cycle compared to pure LiFePO4 or PTMA systems.|$|E

40|$|A fully digital, non-linear, wide bandwidth, current {{controller}} for DC-AC and DC-DC {{voltage source}} converters {{is presented in}} this paper. Exploiting oversampling, the controller mimics an analog hysteresis current controller, but does not employ analog comparators and digital to analog converters. Indeed, it fully virtualizes the hysteresis controller’s operation and, based only on a non linear, efficient, current error filter algorithm, determines the optimum switching instants for the power converter that guarantee reference tracking with minimum delay. In addition, it overcomes the typical limitations of conventional hysteretic controllers, i. e. variable switching frequency or, when frequency stabilization is implemented, sensitiveness to switch dead times and sampling delays. Overall, it offers the same dynamic performance of the analog hysteresis controller, but eliminates all the related issues. Because the current error sample processing algorithm is inherently parallel in structure, the controller is suited for VHDL synthesis and FPGA implementation, which guarantees flexibility and low cost. Its intended application areas include active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, microgrid distributed energy resource (DER) controllers, laboratory <b>battery</b> <b>testers,</b> welding machines...|$|R

40|$|With the {{perennial}} demand for longer runtime of battery-powered Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs), several techniques {{have been proposed}} to increase the battery runtime. One such class of techniques exploiting the battery recovery effect phenomenon claims that performing an intermittent discharge instead of a continuous discharge will increase the usable battery capacity. Several works {{in the areas of}} embedded systems and wireless sensor networks have assumed the existence of this recovery effect and proposed different power management techniques in the form of power supply architectures (multiple battery setup) and communication protocols (burst mode transmission) in order to exploit it. However, until now, a systematic experimental evaluation of the recovery effect has not been performed with real battery cells, using high accuracy <b>battery</b> <b>testers</b> to confirm the existence of this recovery phenomenon. In this paper, a systematic evaluation procedure is developed to verify the existence of this battery recovery effect. Using our evaluation procedure we investigated Alkaline, Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery chemistries, which are commonly used as power supplies for WSN applications. Our experimental results do not show any evidence of the aforementioned recovery effect in these battery chemistries. In particular, our results show a significant deviation from the stochastic battery models, which were used by many power management techniques. Therefore, the existing power management approaches that rely on this recovery effect do not hold in practice. Instead of a battery recovery effect, our experimental results show the existence of the rate capacity effect, which is the reduction of usable battery capacity with higher discharge power, to be the dominant electrochemical phenomenon that should be considered for maximizing the runtime of WSN applications. We outline power management techniques that minimize the rate capacity effect in order to obtain a higher energy output from the battery...|$|R
