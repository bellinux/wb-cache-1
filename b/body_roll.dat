25|$|The 2011 Ford Mustang GT from Shelby was {{previously}} only offered {{in a white}} exterior color with Guardsman Blue Le Mans racing stripes running {{the length of the}} vehicle, but 2012 will see two new colors in Race Red with white LeMans stripes and Kona Blue with white LeMans stripes. These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible will offer a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit includes a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced. The 2012 Shelby GT350 will deliver the same performance numbers as the 2011 model with a 5.0L V8 delivering 430 hp normally aspirated, 525 hp supercharged, or 624 hp supercharged version. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take {{on a life of its}} own. An automatic transmission is optional with the normally aspirated engine, but some will go towards the short throw shifter manual transmission because they actually enjoy to drive. Keeping the powerful engine under control will be an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang reduced <b>body</b> <b>roll</b> and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes.|$|E

[Purpose] This paper {{provides}} {{information about the}} theory and technique of Yamuna <b>Body</b> <b>Rolling.</b> In order to treat physical problems, using the specialized Yamuna <b>Body</b> <b>Rolling</b> balls, people can target superficial skin, fasciae, muscle fibers, tendons, ligaments, bones, internal organs, and the nervous system by themselves. The extraordinary effect of Yamuna <b>Body</b> <b>Rolling</b> is its multidimensional elongation of muscle fibers. In addition to the regular longitudinal elongation by the conventional stretch method, Yamuna <b>Body</b> <b>Rolling</b> enables the transversal and diagonal expansion of muscle fibers {{in order to move}} the body more dynamically. Hamstring, abdominal, and sideline routines are presented as examples for techniques of Yamuna <b>Body</b> <b>Rolling.</b> Yamuna <b>Body</b> <b>Rolling</b> can be applied to functional evaluation and therapeutic uses; therefore, it could provide many benefits in the treatment of different conditions in the medical field...|$|R

2500|$|At {{the time}} it was being made, the 303 was the least {{expensive}} six-cylinder car in Germany. However, it was considered underpowered, with a top speed of [...] [...] The combination of soft spring rates at the front and hard spring rates at the rear caused understeer, <b>body</b> <b>roll,</b> and a generally unsettling pitching movement. 2300 BMW 303s were produced up to 1934, when the 303 was replaced by the 315.|$|E
2500|$|The {{swinging}} {{arms are}} mounted with large bearings to [...] "cross tubes" [...] that run {{side to side}} across the chassis; combined {{with the effects of}} all-independent soft springing and excellent damping, keeps the road wheels in contact with the road surface and parallel to each other across the axles at high angles of <b>body</b> <b>roll.</b> A larger than conventional steering castor angle, ensures that the front wheels are closer to vertical than the rears, when cornering hard with a lot of <b>body</b> <b>roll.</b> The soft springing, long suspension travel and the use of leading and trailing arms means that as the body rolls during cornering the wheelbase {{on the inside of the}} corner increases while the wheelbase on the outside of the corner decreases. As the corning forces put more of the car's weight on the inside pair of wheels the wheelbase extends in proportion, keeping the car's weight balance and centre of grip constant. promoting excellent road holding. The other key factor in the quality of its road holding is the very low and forward centre of gravity, provided by the position of the engine and transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Motor Trend {{called the}} new Chevy II [...] "a most {{straightforward}} car â€“ simple, honest and conventional." [...] Editor Jerry Titus was fascinated with the new rear single-leaf suspension: [...] "How it actually works seems almost contradictory. There {{is a great deal}} of <b>body</b> <b>roll,</b> but the car does not feel unstable. The ride is soft and pleasing, but not seasick-soft with the constant pitching and rolling that some cars have." [...] Interior room, steering, and brakes were commended. Performance was rated as [...] "moderate" [...] for a six-cylinder Nova convertible with Powerglide: 0-60 came up [...] "a shade under 16 seconds," [...] and the top speed was reported to be 98mph, but Titus felt that [...] "the car seems at its best below 75, where it did not feel as though it was working hard." [...] The four, meanwhile, took 20 seconds to make it from 0 to 60mph. In comparison, a 1960 90bhp Falcon with stick shift took 21 seconds 0 to 60, also according to Motor Trend, while the 101bhp six introduced for 1961 required 14.3 seconds with stick and 15.2 with the two-speed Fordomatic.|$|E

When a Parlement refuses registering, the remedy, by long practice, has become familiar to the simplest: a Bed of Justice.

As soon as I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first jerking the spear out of his side, which {{operation}} I confess I performed with my eyes shut tight. His heels leaped together over the little doorstep; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; I hugged him from behind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man on earth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him overboard. The current snatched him {{as though he had}} been a wisp of grass, and I saw the <b>body</b> <b>roll</b> over twice before I lost sight of it for ever. All the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck about the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a flock of excited magpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude. What they wanted to keep that body hanging about for I can't guess. Embalm it, maybe. But I had also heard another, and a very ominous, murmur on the deck below. My friends the wood-cutters were likewise scandalized, and with a better show of reason--though I admit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have him. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was dead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause some startling trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.|$|E
