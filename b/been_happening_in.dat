25|$|Sporadic {{fighting}} had <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the North for months, but {{the intensity}} of the clashes increased after September 2007. Gradually, the defence lines of the LTTE began to fall. The advancing military confined the LTTE into rapidly diminishing areas in the North. Prabhakaran was seriously injured during air strikes carried out by the Sri Lanka Air Force on a bunker complex in Jayanthinagar on 26 November 2007. Earlier, on 2 November 2007, S. P. Thamilselvan, who {{was the head of the}} rebels' political wing, was killed during another government air raid. On 2 January 2008, the Sri Lankan government officially abandoned the ceasefire agreement. By 2 August 2008, LTTE lost the Mannar District following the fall of Vellankulam town. Troops captured Pooneryn and Mankulam during the final months of 2008.|$|E

25|$|In 1841 {{the early}} {{settlers}} {{found themselves in}} need of a government after the death of pioneer Ewing Young. Young had accumulated much wealth as a successful rancher following the Willamette Cattle Company events of 1837 when he and a group of other settlers herded over 600 head of cattle from California to Oregon. This made him very wealthy and intertwined him economically with many of the other pioneers in the valley. Young had died without a will or heir, thus necessitating a need for a probate court, because otherwise people were sure that his estate would have been disposed for the Hudson's Bay Company, the Catholic Jesuit Priests from Canada, or the Protestant Methodist Mission from the United States, as that had <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the past. Several meetings occurred over the subsequent months which included François Norbert Blanchet, William J. Bailey, Mr. Charlevon, David Donpierre, Gustavus Hines, William Johnson, Jason Lee, Étienne Lucier, Robert Moore, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, Sidney Smith, and David Leslie.|$|E

500|$|Drawing from {{research}} performed {{to assess the}} safety of the RHIC collisions, the LHC Safety Study Group, a group of independent scientists, performed a safety analysis of the LHC, and released their findings in the 2003 report Study of Potentially Dangerous Events During Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC. The report concluded that there is [...] "no basis for any conceivable threat". Several of its arguments were based on the predicted evaporation of hypothetical micro black holes by Hawking radiation and on the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model with regard to the outcome of events to be studied in the LHC. One argument raised against doomsday fears was that collisions at energies equivalent to and higher than those of the LHC have <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> nature for billions of years apparently without hazardous effects, as ultra-high-energy cosmic rays impact Earth's atmosphere and other bodies in the universe.|$|E

In May 2012, the Irish Times reported that she had voluntarily returned more than €500,000 in unused Presidential Allowance funds, accrued over the 14 years of her term of office. She is currently pursuing a Doctorate in Canon Law (JCD) at Rome's Pontifical Gregorian University. In 2013 she said that she obtained a master's degree and licentiate in canon law and her interest grew because of her concern about what has <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the Church — the sexual abuse scandal, among other things. When McAleese looked at the scandal, she said [...] "I was struck by what investigators said about canon law and canon lawyers. It was a scathing indictment: In not one single incidence of sexual abuse had canon law been able to do anything on the victim’s side, nothing useful or helpful".|$|E

60|$|In the {{meantime}} {{all kinds of}} things of which Tell had no suspicion had <b>been</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the town.
