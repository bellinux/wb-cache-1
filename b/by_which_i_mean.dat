In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence is horrible, degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that Witchfinder General works as intended." ...|$|E

Clubs Nathan Rabin {{reported}} that past season premieres of 30 Rock {{had a solid}} track record as being the worst episodes of the season, nonetheless Rabin found [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] hilarious and breaking that barrier. He wrote that Matt Damon has been great on the show as Carol; however, his only complaint was Carol's character flaw as being too sensitive. Rabin, who has complained [...] "extensively" [...] about Jenna's character in the past, said the character was in [...] "fine form" [...] {{in her role as}} a TGS producer. Rabin gave the episode an A- grade rating. Bob Sassone of TV Squad deemed this episode a [...] "solid season-opener" [...] that featured [...] "lots of great lines and plot development". Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, was thrilled that the Jack and Avery relationship [...] "not only lasted the summer, but is thriving", and wrote that she was looking forward to the pregnancy storyline involving Avery. Blake noted that Damon's character was [...] "darn-near perfect, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> 'a male version of Liz.'" [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for HitFix said that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] did not [...] "live up to the good old days" [...] of past episodes, nonetheless {{reported that}} he [...] "laughed enough" [...] and was pleased with the direction the show took Liz and Carol's relationship. Sepinwall did not like Tracy and Kenneth's story, calling it a complete miss, but was appreciative of the other storylines, choosing Pete and Jenna's as his favorite. Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times was positive about Damon's role on the show, noting that he has been a [...] "hoot". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the episode was a [...] "nice start to the [...] season" [...] of 30 Rock as it was [...] "perhaps more plot-driven than packed with the emotional and uproariously funny episodes that concluded last season." [...] Eidler commented that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] never did [...] " [...] the utter hilariousness of last season, but I hope that wasn't the climax... and it can eventually return to its previous heights of hilarity". TV Guides Bruce Fretts was complimentary towards Damon's role as Tina Fey's love interest, writing that Damon [...] "showed a refreshingly silly side in keeping with 30 Rocks anything-goes spirit." [...] Matt Wilstein of The Huffington Post called the premiere [...] "a very solid first episode", enjoying Damon's part on the show and the Kenneth story of him still being fired by NBC.|$|E

While serving in the United States and at the United Nations, Ismail wrote personal notes to the Prime Minister, which were recently compiled and published in a book titled [...] "Malaya's First Year at the UN". Ismail remained involved in local politics, however, and pressed for the Alliance coalition of UMNO, the MCA and the Malayan Indian Congress (MIC) to merge into one multi-racial party, instead of remaining as a coalition comprising three mono-racial parties.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} DNA Workbench, {{a program for}} working with DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. It is designed to solve several problems that arise in two domains. The first domain {{is that of the}} algorithm designer and implementor who is working in the emerging field of computational biology. The second domain is that of the worker in a genetics laboratory, who needs frequently to turn to the computer to perform analysis on existing or newly acquired nucleotide or protein sequences. The problems encountered in these two domains overlap to a considerable extent. The problems, and how they are addressed by DNA WorkBench, are discussed within. DNA WorkBench addresses both of these groups with one program. In this way, new problems that require new algorithms can be quickly brought from a theoretical solution to an implementation and to the laboratory workbench. This rapid transfer from research to development to the field is essential in a fast moving area such as biotechnology, <b>by</b> <b>which</b> term <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> to encompass such specialties as molecular biology, genetics, human gene therapy, and the current large-scale international sequencing and mapping of human DNA which ha...|$|R

60|$|The American duchess, I take it, {{comes over}} to Europe, and desires incontinently to drag the European duke at the wheels of her chariot. And the European duke is fascinated in turn, partly by this very fact, partly by the undeniable freshness, brightness, and {{delicate}} culture of the American woman. For there is no burking the truth that in many respects the American woman carries about her a peculiar charm ungranted as yet to her European sisters. It is the charm of freedom, of ease, of a certain external and skin-deep emancipation--an emancipation which goes but a little way down, yet adds a quaint and piquant grace of manner. What she conspicuously lacks, on the other hand, is essential femininity; <b>by</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>mean</b> womanliness--of that she has enough and to spare--but the wholesome physical and instinctive qualities which go {{to make up a}} sound and well-equipped wife and mother. The lack of these underlying muliebral qualities more than counterbalances to not a few Europeans the undoubted vivacity, originality, and freshness of the American woman. She is a dainty bit of porcelain, unsuited for use; a delicate exotic blossom, for drawing-room decoration, where many would prefer robust fruit-bearing faculties.|$|R
