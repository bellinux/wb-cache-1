50|$|In July 2010 the 811th {{transferred}} to the LBJ Middle School from St Therese. Major <b>Ben</b> Noyce <b>transferred</b> the unit and simultaneously had classes conducted at the school. The original approach of having all youth that attended the in-school program also be cadet members in Civil Air Patrol was abandoned and it opened students to attend the STEM based in school class without having to commit to the traditional Civil Air Patrol Squadron and membership. This helped advance STEM and aviation into the school and garner interest in careers and institutions based in aviation.In November 2013, then Major William Fitzpatrick, took over the squadron as the squadron commander. Immediately the focus, goals, mission and vision of the 811th changed substantially. Moving from a drill and ceremonies focused squadron, the 811th refocused on flight training, operational management, and aviation advocating. In 2014 the 811th received a Unit Citation for its contribution for standing up balloon operations and writing regulations for its integration at the national level.|$|R

The Records of the AJCOP include the years 1988 - 1990, please note however; that these dates are incomplete and the remainder of these years' records and later records are in the possession of the AJCOP.

50|$|When Spider-Man {{activates}} the Webware {{to stabilize}} the human and clone cells all across the world, the various Miles Warren clones deteriorate as Ben Reilly fights Doctor Octopus. The Warren clone that doesn't melt realizes he's the true Warren and vows to have revenge on Ben Reilly as the true Jackal. As Ben Reilly and Doctor Octopus start decaying, <b>Ben</b> Reilly tries <b>transferring</b> his mind into the finished Proto-Clone, but Doctor Octopus stops him and succeeds in transferring his mind instead. Ben Reilly takes the New U Pills and steals a citizen's Webware {{to stabilize the}} cells in his body {{and goes back to}} his safehouse (which is a recreation of Peter's childhood home). He finds Warren in his Jackal outfit waiting in the living room. Jackal proceeds to burn Ben Reilly's house down and engages him in one final battle. Ben Reilly defeats Jackal and leaves him in the burning house to die and heads off pondering what he's going to do with his life.|$|R
5000|$|Chedly and <b>Ben</b> Salem were <b>{{transferred}}</b> to {{the prison}} of Kairouan on 11 August. Hassine, M’hamed and princess Soufia were freed several days later. The last son, Salah Eddine, {{was transferred to the}} civil prison in Tunis three months after his house arrest. Alone in the ruined palace, the old couple were not allowed to leave until October 1958, as Lamine's health had deteriorated very badly. They were then transferred to a small villa in La Soukra with a kitchen, a bathroom and two other rooms and given a monthly allowance of 80 dinars, roughly the same as the salary of a secondary school teacher. They remained under house arrest and were forbidden even to go into the garden outside - indeed a policeman remained on duty actually inside the villa. Their daughter princess Soufia was allowed to visit them whenever she wished however. [...] On 8 September the trial of Tahar Ben Ammar came to an end, having worked up the public mood with accusations made, and later withdrawn, about the who possessed the jewels which had belonged to the Bey's wife, which had still not been found.|$|R
50|$|The 4th Division was {{reactivated}} on 1 June 1940 at Fort Benning, Georgia, {{under the}} command of Major General Walter Prosser. Commencing in August the formation was reorganized as a motorized division and assigned (along with the 2nd Armored Division) to I Armored Corps, being officially given its motorized title in parenthesized style and then formally as the 4th Motorized Division effective 11 July 1941. The division participated in Louisiana maneuvers held during August 1941 and then in the Carolina Maneuvers of October 1941, after which it returned to Fort <b>Benning.</b> The division <b>transferred</b> to Camp Gordon, Georgia, in December 1941, the month America entered World War II, and rehearsed training at the Carolina Maneuvers during the summer of 1942. The division, now {{under the command}} of Major General Raymond O. Barton, then moved on 12 April 1943 to Fort Dix, New Jersey, where it was again reconfigured and redesignated the 4th Infantry Division on 4 August of that year. The division participated in battlefield maneuvers in Florida starting in September and after this fall training exercise arrived at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, on 1 December 1943. At this station the division was alerted for overseas movement and staged at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, beginning 4 January 1944 prior to departing the New York Port of Embarkation on 18 January 1944. The 4th Infantry Division sailed to England where it arrived on 26 January 1944.|$|R
5000|$|The 2016-17 Spartans were {{decimated}} by departures from the prior year as seniors Denzel Valentine, Bryn Forbes, and Matt Costello all graduated {{and moved to}} the NBA. Freshman Deyonta Davis also declared his eligibility for the NBA after the year and sophomores Javon Bess and Marvin Clark transferred out of the program. In all, five of the Spartans' top six scorers from 2015-16 did not return. In response, MSU welcomed their most-heralded recruiting class ever as four top-50 ranked players entered the program: Miles Bridges, Joshua Langford, Cassius Winston, and Nick Ward. A young team would look to graduate <b>transfer</b> <b>Ben</b> Carter and seniors Gavin Schilling and Eron Harris to fill the holes left by departing players. However, Carter and Schilling suffered season-ending knee injuries before the season began and Harris would suffer one late in the season. As a result, MSU struggled up front as Ward at 6' 8" [...] was the tallest on the team. Former walk-on Kenny Goins became the backup big man at 6' 6". Following losses in their first two games to top-10 teams, MSU suffered two other losses to top-20 teams. Bridges missed seven games with a knee injury {{near the end of the}} non-conference slate and the Spartans, who started the season ranked as high as 10 in some polls, entered Big Ten play with an 8-5 record. Izzo would lament his early-season schedule which involved trips to Hawaii, New York, and the Bahamas when his young team wouldn't needed important practice time. Wins to start conference play over Minnesota (twice) and Northwestern, which would prove to be two of their better wins on the season, and Bridges's return had MSU at 4-1 in conference play. However, inconsistency haunted the Spartans as their failure to win road games left the Spartans at 8-5 in conference play with a visit to conference leaders, Purdue. MSU was handled easily by the Boilermakers and Harris suffered his knee injury which appeared to spell the end of MSU's 19-year NCAA Tournament streak. However, as Bridges, who averaged over 16 points and eight rebounds on the season, and Ward who averaged over 13 points and six rebounds, led the Spartans, they knocked off ranked Wisconsin to seal a trip to the NCAA Tournament. A 10-8 conference record left the Spartans in a tie for fifth place. A win over Penn State in the Big Ten Tournament preceded a loss to Minnesota, but was enough for the Spartans to get an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament for the 20th consecutive year. A win over Miami in the first round led to a loss to Kansas and an end to the season. Bridges finished the season with perhaps the second-best freshman season in MSU history (behind Magic Johnson): 16.9 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game.|$|R
