40|$|Tall {{and short}} Amazonian caatinga t La Esmeralda (rainfall 2600 mm yr- 1) are {{described}} and {{compared with those}} at San Carlos de Rfo Negro (3600 mm yr- 1). The tall forests have much in common: thin-boled trees, many with scleromorphic mesophylls, lack of thick-stemmed climbers and of herbs, species paucity in all life-forms, domination by Eperua, and {{a high proportion of}} Bombacaceae, Clusiaceae and Euphorbiaceae. The short caatingas are also structurally and floristically similar but at La Esmeralda the notophyll scrubland species are lacking. At La Esmeralda, the common tree species are autochorous, but the majority of plants (particularly understorey species) are zoochorous. Relatively high transmission of light {{to the floor of the}} tall caatinga (1. 5 % PAR) may explain how trees with light-demanding architecture generate in the understorey. The presence of Cecropia and 'weedy' species in the caatinga only at San Carlos may be the result of greater human interference there. The soils at San Carlos and La Esmeralda re similar: thick humus overlying <b>bleached</b> <b>sand,</b> waterlogged most of the year. The water table at La Esmeralda drops to> 1 m depth during the drier months, but tensiometers at 30 cm depth did not indicate significant water shortage. Soils are consistently wetter in the short caatinga than the tall. Shortage of nitrogen appears to determine the major structural nd physiognomic features of the caatinga, and depth of aerated soil appears to determine its stature. Comparisons are made between tall caatinga, wallaba and swamp forest in the Guianas and heath forests of Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|Creating a brand for {{a company}} can require much time, research, and ingenuity. When The Fabric Dock in Wiggins, Mississippi, opened in April 2013, I began work as their graphic {{designer}} and gained valuable experience that has taught me everything from learning to gather strong research for color and typefaces {{to being able to}} communicate with the people on the production end. Since I was dealing with a new business, I was able to start from nothing to create exactly what I felt would be the perfect fit for this sea- inspired sewing shop. I spent days conversing with the owners on location, trying to grasp the intentions of the store and just what atmosphere the owners envisioned for their customers. After careful consideration and ample discussion, the owners and I decided to establish The Fabric Dock as an inspiring, beach cottage chic setting to find designer fabric at reasonable prices. I explored the Internet and design magazines to gain as much insight as I could {{to come up with a}} successful, versatile logo. I studied Pantone swatches and color reports and claimed Living Coral, Fair Aqua, and <b>Bleached</b> <b>Sand,</b> as the colors, in hopes of producing a refreshed nautical feel. I paired a blocky, stamp-like typeface with a soft, flowing one to create the ultimate contrast needed for the logo. This logo would be constantly seen with the store’s icon, a sketched anchor showing a sewing needle with the crossbar connected by a sewn-on button. Not only did I have to unearth information about the store, but I also had to focus on the audience, the customers. Sewing has seen a recent upsurge in popularity. Younger people and children are now becoming interested in this timeless tradition due to trends like Project Runway and Do-It-Yourself projects. Because sewing now encompasses all ages and interests, versatility was the key to constructing signage, advertisements, t-shirt designs, and the rest of the system. I feel I achieved success with versatility, and I hope these design pieces will continually prove to be profitable for The Fabric Dock...|$|E
40|$|Geology and soils {{in general}} Surinam is {{situated}} at {{the northern edge of}} the very old and stable Guiana shield. Six-sevenths of the country’s surface are occupied by formations belonging to the shield and designated together as the basal complex. However, the Roraima formation does not belong to the complex. It was deposited during the Mesozoic (probably the Cretaceous) as a thick layer mainly consisting of sandstone that covered the greater part of the shield. Later on the original sandstone plateau was dissected, a process accelerated by the uplifting of the shield, and finally it disappeared almost completely by erosion. The former surface is now only represented by the flat tops of some table-mountains one of which is found in the interior of Surinam: Tafelberg. See Schols & Cohen (1953). The surface of the northern seventh part of the country is occupied by deposits of Quaternary age. In general may be distinguished (from the south to the north) : 1) The Zanderij formation, consisting mainly of sands of continental origin; 2) the Coropina formation, comprising the “old coastal plain”; the main parts are (a) the so-called “schols”, i. e. the remnants of an old sea-clay plain, separated by filled-up tidal gullies, and (b) the remnants of the offshore bars that formerly separated the plain from the sea; 3) the Demerara formation, comprising the “young coastal plain”. See Van der Eyk (1954, 1957). Geological-pedological classification of the savannas Savannas are found on the basal complex, the Roraima, the Zanderij and the Coropina formation. Cohen & Van der Eyk (1953) classify them as follows: I Savannas of the Coropina formation 1. Watamalejo-type – on the offshore bars 2. Welgelegen-type – on the “schols” II Savannas of the Zanderij formation a. Kasipora-type – on dry <b>bleached</b> <b>sand</b> soils b. Zanderij-type – on wet <b>bleached</b> <b>sand</b> soils c. Coesewijne-type – on non-bleached soils III Savannas of the Roraima formation: Tafelberg-type IV Savannas of the basal complex 1. Paroe-type – on granitic soils 2. Bosland-type – on schist hills 3. Saban-pasi-type – on subgraywacke hills Savanna soils The climate is characterized by the sequence of a long rainy season (April-July), a long dry season (August-November), a short rainy season (December-January) and a short dry season (February-March). In connection with this periodicity the water-table in many places fluctuates strongly {{in the course of the}} year. During the dry seasons the upper layers of the savanna soils are always completely dry, except just after a shower. A soil is called very dry if even during the rainy seasons the upper layers are not influenced by the ground water. A very wet soil, however, at this period is covered by some cm of water; in addition it is characterized by many small hummocks, in Surinam called “kawfoetoes”, which are built up by worms and in which these animals are able to keep their heads above the water. Certain soils occur that in spite of deep watertables are wet, because an impermeable layer in the subsoil impedes drainage of the topsoil. Of course there is a scala between the extremes “very dry” and “very wet”. The texture of the upper layers ranges from bleached and slightly red sand to sandy and silty clay. Object of the investigation The flora and the vegetation of the northern Surinam savannas are the object of this investigation. These savannas do not only represent the types of the Zanderijand the Coropina-formation, but also the Bosland- and the Saban-pasi-type, for these two types are present on the basal complex only near its northern border. The following savannas have been studied. Welgelegen-type: the savannas of Bersaba and Vierkinderen, the Bigi-olo savanna near Hanover and the Fransina savanna near Welgelegen; Kasipora- and Zanderij-type: the white-sandy part of the Lobin savanna near Zanderij; Coesewijne-type: the loamy part of the Lobin savanna, the savanna Mimili Okili near Powaka, the Doti savanna near Wisawini and the Coesewijne savanna near Bigipoika; Saban-pasi-type: the Gros savanna and the De Jong Noord savanna. Data of some other authors pertaining to these and the other types have also been taken into account, some published (Lanjouw, 1936; Maguire c. s., 1948; Heyligers, 1963), some unpublished. The savannas present a marked diversity, among other things with regard to the structure of their vegetation. However, nearly all satisfy this definition: “A savanna (or a campo) is an area with a xeromorphic vegetation comprising an ecologically dominant ground layer consisting mainly of grasses, sometimes together with sedges, and with or without trees and/or shrubs either forming a more or less continuous layer, or in groups, or isolated. ” The species have been studied with respect to the relation with the habitat, the means of dispersal and the area of distribution, all in mutual correlation. Vegetationunits have been distinguished and classified; ecological and chorologic aspects have been taken into account. A combination of all data, obtained during this as well as former investigations by others, permits the drawing of a provisional and general picture of the flora and the vegetation of the northern Surinam savannas as far as the present aspects are concerned. The following statements all apply to N. Surinam only, unless mentioned otherwise. Flora Habitat in general. Nearly all plants occurring on the savannas are heliophilous and are able to survive repeated burning. The flora of the open vegetation types consists of about 270 species the majority of which (72 %) is restricted to the open savannas. However, there are species occurring either in other open situations too, partly as weeds (8 %), or on wet savannas and other wet places (3 %), or in savanna rivulets and in swamps (7 %), or in savanna bushes (8 %). Out of ca. 100 species of the savanna bushes only 15 % are restricted to this vegetation type. The other species occur either also in the open savanna (20 %), or along forest borders (8 %), or in savanna wood and forest (23 %) and/or even in rain forest (31 %). A group of 12 % belonging to the last category does not flower or even not grow high in the bushes. Quite apart from this division other groups may be distinguished among the species of the bushes in the following way: occurring also in secondary forest (31 %) in marsh forest (9 %), in swamps (3 %). The trees and shrubs of the savannas support only few epiphytes and (half-) parasites; these belong to 19 different species. In the field nearly all species show some (factual) range with regard to the degree of moistness and the texture of the soil. The texture itself is not necessarily the decisive factor as there is a relation between the texture and some other properties of the soil, e. g. the consistency and the mineral content. This has not been further investigated. The same holds for the species preferring slightly shaded localities. These spots have a microclimate that differs more from that of its surroundings than in light intensity only. The majority of the open-savanna species have diaspores that are not obviously adapted to any agent of dispersal (71 %). The remaining 29 % are distributed over 6 different categories. The diaspores of the species of the bushes belong partly to the non-adapted forms too (35 %), but 50 % of them are fleshy. Generally speaking, the savanna species have a wider geographic distribution than the spieces of the flora of Surinam as a whole. This is particularly true for the opensavanna species. On the basis of similar areas of distribution the species are classed under 6 geographic elements, viz. the Guianan (G), the northern South-American (N), the northern + eastern South-American (NE), the Middle- and northern + eastern South-American (MNE), the South-American (S) and the American element (A). The distribution of the species of the open-savanna vegetations and of the bushes, respectively, among the geographic elements is as follows (percentages) : G 12 : 26; N 11 : 18; NE 16 : 13; MNE 10; 3; S 9 : 18; A 42 : 22. It appears from a comparison of these figures too, that the species of the first group in general have a wider distribution. Apart from the geographic elements the Roraima element has been distinguished. It comprises all species collected on one or several of the table-mountains in the Guianan interior. The distribution of these species among the geographic elements does not differ considerably from the one of the savanna flora as a whole. It may have appeared already from the foregoing that the species of the bushes, though presenting a higher percentage of adapted diaspores, nevertheless do not have areas of distribution wider than those of the open-savanna species. The expected correlation is, however, apparent if the two groups are considered separately: the mean area of distribution of the species with adapted diaspores is wider than the one of those with non-adapted diaspores. A comparison of the ecological and the chorologic aspects brings to the fore two focal points within the savanna flora: The elements with a small distribution (G and N) are most numerously represented on wet to very wet sandy (in particular white-sandy) soils, whereas the elements with a wide distribution (MNE, S and A) are concentrated on dry and moist non-bleached sands and loams and on very wet soils and present a preference-top on dry and moist loamy sand. The Roraima species are by far the most numerous on the wet white sand, in general they are more numerous on wet than on dry soils. Vegetation Vegetation-units have been distinguished and classified according to the BraunBlanquel school. It has been attempted to make the groups of so-called characteristic and differential species correspond with ecological groups in the sense of Duvigneaud (1946, 1949). The latter consist of species with clear, sociological affinities between them because of similar habitat requirements. The open-savanna (and orchard-savanna) vegetation-types have been united into a single class which is defined and divided as follows: Class Leptocoryphio-Trachypogonetea. Principal species; Trachypogon plumosus, Leptocoryphium lanatum, Axonopus pulcher and Rhynchospora barbata. It seems likely that this class and its subdivision up to and including the alliances may be applied to the whole of Guiana. 1. Order Trachypogonetalia plumosi. Principal species: Trachypogon plumosus, Axonopus pulcher and Bulbostylis junciformis. On very dry to moist soils. 1. 1. Alliance Cassio (ramosae) -Trachypogonion. Principal species: Axonopus pulcher Trachypogon plumosus, and Bulbostylis conifera. On white sands. There are 3 or 4 associations two of which occur on open patches between so-called muri-bushes (see B 1). Distribution: Kasipora-type; Guiana and adjoining parts of Brazil. 1. 2. Alliance Curatello-Trachypogonion. Among the many tens of species the most common ones are Trachypogon plumosus, Axonopus pulcher, Schizachyrium riedelii and Heliconia psitlacorum. Usually there is a thin layer of trees mainly consisting of Curalella americana, giving the vegetation the aspect of a type of so-called orchard savanna. A rather large part of the species occurs outside the savannas on other open spots too. The alliance occurs on pure reddish and on loamy sands. On the savannas of the Coesewijne- and the Welgelegen-type 5 associations are present. Similar vegetation types are found throughout Guiana, on the central Venezuelan llanos and far into E. Brazil. 1. 3. Alliance Rhynchosporo (barbatae) – Trachvpogonion. Principal species: Axonopus pulcher, Leptocoryphium lanatum, Mesosetum cayennense, Bulbostylis conifera and Rhynchospora barbata var. barbata. On sandy (clay) loam. Two associations on savannas of the Coesewijne-type; they are related to vegetation types in French Guiana and in regions farther to the west, up to the Venezuelan llanos and some of the West Indian Islands. 2. Order Paspaletalia pulchelli. Leptocoryphium lanatum is the only species which is common in all communities of this order. In general the vegetations are not closed. On wet (or even very wet) soils. 2. 1. Alliance Syngonantho-Xyridion. Principal species: Paspalum pulchellum, Panicum micranthum, Rhynchospora barbata var. glabra, R. graminea, Xyris guianensis and Abolboda americana. On white sands, wet and very wet. Three associations are found on the savannas of the Zanderij- and the Watamalejo-type. Distribution: Guiana and adjoining parts of Brazil, also on the table-mountains of the Guianan highlands. 2. 2. Alliance Bulbostylidion lanatae. Principal species: Trachvpogon plumosus, Paspalum pulchellum, Panicum micranthum, Mesosetum tenuifolium, Rhynchospora barbata var. barbata and R. rhizomatosa. On loamy sand and sandy loam; wet. In northern Surinam 5 associations occur on savannas of the Saban-pasi- and the Watamalejo-type. Distribution: Guiana, probably also on the table-mountains. 2. 3. Alliance Imperato (brasiliensis) -Mesosetion (cayennensis). Principal species: Leptocoryphium lanatum, Mesosetum cayennense, Imperata brasiliensis, Rhynchospora barbata var. barbata and R. globosa. On wet sandy loam and heavier soil types. Four associations on savannas of the Coesewijne-, Welgelegen- and Saban-pasi-type. Related vegetation types occur, as far as known, only in regions more to the west, up to the llanos and Guatemala. 3. Order Panicelalia stenodis. Principal species: Leptocoryphium lanatum, Panicum nervosum, Hvpogynium virgatum, Heliconia psittacorum and Tibouchina aspera. On very wet soils, in savanna rivulets and small depressions. There are 2 alliances, both showing relationship with vegetation types occurring in regions more to the west, up to the llanos and some West Indian Islands. 3. 1. Alliance Axonopodion chrysitis. Principal species: Leptocorvphium lanatum, Panicum nervosum, Rhynchospora globosa and Tibouchina aspera. On very wet soils of sandy loam and heavier. In N. Surinam 3 associations are found on savannas of the same types as alliance 2. 3. 3. 2. Alliance Mauritio-Hypogynion (virgati). Principal species: Hypogynium virgatum, Leptocoryphium lanatum, Panicum nervosum, Rhynchospora glauca, Heliconia psittacorum and Tibouchina aspera. Typical are the tall palms of Mauritia flexuosa. The alliance has rather many species in common with the communities of swamps, e. g. Blechnum indicum and Rhynchospora cyperoides. There are 3 associations, found in rivulets and depressions on savannas of all types. The different types of savanna-bushes are merely described. A classification on floristic grounds would be justified only if the savanna woods and forests were included in it too. B 1. Ternstroemia-Matayba bushes. See Heyligers (1963). Principal species: Ternstroemia punctata, Clusia fockeana, Licania incana, Humiria balsamifera var. guianensis (“muri”), Pagamea capitata, Matayba opaca and Conomorpha magnoliifolia. On dry white sand. B 2. Rapanea bushes. Principal species: Rapanea guianensis, Davilla aspera, Tapirira guianensis, Symplocos guianensis, Miconia rubiginosa, Byrsonima crassifolia, B. coccolobifolia and Curatella americana. On dry loamy sand and dry sandy loam. B 3. Cupania bushes. Principal species: Cupania scrobiculata var. frondosa. Byrsonima crassifolia, Davilla aspera, Miconia ciliata, Maprounea guianensis, Symplocos guianensis Protium heptaphyllum, and Curatella americana. On moist loamy sand and moist sandy loam. B 4. Clusia-Scleria bushes. See Heyligers (1963). Principal species: Licania incana, Clusia fockeana, Bactris campestris and Scleria pyramidalis. On wet white sand. B 5. Marlierea bushes. Principal species: Marlierea montana, Bactris campestris and Licania incana. On wet loamy sand. B 6. Roupala-Antonia bushes. Principal species: Roupala montana, Antonia ovata, Davilla aspera, Miconia ciliata, Bactris campestris, Licania incana, Humiria balsamifera div. var., Pagamea guianensis and Marlierea montana. On knolls of pebbles embedded in sandy loam; wet. Existence, origin and maintenance of the savannas There is no type of climate that accounts for a savanna vegetation irrespective of other conditions. However, a climate that permits the existence of savanna vegetations may be called a “savanna climate”. The latter is characterized by a certain difference between the precipitation in dry and wet seasons, independent of absolute values. The climate of northern Surinam is a savanna climate in this sense. A savanna vegetation is natural, i. e. determined edaphically, if the upper layer of the soil is alternately desiccated and saturated with water, thus in general in wet and very wet localities and in rivulets. As far as known the following savanna types and vegetation types are involved in this situation (the rivulets left out of consideration) : Watamalejo (2. 1) Welgelegen, partly (2. 2), Zanderij (2. 1 and B 4), Saban-pasi (2. 1 and B 5, 2. 2. and B 6) and Bosland (?). A savanna vegetation occurs in dry localities only if fires prevent the formation of a closed layer of trees or shrubs. This is found among the following types: Welgelegen, partly (1. 2 and 1. 3), Coesewijne (1. 2 and B 2, 1. 3 and B 3) and Kasipora (1. 1 and B 1). Parts of the savannas of the Welgelegen-, Coesewijne- and Saban-pasi-type occupied now by vegetations of the Imperato-Mesosetion (2. 3) and the Axonopodion chrysitis (3. 1) would probably be overgrown very slowly by the surrounding forest and only starting from its edges if the fires were stopped. It might be easily assumed that savannas owing their maintenance at present only to deliberate burning, originated from forests as a result of human interference as well. However, the possibility may not be excluded that they came into existence very long ago, either caused by natural fires or in consequence of a water economy of the soil differing from the present one. Final conclusions All available data concerning the flora and the vegetation of the northern Surinam savannas justify the following theories: The wet white-sand savannas of the Zanderij-type have vegetation types (2. 1) consisting of species that mainly stem from formerly or still existing savannas on the basal complex and on the Roraima formation, probably chiefly on the latter. These species may have reached the Zanderij formation either directly by means of series of savannas in the interior that still may have been present during the break-down of the Roraima plateau, or indirectly by the way of other sandy regions bordering the edges of the Guiana shield. The vegetations of the savannas belonging to the Saban-pasi-type on wet loamy sand and sandy loam (2. 2) consist of species which already for a long time were common to the basal complex and the Roraima plateau or/and which originated from the plateau, and besides of species that developed on the basal complex or migrated from elsewhere to the subgraywacke-area. The savannas of the Watamalejo-type and of the Welgelegen-type N. of the Wane-creek have a flora that may be regarded as a selection from that of the two preceding types. The vegetation types on dry and moist, red, pure and loamy sands belonging to the Coesewijne- and the Welgelegen-type (1. 2) have a high percentage of their species in common with the campos of central and eastern Brazil. It seems possible that these species came to N. Surinam from the campos. The species combination of the savanna vegetations from other habitats does not permit a conclusion with regard to their possible origin...|$|E

At the base of the section, the earliest phase of silicification is the pseudomorphic replacement of sedimentary clay minerals by opal. Subsequently, void linings of micro-laminated opal were formed, and fibrous silica was precipitated in residual cavities. In the middle part of the section, sedimentary clay minerals were replaced by microcrystalline quartz, while silicifieation of clay-free sands was achieved by overgrowth ofdetrital quartz grains. In both cases, residual voids were filled with chalcedony and euhedral quartz.

A wide range of modern beaches have been sampled in the Western and Orkney Isles of Scotland to examine regional variations in luminescence sensitivity, residuals and ease of <b>bleaching.</b> These modern <b>sands</b> have negligible residuals for infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL), small optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) residuals and significant thermoluminescence residuals. The relationship between these signals and laboratory bleaching results may indicate the initial depositional environment, and hence lead to a means of identifying well-bleached dating samples. Both sensitivities and residuals show regional differences, reflecting local geology. Preliminary ages obtained from aeolian sands associated with archaeological sites at Amble (Northumbria) and Tofts Ness (Sanday, Orkney) using regenerative blue OSL techniques on extracted quartz are broadly consistent with external age controls from the first and third millennium BC...|$|R

For reasons which do not concern the public, it is made as bitterly uncomfortable as possible. The food is infamous, and the charges seem to be wilfully pitched about eighty per cent above the tariff, so that some portion of the bill, at least, may be paid without bloodshed, or the unseemly defilement of walls with the contents of drinking glasses. This is short-sighted policy, and it would, perhaps, be better to lower the prices and hide the tariff, and put a guard about the house to prevent jackal-molested donkeys from stampeding into the verandahs. But these be details. Jodhpur dak-bungalow is a merry, merry place, and any writer in search of new ground to locate a madly improbable story in, could not do better than study it diligently. In front lies sand, riddled with innumerable ant-holes, and beyond the sand the red sandstone wall of the city, and the Mahometan burying-ground that fringes it. Fragments of sandstone set on end mark the resting places of the Faithful, who are of no great account here. Above everything, a mark for miles around, towers the dun-red pile of the Fort which is also a Palace. This is set upon sandstone rock whose sharper features have been worn smooth by the wash of the windblown sand. It is as monstrous as anything in Dore's illustrations of the Contes Drolatiques and, wherever it wanders, the eye comes back at last to its fantastic bulk. There is no greenery on the rock, nothing but fierce sunlight or black shadow. A line of red hills forms the background of the city, and this is as bare as the picked bones of camels that lie <b>bleaching</b> on the <b>sand</b> below.|$|R
40|$|Coral reef environments {{have been}} {{degrading}} steadily {{over the last}} few decades. It is generally accepted now that coral reefs are one of the first marine ecosystems to show measurable perturbations driven by global warming. Some of theses perturbations are consequence of extreme stochastic disturbances like hurricanes or extreme thermal anomalies and therefore, can be easily identified using broad indicators like coral cover. These indicators are easy to measure and provide a general description of the system in question. The detection and interpretation of more subtle perturbation in coral communities is more complicated, both logistically and conceptually. However, detecting chronic perturbations at an early stage can increase significantly the success of early mitigating management strategies. This thesis focuses on the development and application of highly sensitive indicators that can detect subtle perturbations in coral communities. It also studies the ecological interpretation of mild perturbations and their effect on the future structure of coral reef environments. The mild thermal disturbance experienced by the Heron Island reef in the south of the Great Barrier Reef during the 2005 - 2006 summer, and an environmental gradient along the central coast of Venezuela (south Caribbean Sea), were used as models to test the sensitivity of coral reefs to mild disturbances at different organisation levels (organism, population, and community). At the organismal level my results showed that the intensity of bleaching that a colony shows during a mild thermal disturbance is affected by the morphology of the colony as well as the substrates surrounding the colony. Colonies surrounded by <b>sand</b> <b>bleached</b> more than colonies surrounded by dead coral or rubble. I propose that reef specific information on the relative cover of sand, rubble, and dead coral can improve the fine scale accuracy of bleaching predicting models. Studying the same mild thermal disturbance at Heron Island, I showed how demographic parameters of some populations are more sensitive to mild thermal disturbances than coral cover (the most widely used response variable in coral monitoring programs around the world). Furthermore, my results suggest that the response of coral populations to mild thermal disturbance is different in nature and intensity to the respond observed during extreme thermal disturbances. Some taxa like Stylophora pistillata, are highly sensitive to extreme thermal disturbances, and tend {{to be the first to}} die under these conditions. In contrast, this taxon was extremely tolerant to the mild thermal disturbance of early 2006 in comparison to other taxa identified previously as more tolerant than S. pistillata. This difference in the response of coral environments to milder more common disturbances can have great influence in the trajectory that coral reefs follow in a rapidly changing world. Finally at a community level, I demonstrated how the power to detect the effect of environmental conditions on coral environments is drastically increased when the coral host-endosymbiotic algae relationship is interpreted holistically. The percentage of the variability of the community structure that can be explained by environmental variables in the central coast of Venezuela is doubled when the unit of selection considered is the holobiont instead of the coral host or the endosymbiont independently. This approach can be crucial for the detection of subtle changes in coral communities as the frequency and intensity of disturbances increase rapidly. The increase in detection power provided by the different approaches developed in this project can both improve our understanding of the structuring role of mild disturbances in coral communities as well as help identify the effect of disturbances in an early stage before the perturbation reaches catastrophic proportions. This early identification of perturbations can be used for the development of adaptive management strategies that can increase the resistance and resilience of coral reefs in the future...|$|R
40|$| resembled {{each other}} very closely, and {{accordingly}} the records for the clearing are considered to represent also the atmospheric conditions just above the canopy. It appeared that in the dry season(s) saturation deficit in the open could rise to considerable heights (figs. 23 - 25, 28, 32, 33); during the 8 wettest months it seldom reached a value of 12 mm (rel. hum. 60 %) for longer than ¼ hr. /day, but during the 2 driest months the deficit generally rose above 12 mm (rel. hum. below 40 %) during at least 1 hr. /day, and values above 20 mm (rel. hum. 45 %) were recorded repeatedly during more than one hour on end. During a very dry season a deficit of 22 mm (rel. hum. 42 %) is reached nearly every day for at least 2 hours, thus approaching values similar to those reported in desert regions. Yet, even during the driest periods {{there is a long}} night period of high humidity (fig. 28). Although the atmospheric humidity of the rain forest in Suriname showed a lower average and reached considerably lower minima than e. g. in Africa, it is uncertain whether these differences are real, because the records from other forests probably did not show the full seasonal range of humidity (1. 4. 5). During the present study extensive use was made of a set of Piche evaporimeters, although we were fully aware of the limited value of data which are obtained with an instrument that by its nature can never fully integrate the effect of various stimuli to water loss in exactly the same manner in which this is done by plants. Yet the use of a mechanical device that measures the integrated effect of the various factors by which transpiration is promoted may provide data of great ecological value, notably for comparative purposes. The advantages and limitations of the values obtained with Piche evaporimeters were discussed in 1. 5. 1 and 1. 5. 2. It appeared that the readings of capillary evaporation, especially when averaged over longer periods, may provide a very convenient measure of the relative differences in atmospheric humidity in various habitats (figs. 30, 31, 34, 45). In the forest the seasonal differences in air temperature appeared to be rather small (fig. 31), owing to the small range of the seasonal variations in overall air temperature. The daily maximum in the undergrowth of mesophytic forest generally varied between 25 ° and 30 ° C, and the minima between 20 ° and 22 ° C. The data on air temperature have been summarized in table V, and are shown graphically in figs. 31, 37 - 40. The soil temperature under forest cover showed only very small seasonal and daily variations, and at a depth of 2 cm presumably never exceeds a value of 28 ° C. The data have been summarized in table V and are shown graphically in figs. 41 - 44. The maximum range of temperature observed at 75 cm depth under closed forest remained below 2 °. It may safely be assumed that a single reading at this depth may serve as a close approximation of the long-term average of air temperature in the undergrowth. Although being small, the differences in soil temperature under different types of vegetation appeared to provide a useful, integrating index of environmental factors, as illustrated in fig. 45. In a large clearing, where the bare soil is insolated throughout the day, down to a depth of 75 cm the average temperature is considerably more than 25 ° C, which is the critical value above which destruction of organic matter in the soil is assumed to proceed at a higher rate than its deposition. In savanna forest (xeromorphous forest) intensity of illumination, air temperature, evaporation, saturation deficit and soil temperature were on the average higher than in mesophytic (rain) forest, and showed somewhat greater daily and seasonal amplitudes. During the greater part of the year the differences were very small, but they became larger during the dry season (figs. 22, 27, 31, 36, 37, 39, 44, 45). The second part deals with the soils of the regions where our ecological studies were carried out. Two main geomorphological units are recognizable in this area (II. 2. 1, II. 3) : (1) the Old cristalline Basement which is of Pre-cambrian age and which in the area under consideration consists mainly of acidic, highly metamorphous rocks with igneous intrusions; (2) the Zanderij formation which forms the nearly flat “cover landscape” between the Basement and the Coastal Sediment series. The soil studies were chiefly carried out in the transitional zone between the two formation(-series) : Mapane- and Upper-Coesewijne-region, and were described in sections II. 2 and II. 3 (cf. figs. 1 - 3, 46, 48, 53, 54). In this region the surface of the Basement Complex, which is the remnant of a very old peneplain, is undulating to fairly flat, dissected by numerous creeks and gullies; the soils vary from sandy clays to loamy coarse sands, and for the greater part are covered with (sub-) mesophytic lowland forest. Farther inland, ferrallitic soils — with abundant pisolithic ironstone gravel in the upper horizons — may predominate (II. 4) and, locally on plateaus, very shallow soils may cover a sheet of lateritic ironstone (ferrite/ferrobauxite); the forest (III. 4) is sub-mesophytic or (sub-) xeromorphous hillforest. The “Zanderij sands” which form the oldest non-consolidated sediments, vary from <b>bleached</b> coarse <b>sands</b> (with open savanna/savanna forest) to red sandy clay-loams (with sub-mesophytic forest). Although it was not our intention to develop a classification of the forest soils found in the lowlands of central Suriname, behind the coastal belt, the soil profiles were divided into 4 groups, depending on the degree of drainage, viz.; impeded, partially impeded, free, or excessive; the ferrallitic soils were kept apart. The distribution of the main types of vegetation on the nutritionally poor soils behind the coastal belt (figs. 46 and 53), presumably is mainly controlled by physical features on which the moisture relations in the soil depend; mesophytic forest is found on mesic sites, viz. on well-aerated soils where water-supply is sufficient throughout the greater part of the year. The results of the laboratory analyses (tables VI-XI) show {{that the majority of the}} soils in the sites studied, though varying in some of their characteristics (structure, texture, topography, parent materials) share many qualities which may be regarded as being typical for the majority of the soils of the rain-forest belt: in texture they are loamy to clayey, but invariably sandy, especially in the upper horizons; they are invariably acid, and are highly deficient in exchangeable bases (particularly in calcium and phosphorus), the kaolinitic clay-kolloid being strongly degraded; their organic-matter content is rather low, and the narrow C/N ratio — which is noted even in the upper horizons — indicates that humification is nearly complete and must take place very rapidly. The soils are practically devoid of weatherable minerals. The parent rock is weathered down to considerable depth and practically is split up in quartz (gravel, sand, silt), kaolin and iron (in the ferro-form in the soil solution and as ferri in coatings on the quartz grains and occasionally in the form of iron concretions). The base exchange capacity of kaolinite being very low, the humus colloids form the only adsorption complex of any importance. In the Mapane area the soil was sampled systematically in a 50 -ha complex with the principal object to ascertain how much the soil varied over a small area, and to what extend variations in soil factors might account for the striking irregularities of the distributional pattern of the trees. As a matter of fact individuals of many species in stands of mesophytic forest show a non-random distribution (II. 2. 3, IV. 5, figs. 47, 50, 52, 69); for the majority of the species studied no correlation could be found between their distribution and definite soil properties (II. 2. 3). Only for two species such a correlation could be ascertained (II. 2. 3, figs. 50, 52). The peculiar distribution of Vouacapoua americana (fig. 46) was discussed in detail in II. 2. 3. By means of distributional maps for two important tree species in small areas in the Upper-Coesewijne region (figs. 55 - 57) the very wide ecological amplitude of many tree species of the mesophytic forest is demonstrated. Combined data on pore space and soil moisture, being of paramount ecological interest, were determined (by means of constant-volume rings) at different depths of the soil profile for a range of soil types. Methods and results are discussed in section II. 6. The porosity figures given in table XII show that the total pore volume in the upper horizons of soils under forest cover is within wide limits independent of the mechanical composition of the soil, and varies between 39 - 47 % in the main zone of biological activity in the profile. As might have been expected, soil moisture appeared to he strongly correlated with the mechanical composition of the soil (fig. 59, tables XII-XIV). It was made plausible that the occurrence of mottling in the soil profile is connected with an interference in aeration during at least part of the year. The third part deals with a number of botanical surveys carried out in various types of mesophytic forest. Here too it was not the intention to arrive at a sociological classification, but we merely wished to obtain an impression of the order of magnitude of the differences found in these types of forest. To this end sample plots of 0. 3 - 1 ha were divided into squares of 10 x 10 m; in each of these quadrats all trees of 5 cm d. b. h. and over were identified and measured. In 10 % of the quadrats also the undergrowth of 2 - 4 ½ cm d. b. h. was enumerated. The method of quadrating is described in III. 1, in which section also emphasize was laid on the fact that both the size of the sample plots and of the quadrats was arbitrarily chosen; the present investigations are only meant to give a first insight in the order of magnitude of the variability existing in the composition of the forest in a small area (Mapane region) as well as over larger distances. The studies were carried out in stands of mesophytic forest belonging to the same “floristic” or “natural” area, which means that every species that was encountered in the sample plots has a natural range which is greater than the region under consideration. Yet, as was clearly demonstrated, the floristic composition of the forests which were sampled showed marked differences (tables XVII and XVIII). The heterogeneity of what is supposed to be a single stand on homogeneous (?) soil appears from the tables in which the results of enumerations in neighbouring plots are given (e. g. tables XIX-XXI). The forest on mesic sites in Suriname is typical mixed forest in that it shows the same pecularities in the distribution of the constituent species as have been described for other equatorial countries: the forest seldom shows any tendency towards single-species dominance; the composition shows distinct variations from place to place; each of the sample plots shows a different assemblage of relatively abundant, “leading” species. The latter do not exceed 20 in number, although in the whole of Suriname there are in the mesophytic forest at least some 200 species of large trees, the majority of which never become codominant. The preliminary study of the forest in Suriname indicates that it might be possible to distinguish geographic regions, within which the forest on mesic sites shows approximately the same group of “leading” species (although within such a region the relative numerical importance of each of the “leading” species shows considerable fluctuations from one place to another). Notwithstanding these heterogeneities the average floristic composition remains more or less the same in such a geographic region. Although it is admitted that some sor...|$|R
