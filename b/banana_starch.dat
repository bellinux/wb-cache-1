From {{the graph of}} viscosity versus time, the final viscosity of plantain starch (298. 67 Rvu) was {{higher than that of}} <b>Banana</b> <b>starch</b> (165. 67 Rvu). The higher viscosity recorded in plantain starch showed that there was re-association between the starch molecules which led to formation of gel and caused by not only simple kinetic effect of cooling but re-association of amylose.

Little {{is known about the}} structure of major gene families involved in <b>banana</b> <b>starch</b> metabolism and their evolution compared to other species. To identify genes involved in <b>banana</b> <b>starch</b> metabolism and investigate their evolutionary history, we analyzed six gene families playing a crucial role in plant starch biosynthesis and degradation: the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases (AGPases), starch synthases (SS), starch branching enzymes (SBE), debranching enzymes (DBE), α-amylases (AMY) and β-amylases (BAM). Using comparative genomics and phylogenetic approaches, these genes were classified into families and sub-families and orthology relationships with functional genes in Eudicots and in grasses were identified. In addition to known ancestral duplications shaping starch metabolism gene families, independent evolution in banana and grasses also occurred through lineage-specific whole genome duplications for specific sub-families of AGPase, SS, SBE, and BAM genes; and through gene-scale duplications for AMY genes. In particular, banana lineage duplications yielded a set of AGPase, SBE and BAM genes that were highly or specifically expressed in banana fruits. Gene expression analysis highlighted a complex transcriptional reprogramming of starch metabolism genes during ripening of banana fruits. A differential regulation of expression between banana gene duplicates was identified for SBE and BAM genes, suggesting that part of starch metabolism regulation in the fruit evolved in the banana lineage.

Conclui-se que os amidos de Musa AAA-Nanicão e Musa AAB-Terra são estruturalmente distintos, justificando as respostas fisiológicas distintas encontradas posteriormente pelos mesmos autores. As distinções das propriedades físicas e bioquímicas obtidas para os grânulos, embora moderadas entre si e bastante distintas em relação ao amido de milho, não explicaram a alta resistência dos amidos das bananas à digestão enzimática. Os parâmetros obtidos nas análises permitiram, pela primeira vez avaliar as características e diferenças entre grânulos de amido de espécies distintas de banana e suas relações ao amido de milho. <b>Banana</b> <b>starch</b> {{has been studied}} {{in the area of}} Nutrition ever since the concept of RS was introduced. The {{starches}} of Musa Type AAA-Nanicão and Musa Type AAB-Terra were characterized according to their physiological responses [12]. As a continuation, this study presents other physical and morphological features of starch granules from both species of banana, comparing them with native starch from commercial corn. The banana starches were extracted according to CHIANG, CHU & CHU [3]. The morphology of the granules was examined after hydrolysis in vitro pancreatic alpha-amylase. The respective X-ray amylogram and diffractogram were prepared. The length of the starch granules from Musa Type AAA-Nanicão was 30 - 40 µm. The starch granules from Musa Type AAB-Terra also presenting an oval, elongated shape, were slightly shorter between 20 - 30 µm. The enzymatic attack in vitro initiated on the once smooth surface and the corrosion caused superficial and apical grooves. A scanning electron microscopy showed that the 24 hour hydrolysis in vitro was limited, and occurred mostly in the amorphous layers of both species. The pattern of corrosion was distinctly different in the corn starch. In the viscosimeter the <b>banana</b> <b>starch</b> suspensions demonstrated a great capacity for hydration and a smaller capacity for retrogradation as compared to corn starch, especially the starch from Musa Type AAA-Nanicão; the starch from Musa Type AAB-Terra presented a greater paste stability. In the X-ray diffraction analysis, the <b>banana</b> <b>starch</b> granules were shown to be the standard type B and C for Musa Type AAA-Nanicão and Musa Type AAB-Terra, respectively. It was concluded that the structures of the starches from Musa AAA-Nanicão and Musa AAB Terra were different, justifying the different physiological responses previously found by the same authors. The distinction between the properties, both biochemical and physical, obtained for the two types of <b>banana</b> <b>starch</b> granule, although only moderate between the two, and considerably different when compared to corn starch, did not explain the high resistance of the banana starches to enzymatic digestion. For the first time, the parameters obtained in this study allow one to evaluate the characteristics and differences between the starch granules of different kinds of banana and their relation with the corn starch...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to introduce and evaluate natural excipient (banana powder) that has versatile property in the orally disintegrating tablets using Telmisartan as model drug. Oral disintegrating tablets are the useful formulations for pediatrics, geriatric, psychiatric, patients and those have difficulty in swallowing tablets/capsules resulting in improved patient compliance. Telmisartan is an antihypertensive drug which belongs to the class of Angiotensin Receptor ΙΙ (Type- ATΙ) Antagonist. It is a poorly soluble drug (BCS class-II) and its absorption is dissolution rate limited. The oral bioavailability of Telmisartan is 45 %. Hence, in this investigation an attempt was made to develop Oral dispersible tablets of Telmisartan formulated with natural disintegrating agent like banana powder with superior dissolution properties when compared to the Telmisartan ODTs formulated with synthetic superdisintegrant like SSG. The aim is to formulate various batches of oral disintegrating tablets of Telmisartan by using Banana powder and SSG with different concentrations 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, individually by using different diluents like Mannitol and Lactose by wet granulation method. The tablets were evaluated for the precompression parameters such as bulk density, compressibility, angle of repose etc and post compression parameters like hardness, weight variation, friability, disintegration time and in-vitro dissolution profiles. Tablets containing banana powder as disintegrating agent were dispersed rapidly within 15 sec and showed 92. 09 % drug release in 15 min.

40|$|Carbohydrate is {{the main}} energy source of humans and animals. It is {{important}} for biosynthesis where it acts as precursor for most chemical reaction in our body. Carbohdydrate can be divided into four group which are polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, and monosaccharides. The latter two is commonly known as sugar. There are many foods high in carbohydrate include fruits, sweets, soft drinks, breads, pastas, beans, potatoes, bran, rice, and cereals. Most plants and fruits stored carbohydrate in form of <b>starch.</b> <b>Banana</b> for example contains high percentage of carbohydrate content. Detailed studies on chemical composition of banana peels also have shown high percentage of carbohydrate content. Thus, the large quantities of banana in Malaysia specifically, have the potential of being used industrially for production of sugars. It can alternatively become a new source of food sweetener and therefore reducing Malaysia's need on sugar cane for sugar production and also reduce our dependant on imported sugar. Besides, this study can help to eliminate environmental problems caused by banana waste. Experiment was set up to extract carbohydrate in form of <b>starch</b> from the <b>banana</b> peels by alkaline extraction method using 0. 1 M NaOH. The confirmation of the extracts was done by microscopy images of starch granules. The microscopy images showed irregular shape of starch granules and when stained with iodine solution, the color changes from brown to deep blue. Further reaction takes place to convert starch into sugar in form of glucose syrup by enzyme hydrolysis using a-amylase and amyloglucosidase. Quantitative confirmation of total sugar syrup was done by Lane Eynon titration method and average result of five sample gives was 655. 4 mg!lOOml or 0. 33 % w/w...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} and replication of E. coli within Crohn’s Disease (CD) tissue {{has been confirmed}} by multiple authors and is hypothesised to be pivotal {{in the development of}} CD. In this thesis, quantification of E. coli bacteria within endoscopic biopsies has been achieved with high efficiency, sensitivity and reproducibility using PCR plasmid technology, and the technique’s utility demonstrated by quantifying E. coli within the biopsies of CD patients in clinical relapse and remission as well as within the first lesions present in CD relapse, aphthous ulcers. These studies showed some interesting correlations with clinical, macroscopic, and histological data, obtained during a clinical trial of soluble plantain fibre supplementation for prevention of relapse in CD. These included increased quantities of E. coli in tissues from the mucosa of patients in clinical relapse whose ileum was macroscopically normal yet histologically inflamed, and significant falls in the quantities of E. coli over time in the biopsy tissues of patients who were in clinical remission. The ability of a specific group of E. coli, the adherent invasive E. coli (AIEC), to replicate within macrophages, is increasingly perceived to be fundamental in CD pathogenesis. The replication of E. coli within the phagolysosomes of macrophages is implicated in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, granuloma formation, and the consequent mucosal injury seen in CD. The pharmacological inhibition of AIEC replication in this work within murine macrophage tissue in vitro by the immunosuppressive azathioprine and its active metabolite 6 -thioguanine {{as well as by the}} antibiotic ciprofloxacin at clinically relevant concentrations is supportive of this central hypothesis, and also suggests new treatment combinations that might be trialled in active CD. Interestingly and unexpectedly the steroid hydrocortisone also inhibited AIEC replication within macrophages, suggesting that sepsis-related complications seen with steroid use clinically may be related to its effects on neutrophil recruitment, rather than on phagocytic killing of bacteria. The diarrhoeal pathogens EPEC, ETEC, and C. difficile represent a large disease burden in terms of infantile, travellers’, and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea respectively with C. difficile also sometimes implicated in the exacerbation of CD. Plantain (<b>banana)</b> non <b>starch</b> polysaccharide (NSP) has previously been demonstrated to inhibit AIEC adhesion to mucosal tissues, and this work demonstrates the inhibition of the adherence of ETEC and C. difficile to intestinal cells in vitro with two different modalities, using concentrations of soluble plantain fibre that are readily achievable in the distal intestinal lumen. Previous work on AIEC inhibition with plantain was confirmed, whilst oat fibre and apple pectin did not significantly inhibit ETEC adherence. EPEC was not inhibited by plantain fibre, which may be due to its unique epithelial interaction. These foodstuffs, if prepared as suitable supplements, may offer new prophylactic therapeutic interventions for global and institutional diarrhoeal illness following appropriate clinical trials.
