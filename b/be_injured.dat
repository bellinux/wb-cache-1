5|$|The mucosal {{lining of}} the trachea may also <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> by {{inhalation}} of hot gases or harmful fumes such as chlorine gas. This can lead to edema (swelling), necrosis (death of the tissue), scar formation, and ultimately stenosis. However, TBI due to inhalation, foreign body aspiration, and medical procedures is uncommon.|$|E
5|$|While whaling {{no longer}} threatens the species, {{individuals}} {{are vulnerable to}} collisions with ships, entanglement in fishing gear and noise pollution. Like other cetaceans, humpbacks can <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> by excessive noise. In the 19th century, two humpback whales were found dead near sites of repeated oceanic sub-bottom blasting, with traumatic injuries and fractures in the ears.|$|E
5|$|A serious {{accident}} occurred on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill. All the bogies {{on the leading}} coach left the rails, causing fifteen people (nine women and six men) to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> seriously {{enough for them to}} be taken to the Western Infirmary.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
5|$|In July of that year, McAleer {{presided over}} the Blues' upset 6–1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. Although the Tigers' manager, Tommy Burns, agreed to forfeit the game for fear that the umpire, Joe Cantillon, would <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> by an angry crowd, McAleer agreed to play the Tigers using a reserve umpire. The Blues {{eventually}} closed {{the season with a}} 54–82 record, placing seventh in the eight-team American League.|$|E
5|$|Later, Liz apologizes to Jenna for {{allowing}} her to <b>be</b> <b>injured,</b> and agrees to let Jenna tell the TGS writing staff about her role in an advertisement for a phone sex line. The writers find the ad online, and greatly enjoy watching it. Jack comes in while the writers are watching and laughs so hard that he vomits. The laughter lifts Jack out of his bad mood, and he tells Liz what an important friend she is.|$|E
50|$|Company records {{indicate}} around 10,000 workers (roughly 1.6% of its claimed more than 600,000 workers) <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> at work every year. According to a 2002 {{report by the}} AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department, Labor Ready employees <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> at three times the U.S. national average rate.

5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> or killed by the animals or drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} {{placed on a}} {{horizontal}} tree branch or in a shrub, a few metres above the ground. The nest is an open cup constructed of grass stalks and other fibres, and lined with feathers and hair. The female lays three to five pinkish eggs with brown dots from May to July. Incubation and fledging periods are unknown. This species has been recorded giving a distraction display, pretending to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> to distract predators from its nest. Both parents feed the young, though the female may do so more frequently.|$|E
5|$|This cavalry {{charge was}} unique {{during the whole}} of the First World War, being the only one carried out in the dark and across country, which had not been {{previously}} reconnoitred. The ground was found to be scattered with clumps of long spiked thistles, and a number of pitfalls causing nine men to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> from falls during the charge.|$|E

5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> or killed by a high fall.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{returns to}} {{challenge}} Fats again, putting up his entire $3,000 stake {{on a single}} game. He wins game after game, beating Fats so badly that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands a share of Eddie's winnings and threatens that Eddie will <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> unless he pays. But Eddie says that {{if he is not}} killed he will kill Bert when he recovers; invoking the memory of Sarah, he shames Bert into giving up his claim. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big-time pool hall again. Eddie and Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.|$|E
5|$|His initial {{appearance}} of the 1914season was in relief on April 17, {{a game in which}} he pitched 4innings, and gave up three runs in 6–5victory over the Reds. He followed that with two consecutive strong games as the starting pitcher, allowing just one unearned run in each game; the second was a complete game against the Reds. On June12, he started the game against New York, only to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> in the third inning when he was hit in the hand by a ball batted by Fred Merkel, and had to leave the game. The injury did not cause Lavender to lose much playing time. He pitched a four-inning relief appearance on June19, followed by a complete game shutout on June27 against the Reds. On August17, he pitched a second shutout during the season, a 3-0victory over the Brooklyn Robins.|$|E

5|$|Lusitanos {{can be any}} solid color, {{although}} they are generally gray, bay or chestnut. Horses of the Alter Real strain are always bay. Members of the breed are of Baroque type, with convex facial profiles, heavy muscling, intelligent and willing natures, with agile and elevated movement. Originally bred for war, dressage and bullfighting, Lusitanos are still used today in the latter two. They have competed in several Olympics and World Equestrian Games {{as part of the}} Portuguese and Spanish dressage teams. They have also made a showing in driving competitions, with a Belgian team of Lusitanos winning multiple international titles. Members of the breed are still used in bloodless bullfighting today, where it is expected that neither horse or bull will <b>be</b> <b>injured.</b>|$|E
5|$|No {{members of}} the general public were {{permitted}} on the island during the ceremonies, which were reserved entirely for dignitaries. The only females granted access were Bartholdi's wife and de Lesseps's granddaughter; officials stated that they feared women might <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> in the crush of people. The restriction offended area suffragists, who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island. The group's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women's right to vote. A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather.|$|E
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
50|$|In October 1806, Morand {{commanded}} his {{division at}} the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, where he performed well and <b>was</b> <b>injured</b> in the arm. He <b>was</b> <b>injured</b> again at the Battle of Eylau.|$|R
50|$|In late April, New York Times {{reported}} that nine people {{had died and}} more than fifty <b>were</b> <b>injured.</b> In July, New York Times {{reported that}} more than 250 had <b>been</b> <b>injured.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub-contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct or modify, and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> by their failure to maintain or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> as {{a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result}} of tumour spread, or due to other means. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. Injury to the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both the right and left nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to <b>be</b> <b>injured</b> as a result, especially Ray, who is now paralyzed from the waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E
