40|$|Session T 9 - Reconstruction of East Asian <b>Blocks</b> <b>in</b> Pangea: paper no. 238 - 1 Pangea is the {{youngest}} supercontinent in Earth's history and its main body formed about 250 million years ago. As supported by voluminous evidence from reliable geological, paleomagnetic and paleontological data, configurations of major continental <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> Pangea have been widely accepted. However, controversy has long surrounded the reconstructions of East Asian <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> Pangea. So far, most Pangea reconstructions assume that continental <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> East Asia had never become parts of Pangea before its breakup. In these reconstruction models, configurations of East Asian <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> Pangea were mainly based on geological and paleomagnetic data before the 1990 ’s but did not fully consider recent data produced by Chinese researchers about collisional mountain belts between continental <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> East Asia. To precisely reconstruct the East Asian <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> Pangea, the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) recently set up a Major NSFC Program entitled “Reconstruction of East Asian <b>Blocks</b> <b>in</b> Pangea”. On the basis of summarizing and integrating previous data, this major program will carry out detailed field-based structural, metamorphic, geochemical, geochronological, paleomagnetic and paleontonological investigations on key segments of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, Central China Orogenic Belt and Paleo-Tethys Belt, which assembled major continental <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> East Asia, {{in order to determine}} the timing and processes of opening and closuring of the Paleo-Asian Ocean, Proto-Tethyan Ocean (Qin-Qi-Kun Ocean) and Paleo-Tethyan Ocean. The program will not only answer where, when and how continental <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> East Asia were assembled and whether or not they had become parts of Pangea before the breakup of the supercontinent, but will also improve and develop the theory of plate tectonics. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
