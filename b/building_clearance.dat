Counter terrorist training includes close quarters battle (CQB), explosive entry, tubular assault (in vehicles such as in buses, trains and aircraft) and in high rise buildings, as well as room and <b>building</b> <b>clearance.</b> This training is conducted in a range of advanced facilities, including electronic indoor and outdoor CQB ranges, outdoor sniper range, and urban training facilities at Swanbourne. Additional facilities include a special urban complex, vertical plunging range, method of entry house, and simulated oil rig and aircraft mock-ups in order to provide realistic training environments for potential operational scenarios. Free-Fall training includes High Altitude Parachute Operations (HAPO) either High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) or High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) conducted at a maximum of 25,000 feet. SASR personnel also provide training in weapons handling to ASIS operatives at Swan Island in Victoria. Despite a possible reduction in rank, SASR operators receive significant allowances, which make them among the highest-paid soldiers in the Australian Defence Force, with a trooper (equivalent to a private) reportedly earning about $100,000 per annum in 2006.|$|E

Wartime haste in <b>building,</b> insufficient <b>clearance</b> between the rotating and fixed structure of the turret, insufficient full calibre firing exercises and extensive arrangements to prevent flash from reaching the magazines made it mechanically complex, leading to problems during prolonged actions. In order to bring ammunition into the turret at any degree of train, the design included a transfer ring between the magazine and turret; this did not have sufficient clearance {{to allow for the}} ship bending and flexing. Improved clearances, improved mechanical linkages, and better training led to greater reliability in the quadruple turrets but they remained controversial.|$|R

Since 2009, under the amended Occupational Safety and Health Act, the survey of asbestos in <b>buildings</b> and <b>clearance</b> test of asbestos removal works have been mandated to be carried out by the laboratories designated by the Ministry of Employment and Labor (MOEL) in the Republic of Korea. To assess the performance of asbestos laboratories, a PT scheme on asbestos analysis was launched by the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA) on behalf of the MOEL in 2007. Participating laboratories are evaluated once a year for fiber counting and bulk asbestos analysis by phase contrast microscopy and polarized light microscopy, respectively. Currently, the number of laboratory enrollments is >  200, and the percentage of passed laboratories is >  90. The current status and several significant changes in operation, sample preparations, and statistics of assigning the reference values of the KOSHA PT scheme on asbestos analysis are presented.

500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the indoor-outdoor {{thermometer}} is to allow the outside temperature to be indicated inside a building, thus removing the need to go outside to take a temperature reading. [...] They are also used in vehicles, and are particularly useful for municipal vehicles involved in snow and ice <b>clearance.</b> <b>Building</b> maintenance engineers can use an indoor-outdoor thermometer that has not been installed to get a quick reading of air temperature in a location inside a building. [...] This is done by swinging the bulb of the outdoor sensor in the air while still attached to the instrument. This will get a faster reading because the bulb will come up to temperature much more quickly than the indoor sensor built into the instrument.|$|R

60|$|Let us, however, {{drop the}} expert methods and handle this {{question}} rather more rudely. Do we want London rebuilt? If we do, is there, after all, {{any reason why}} we should rebuild it on its present site? London is where it is for reasons that have long ceased to be valid; it grew there, it has accumulated associations, an immense tradition, that this constant mucking about of builders and architects is destroying almost as effectually as removal to a new site. The old sort of rebuilding was a natural and picturesque process, house by house, and street by street, a thing as pleasing and almost as natural in effect as the spreading and interlacing of trees; as this new <b>building,</b> this <b>clearance</b> of areas, the piercing of avenues, becomes more comprehensive, it becomes less reasonable. If we can do such big things we may surely attempt bigger things, so that whether we want to plan a new capital or preserve the old, it comes at last to the same thing, that {{it is unreasonable to}} be constantly pulling down the London we have and putting it up again. Let us drain away our heavy traffic into tunnels, set up that clearing-house plan, and control the growth at the periphery, which is still so witless and ugly, and, save for the manifest tidying and preserving that is needed, begin to leave the central parts of London, which are extremely interesting even where they are not quite beautiful, in peace.|$|R
40|$|During the {{construction}} {{stage of a}} <b>building</b> with high <b>clearances,</b> large spans and thick slabs, the isolated tower scaffolds which have higher load-carrying capacity are often considered {{to serve as the}} falsework and meet the load demand of the building. Because isolated tower scaffolds served as temporary supports are immediately removed after finishing {{the construction}} stage, the importance is often neglected. Up to now, the information on the structural design of isolated tower scaffolds has been rather scarce, and the assembly of isolated tower scaffolds on construction sites still relies mainly on the experienced workers. This phenomenon results in a high risk of collapse in actual application of isolated tower scaffolds on construction sites. This study explores the critical loads and the failure models of isolated tower scaffolds in various setups by testing actual installations of isolated tower scaffolds based on construction sites. The research results show that the base screw jack has a limited effect on the overall load-carrying capacity of isolated tower scaffolds. When isolated tower scaffolds are set up on ground with different elevations or on ground under an inclined top slab with varying elevations, the load-carrying capacity is not affected evidently if the elevation is less than half meter. On construction sites, when assembled in multiple layers, th...|$|R
