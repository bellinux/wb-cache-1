40|$|Background—Most {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that -adrenergic receptor antagonists improve long-term survival in heart failure patients. <b>Bucindolol,</b> a nonselective -receptor blocker, however, failed to reduce heart failure mortality in a recent large clinical trial. The reasons for this failure are not known. <b>Bucindolol</b> has partial agonist properties in rat myocardium, but whether it has agonist activity in human heart is controversial. To address this, we measured the ability of <b>bucindolol</b> to increase cAMP accumulation in human myocardium. Methods and Results—Myocardial strips (1 mm 3) obtained from rat and nonfailing human hearts were confirmed to be viable for 48 hours in normoxic tissue culture by MTT assay and histology. Freshly isolated strips were exposed to -adrenergic antagonists and agonists and assayed for cAMP. In both rat and human strips, the full -adrenergic agonist isoproterenol raised cAMP levels by 2. 5 -fold at 15 minutes. Carvedilol and propranolol had no effect on basal cAMP levels, whereas metoprolol reduced basal cAMP by 25 %.

40|$|Beta-adrenergic {{blockade}} {{represents a}} promising therapeutic approach to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. <b>Bucindolol,</b> a new beta-blocker, showed favorable effects in a short-term (3 month) trial in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. To assess long-term response, 20 study patients (7 of 9 patients previously {{assigned to the}} placebo group and 13 of 14 patients previously assigned to <b>bucindolol</b> therapy) received long-term <b>bucindolol</b> therapy and were followed up for a mean of 23 ± 4 months (range 17 to 30). The mean patient age was 49 years (range 29 to 66) and the median duration of disease was 11 months (range 1 to 190).

At {{the end of the}} common follow-up time, all 20 patients were alive, 17 continued to receive <b>bucindolol</b> (mean dose 176 mg/day, range 25 to 200), and 2 underwent cardiac transplantation. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from a baseline value of 25 ± 8 % to 35 ± 13 % (n = 19 pairs, p < 0. 001). Functional class improved in 12, was unchanged in 5 and deteriorated in 3 (p = 0. 056). Exercise time was maintained (9. 4 ± 3. 1 versus 9. 1 ± 3. 5 min, n = 19, p = NS), as was maximal oxygen uptake (19. 2 ± 4. 9 versus 18. 8 ± 5. 7 ml/kg per min, n = 19, p = NS). Thus, long-term <b>bucindolol</b> therapy leads to substantial increases in ejection fraction and to improved functional class while stable exercise performance is maintained.

We considered polymorphisms in the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR), a β-blocker target, as candidate pharmacogenomic loci. Transfected cells, genotyped human nonfailing and failing ventricles, and a clinical trial were used to ascertain phenotype and mechanism. In nonfailing and failing isolated ventricles, β 1 -Arg- 389 had respective 2. 8 ± 0. 3 - and 4. 3 ± 2. 1 -fold greater agonist-promoted contractility vs. β 1 -Gly- 389, defining enhanced physiologic coupling under relevant conditions of endogenous expression and HF. The β-blocker <b>bucindolol</b> was an inverse agonist in failing Arg, but not Gly, ventricles, without partial agonist activity at either receptor; carvedilol was a genotype-independent neutral antagonist. In transfected cells, <b>bucindolol</b> antagonized agonist-stimulated cAMP, with a greater absolute decrease observed for Arg- 389 (435 ± 80 vs. 115 ± 23 fmol per well). Potential pathophysiologic correlates were assessed in a placebo-controlled trial of <b>bucindolol</b> in 1, 040 HF patients. No outcome was associated with genotype in the placebo group, indicating little impact on the natural course of HF. However, the Arg- 389 homozygotes treated with <b>bucindolol</b> had an age-, sex-, and race-adjusted 38 % reduction in mortality (P = 0. 03) and 34 % reduction in mortality or hospitalization (P = 0. 004) vs. placebo.

The major allele homozygotes and minor allele carriers of each polymorphism are respectively associated with efficacy enhancement and loss, creating the possibility for genotype combination interactions that can be measured by clinical trial methodology. In a 1, 040 patient substudy of a <b>bucindolol</b> vs. placebo heart failure clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that combinations of β(1) 389 and α(2 C) 322 - 325 polymorphisms are additive for both efficacy enhancement and loss. Additionally, norepinephrine (NE) affinity for β(1) 389 AR variants was measured in human explanted left ventricles. The combination of β(1) 389 Arg+α(2 C) 322 - 325 Wt major allele homozygotes (47 % of the trial population) was non-additive for efficacy enhancement across six clinical endpoints, with an average efficacy increase of 1. 70 -fold vs. 2. 32 -fold in β(1) 389 Arg homozygotes+α(2 C) 322 - 325 Del minor allele carriers. In contrast, the minor allele carrier combination (13 % subset) exhibited additive efficacy loss. These disparate effects are likely due to the higher proportion (42 % vs. 8. 7 %, P =  0. 009) of high-affinity NE binding sites in β(1) 389 Arg vs. Gly ARs, which converts α(2 C) Del minor allele-associated NE lowering from a therapeutic liability to a benefit.

Neither the binding of nebivolol nor of bisoprolol is affected by the presence of guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH) p). Nebivolol and bisoprolol exert similar inverse agonist activity in human ventricular as well as atrial myocardium. In atrial myocardium, inverse agonism of both compounds is higher compared to <b>bucindolol,</b> equal to carvedilol and lower compared to metoprolol. Favourable haemodynamic effects of nebivolol in humans are not due to β 1 -selectivity or partial agonist activity of this agent. Other mechanisms, i. e. the production of nitric oxide, may thus be responsible for its unique haemodynamic profile...|$|E
40|$|Heart failure {{patients}} with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) are heterogenous, and {{our ability to}} identify patients likely to respond to therapy is limited. We present a method of identifying disease subtypes using high-dimensional clinical phenotyping and latent class analysis that {{may be useful in}} personalizing prognosis and treatment in HFREF. A total of 1121 {{patients with}} nonischemic HFREF from the β-blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial were categorized according to 27 clinical features. Latent class analysis was used to generate two latent class models, LCM A and B, to identify HFREF subtypes. LCM A consisted of features associated with HF pathogenesis, whereas LCM B consisted of markers of HF progression and severity. The Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) Score was also calculated for all patients. Mortality, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as an increase in LVEF ≥ 5 % and a final LVEF of 35 % after 12 months, and effect of <b>bucindolol</b> on both outcomes were compared across HFREF subtypes. Performance of models that included a combination of LCM subtypes and SHFM scores towards predicting mortality and LVEF response was estimated and subsequently validated using leave-one-out cross-validation and data from the Multicenter Oral Carvedilol Heart Failure Assessment Trial. A total of 6 subtypes were identified using LCM A and 5 subtypes using LCM B. Several subtypes resembled familiar clinical phenotypes. Prognosis, improvement in LVEF, and the effect of <b>bucindolol</b> treatment differed significantly between subtypes. Prediction improved with addition of both latent class models to SHFM for both 1 -year mortality and LVEF response outcomes. The combination of high-dimensional phenotyping and latent class analysis identifies subtypes of HFREF with implications for prognosis and response to specific therapies that may provide insight into mechanisms of disease. These subtypes may facilitate development of personalized treatment plans...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis was a {{retrospective}} analysis {{to determine the effect}} of diabetes on outcome in patients with advanced heart failure (HF), and to determine the effect of beta-blockade in patients with HF with and without diabetes mellitus. BackgroundIn chronic HF the impact on clinical outcomes and therapeutic response of the prevalent comorbid condition diabetes mellitus has not been extensively investigated. MethodsWe assessed the impact of diabetes on prognosis and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy with <b>bucindolol</b> in patients with HF enrolled in the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST). We conducted {{a retrospective}} analysis to examine the prognosis of patients with advanced HF with and without diabetes, and the effect of beta-blocker therapy on mortality and HF progression or myocardial infarction (MI). The database was the 2, 708 patients with advanced HF (36 % with diabetes and 64 % without diabetes) who were randomized to the beta-blocker <b>bucindolol</b> or placebo in BEST and followed for mortality, hospitalization, and MI for an average of two years. ResultsPatients with diabetes had more severe chronic HF and more coronary risk factors than patients without diabetes. Diabetes was independently associated with increased mortality in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (adjusted hazard ratio 1. 33, 95 % confidence interval 1. 12 to 1. 58, p = 0. 001), but not in those with a nonischemic etiology (adjusted hazard ratio 0. 98, 95 % confidence interval 0. 74 to 1. 30, p = 0. 89). Compared with patients without diabetes, in diabetic patients beta-blocker therapy was at least as effective in reducing death or HF hospitalizations, total hospitalizations, HF hospitalizations, and MI. Ventricular function and physiologic responses to beta-blockade were similar in patients with and without diabetes. ConclusionsDiabetes worsens prognosis in patients with advanced HF, but this worsening appears to be limited to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In advanced HF beta-blockade is effective in reducing major clinical end points in patients with and without diabetes...|$|E

CIBIS-II, COPERNICUS, and MERIT-HF have shown that β-blocker treatment with bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol XL, respectively, reduce mortality in advanced heart failure patients, whereas BEST found a statistically nonsignificant trend toward reduced mortality with <b>bucindolol.</b> We conducted a post hoc analysis to determine whether the response to β-blockade in BEST could be related to differences in the clinical and demographic characteristics of the study populations. We generated a sample from BEST to resemble the patient cohorts studied in CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF to find out whether the response to β-blocker therapy was similar to that reported in the other trials. These findings are further compared with COPERNICUS, which entered patients with more severe heart failure. Methods: To achieve conformity with the entry criteria for CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF, the BEST study population was adjusted to exclude patients with systolic blood pressure 100 mm Hg, heart rate 60 bpm, and age 80 years (exclusion criteria employed in those trials). The BEST comparison subgroup (BCG) was further modified to more closely reflect the racial demographics reported for patients enrolled in CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF. The association of β-blocker therapy with overall survival and survival free of cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, and progressive pump failure in the BCG was assessed...|$|E
40|$|Objective To clarify {{whether any}} {{particular}} beta blocker is superior {{in patients with}} heart failure and reduced ejection fraction or whether the benefits of these agents are mainly due to a class effect. Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis of efficacy of different beta blockers in heart failure. Data sources CINAHL(1982 - 2011), Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials (- 2011), Embase (1980 - 2011), Medline/PubMed (1966 - 2011), and Web of Science (1965 - 2011). Study selection Randomized trials comparing beta blockers with other beta blockers or other treatments. Data extraction The primary endpoint was all cause death at the longest available follow-up, assessed with odds ratios and Bayesian random effect 95 % credible intervals, with independent extraction by observers. Results 21 trials were included, focusing on atenolol, bisoprolol, <b>bucindolol,</b> carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol. As expected, in the overall analysis, beta blockers provided credible mortality benefits in comparison with placebo or standard treatment after a median of 12 months (odds ratio 0. 69, 0. 56 to 0. 80). However, no obvious differences were found when comparing the different beta blockers head {{to head for the}} risk of death, sudden cardiac death, death due to pump failure, or drug discontinuation. Accordingly, improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction were also similar irrespective of the individual study drug. Conclusion The benefits of beta blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction seem to be mainly due to a class effect, as no statistical evidence from current trials supports the superiority of any single agent over the others...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of gender on baseline characteristics, response to treatment, and prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). BackgroundUnder-representation of women in HF clinical trials has limited our understanding of gender-related differences in patients with HF. MethodsThe impact of gender was assessed in the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) which randomized 2, 708 patients with New York Heart Association class III/IV and LVEF ≤ 0. 35 to <b>bucindolol</b> versus placebo. Women (n = 593) were compared with men (n = 2, 115). Mean follow-up period was two years. ResultsSignificant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were found. Women were younger, more likely to be black, had a higher prevalence of nonischemic etiology, higher right and left ventricular ejection fraction, higher heart rate, greater cardiothoracic ratio, higher prevalence of left bundle branch block, lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and lower plasma norepinephrine level. Ischemic etiology and measures of severity of HF were found to be predictors of prognosis in women and men. However, differences in the predictive values of various variables were noted; most notably, coronary artery disease and LVEF appear to be stronger predictors of prognosis in women. In the nonischemic patients, women had a significantly better survival rate compared with men. ConclusionsIn HF patients with impaired LVEF, significant gender differences are present, and the prognostic predictive values of some variables vary in magnitude between women and men. The survival advantage of women is confined to patients with nonischemic etiology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause {{mortality}} in patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction according to gender, race, {{and the presence of}} diabetes. BackgroundMajor randomized clinical trials have established that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers have life-saving benefits in patients with LV systolic dysfunction. Most patients enrolled in these trials were Caucasian men. Whether an equal effect is achieved in women, non-Caucasians, and patients with major comorbidities has not been established. MethodsThe authors performed a meta-analysis of published and individual patient data from the 12 largest randomized clinical trials of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers to produce random effects estimates of mortality for subgroups. ResultsData support beneficial reductions in all-cause mortality for the use of beta-blockers in men and women, the use of ACE inhibitors and some beta-blockers in black and white patients, and the use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in patients with or without diabetes. Women with symptomatic LV systolic dysfunction probably benefit from ACE inhibitors, but women with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction may not have reduced mortality when treated with ACE inhibitors (pooled relative risk = 0. 96; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 75 to 1. 22). The pooled estimate of three beta-blocker studies supports a beneficial effect in black patients with heart failure, but one study assessing <b>bucindolol</b> reported a nonsignificant increase in mortality. ConclusionsAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers provide life-saving benefits in most of the subpopulations assessed. Women with asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction may not achieve a mortality benefit when treated with ACE inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: Beta-blockers are an {{established}} treatment for chronic heart failure. However, {{the relationship between}} their benefit and {{the severity of the}} disease remains to be determined. Methods and results: We studied the relationship between amplitude of benefit of beta-blockers and severity of chronic heart failure, based on data for mortality and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, complementary subgroup analyses and analysis of individual data from the CIBIS II trial. In the meta-analysis, mortality was reduced by 22 % (95 %CI: 16 to 28) and hospitalizations for worsening heart failure by 24 % (95 %CI: 20 to 29). Benefit was similar with metoprolol, bisoprolol and carvedilol. After exclusion of <b>bucindolol</b> trials, due to the heterogeneity of results for mortality, the reduction in mortality was similar according to the severity of heart failure, assessed either by left ventricular ejection fraction or by New York Heart Association classification. In CIBIS II, beta-blockers induced a significant reduction in mortality of 45 % (95 %CI: 9 to 66), 41 % (95 %CI: 17 to 59) and 23 % (95 %CI: 1 to 40) in the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively. Hospitalizations were reduced by 35 % (95 %CI: 2 to 57), 41 % (95 %CI: 18 to 58) and 23 % (95 %CI: 0 to 41), {{there was no significant difference}} between the three score groups.

The rank order of β 1 -selectivity as judged by competition experiments to 3 H-CGP 12. 1777 in the presence of CGP 207. 12 A (300 [*]nmol[*]l− 1, Kiβ 2) or ICI 118. 551 (50 [*]nmol[*]l− 1, Kiβ 1) were NEB(Kiβ 2 /Kiβ 1 : 40. 7) >BIS(15. 6) >MET(4. 23) >CAR(0. 73) >BUC(0. 49). The rank order of the negative inotropic potency of the β-adrenoceptor antagonists measured in left ventricular trabeculae (dilated cardiomyopathy, DCM) as judged by the concentration needed to induce a 50 % decrease in isoprenaline (1 [*]μmol[*]l− 1) -stimulated force (IC 50) was: MET (0. 6 [*]μmol[*]l− 1) >CAR (4. 1 [*]μmol[*]l− 1) >NEB (7. 0 [*]μmol[*]l− 1). NEB, BUC, MET and CAR did not not exert an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) as determined by measurements of force development in forskolin (0. 3 [*]μmol[*]l− 1) pre-treated left ventricular trabeculae, nor by measuring adenylate cyclase activity in forskolin (0. 3 [*]μmol[*]l− 1) -stimulated assays (crude membranes). This also holds true for radioligand binding assays with or without guanine nucleotide guanyl- 5 ′-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH) p). Although all studied β-adrenoceptor antagonists lack intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), they differ in the β 1 -selectivity as well as in their direct negative inotropic action. These differences as well as the mode of extracardiac action may have an impact on outcome of patients treated with β-adrenoceptor antagonists...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{investigated}} the role of adrenergic receptor genetics on transplant-free survival in heart failure (HF). BackgroundDiscordant results exist for genetic associations between adrenergic receptor alleles and end points of β-blocker response in HF patients. MethodsWe identified 637 patients enrolled in 2 U. S. cardiovascular genetic registries with HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction who were discharged on β-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and diuretic medications. End points were determined through the national Social Security Death Master File and transplant records. We genotyped 5 polymorphisms in 3 genes: ADRB 1 (S 49 G, R 389 G), ADRB 2 (G 16 R, Q 27 E), and ADRA 2 C (Del 322 - 325) using 5 ′ nuclease assays and performed a multivariable clinical-genetic analysis. ResultsA total of 190 events (29. 8 %) occurred over a median follow-up of 1, 070 days. Multivariable analysis showed a significant effect of 4 clinical factors on survival: age (p = 0. 006), gender (p = 0. 005), ejection fraction (p = 0. 0002), and hemoglobin (p = 0. 00010). There was no significant effect of the polymorphisms or haplotypes analyzed on survival. ConclusionsGenotypes and haplotypes of ADRB 1, ADRB 2, and ADRA 2 C did not significantly affect survival in metoprolol-treated or carvedilol-treated HF patients in this study. These results complement the findings of 2 similarly designed previous studies, but do not replicate an association of ADRB 2 haplotypes and survival. All 3 studies differ from a survival benefit reported for bucindolol-treated homozygous ADRB 1 R 389 individuals. This may be attributable to a drug-specific interaction between genotype and outcome with <b>bucindolol</b> that {{does not seem to}} occur with metoprolol or carvedilol...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether higher left ventricular inotropic reserve, defined as the increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in response to intravenous dobutamine infusion, or other ventriculographic variables predict the increase in LVEF after beta-blocker therapy in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). BACKGROUNDLong-term beta-blocker therapy increases LVEF in some patients with NICM. Other than dose, there are no definite predictors of LVEF increase. METHODSThirty patients with LVEF ≤ 0. 35 and NICM underwent assessment of LVEF at rest and after a 10 -min intravenous infusion of dobutamine at 10 μg/kg/min, using equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography. Age was 49 ± 11 years, 33 % women, functional class 2. 6 ± 0. 5, duration of chronic heart failure 3. 2 ± 2. 9 years, LVEF 0. 21 ± 0. 07, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index 180 ± 64 ml/m 2. Right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was abnormal in 37 %. Mean dobutamine-induced augmentation of LVEF (DoΔLVEF) was 0. 12 ± 0. 08. Patients were started on one of three beta-blockers (carvedilol, <b>bucindolol</b> or metoprolol) and the dose was advanced to the maximum tolerated. RESULTSLeft ventricular ejection fraction, reassessed 7. 4 ± 5. 9 months after maximum beta-blocker dose was reached, increased to 0. 34 ± 0. 13 (p = 0. 0006). The following baseline variables correlated with improvement of LVEF: DoΔLVEF (p = 0. 001), RVEF (p = 0. 005), systolic blood pressure at end of dobutamine infusion (p = 0. 02) and dose of beta-blocker (p = 0. 07). In a multivariate analysis, only DoΔLVEF (p = 0. 0003) and RVEF (p = 0. 002) were predictive of the increase in LVEF. CONCLUSIONSPatients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who have higher left ventricular inotropic reserve and normal RVEF derive higher increase in LVEF from beta-blocker therapy...|$|E
40|$|For {{cardiovascular}} {{diseases such as}} high blood pressure, angina pectoris, and left ventricle hypertrophy; long-term activation of beta-adrenergic receptors is strongly linked to the progression of these diseases. A class of antagonistic drugs that target betaadrenergic receptors are collectively called beta-blockers. These drugs are commonly used to reduce the inotropic and chronotropic effects of beta-adrenergic receptor activation. This past decade has revealed that beta-blockers and other ligands are capable of functional selectivity at receptors. Functional selectivity describes the ability of ligands acting at 0 protein-coupled receptors (OPCRs) to preferentially activate or inhibit different signal transduction pathways. The studies on beta-adrenergic 2 receptors that explored functional selectivity showed that beta-blockers can be functionally selective by inhibiting the cAMP pathway while simultaneously activating ERK. The 0 protein coupled to beta-adrenergic receptors are the primary regulators of the cAMP, however {{there are a variety}} of pathways that can regulate ERK activity and few studies have tried to determine which pathway(s) the beta-blockers are targeting to cause this ERK activation. This is especially important for beta-adrenergic 2 receptors because they can activate ERK through multiple pathways (0 protein switching from G, to Oi/oprotein, beta-arrestin assisted or EOFR transactivation). ERK activation is linked to reversing cell damage caused by apoptosis signaling that results from G, activation by beta-adrenergic receptors. Understanding the specific pathways these beta-blockers can target for ERK activation would lead to better understanding of their therapeutic benefits. In this study we plan to elucidate the pathways several beta-blockers are targeting to activate ERK. In particular, we will investigate the role of clathrin-mediated receptor internalization and EGFR transactivation in beta-blocker-dependent ERK phosphorylation. In HEK 293 cells transfected with beta-adrenergic 2 receptors, we measured the changes in cAMP and ERK phosphorylation in response to the following beta-blockers labetalol, alprenolol, <b>bucindolol,</b> carvedilol, carazolol, leI 118, 551 and propanolol. All of the beta-blockers studied inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation but stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK to varying degrees. Beta-blocker-mediated ERK phosphorylation was shown to be dependent on clathrin-dependent internalization and EGFR transactivation...|$|E
