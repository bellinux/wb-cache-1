An organization known as Fenrir was founded to exterminate Aragami using weapons called God Arcs which is made from the cells of an Aragami. Those who specialize in exterminating Aragami are known as God Eaters. Originally God Eaters had one type in which their God Arcs can only keep gun form or <b>blade</b> <b>form,</b> however a new type has been discovered that can switch between gun and <b>blade</b> <b>form.</b> Since then, they have been classified new-types and the previous as old-types.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill is a}} polearm weapon used by {{infantry}} {{in medieval}} Europe.The bill is similar in size, function and appearance to the halberd, differing mainly in the hooked <b>blade</b> <b>form.</b> Other terms for the bill include English bill, bill hook or bill-guisarme.|$|E
5000|$|An eastern {{influence}} can {{be detected}} in the <b>blade</b> <b>form,</b> and Le Marchant is recorded {{as saying that the}} [...] "blades of the Turks, Mamalukes, Moors and Hungarians were preferable to any other". The blade profile is similar to some examples of the Indian tulwar, and expert opinion has commented upon this. This similarity prompted some Indian armourers to re-hilt old 1796 pattern blades as tulwars later in the 19th century.|$|E

2500|$|The {{species of}} Sarcocornia are {{perennial}} herbs, subshrubs or shrubs. They are taking an erect or prostrate, creeping form. The new stems are fleshy and divided into joint-like segments. Older stems are woody and not segmented. The oppositely arranged leaves are borne on fleshy, knobby petioles, their base decurrent and connate (thus forming the segments), the <b>blades</b> <b>forming</b> small, triangular tips with narrow scarious margin.|$|R
5000|$|Yari ("spear"): A spear, or spear-like polearm. Yari have various <b>blade</b> <b>forms,</b> from {{a simple}} double edged and flat blade, to a {{triangular}} cross section double edged blade, to those with a symmetric cross-piece (jumonji-yari) or those with an asymmetric cross piece. The main blade is symmetric and straight unlike a naginata, and usually smaller but can be as large or bigger than some naginata blades.|$|R
50|$|Yatagans {{consist of}} a single-edged blade with a marked forward curve and a hilt formed of two grip plaques {{attached}} through the tang, {{the end of the}} hilt being shaped like large ears. The gap between the grips is covered by a metal strap, which is often decorated. The blade varies from 60 to 80 cm in length and is curved forward (like the Iberian falcata, or Greek kopis), sometimes reclining backwards again towards the very end. This <b>blade</b> <b>form</b> {{is often referred to as}} being 'recurved.' While the back of the blade is made of softer steel, the sharp edge is made of hard, tempered steel for durability.|$|E
5000|$|The goal is {{to defeat}} all or {{specific}} Aragami in the designated area within the time limit depending on mission objectives. Additional rewards are gained depending on how efficiently the mission was completed. Players can dash, sprint, and jump by consuming stamina (ST) that auto-regenerates over time. Players' sole weapon is the God Arc (Jinki); a unique weapon that can instantly switch to four different forms: Blade, Gun, Shield and Predator. Attacking Aragami in Gun form consumes Oracle Points (OP). Oracle Points can be regained by successfully attacking in <b>Blade</b> <b>form,</b> however this also consumes stamina. Once an Aragami has been defeated, materials can be collected from its remains by switching to Predator form and devouring it. If a player loses all of their health points (HP), AI teammates can use [...] "Link Aid" [...] to revive team members by sacrificing some HP of their own. By devouring an Aragami that is still alive, God Eaters obtain an Aragami bullet that can be fired back and temporarily enter a state called [...] "Burst Mode" [...] in which their speed, strength and energy regeneration increase. In addition, New-Type God Eaters can send teammates into an artificial Burst Mode called [...] "Link Burst" [...] by sending Aragami bullets at their teammates. The Link Burst is capable of [...] "stacking" [...] up to three times by receiving multiple Aragami bullets in succession.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{form error}} of turbine blade {{impacts on the}} work {{performance}} of turbine directly. To inspect the <b>blade</b> <b>form</b> error, the cross section curve of turbine blade is constructed as NURBS by interpolating design points in the paper, then the mathematical model of form error of blade is developed by searching for four control points of the minimum distance between measure points and design curve, and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied for solving the minimum distance between measure points and design curve. Comparing with BFGS and DFP, the experiment results show the proposed method is effective in inspecting the <b>blade</b> <b>form</b> error...|$|E

The lower end is also slightly thinner {{than the rest}} of the frond because the first segments are shorter.

50|$|R. nepalensis {{does not}} closely {{resemble}} any other species. The {{small size of}} the spurs below the anthers are like those of R. alpina. The leaves have similarities to R. debilis in that the <b>blades</b> <b>form</b> rosettes and have narrow stem-like bases. The lateral staminodes of R. nepalensis are unusual in being more or less circular. The species is also unusual in only being known with white flowers.|$|R

40|$|There {{continues}} to be controversy regarding the typological affinities and temporal placement of bifurcate-stemmed dart points {{across much of the}} Great Basin. Morphological analysis of 688 projectile points from eight localities suggests that much of this variation conforms to two formal expressions, gracile artifacts equating to the Gatecliff Split-stem series in more northern areas and robust artifacts consistent with historical descriptions of the Pinto series in the southwestern Great Basin. Available chronological data place Pinto forms significantly earlier than their gracile counterparts. Empirical assessment of material profiles further implies that morphological variation among Pinto points can be explained in terms of toolstone availability and knapping qualities, which alter <b>blade</b> <b>form</b> more profoundly than stem/shoulder characteristics. This may have general implications for debates concerning artifact recycling trajectories, typological integrity, and the utility of dart points as time markers...|$|E
