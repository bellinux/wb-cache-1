As the name implies, geometry processing is meant to be analogous to signal processing and image processing. Many concepts, data structures and algorithms are directly analogous. For example, where image smoothing might convolve an intensity signal with a <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> formed using the Laplace operator, geometric smoothing might be achieved by convolving a surface geometry with a <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> formed using the Laplace-Beltrami operator.|$|E

In this paper, we present a spectral analysis of image gradients, {{which leads to a}} better configuration for identifying the <b>blurring</b> <b>kernel</b> of more general motion types (uniform velocity motion, accelerated motion and vibration). Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid Fourier-Radon transform to estimate the parameters of the <b>blurring</b> <b>kernel</b> with improved robustness to noise over available techniques.

50|$|By {{imposing}} a signal domain constraint of finite extent support and positivity over the finite region of support, the constrained iterative deconvolution solution can be guaranteed to converge.

50|$|For image processing, {{deconvolution}} is {{the process}} of approximately inverting the process that caused an image to be blurred. Specifically, unsharp masking is a simple linear image operation—a convolution by a kernel that is the Dirac delta minus a gaussian <b>blur</b> <b>kernel.</b> Deconvolution, on the other hand, is generally considered an ill-posed inverse problem that is best solved by nonlinear approaches. While unsharp masking increases the apparent sharpness of an image in ignorance of {{the manner in which the}} image was acquired, deconvolution increases the apparent sharpness of an image, but based on information describing some of the likely origins of the distortions of the light path used in capturing the image; it may therefore sometimes be preferred, where the cost in preparation time and per-image computation time are offset by the increase in image clarity.|$|E
30|$|Because the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> is {{not known}} exactly in the image {{formation}} process, it may have some errors: f=f̃+e, where f is the accurate <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> and f̃ is the inaccurate <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> containing an error e.

30|$|Motion {{deblurring}} is a {{frequently used}} approach for reducing this image degradation resulting from motion blur in image shooting. In many studies, approaches [1, 2] were developed that apply <b>blur</b> <b>kernels</b> that express motion blur in the input images; the blurred images are restored by deconvolving the images with the estimated <b>blur</b> <b>kernels.</b> These approaches include single-image deblurring methods [3 – 5] and multi-image deblurring methods [6 – 8]. In the former, the <b>blur</b> <b>kernels</b> are estimated {{from a single}} image using parametric models for maximum a-posteriori estimation and in the latter the ill-posed problems in deconvolution are reduced by estimating the <b>blur</b> <b>kernels</b> from multiple images. Several papers have reported motion deblurring methods that consider the camera’s egomotion while the shutter is open, which is estimated by using gyro sensors and accelerometers [9] or the camera’s geometric location [10]. However, most of these methods adopt a software-based approach for image restoration and do not consider the acquisition of blur-free input images. There are limitations {{to the extent to}} which images can be improved, in particular when significant changes in the target scene occur in the images captured while the camera shutter is open.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a blind {{deconvolution}} approach for reconstruction of Adaptive Optics (AO) high-resolution retinal images. The framework employs Random Forest to learn the mapping of retinal images onto the space of <b>blur</b> <b>kernels</b> expressed in terms of Zernike coefficients. A specially designed feature extraction technique allows inference of <b>blur</b> <b>kernels</b> for retinal images of various quality, taken at different locations of the retina. This model is validated on synthetically generated images as well as real AO high-resolution retinal images. The obtained results on the synthetic data showed an average root-mean-square error of 0. 0051 for the predicted <b>blur</b> <b>kernels</b> and 0. 0464 for the reconstructed images, compared to the ground truth (GT). The assessment of the reconstructed AO retinal images demonstrated that the contrast, sharpness and visual quality of the images have been significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|Sharpness is an {{important}} basic attribute of image quality. The spread of the <b>blurring</b> <b>kernel</b> is a good objective correlate of sharpness. Hence, by estimating {{the spread of the}} <b>blurring</b> <b>kernel</b> from a <b>blurred</b> image, lhe sharpness in the image can be predicted. Kayargadde and Martens (J 994) have presented an algorithm for estimating the spread of the <b>blurring</b> <b>kernel</b> from an image. In the algorithm, a global estimate is obtained by combining local estimates at prominent edge locations in the image. These local estimates at edges are arrived at by combining local derivatives.

We show that the estimates of sensory strength of blur obtained using the algorithm correlate well with the perceived unsharpness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Although {{multi-frame}} super resolution {{has been}} extensively studied in past decades, super resolving real-world video sequences still remains challenging. In existing systems, either the motion models are oversimplified, or important factors such as <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> and noise level {{are assumed to be}} known. Such models cannot capture the intrinsic characteristics that may differ from one sequence to another. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution via simultaneously estimating underlying motion, <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> and noise level while reconstructing the original high-res frames. As a result, our system not only produces very promising super resolution results outperforming the state of the art, but also adapts to a variety of noise levels and blur kernels. To further analyze the effect of noise and <b>blur</b> <b>kernel,</b> we perform a two-step analysis using the Cramer-Rao bounds. We study how <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> and noise influence motion estimation with aliasing signals, how noise affects super resolution with perfect motion, and finally how <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> and noise influence super resolution with unknown motion.

40|$|Blind image {{deblurring}}, i. e., deblurring without {{knowledge of}} the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel,</b> is a highly ill-posed problem. The problem can be solved in two parts: i) estimate a <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> from the blurry image, and ii) given estimated <b>blur</b> <b>kernel,</b> de-convolve blurry input to restore the target image. In this paper, by interpreting an image patch as a signal on a weighted graph, we first argue that a skeleton image [...] -a proxy that retains the strong gradients of the target but smooths out the details [...] -can be used to accurately estimate the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> and has a unique bi-modal edge weight distribution. We then design a reweighted graph total variation (RGTV) prior that can efficiently promote bi-modal edge weight distribution given a blurry patch. However, minimizing a blind image deblurring objective with RGTV results in a non-convex non-differentiable optimization problem. We propose a fast algorithm that solves for the skeleton image and the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> alternately. Finally with the computed <b>blur</b> <b>kernel,</b> recent non-blind image deblurring algorithms {{can be applied to}} restore the target image. Experimental results show that our algorithm can robustly estimate the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> with large kernel size, and the reconstructed sharp image is competitive against the state-of-the-art methods.

40|$|A new {{localized}} and computationally efficient {{approach is}} presented for shift/space-variant image restoration. Unlike conventional approaches, it models shift-variant blurring {{in a completely}} local form based on the recently proposed Rao Transform (RT). RT facilitates almost exact inversion of the blurring process locally and permits very fine-grain parallel implementation. The new approach naturally exploits the spatial locality of <b>blurring</b> <b>kernels</b> and smoothness of underlying focused images. It formulates the deblurring problem in terms of local parameters that are less correlated than raw image data. It is a fundamental advance that is general and not limited to any specific form of the <b>blurring</b> <b>kernel</b> such as a Gaussian.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{recovering}} a sharp version of a given blurry image when the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> is unknown. Previous methods often introduce an image-independent regularizer (such as Gaussian or sparse priors) on the desired <b>blur</b> <b>kernel.</b> We shall show that the blurry image itself encodes rich information about the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel.</b> Such information can be found through analyzing and comparing how the spectrum of an image as a convolution operator changes before and after blurring. Our analysis leads to an effective convex regularizer on the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> which depends only on the given blurry image. We show that the minimizer of this regularizer guarantees to give good approximation to the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> if the original image is sharp enough. By combining this powerful regularizer with conventional image deblurring techniques, we show how we could significantly improve the deblurring results through simulations and experiments on real images. In addition, our analysis and experiments help explaining a widely accepted doctrine; that is, the edges are good features for deblurring...|$|E
40|$|Super {{resolution}} (SR) algorithms typically {{assume that}} the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> is known (either the Point Spread Function ‘PSF ’ of the camera, or some default low-pass filter, e. g. a Gaussian). However, the performance of SR methods significantly deteriorates when the assumed <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> deviates from the true one. We propose a general framework for “blind ” super resolution. In particular, we show that: (i) Unlike the common belief, the PSF of the camera is the wrong <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> to use in SR algorithms. (ii) We show how the correct SR <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> can be recovered directly from the low-resolution image. This is done by exploiting the inherent recurrence property of small natural image patches (either internally within the same image, or externally {{in a collection of}} other natural images).

40|$|Single-image blind {{deblurring}} for imaging sensors in the Internet of Things (IoT) is {{a challenging}} ill-conditioned inverse problem, which requires regularization techniques {{to stabilize the}} image restoration process. The purpose is to recover the underlying <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> and latent sharp image from only one blurred image. Under many degraded imaging conditions, the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> could be considered not only spatially sparse, but also piecewise smooth {{with the support of}} a continuous curve. By taking advantage of the hybrid sparse properties of the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel,</b> a hybrid regularization method is proposed in this paper to robustly and accurately estimate the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> estimation method is enhanced by incorporating both the L 1 -norm of kernel intensity and the squared L 2 -norm of the intensity derivative. Once the accurate estimation of the <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> is obtained, the original blind deblurring can be simplified to the direct deconvolution of blurred images. To guarantee robust non-blind deconvolution, a variational image restoration model is presented based on the L 1 -norm data-fidelity term and the total generalized variation (TGV) regularizer of second-order. All non-smooth optimization problems related to <b>blur</b> <b>kernel</b> estimation and non-blind deconvolution are effectively handled by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) -based numerical methods.
