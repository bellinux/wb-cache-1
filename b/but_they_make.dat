5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere is the Rocky Mountains in {{southern}} Canada, Toklo's mom is bringing Toklo and his sickly brother to a river {{to teach them}} how to catch salmon. However, in insanity, Toklo's mom abandons Toklo after a mental break because his brother died. Now Toklo must survive on his own, just like Kallik. Wandering randomly, Toklo gets chased by human hunters and then meets a bear who is also getting chased by hunters. The bear gets injured, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> it to safety and requests that Toklo to retrieve certain herbs, which he does. The bear turns into a human and later introduces himself as Ujurak. It is revealed that Ujurak is a Shapeshifter, to Toklo's disbelief, before turning back into a bear. The two end up traveling together.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{polyester}} polyols {{are based}} on virgin raw materials and are manufactured by the direct polyesterification of high-purity diacids and glycols, such as adipic acid and 1,4-butanediol. Polyester polyols are usually more expensive and more viscous than polyether polyols, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> polyurethanes with better solvent, abrasion, and cut resistance. Other polyester polyols {{are based on}} reclaimed raw materials. They are manufactured by transesterification (glycolysis) of recycled poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) or dimethylterephthalate (DMT) distillation bottoms with glycols such as diethylene glycol. These low molecular weight, aromatic polyester polyols are used in rigid foam, and bring low cost and excellent flammability characteristics to polyisocyanurate (PIR) boardstock and polyurethane spray foam insulation.|$|E

500|$|A {{second problem}} is the {{difficulty}} of comparisons across cultures. [...] "Comparisons across countries are currently hampered by differences in activity classification and nomenclature." [...] In-depth surveys {{may be the only}} way to get necessary information desired, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> it difficult to perform cross-cultural comparisons. The lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work is an example. [...] "Despite increasing recognition that domestic labor is work, existing vocabularies do not easily convey the new appreciations. People still tend to talk about work and home as if they were separate spheres. 'Working mothers' are usually assumed to be in the paid labor force, despite feminist assertions that 'every mother is a working mother.' There are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles. Housewife, home manager, homemaker are all problematic and none of them conveys the sense of a women who juggles both domestic labor and paid employment." ...|$|E

[...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly described Save Rock and Roll as a stairway to a new era for the band, writing: [...] "There's not much psychological processing on Save Rock and Roll, but it does advance FOB's vision of an über-inclusive guitar-pop utopia." [...] Rolling Stones Simon Vozick-Levinson characterized the record as full of [...] "over-the-top ambitions", summarizing by saying: [...] "Does rock's future depend on this overheated nonsense? Of course not. But life is more fun with Fall Out Boy than without them."

2500|$|He {{is listed}} as Vice President at Algae Systems, a Nevada-based company with a working demo-scale pilot plant in Daphne, Alabama, {{dedicated}} to commercializing novel methods at the water-energy nexus for growing microalgae offshore as a second-generation biofuels feedstock and converting it to useful crude via hydrothermal liquefaction, while simultaneously treating wastewater, reducing carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, and producing biochar. At Startup Grind Jackson Hole on March 13, 2015, Barlow {{said that he was}} motivated to team up with Algae Systems after undergoing back surgery to address pain from an old ranching injury, while he had been an advisor to Herb Allison (president of Merrill Lynch at the time) and working to completely [...] "electronify" [...] financial transactions and speculative asset assembly (Barlow was named [...] "One of the 25 Most Influential People in Financial Services" [...] in the June 1999 issue of FutureBanker Magazine). The surgery successfully alleviated the pain and catalyzed Barlow to change his focus from building wealth to building infrastructure in order {{to do something about the}} “amount of alterations we are already enacting on Planet Earth... We are not necessarily making it warmer, but weirder.” At Startup Grind Jackson Hole, Barlow also explained how once over tea with “Grandmother of the Conservation Movement” Mardy Murie, he was inspired by her words, “Environmentalists can be a pain in the ass... <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> great ancestors.” Adopting this philosophy, Barlow says, “I want to be a good ancestor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} looking past {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> it believable." ...|$|E
