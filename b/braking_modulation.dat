50|$|Most new {{mountain}} bikes use disc brakes. They offer much improved stopping power (less lever pressure is required providing greater <b>braking</b> <b>modulation)</b> over rim brakes under all conditions especially adverse conditions, {{because they are}} located {{at the center of}} the wheel (on the wheel hub). They therefore remain drier and cleaner than wheel rims, which are more readily soiled or damaged. The disadvantage of disc brakes is their increased cost and often greater weight. Well set up V brakes or older cantilever set-ups, under normal road conditions can be equally, if not more effective in stopping power. Disc brakes do not allow heat to build up in the tires on long descents. Instead, heat builds up in the rotor, which can become extremely hot.|$|E
50|$|At 06:45 UTC, {{the plane}} touched down hard, {{approximately}} 1030 ft past {{the threshold of}} Runway 33, at a speed of approximately 200 kn, bounced once and then touched down again, approximately 2800 ft from the threshold. Maximum emergency braking was applied and retained, and the plane {{came to a stop}} 7600 ft from the threshold of that 10000 ft runway. Since the anti-skid and <b>brake</b> <b>modulation</b> systems were inoperative, the eight main wheels locked up; the tires abraded and fully deflated within 450 ft. Fourteen passengers and two crew members suffered minor injuries, while two passengers suffered serious injuries during the evacuation of the aircraft. The plane suffered structural damage to the main landing gear and the lower fuselage.|$|R
40|$|The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) uses IRIG-B {{transmitted}} over microwave as {{its primary}} system time dissemination. Problems with {{accuracy and reliability}} have led to ongoing research into better methods. BPA has also developed and deployed a unique fault locator which uses precise clocks synchronized by a pulse over microwaves. It automatically transmits the data to a central computer for analysis. A proposed system could combine fault location timing and time dissemination into a Global Position System (GPS) timing receiver and close the verification loop through a master station at the Dittmer Control Center. Such a system would have many advantages, including lower cost, higher reliability, and wider industry support. Test results indicate the GPS has sufficient accuracy and reliability for this and other current timing requirements including synchronous phase angle measurements. A phasor measurement system which provides phase angle has recently been tested with excellent results. Phase angle is a key parameter in power system control applications including dynamic <b>braking,</b> DC <b>modulation,</b> remedial action schemes, and system state estimation. Further research is required to determine the applications which can most effectively use real-time phase angle measurements and the best method to apply them...|$|R
40|$|Aerobraking {{concepts}} are being studied {{to improve performance}} and cost effectiveness of propulsion systems for Mars landers and Mars interplanetary spacecraft. Access to megawatt power levels (nuclear power coupled to high-storage inductive or capacitive devices) on a manned Mars interplanetary spacecraft may make feasible electromagnetic <b>braking</b> and lift <b>modulation</b> techniques which were previously impractical. Using pulsed microwave and magnetic field technology, potential plasmadynamic braking and hydromagnetic lift modulation techniques have been identified. Entry corridor modulation to reduce loads and heating, to reduce vertical descent rates, and to expand horizontal and lateral landing ranges are possible benefits. In-depth {{studies are needed to}} identify specific design concepts for feasibility assessments. Standing wave/plasma sheath interaction techniques appear to be promising. The techniques may require some tailoring of spacecraft external structures and materials. In addition, rapid response guidance and control systems may require the use of structurally embedded sensors coupled to expert systems or to artificial intelligence systems...|$|R
