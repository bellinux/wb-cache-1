50|$|The Boquer Valley (Vall de Boquer) is {{a scenic}} valley running 3 km {{north-east}} {{from the town}} of Port de Pollen√ßa, Majorca, to the sea at Cala Boquer. It is popular with bird-watchers for its migratory birds and resident <b>Blue</b> <b>Rock</b> <b>Thrushes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The little {{rainfall}} {{that occurs}} is usually torrential, {{so that the}} ground, consisting of marls and sandstone with little vegetation, is unable to retain moisture. Instead, the rain causes erosion, forming the characteristic landscape of badlands. Arroyos formed by torrential rain harbor the scarce vegetation and fauna such as swifts, hedgehogs, jackdaws, pin-tailed sandgrouses, <b>blue</b> <b>rock</b> <b>thrushes,</b> stone curlews, trumpeter finches, and crested larks.|$|R

50|$|The Amber Mountain <b>rock</b> <b>thrush</b> {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a separate species but this view is doubtful. It had been split from the forest <b>rock</b> <b>thrush</b> because {{of a variety of}} morphological differences and in spite of an absence of genetic distinctiveness. As the forest <b>rock</b> <b>thrush</b> and Benson's <b>rock</b> <b>thrush</b> have been lumped into Monticola sharpei this taxon has followed suit.|$|R

50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>rock</b> <b>thrush</b> is a starling-sized bird, 21 - 23 cm {{in length}} {{with a long}} slim bill. The {{breeding}} male of the nominate subspecies is unmistakable, with all blue-grey plumage apart from its darker wings. Females and immatures are much less striking, with dark brown upperparts, and paler brown scaly underparts. The male of the subspecies M. s. philippensis has rufous-chestnut plumage from the mid-breast down to the undertail. Both sexes lack the reddish outer tail feathers of rock thrush.|$|E
50|$|The brown rock chat {{is larger}} than the {{somewhat}} similar looking Indian robin and is about 17 cm long. It is uniformly rufous brown with the wings and tail of a slightly darker shade. The brown on the undersides grades into a dark grey-brown vent. In flight it resembles a female <b>blue</b> <b>rock</b> <b>thrush</b> and is usually found singly or in pairs on old buildings or rocky areas. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. When feeding on the ground it sometimes flicks open its wings and tail. It also has a habit of slowly raising its tail slightly, fanning it and bobbing its head. They feed mainly on insects, picked off the ground. They have been known to feed late and forage on insects attracted to artificial lighting.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{contained}} 113 {{images with}} birds {{as the central}} figures, including the title page which depicts a female <b>blue</b> <b>rock</b> <b>thrush</b> in a tree with a shepherd beneath it tending his flock. According to Eleanor MacClean, Librarian of the Blacker-Wood Library of Zoology and Ornithology at McGill University, which now holds the collection, the bird images contain [...] "possibly the oldest preserved bird skins in existence, which makes them of importance taxonomically as well as artistically." [...] The majority of the images show the birds in static profile poses. However some of them depict birds in flight or interacting with people or other birds. There is also a depiction of a woodpecker confronting a snake and another of a woodpecker sticking his tongue into a tree looking for insects. According to MacClean, these represent {{some of the earliest}} attempts to illustrate the behaviour of birds in addition to their appearance.|$|E
