Maximum surface speed is 183 m/s (600 fps) and maximum buffer gas pressure is 1389 kPa (200 psia). An operating range map was computed {{as a function of}} speed and pressure. Contradictory problems arise due to excessive friction preventing ring tracking at low-speed, high-pressure conditions and insufficent friction to retard inertia driven motions at high-speed, low-pressure conditions.

Development of two types of fluid-film seals for application to advanced LOX turbomachines are summarized. The first is a floating ring, helium <b>buffered</b> <b>seal</b> whose function is to exclude intrusion of liquid oxygen (LOX) into the turbine drive. The other is a spiral groove, LOX, face-type configuration designed to break down pressure and minimize leakage of LOX. The Rayleigh-step, floating ring gas seals require low clearances to minimize leakage and stiff films to assure tracking excursions of the rotor and to overcome Coulomb friction between the rings and housings. The design and test results of these <b>buffer</b> <b>seals</b> are described. Results indicate significant performance improvement over seals used on contemporary engines. The possibilities of reducing helium storage requirements and thus increasing payload appear promising. A unique configuration of spiral groove LOX seal was required to avoid detrimental vaporization in the flow path. It was found that fluid turbulence and inertia influence groove geometry and in particular groove depth must be much greater than spiral groove seals using conventional fluids...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{advanced}} seals for liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopumps were investigated. One was a spiral-groove face seal whose {{function is to}} seal high-pressure LOX at the impeller end of the turbopump. The other was a floating-ring, Rayleigh-step, helium <b>buffered</b> <b>seal</b> used to prevent LOX ingress to the turbine side of the unit. For each seal type, two sizes were investigated (50 and 20 mm). A turbine-driven test rig was designed and manufactured, and a test program was completed on the 50 mm floating-ring, Rayleigh-step, helium <b>buffered</b> <b>seal.</b> Significant results were: vaporization in the flow path could cause failure by overheating; therefore, the spiral-groove pumping portion of the seal that provides the fluid film must circulate fluid without disruption if vaporization occurs in the sealing dam. This is successfully accomplished by a pressure-balanced spiral-groove concept that is described. The spiral-groove configuration is affected by turbulence in the fluid film and pressure drops due to fluid inertia at sudden contractions. The net results of these effects are deep grooves, large operating films, and high power loss when compared against seals operating with laminar films. Turbulence and inertia are induced by the high-density and low-viscosity characteristics of LOX. The program clearly pointed out the need to consider system environmental factors such as thermal and centrifugal distortions and rotor vibrations in the seal design...|$|R

A variety of face configurations were considered, and the self-energized-hydrostatic and spiral-groove geometries were selected for detailed evaluation.

40|$|The present {{configuration}} of Helium <b>Buffer</b> <b>Seal</b> on the ATD oxygen pump {{consists of a}} pair of opposed carbon rings are forced axially against their containment housings. Leakage occurs through the clearance between the rings and the shaft. The total helium leakage through both sides is approximately 239 SCFM. A reduction in leakage to 50 SCFM will result in less helium storage and consequently permit a substantial increase in payload. Under Phase 1 NASA SBIR, a solid T-Ring seal was analyzed and designed that could satisfy the criteria of reducing leakage to 50 SCFM or less. The design makes maximum use of available length and employs a mid length row of hydrostatic orifaces that feed buffer helium directly into a 2 to 3 mil clearance region. The flow splits into opposite paths to buffer oxygen gas on one side and hydrogen gas on the turbine side. The seal employs opposed hydrostatic tapered land secondary seals that provide friction free support of the primary seal and allows the primary seal to follow rotor excursion and maintain concentric operating clearance. The predicted performance of the T-seal is excellent with operation at a safe film thickness of 2 to 2. 5 mils and leakage less than 50 SCFM...|$|E

Such clays must fulfill certain requirements (e. g. on swelling properties, hydraulic conductivity or plasticity) and must be stable for thousands of years. Better sealing behavior is obtained when the clay is compacted. Technology of the seal construction can vary according to its target dry density. Very high dry density is needed for <b>buffer</b> (<b>sealing</b> around entire canister with radioactive waste). Less strict requirements are on material backfilling the access galleries.

40|$|Program {{objectives}} were to determine three advanced configurations of helium <b>buffer</b> <b>seals</b> {{capable of providing}} improved performance in a space shuttle main engine (SSME), high-pressure liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump environment, and to provide NASA with the analytical tools to determine performance {{of a variety of}} seal configurations. The three seal designs included solid-ring fluid-film seals often referred to as floating ring seals, back-to-back fluid-film face seals, and a circumferential sectored seal that incorporated inherent clearance adjustment capabilities. Of the three seals designed, the sectored seal is favored because the self-adjusting clearance features accommodate the variations in clearance that will occur because of thermal and centrifugal distortions without compromising performance. Moreover, leakage can be contained well below the maximum target values; minimizing leakage is important on the SSME since helium is provided by an external tank. A reduction in tank size translates to an increase in payload that can be carried on board the shuttle.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 There {{has been}} a rapid growth in the {{application}} of noncontacting double seals with a gas buffer fluid to pump sealing. The advantages of such a sealing arrangement are: ?	There is no liquid buffer fluid to maintain or dispose of. ?	Gas buffer fluid causes a minimum of contamination to the process. ?	There are no emissions, so no monitoring may be required. ?	Friction power is only a fraction of that associated with liquid seals. ?	Because there is no contact, seal life can be several times that of a liquid/contacting seal. One of the limitations of a conventional double seal arrangement, be it gas or liquid, is that there must be either considerable axial length or considerable diametral space available. There are many pump applications that could benefit from a double gas <b>buffered</b> <b>sealing</b> system where space is severely limited. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a small size double gas sealing device. The double gas seal with coplanar coaxial Rayleigh pad faces has two gas sealing faces concentrically located on the same plane. Buffer gas is supplied to an annular groove between the two sealing faces. The outside gas seal leaks to process and the inside gas seal leaks to atmosphere. Both faces have Rayleigh step pad lifting surfaces as well as a sealing dam similar to a conventional gas seal. The process fluid is to the outside of the outer seal face so as to minimize process fluid contamination of the gas seal face. With the configuration described, the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be made into a small package that fits entirely into a seal gland, which itself has minimum dimensions. Thus this seal will fit to most conventional small bore ANSI pumps, and this makes it possible to apply double gas sealing technology to many existing process pumps. In this paper, the theory of the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces is described. Considerable design work was required to find useable shapes and balance moments on the seal so that the inside and outside sealing gaps stay open under variable process and gas supply pressures. Optimization of the Rayleigh step pad bearings was performed. A complete simulation model was developed. Deflection results and predicted performance (leakage) are presented. Extensive testing has been conducted, and the paper presents predicted and measured leakage as a function of process and gas pressure. Loss-of-gas testing has also been performed, and these results are presented. Several field tests have been initiated and these are described. Observation so far has been that the seal performs as expected, so the double gas seal with coplanar coaxial faces can be used to provide double gas sealing solutions for many pumps having limited available space...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHighly {{compacted}} bentonite-based {{materials are}} often considered as <b>buffer</b> or <b>sealing</b> materials for deep {{high-level radioactive waste}} repositories. In situ, the initial state of bentonite-based materials is only partially saturated, which has a very high suction that will promote water absorption from the host rock. In addition, a gradient of water saturation will be formed between the external part and {{the central part of}} the compacted bentonite blocks. In this paper, water retention tests, under both constant-volume and free-swelling conditions, were performed to investigate the suction behavior of a compacted bentonite/sand mixture. In order to investigate the sealing ability of the partially saturated bentonite/sand mixture, gas permeability tests were also carried out under the in situ confining stress. It was found that the confining conditions have a limited effect on the water retention capacity of the compacted bentonite/sand mixture at lower levels of relative humidity (RH), while this influence is significant at higher RH levels. The results of gas permeability tests show that gas permeability is very sensitive to the water content and the confining pressure. When the sample (stable at RH= 98 %) was subjected to a in situ confining pressure (7 – 8 MPa), the gas permeability was very low (1. 83 × 10 – 14 m/s) which indicates that gas tightness can be obtained even though the sample is not fully saturated...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} isolate {{spatially}} those factors responsible for forest degradation in Brunei Darussalam. While human activities {{are one of the}} deforestation forces, the degradation of forest far from development corridors may implicate extra-human factors in its explanation. In the absence of apparent sources of pollution, mean temperature rise is a good candidate factor as heat stress is capable of reducing photosynthesis, which can manifest itself in a drop in canopy density. Considering that leaves are the most active scattering kernels of electromagnetic waves within tree canopies, especially in the C-band (λ= 5. 3 cm), one can expect that the shuttle radar topography mission elevation data product (SRTM) developed for that band should exhibit a variable bias over forest depending on its density. This relationship, e. g., vegetation density versus elevation bias, is used to measure forest depletion. Based on data from a forest map, SRTM and a reference DTM we calculated a typical bias for seven forest types. A linear relationship was established between elevation bias and forest depletion level. The typical bias means zero depletion, and bias equal to zero means 100 % depletion. A map of forest depletion was developed using that relationship. By excluding pixels most likely to be affected by human activities (2. 5 km buffer around settlements and 0. 5 km <b>buffer</b> around <b>sealed</b> roads), depletion levels for all remaining pixels were categorized by forest type.

To obtain and average log zero time reading, all of the zero time contents were combined by averaging their base 10 logarithms. Log reduction was calculated as {{the difference between the}} samples and average zero time logarithms. Percent kill was calculated as 100 (1 - Log 10).|$|R
40|$|Introduction Vancomycin is {{commonly}} added to acrylic bone cement during revision arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing vancomycin are available but significantly more expensive. We investigated whether the antibiotic elution and mechanical strength of ‘home-made’ vancomycin containing bone cement was comparable to commercial vancomycin-impregnated cement. Methods A total of 18 cement discs of constant size, containing either proprietary CopalG+V®; or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G® with vancomycin added by hand, were made. Each disc contained the same antibiotic quantities (0. 5 g gentamycin, 2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate <b>buffer</b> in a <b>sealed</b> container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight time points over a two week period. The concentration of gentamicin and vancomycin in the fluid was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The impact strength of each PMMA cement preparation {{was measured using}} a Charpy-type impact tester. Results Highest peak antibiotic concentrations were observed from the ‘home-made’ vancomycin containing cement, added as in the operating theatre. Overall antibiotic elution was, five-fold (vancomycin) and two-fold (gentamicin), greater from the ‘home-made’ mix compared to commercially mixed cement. However the ‘home-made’ cements showed greater variation in elution kinetics compared to the commercial mix. Use of a vacuum during mixing had no significant effect on antibiotic elution {{in any of the}} samples. Impact strength testing showed {{no significant differences between the}} groups. Discussion Our findings suggest the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder to gentamicin-impregnated bone cement in theatre, significantly increases elution of both antibiotics, with no significant loss of strength, compared to commercially prepared cement. Conclusion We have found no significant advantages of expensive off-the-shelf vancomycin-impregnated bone cement and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand when making cement beads and spacers...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} indentation of bone cement spacers used in revision of infected joint arthroplasty with a MacDonald dissector increased the elution of antibiotic in vitro. A total of 24 cement discs containing either 0. 17 g (0. 88 % w/w), 0. 25 g (1. 41 % w/w), or 0. 33 g (1. 75 % w/w) gentamicin of constant size were made. Of these, 12 were indented with the dissector. Each disc was immersed in ammonium acetate <b>buffer</b> in a <b>sealed</b> container, and fluid from each container was sampled at zero, one, three, six, 24, 48 and 72 hours and at one, and two weeks. The concentration of gentamicin in the fluid was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The fluid sampled at 72 hours from the indented discs containing 0. 17 g gentamicin (0. 88 % w/w) contained {{a mean of}} 113 mcg/ml (90. 12 to 143. 5) compared with 44. 5 mcg/ml (44. 02 to 44. 90) in the fluid sampled from the plain discs (p = 0. 012). In discs containing 0. 33 g gentamicin (1. 75 % w/w), the concentration eluted from the indented discs at 72 hours was a mean of 316 mcg/ml (223 to 421) compared {{with a mean of}} 118 mcg/ml (100 to 140) from the plain discs (p < 0. 001). At two weeks, these significant differences persisted. At nine weeks the indented discs eluted a greater concentration for all gentamicin doses, but the difference was only significant for the discs containing 0. 17 g (0. 88 % w/w, p = 0. 006). However if the area under the curve is taken as a measure of the total antibiotic eluted, the indented discs eluted more gentamicin than the plain discs for the 0. 17 g (0. 88 % w/w, p = 0. 031), the 0. 25 g (1. 41 % w/w, p < 0. 001) and the 0. 33 g (1. 75 % w/w, p < 0. 001) discs. When preparing antibiotic spacers for use in staged revision arthroplasty surgery we recommend indenting the spacer with a MacDonald dissector to increase the elution of antibiotic...|$|R
40|$|Authors: Salix Boulet, Michel L. Ndongala and Nicole F. Bernard 1 Corresponding author ([nicole. bernard@mcgill. ca](nicole. bernard@mcgill. ca)). ### INTRODUCTION The {{enzyme-linked}} immunospot (ELISPOT) assay {{measures the}} secretion intensity of effector molecules released by immune cells {{in response to}} ex vivo antigenic stimulation, {{as well as the}} frequency of these responding cells. This assay is highly sensitive, quantitative, easy to use, and amenable to high-throughput screening. For these reasons, the ELISPOT assay is considered by many as a gold standard for monitoring cellular immune responses. Until recently, ELISPOT assays using chromophores to detect the T cell secretion of cytokines were limited to the characterization of a single effector molecule. Notably, studies evaluating the immune response to chronic viral infections often measured IFN-γ secretion by ELISPOT because of the known antiviral effects of this cytokine as well as its correlation to the cytotoxic capacity of T cells. However, maintenance of both IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion by pathogen-specific T cells has been linked to a more favorable clinical outcome in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Leishmania infections. Therefore, an ELISPOT assay able to simultaneously characterize T cell responses in terms of IL- 2 and IFN-γ secretion is potentially relevant for the monitoring of immune responses to certain infectious agents. In this protocol, we describe an ELISPOT assay for the simultaneous detection of IL- 2 and IFN-γ upon stimulation with viral peptides. ### RELATED INFORMATION Early uses of the ELISPOT assay for studies of immune cell secretion intensity and frequency are described in Currier et al. (2002) and Czerkinsky et al. (1988). The principles of the ELISPOT assay are reviewed in Letsch and Scheibenbogen (2003), and its use in high-throughput screening is described in Hernandez-Fuentes et al. (2003). The pathogen studies by Harari et al. (2005) illustrate the potential utility of simultaneous detection of IFN-γ and IL- 2 secretion for monitoring immune response. Darrah et al. (2007) demonstrate that immune responses secreting IFN-γ and IL- 2 and other cytokines play a protective role in a Leishmania major infection model. The assay presented in this protocol has also been described in Boulet et al. (2007). ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1.

Permeabilize the MultiScreen IP white-walled ELISPOT plate by aliquoting 50 μL of 90 % MeOH from a 50 -mL plastic trough to each well using a multichannel pipette. Wait ~ 45 sec or until all the wells in the plate appear slightly translucent. - Immediately wash the plate with 1 X PBS, adding 200 μL from a 50 -mL plastic trough to each well using the multichannel pipette. Repeat four times. - *The goal of washing with ~ 200 μL of fluid is to remove specific reagents after each step. As such, the volume used for the washes {{does not have to be}} precisely 200 μL*. - Add 100 μL of coating buffer (dual, IL- 2, and IFN-γ) to the appropriate wells. - Seal plate in plastic wrap and incubate overnight at 4 °C. ***Thawing Cells (30 min) *** 5. Remove frozen PBMCs from the liquid nitrogen tank and thaw in a 37 °C waterbath, shaking gently until the frozen aliquot is reduced to a small ice pellet. 6. Transfer cells into a 15 -mL PP tube using a plastic transfer pipette and add ~ 10 mL of warm (37 °C) wash medium drop by drop while gently mixing the contents of the tube. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 7 min. 7. Discard the supernatant by decanting, and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of warm (37 °C) wash medium. Centrifuge at 1500 rpm for 7 min. 8. Repeat Step 7, but remove a 30 -μL aliquot prior to centrifugation in order to count cells under the microscope. To count cells, dilute in Erythrosine B dye to check viability and use a hemacytometer. 9. After the last centrifugation, discard the supernatant and resuspend PBMCs at 2 × 10 e 6 cells/mL in warm (37 °C) R 10 medium. Aliquot a maximum 10 e 7 (or 5 mL) cells per 50 -mL PP conical tube and incubate overnight in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. **Day 2 : Blocking Plates, Cell Plating** ***Blocking Plates (90 min) *** 10. Retrieve coated plates from the refrigerator and remove coating buffers by washing plates three times with 1 X PBS, adding 200 μL of 1 X PBS to each well with a multichannel pipette. *See Troubleshooting*. 11. Add 200 μL of blocking buffer and incubate for at least 1 h at room temperature. 12. Wash plates five times with 200 μL/well of 1 X PBS. Leave 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS until ready to proceed to Step 13. ***Cell Plating (2 h) *** 13. Remove 1 X PBS from ELISPOT plate and add stimuli in RPMI medium 1640 to appropriate wells in a volume of 50 μL (or 100 μL for the medium control). During this step, do not allow wells to dry. Once done, place plate in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. Stimuli are usually plated in triplicates and may include the following: - i. Medium control: 100 μL R 10 medium with no stimulus added. No cells are added to these wells in Step 15. - *No spots should be detected in Step 28. This controls for medium quality*. - ii. Negative control: 50 μL R 10 medium with no stimulus added. - *Unstimulated cells should give no or few spots in Step 28 *. - iii. Positive control: Anti-CD 3 mAb at a final well concentration of 0. 3 μg/mL. - iv. CEF control: Most individuals respond to this pool of peptides isolated from cytomegalovirus (C), Epstein-Barr virus (E), and influenza virus (F). - v. Peptides from infectious agent: Optimal peptides (8 - to 11 -mers) or 15 -mers are usually recommended. Pools of peptides may be used. Final concentration of the individual peptides or each peptide within a pool should be ~ 4 μg/mL. 14. Retrieve cells from the incubator and pool into a single 50 ‐mL PP tube. Add warm (37 °C) wash medium to fill the tube and remove a 30 -μL aliquot to count PBMCs. 15. Centrifuge cells at 1500 rpm for 7 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in warm (37 °C) R 20 medium at 4 × 10 e 6 cells per mL. Retrieve plate from the incubator and add 50 μL of cells to appropriate wells. - *Do not add cells to the “medium control” wells (Step 13. i) *. 16. Incubate plate for 28 h in a humidified atmosphere incubator preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. **Day 3 : Detection (30 min) ** 17. Wash ELISPOT plate: - i. Three times with 1 X PBS, 200 μL per well. - ii. Three times with PBS-T buffer, 200 μL per well. 18. Add 100 μL per well of detection <b>buffer.</b> 19. <b>Seal</b> plate in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight at 4 °C. **Day 4 : Spot Color Development (3. 5 h) ** 20. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Three times with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well. Between each wash, empty wash fluid into a container. - ii. Three times with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well and the VPW. 21. Add 100 μL of developing buffer to all wells using a multichannel pipette and incubate at room temperature for at least 2 h. 22. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Twice with 200 μL per well of PBS-T buffer, pouring off the wash buffer between each wash step. - ii. Twice with PBS-T buffer using 200 μL per well and the VPW. - iii. Three times with 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS, using the VPW. - iv. Once with 200 μL per well of filtered H 2 O. 23. Add 100 μL per well of Vector Blue solution and incubate for ~ 5 min at room temperature. 24. Remove Vector Blue solution and wash the ELISPOT plates: - i. Three times with 200 μL per well of 1 X PBS, pouring off the wash buffer between each wash step. - ii. Three times with 200 μL of 1 X PBS, using the VPW. 25. Activate AEC buffer by adding 4. 8 μL of H 2 O 2 to 10 mL of AEC buffer and filter through a 0. 45 -μm filter. Add 100 μL per well of activated AEC buffer to each well and incubate up to 5 - 10 min. 26. Wash the ELISPOT plate: - i. Twice with 200 μL per well of filtered H 2 O, using the VPW. - ii. One minute under running tap H 2 O. Remove the bottom of the ELISPOT plate and wash both sides of the membrane. 27. Air-dry the plates. 28. Take a picture of the wells and count spots using the CTL-Immunospot Analyzer as described by the manufacturer. If a picture of the plates cannot be taken and counted on the same day, keep the plates away from light until it can be done. - *For counting spots, sensitivity and compensation are set|$|R
