5000|$|Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) is an eight-bit {{character}} encoding used {{mainly on}} IBM mainframe and IBM midrange computer operating systems. EBCDIC {{descended from the}} code used with punched cards and the corresponding six bit <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> <b>code</b> used with most of IBM's computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s. [...] It is also supported on various non-IBM platforms such as Fujitsu-Siemens' BS2000/OSD, OS-IV, MSP, and MSP-EX, the SDS Sigma series, and Unisys VS/9 and MCP.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, IBM {{introduced}} a new, smaller, round-hole, 96-column card format {{along with the}} IBM System/3 computer. These cards have tiny (1 mm), circular holes, smaller than those in paper tape. Data is stored in six-bit <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> <b>code,</b> with three rows of 32 characters each, or 8-bit EBCDIC. In this format, each column of the top tiers are combined with two punch rows from the bottom tier to form an 8-bit byte, and the middle tier is combined with two more punch rows, so that each card contains 64 bytes of 8-bit-per-byte binary coded data.|$|E

50|$|IBM {{used the}} terms <b>Binary-Coded</b> <b>Decimal</b> Interchange <b>Code</b> (BCDIC, {{sometimes}} just called BCD), for 6-bit alphanumeric codes that represented numbers, upper-case letters and special characters. Some variation of BCDIC alphamerics {{is used in}} most early IBM computers, including the IBM 1620, IBM 1400 series, and non-Decimal Architecture members of the IBM 700/7000 series.|$|R
50|$|Excess-3 or 3-excess {{binary code}} (often {{abbreviated}} as XS-3, 3XS or X3) or Stibitz code (after George Stibitz, who built a relay-based adding machine in 1937) is a self-complementary <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> (BCD) <b>code</b> and numeral system. It is a biased representation. Excess-3 code was used on some older computers {{as well as}} in cash registers and hand-held portable electronic calculators of the 1970s, among other uses.|$|R
50|$|It {{featured}} a new punched card format that was smaller and stored 96 characters. Instead of the rectangular punches {{in the classic}} IBM card, the new cards had tiny (1 mm), circular holes much like paper tape. Data was stored in six-bit <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> <b>code,</b> with three rows of 32 characters each, or 8-bit EBCDIC, with the two extra holes located in the top rows.Cards had room for 128 printed characters in four rows of 32 characters each. The new cards were about 1/3 {{the size of the}} original 80 column cards but held 20% more text data (96 characters). The smaller, and thus lighter card could be processed with faster equipment and with fewer jams.|$|E
500|$|A <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> time <b>code</b> began {{testing in}} 1960, and became {{permanent}} in 1961. This [...] "NASA time code" [...] was modulated onto a 1000Hz audio tone at 100Hz, sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated [...] "baaga-bong". The code was also described as {{sounding like a}} [...] "buzz-saw". On July 1, 1971, the time code's broadcast was changed to the present 100Hz subcarrier, which is inaudible when using a normal radio (but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a chart recorder).|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{representation}} of a positive integer is a string of bits, using the binary numeral system. The order of the memory bytes storing the bits varies; see endianness. The width or precision of an integral type {{is the number of}} bits in its representation. An integral type with n bits can encode 2n numbers; for example an unsigned type typically represents the non-negative values 0 through 2nâˆ’1. Other encodings of integer values to bit patterns are sometimes used, for example <b>Binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> or Gray <b>code,</b> or as printed character codes such as ASCII.|$|R
5000|$|EBCDIC [...] was devised in 1963 and 1964 by IBM and was {{announced}} {{with the release}} of the IBM System/360 line of mainframe computers. It is an eight-bit character encoding, developed separately from the 7-bit ASCII encoding scheme. It was created to extend the existing <b>Binary-Coded</b> <b>Decimal</b> (BCD) Interchange <b>Code,</b> or BCDIC, which itself was devised as an efficient means of encoding the two zone and number punches on punched cards into 6 bits. The distinct encoding of 's' and 'S' (using position 2 instead of 1) was maintained from punched cards where it was desirable to not have hole punches too close to each other to ensure the integrity of the physical card.|$|R
50|$|The <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> scheme {{described}} in this article is the most common encoding, but there are many others. The method here can be referred to as Simple <b>Binary-Coded</b> <b>Decimal</b> (SBCD) or BCD 8421.|$|R
50|$|A {{time code}} {{was added to}} WWVB on July 1, 1965. This made it {{possible}} for clocks to be designed that could receive the signal, decode it, and then automatically synchronize themselves. The time code format has changed only slightly since 1965; it sends a <b>decimal</b> time <b>code,</b> using four binary bits to send each digit in <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> (BCD).|$|R
5000|$|Many {{non-integral}} values, such as decimal 0.2, have {{an infinite}} place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) {{but have a}} finite place-value in <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on <b>binary-coded</b> <b>decimal</b> representations of decimal fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values.|$|R
