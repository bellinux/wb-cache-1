60|$|My premonitions as to lovers proved correct. Glenby {{was soon}} infested with them. Heaven knows where {{they all came}} from. I had not {{supposed}} there was a quarter as many young men in the whole county; but there they were. Sara was in the seventh heaven of delight. Was not Betty at last a belle? As for the proposals...well, Betty never counted her scalps in public; <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while a visiting youth dropped out and was seen no more at Glenby.

In fact, little Mr. Squirrel didn't feel safe on the ground a minute, and so he kept to the trees as much as possible. Of course, when the {{branches}} of one tree reached to the branches of another tree, it was an easy matter to travel through the tree-tops, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while there would be open places to cross, and many a fright did timid little Mr. Squirrel have as he scampered across these open places.

60|$|The reading {{took place}} in the library. Through the open window Honora {{perceived}} the form of Joshua asleep in the hammock, his Sunday coat all twisted under him. It worried her to picture his attire when he should wake up. Once Mrs. Robert looked in, smiled, said nothing, and went out again. At length, in a wicker chair under a distant tree on the lawn, Honora beheld the dejected outline of the Vicomte. He was trying to read, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while would lay down his book and gaze protractedly at the house, stroking his mustache. The low song of the bees around the shrubbery vied with Mr. Holt's slow reading. On the whole, the situation delighted Honora, who bit her lip to refrain from smiling at M. de Toqueville. When at last she emerged from the library, he rose precipitately and came towards her across the lawn, lifting his hands towards the pitiless puritan skies.|$|E

But he stood there, straight as a ramrod, and never moved a eye-winker. She said his face was somepin awful: just as solemn and still! He never spoke after that one word 'Salvation,' <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while he snorted. Nobody seen him come in, or ever seen him before till he first snorted, and then they didn't see anybody else. The preacher, he preached along, and tried to act like as if nowthun' had happened, but it was no use; nobody didn't hardly pay no attention to him 'ceptun' the stranger himself; he never took his eyes off Elder Grove; some thought he was tryun' to charm him, like a snake does a bird; but it didn't faze the elder." ...|$|E

I'm really proud of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{generally}} well received.

5000|$|A one-star review {{came from}} Roger Ebert who wrote, [...] "Here it is, the goofiest {{movie of the}} year, a movie so bad in so many {{different}} and endearing ways that I’m damned if I don’t feel genuine affection for it. We all know it’s bad manners to talk during a movie, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a while a film comes along that positively requires the audience to shout helpful suggestions and lewd one-liners at the screen. “Heartbreak Hotel” is such a movie.
