50|$|Over {{the next}} three decades, 1895-1925, as food canning was {{approaching}} <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> industry, botulism was becoming a public health hazard. Karl Friedrich Meyer, a prodigiously productive Swiss-American veterinary scientist created a center at the Hooper Foundation in San Francisco, where he developed techniques for growing the organism and extracting the toxin, and conversely, for preventing organism growth and toxin production, and inactivating the toxin by heating. The California canning industry was thereby preserved.|$|R
25|$|Xigris was {{designed}} to fight sepsis, a condition that kills more than 200,000 Americans annually. It was the only approved drug for sepsis, and it costs $8,000 to treat a single patient.

50|$|The recent {{interest}} in the organic industry has sparked the interest of many businesses from small local distributors to large companies that distribute many products nationally. The organic market is now <b>a</b> 14 <b>billion</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> industry, that continues to grow especially from large corporations such as Wal-Mart that are now offering organic choices to their customers. Other companies that offer organic options include General Mills and Kraft.

When larger companies buy smaller companies it is called stealth ownership.|$|R

It will make available two <b>billion</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> for five years for the financing of renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies projects in the latter stages of development. The government has indicated that the fund is expected to be financially self-sufficient producing a positive return on investment comparable to the long term bond rate.|$|E
25|$|Also {{significant}} was the 1968 {{declaration of}} the Brezhnev Doctrine which officially asserted the Soviet Union's right to intervene in other nation's internal affairs {{in order to secure}} socialism from opposing capitalist forces. This doctrine was used to justify the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In Afghanistan the Soviet forces met a fierce resistance from the Afghans who were supported by the CIA. Battling an opposition that relied on guerrilla tactics and asymmetric warfare, the massive Soviet war machine proved incapable of achieving decisive victories and the entire campaign quickly devolved into a quagmire not unlike that which the U.S. faced a decade earlier in the Vietnam War. After ten years of fighting at the cost of approximately 20 <b>billion</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> (in 1986 United States dollars) and 15,000 Soviet casualties, Gorbachev surrendered to public opinion and ordered troops to withdraw in early 1989.|$|E
2500|$|They play {{important}} roles in the food chain and are an important food source for larger animals ranging from fish to whales.

Commercial shrimp species support an industry worth 50 <b>billion</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> and in 2010 the total commercial production of shrimp was nearly 7 million tonnes. Shrimp farming became more prevalent during the 1980s, particularly in China, and by 2007 the harvest from shrimp farms exceeded the capture of wild shrimp. There are significant issues with excessive bycatch when shrimp are captured in the wild, and with pollution damage done to estuaries when {{they are used to}} support shrimp farming.

40|$|No body {{event in}} a girl’s (or a woman’s) {{life is more}} ambivalently coded than menstruation. Tied to both the filth of bodily waste and the {{possibility}} of motherhood, menstruation has powerful social connotations that lead to its virtual erasure from “polite” discourse. When menstruation or menarche is acknowledged openly, it is usually done for one reason: containment. The two <b>billion</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> feminine hygiene industry offers items for sale that “protect,” but the actual mechanics of menstruation are never addressed in the industry’s advertising, saving vulnerable men and children from the knowledge of what, exactly, menstrual products do. Why do we need so much protection from menstruation, and who, exactly, is being protected? Where does the danger lie? This paper addresses the ways girls are taught to contain the potential dangers of menstruation and argues that hiding the realities of menstruation forms part of girls’ larger project of learning to shape their bodies into the “contained” or “classical” body of normative femininity...|$|R
