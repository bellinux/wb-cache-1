40|$|Glycine betaine (betaine) {{acts as a}} methyl group donor in transmethylation {{reactions}} in organisms. Betaine occurs in numerous vertebrate tissues as an osmolyte, ensuring osmoprotection. Betaine is safe for piglets at the maximum supplementation rate of 2 000 mg/kg complete feed with a margin of safety below 5. This conclusion is extended to all pigs and extrapolated to all animal species and categories. The use of betaine anhydrous and <b>betaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> as feed additives up to a supplementation rate of 2 000 mg betaine/kg complete feed is unlikely to pose concerns for consumer safety. In the absence of data, betaine anhydrous and <b>betaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> should be considered hazardous by inhalation, as irritant to skin, eyes and mucous membranes, and skin sensitisers. The supplementation of feed with betaine anhydrous and <b>betaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> does not pose a risk to the environment. Betaine {{has the potential to}} become efficacious in all animal species and categories when administered via feed or water for drinking. Betaine anhydrous and <b>betaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> are considered as nutritionally equivalent sources of betaine. The FEEDAP Panel made some recommendations on (i) introduction of a maximum content for supplemental betaine in complete feed and water for drinking; (ii) avoidance of simultaneous use of betaine in feed and water for drinking; (iii) avoidance of simultaneous inclusion of betaine and choline chloride in premixtures; and (iv) protection of users when handling the additives...|$|E

40|$|Osmolytes {{are small}} solutes that {{regulate}} turgor pressure within cells that undergo various extreme stressors from high salt or urea concentration, drastic pressures, high temperatures, among other parameters. Since their {{mechanism of action}} is not well understood, the emphasis in most scientific investigations is to study their effect on the structure, function, and stability of proteins and enzymes. In my research work described in this presentation I have studied the effect of different concentrations of osmolytes such as urea, guanidine <b>hydrochloride,</b> <b>betaine,</b> trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) on the enzymatic properties of a serine protease, bovine chymotrypsin. Serine proteases are proteolytic enzymes that have crucial role in bodily functions by performing specific peptide bond hydrolyses in proteins and peptides. Bovine chymotrypsin shows specificity towards large hydrophobic amino acid side chains such as Leu, Phe, Tyr, and Trp but also hydrolyzes peptide bonds contributed by Arg. In my research investigations I used substrates bearing Leu, Phe, and Arg at the reactive site peptide bond. The results of this investigation will be presented in terms of effects of osmolytes on the enzymatic hydrolysis of different substrates by bovine chymotrypsin...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{performances}} of several natural organic inhibitors were investigated in a sol-gel system (applied on the magnesium alloy Mg AZ 31 B substrate). The inhibitors were quinaldic acid (QDA), <b>betaine</b> (BET), dopamine <b>hydrochloride</b> (DOP), and diazolidinyl urea (DZU). Thin, uniform, and defect-free sol-gel coatings were prepared with and without organic inhibitors, and applied on the Mg AZ 31 B substrate. SEM and EDX were performed to analyze the coating surface properties, the adhesion to the substrate, and the thickness. Electrochemical measurements, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and anodic potentiodynamic polarization scan (PDS), were performed on the coated samples to characterize the coatings’ protective properties. Also, hydrogen evolution measurement—an easy method to measure magnesium corrosion—was performed in order to characterize the efficiency of coating protection on the magnesium substrate. Moreover, scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) measurements were performed to examine {{the efficiency of the}} coatings loaded with inhibitors in preventing and containing corrosion events in defect areas. From the testing results it was observed that the formulated sol-gel coatings provided a good barrier to the substrate, affording some protection even without the presence of inhibitors. Finally, when the inhibitors’ performances were compared, the QDA-doped sol-gel was able to contain the corrosion event at the defect...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study aims to {{demonstrate}} that depolymerization of cellulose can be closely controlled in a reaction media made of <b>betaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (BHC) and [TBMA] Cl opening the route to low molecular weight cello-oligomers that exhibit a high potential for marketing {{in the production of}} surfactants and thickener agents. The main advantages of this process rely on (1) the sustainability of BHC, (2) convenient isolation of cello-oligomers, and (3) recyclability of BHC and [TBMA]Cl. On the other hand, we demonstrate that this work can be also considered as an efficient pretreatment process of cellulose. Indeed, whereas in water cellulose is recalcitrant to hydrolysis, we show here that recovered cello-oligomers can be subsequently readily converted in water to glucose...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlycine <b>betaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (BHC), a safe acid industrially {{produced}} from the largely available glycine betaine {{isolated from the}} manufacture of sugar from beet, was used in combination with water to produce sustainable reaction media capable of selectively converting agricultural wastes to furfural and levulinic acid. At {{the end of the}} process, BHC can be conveniently recovered and recycled. Under optimized conditions, furfural was produced with 65 % and 73 % yield from wheat straw and xylan originated from beechwood, respectively. More importantly, by closely controlling the reaction temperature, it was possible to selectively drive the reaction either to xylose, furfural or levulinic acid. This process based on the use of biodegradable and safe BHC opens a sustainable route for the production of valuable fine chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass...|$|E
40|$|The first betaine {{chloride}} tetrachloroidoferrate(III)  double salt, (Hbet) 2 Cl[FeCl 4] = (Hbet) Cl·(Hbet) [FeCl 4], {{was obtained}} from a solution of <b>betaine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (HbetCl) and FeCl 3 ∙ 6 H 2 O in water. The crystal structure (orthorhombic, Pbcm, a = 6. 2717 (13), b = 12. 841 (3), c = 25. 693 (5) Å, Z = 4) is characterized by layers of tetrachloridoferrate(III) anions separated by chloride-bridged, H-bond mediated cationic (Hbet) dimers. The hydrogen bonding network in the crystal structure follows the Pearson HSAB (hard acid-soft base) concept: According to the Pearson concept, the chloride anions show high affinity to the carboxyl group (hard acid and base), and the tetrachloroidoferrate(III) anion preferentially interacts with the activated methyl donors (soft acid and base). These interactions between the COOH group, as hard H-bond donor, and chloride as hard acceptor besides those between the soft, activated methyl groups and the soft tetrachloridoferrate(III) anions are the major structure-directing forces in the crystal structure of (Hbet) 2 Cl[FeCl 4]...|$|E
40|$|Food {{supplements}} are foods, {{the purpose}} {{of which is to}} supplement the normal diet and which consist of concentrated nutrient sources (vitamins and minerals) or othe r substances with a nutritional or physiological effect, alone or in combination. ( [...] ) In Spain, food supplements are regulated by Royal Decree 1487 / 2009, which transposed Directive 2002 / 46 /EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements into Spanish law. However, only the use of vitamins and minerals is currently regulated. Therefore the Scientific Committee has been asked to make an assessment of the proposal to authorise certain substances other than vitamins and minerals in the manufacture of food supplements. The six substances proposed by the Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs, Food Safety and Nutrition(AECOSAN) are <b>betaine,</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> phytosterols, lactase, melatonin, methylsulphonylmethane and polyphenols from olive oil, olive leaves and olives. The Scientific Committee has assessed each proposal, analysing the characteristics and sources of each substance, and the nutrition, metabolism and safety and has concluded, in each case, whether that submitted by the AECOSAN is acceptable from a safety viewpoint for use as a food supplement. In no event is the assessment intended as a guarantee of the biological efficiency of the substances and the estimated doses. The Scientific Committee states that, in any case individuals undergoing medical treatment consult with the doctor the opportunity or suitability of consuming food supplements, given the possibility of interactions in certain cases. In addition, in the case of food supplements with an antioxidant effect, {{it should be noted that}} in certain conditions and at high doses, these compounds may behave as pro-oxidants...|$|E
