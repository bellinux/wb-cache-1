40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the long term}} durability predictions of nuclear waste repositories, acceleration methods enhancing calcium leaching process from cementitious materials are needed, even though mechanisms not necessarily comparable to those predominant in a natural leaching process may be developed. In the previously published acceleration methods the samples are very small, which limits further physical or mechanical tests. In this paper, a new acceleration method based on electro-chemical migration is presented. The method although not driven with the same kinetics as in natural leaching, was designed {{in such a way}} that unnecessarily destructive by-effects could be minimized while promoting a higher leaching rate for a sample size suitable for further testing the mechanical and physical properties. It is shown that approximately 1 x 10 ^ 6 C of electrical charge per paste specimen of size Ø 50 x 75 mm (approximately 230 g) is required to leach out the total amount of Portlandite. The chemical and mineralogical properties of leached samples are characterized by various techniques. It is concluded that aged samples are comparable to those leached in a natural leaching process as both are characterized by a layered system comprising an unaltered core delineated <b>by</b> <b>total</b> <b>dissolution</b> of Portlandite followed by a progressive decalcification of the calcium silicate hydrate gel...|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} {{degradation}} on {{the properties of}} cementitious materials {{has been reported in}} several studies in the literature (Adenot and Buil 1992; Carde et al. 1997; Carde and François 1997; Carde et al. 1996; Faucon et al. 1996, 1998; Haga et al. 2005; Maltais et al. 2004). In these studies leaching of calcium from cementitious materials have been accomplished both through immersion of the solid cementitious specimens in water (Faucon et al. 1996; Haga et al. 2005; Mainguy et al. 2000) and through immersion of the specimens in chemical agents in order to accelerate the leaching process (Adenot and Buil 1992; Carde and François 1997; Faucon et al. 1996, 1998; Haga et al. 2005; Heukamp et al. 2001; Mainguy et al. 2000; Maltais et al. 2004; Revertegat et al. 1992; Ryu et al. 2002; Saito et al. 1992; Wittmann 1997).

Moreover, it is concluded that depletion in calcium changes the bulk density and the pore structure of the hydrated cement paste (Haga et al. 2005; Mainguy et al. 2000) and the changes in pore volume also alters the mechanical properties of the cementitious materials (Carde and François 1997; Heukamp et al. 2001; Saito and Deguchi 2000).|$|E

This paper reports the validation of the Soxhlet extraction technique by comparison with total dissolution with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The work was carried out for two of the three particle size ranges obtained by grinding the PET flake (300 - 425 and 425 - 700 &# 0956;m) and for the unground flake. Further validation was undertaken by comparison of contaminant levels determined <b>by</b> <b>total</b> <b>dissolution</b> with TFA and sonication with dichloromethane (DCM) using flake ground to the 0 - 300 &# 0956;m size range. The levels of contaminants increased with decreasing particle size range, but X-ray diffraction measurements of degrees of crystallinity were similar for each PET particle size range, thus showing that the differences in contaminant levels were not due to variable percentages of the amorphous material from the tops and bottoms of shredded bottles, relative to the amounts of crystalline PET from the mid-sections of the bottles. Hence, it was postulated that the variations in contaminant levels were due to selective grinding of the more highly contaminated surfaces, whilst the larger particles incorporated the less contaminated interior material. The grinding was also strongly selective with respect to the amorphous flake. Analysis of the segregated amorphous and crystalline flake phases indicated that many contaminants were similarly absorbed into both phases, whilst some were preferred by the amorphous PET and others were preferred by the crystalline PET...|$|E

This introductory paper describes the objectives of DUNE and the implementation plan of a series of mesocosm experiments conducted in the Mediterranean Sea in 2008 and 2010 during which either wet or dry and a succession of two wet deposition fluxes of 10 g m - 2 of Saharan dust have been simulated based on the production of dust analogs from erodible soils of a source region. After the presentation of the main biogeochemical initial conditions of the site at the time of each experiment, a general overview of the papers published in this special issue is presented.

The dissolved trace metals with crustal origin - Mn, Al and Fe - showed different behaviors as a function of time after the seeding. The increase in dissolved Mn and Al concentrations was attributed to dissolution processes. The observed decrease in dissolved Fe was due to scavenging on sinking dust particles and aggregates. When a second dust seeding followed, a dissolution of Fe from the dust particles was then observed due to the excess Fe binding ligand concentrations present at that time. Calcium nitrate and sulfate were formed in the dust analog for wet deposition following evapocondensation with acids for simulating cloud processing by polluted air masses under anthropogenic influence.

DUNE experiments have clearly shown the potential for Saharan wet deposition to modify the in situ concentrations of dissolved elements of biogeochemical interest such as Fe and also P and N. Indeed, wet deposition yielded a transient increase in dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) followed by a very rapid return to initial conditions or no return to initial conditions when a second dust seeding followed. By transiently increasing DIP and DIN concentrations in P- and N-starved surface waters of the Mediterranean Sea, wet deposition of Saharan dust can likely relieve the potential P and/or N limitation of biological activity; this has been directly quantified in terms of biological response.

40|$|The {{study of}} trace metal {{speciation}} {{has benefited from}} {{a great deal of}} interest leading to the development and the diversification of sequential extraction schemes (SES), which triggered the need for harmonization by the standard, measurements and testing programme (SM & T). However, some uncertainties still persist in the application of the harmonized 3 -step protocol, because of the difficulty in conceptualizing a technique that can be applied to environmental samples irrespective of their nature. The alternative method proposed in this study is based on the solubility of the sample components progressively dissolved during the course of an acidimetric titration by 1 mol L 1 HCl. The major HCl-reactive mineralogical components are identified using mass balance calculation of H+ consumed by their dissolution together with the amount of major elements released into solution. The speciation of minor and trace elements is investigated by comparing their titrations to those of the major elements. This approach is much simpler than SES because it uses simple non-selective H+ at room temperature instead of a complex experimental design of so-called specific reagents. The different mineral components of the solid are no longer operationally defined and the problem of selectivity is irrelevant to the titration approach. The method was applied to several sediment samples from the Scheldt estuary and the particulate phase was further examined by Scanning Electron Microprobe and X-ray Diffraction techniques. The nearly complete consumption of H+ in the suspension is balanced <b>by</b> the <b>total</b> <b>dissolution</b> of carbonates and Fe-oxyhydroxides. In contrast to the speciation inferred from the Tessier SES, the acidimetric titration has demonstrated that the carbonate phase does not significantly contain trace metals with the exceptions of 40 % of the Mn and 30 % of the Co. In contrast, the Fe-oxyhydroxides seem {{to play a major role}} and account for 70 % of Pb and 20 % of Cr, in addition to 60 % of P and additional amounts of 20 % Co and 40 % Mn. 70 % of the Cu also occur in the oxyhydroxide phase, more likely coprecipitated with gibbsite. 90 % of the Cd and 85 % of Zn can be attributed to the Acid Volatile Sulfide (AVS) phase as evidenced from S titration. The acidimetric titration method not only provides information on the speciation of trace metals but also allows the quantification of their reactivity and mobility, if one considers that the titration roughly mimics pH changes that may occur as a result of chemical disequilibrium in the environment. The results demonstrate the potential of the acidimetric titration as an alternative to SES protocols in geochemical and environmental regulation studies. This method is applicable to a wide variety of environmental materials with little or minor adjustments. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Previously unknown {{splitting}} phenomena {{were detected}} in the martensitic transformation of XCrl 3 and XCrMoV 14 stainless steels using high resolution dilatometric analysis. These splittings, which are denominatedM S 0 in this article, indicate the martensitic subtransformation of areas of austenite rich in carbon and carbide-forming elements. In contrast to other types of splitting known until now, theM S 0 occur {{in the absence of}} carbide precipitation during cooling. From the experimental results obtained in this study, it can be concluded that the splittings resulted from concentration gradients produced in the austenite {{as a consequence of the}} partial or <b>total</b> <b>dissolution</b> of M 23 C 6 carbides during heating.

50|$|In many Latin American countries, {{liberalism}} and radicalism {{have been associated}} with generally left-of-center political movements such as Colombia's Liberal Party, historically concerned mostly with effecting government decentralization and regional autonomy (liberals were influential in the <b>total</b> <b>dissolution</b> of at least two defunct countries, the United Provinces of Central America and Gran Colombia) and separation of church and state. At times, the anti-clerical and secularist stances promoted by Latin American liberals have resulted in limitations on the civil rights of clergy or others associated with the Church (as in Mexico, where law still prohibits priests from public office). Liberalism in North America has a different background.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of axial view ICP OES and ICP-MS techniques were compared through {{the determination of}} As, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sb and Sn in electrolytic copper. Samples were prepared by two procedures: 1. <b>Total</b> <b>dissolution</b> with 5 % v/v HNO 3 and 2. Dissolution with 1. 4 % v/v HNO 3 plus 2. 0 % v/v H 2 SO 4, followed by separation of the Cu by electrodeposition. The methods were applied {{for the analysis of}} standard copper solutions, using calibration against aqueous solutions with or without the addition of Cu. The results obtained by the two techniques were similar, but the separation of Cu from the sample matrix proved to be more adequate for practical reasons...|$|R
40|$|The area studied {{follows the}} sharp geomorphological {{boundary}} at which an abrupt change occurs from a Mediterranean to a cold continental climate. The dominant soils are brown soils developed on limestone and melanosols developed on dolomite. Twenty five elements were analysed {{in the fine}} soil sample fraction (– 63 m) <b>by</b> ICP-AES after <b>total</b> <b>dissolution</b> {{in a mixture of}} concentrated acids (HF, HCl, HNO 3, HClO 4). The topsoil geochemical data sets of both western Croatia and the national park were processed through R-mode factor analysis to determine the patterns of geochemical association among elements and to detect and identify possible anomalies of elements that could be associated with airborne contamination. A four-factor model accounted for 75 % of the total variance. The association of Pb, Zn, Cd, As and P was interpreted as associated with airborne contamination and acid rain deposition. The factor score map of the Pb-Zn-Cd-As-P association shows high positive scores located along the climate boundary that passes through Risnjak National Park and further to the southeast over Mt Velebit. Along this regional climate barrier, the deposition of airborne contaminants carried by westerly winds from both regional (NE Italy) and local (Rijeka, oil refineries and oil- and coal-fired power plants) sources evidently occurred. With the aid of factor analysis it was possible clearly to identify areas influenced <b>by</b> airborne pollution. <b>Total</b> lead concentrations detected at altitudes higher than 1050 m above sea level in the national park were higher than 80 ppm (maximum 139 ppm Pb) while the regional mean Pb concentration is 43 ppm. Also a stoichiometric approach was applied to compensate for the influence of the amount of the clay fraction by modeling soil geochemical baselines {{on the basis of the}} calculation of the Pb enrichment factor (EF). As a basis for these calculations, reference soils with the presumed least anthropogenic influence from the island of Mljet (78 samples) were used. In the area of Risnjak National Park approximately 20 % of the samples have an Pb EF higher than 2, which can be considered polluted, while the whole region of Western Croatia (not including Istria) has less than 3 % of Pb enriched samples. All the samples from the area of Mt Velebit contain Pb within the baseline range (EF 2), što se može smatrati kao zagađenje, dok čitavo područje zapadne Hrvatske (osim Istre) ima manje od 3 % olovom obogaćenih uzoraka. Svi uzorci s područja Velebita imaju vrijednost EF za olovo unutar područja geokemijskog šuma (EF < 2) pa se može smatrati da je utjecaj atmosferskog zagađenja u tom području manje izražen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Sixteen {{soil and}} {{sedimentary}} geological reference materials were analysed for As {{and the heavy}} metals Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectro-metry (ICP-MS) in combination with <b>total</b> and partial <b>dissolution</b> of the samples. It can be demonstrated {{that none of the}} modern ICP methods is completely free from analytical problems. This applies in particular when the concentrations are close to the detection limits (e. g. in ICP-AES) and is mainly due to the wide variation in the bulk composition of soils resulting in complex matrix effects (e. g. in ICP-MS). In order {{to determine the extent of}} soil pollution by heavy metals, both partial and <b>total</b> <b>dissolution</b> have to be performed prior to analysis. Key words: Soil analysis; heavy metals; inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry; inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Soil is composed of mineral constituents, organic matter (humus), living organisms, air and water, and it regulates the natural cycles of these components.
