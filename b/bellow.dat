5|$|Reich's work {{influenced}} {{a generation}} of intellectuals, including Saul <b>Bellow,</b> William Burroughs and Norman Mailer, {{and the founder of}} Summerhill School in England, A. S. Neill. The French philosopher Michel Foucault wrote in The History of Sexuality (1976) that the impact of Reich's critique of sexual repression had been substantial.|$|E
5|$|Glenn Richards, Adam Donovan and David Williams {{grew up and}} {{attended}} school in Shepparton, Victoria. Richards began writing songs while studying English at university in 1996. He invited Donovan and Williams, who had been studying music at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE, to join him; they in turn asked classmate Edmondo Ammendola to join in. The band took their name from the 1954 novel The Adventures of Augie March by Saul <b>Bellow,</b> citing its poetic, complex prose {{as a reflection of}} Richards' vocals.|$|E

In 1963 he was rewarded the Bastian Prize for his translation of Claude Simon's The Flanders Road. He chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators from 1961 to 1965.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males <b>bellow</b> {{to make their}} {{presence}} known to females. Muskoxen roar during male-male fights, and male saigas force air through their noses, producing a roar to deter rival males and attract females. Mothers also use vocal communication to locate their calves if they get separated. During fights over dominance, males tend to display themselves in an erect posture with a level muzzle.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and walruses, were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the Nazgûl scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mûmakils <b>bellow</b> comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
50|$|Double-acting piston <b>bellows</b> are {{a type of}} <b>bellows</b> used by blacksmiths and {{smelters}} {{to increase}} the air flow going into the forge, with the property that air is blown out on both strokes of the handle (in contrast to simpler and more common <b>bellows</b> that blow air when the stroke is {{in one direction and}} refill the <b>bellows</b> in the other direction). These <b>bellows</b> blow a more constant, and thus stronger, blast than simple <b>bellows.</b> Such <b>bellows</b> existed in China at least since the 5th century BC, when it was invented, and had reached Europe by the 16th century.|$|R
50|$|The fresh gas {{addition}} is made {{by controlling}} the pressure in a dosage chamber proportional to the counterlung <b>bellows</b> volume. The dosage chamber is filled with fresh gas to a pressure proportional to <b>bellows</b> volume, with the highest pressure when the <b>bellows</b> is in the empty position. When the <b>bellows</b> fills during exhalation, the gas is released from the dosage chamber into the breathing circuit, proportional to the volume in the <b>bellows</b> during exhalation, and is fully released when the <b>bellows</b> is full. Excess gas is dumped to the environment through the overpressure valve after the <b>bellows</b> is full.|$|R
50|$|Welded <b>bellows</b> (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} <b>bellows)</b> {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two <b>bellows</b> types generally centers on cost and performance. Hydroformed <b>bellows</b> generally have a high tooling cost, but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, hydroformed <b>bellows</b> have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded metal <b>bellows</b> are produced with a lower initial tooling cost and maintain higher performance characteristics. The drawback of welded <b>bellows</b> is the reduced metal strength at weld joints, caused by the high temperature of welding.|$|R
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators <b>bellow</b> to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E
5|$|Cortina {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in hosting writers, intellectuals, poets and editors from all over the world. Ernest Hemingway, Saul <b>Bellow,</b> Dino Buzzati, as well as Vittorio Gassman, Leonardo Sciascia, Leonardo Mondadori and many others, spent their vacations in the town and took part in the cultural life of the city. Through the years, this led to a continuous activity of literature festivals and book presentations, like Una Montagna di Libri ("A Mountain of Books"), held twice a year since 2009. The festival attracted to Cortina writers as Azar Nafisi, Peter Cameron, Emmanuel Carrère.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bellows</b> is a {{metal pipe}} with stretch and flexibility. <b>Bellows</b> {{is used in}} various environments as {{expansion}} joints of piping equipment to absorb vibration and thermal expansion. 60 % of <b>bellows</b> failure is caused by fatigue and low cycle fatigue failure occurs on <b>bellows</b> because the <b>bellows</b> are used in plastic region. This study intends to elucidate the mechanical properties of the <b>bellows</b> with elasto-plastic analysis. Then manufacturing the <b>bellows,</b> the shape of <b>bellows</b> is formed by extruding {{from the inside of}} a pipe. Therefore thickness of the <b>bellows</b> is not uniform and the thickness of the crown becomes thinner than the root. Analysis models considering thickness distribution are constructed in order to elucidate the influence of the thickness distribution. As a result, maximum equivalent stress is higher in U-type than n-type. Then, number of cycle to failure of U-type is about 30 - 40 % less than fi-type, so ft-type has mechanical superiority than U-type. Also life of the <b>bellows</b> is reduced by considering the thickness distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the thickness distribution in order to evaluate the life of <b>bellows</b> in safe side. ROMBUNNO. G 030050...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2000. Engineering and Applied ScienceBibliography: leaves 190 - 199 While {{analysis}} of <b>bellows,</b> {{and in particular}} unreinforced <b>bellows,</b> has been investigated {{over the course of}} the last several decades, there remain a significant number of unanswered questions with respect to their behavior. The present research addresses their behavior under cyclic displacement loading; in particular, strain due to displacement. Prediction of strain range due to displacement is important in the fatigue design of <b>bellows.</b> In addition, a number of other areas are clarified by ancillary research. [...] Design of <b>bellows</b> for cyclic displacement loading primarily relies on data obtained from <b>bellows</b> fatigue tests. Further, fatigue data on <b>bellows</b> fabricated from one material is not considered a reliable indication of the fatigue performance of <b>bellows</b> fabricated from another material. This is because there has not been a good correlation between the fatigue performance of <b>bellows</b> based on calculated stress versus cycles to failure with that for the material of construction, as represented by polished barfatigue curves. [...] This research shows that the differences in fatigue behavior of reinforced and unreinforced <b>bellows,</b> and the differences between <b>bellows</b> fatigue data and polished bar fatigue data is due to plastic strain concentration that occurs in <b>bellows.</b> The existing, widely used charts and equations for evaluation of unreinforced <b>bellows</b> were found in this research to have sufficient accuracy for calculation of the significant stresses in the elastic regime for most <b>bellows</b> geometries. Some specific observations for further improvement are made. However, it was found that the elastic prediction of stresses in unreinforced <b>bellows</b> is not sufficient to accurately evaluate the displacement strains in <b>bellows.</b> Significant plastic strain concentration due to displacement loading occurs in the highly stressed regions of <b>bellows.</b> Regimes of behavior, depending on geometry parameters, were found. Prediction of fatigue performance of <b>bellows</b> is significantly improved by proper consideration of the effect of convolution geometry on plastic strain concentration.

5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud <b>bellow</b> and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still no sign of the three horses.|$|E

5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may <b>bellow,</b> snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{together}} with Cuban dissident Armando Valladares, Bukovsky co-founded {{and was later}} elected president of Resistance International. The anti-Communist organisation was run from a small office in Paris by Soviet dissidents and emigres, notably Vladimir Maximov and Eduard Kuznetsov. In 1985 it expanded into the American Foundation for Resistance International. Among the prominent {{members of the board}} were Albert Jolis and Jeane Kirkpatrick while Midge Decter, Yuri Yarim-Agaev, Richard Perle, Saul <b>Bellow,</b> Robert Conquest and Martin Colman were on the body's advisory committee. The Foundation aimed to be a coordinating centre for dissident and democratic movements seeking to overturn communism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. It organised protests in the communist countries and in the West, and opposed western financial assistance to communist governments. The Foundation also created the National Council to Support Democratic Movements (National Council for Democracy) with the goal of aiding the emergence of democratic rule-of-law governments, and providing assistance with the writing of constitutions and the formation of civil institutions.|$|E
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or <b>bellow</b> in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of operation {{is to add}} a mass of oxygen that is proportional to ventilation volume.
