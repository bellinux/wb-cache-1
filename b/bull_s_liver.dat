Stages of new drug development research is a preclinical test using experimental animals, therefore the manufacture of an animal model of hyperuricemia is necessary. This study aims to determine the optimal induction of uric acid to increase blood uric acid levels by administering high purine foods such as cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liver,</b> cow 2 ̆ 7 s spleen, Gnetum gnemon, emping and fried peanuts. Eighty male white rats were used individuals to be divided into 4 groups, they were: (I) cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liver,</b> (II) cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liver</b> and cow 2 ̆ 7 s spleen, (III) cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liver,</b> cow 2 ̆ 7 s spleen and boiled gnetum gnemon beans, and (IV) cow 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>liver,</b> cow 2 ̆ 7 s spleen, emping and fried peanuts. This study using easy touch GCU to measure blood uric acid level. The result of statistical analysis of uric acid level means with 5 times repetition using One Way ANOVA showed that there was a very significant difference between treatments (p < 0, 01).

40|$|Le sujet de ma thèse est l étude de la {{diffraction}} par des trous sub-longueur percés dans des films métalliques, ainsi que la compréhension du rôle des plasmons de surface (SPs) dans la diffraction en champ lointain. Nous avons construit un goniomètre fait maison de haute qualité. Une série de trous unique percés dans un film opaque et variant continûment de k r >> 1 à k r > 1 to k r<< 1 {{in a flat}} opaque film were explored, where k is the wavevector of {{the incident}} wave and r is the radius of the hole. The experimental {{results indicated that the}} diffraction of single hole can be classified into four regimes, depending on the input polarization. A simple analytical expression reveals {{for the first time the}} subtle interplay of two competing factors: one related to surface plasmon excitation and the other originating in the coupling of the field to the waveguide mode of the aperture. When the hole is surrounded by concentric grooves (<b>bull</b> <b>s</b> eye structure) and is illuminated with the grooves on the output side, the beaming effect occurs: far-field diffraction is confined in very small solid angle. The effects of geometrical parameters on <b>bull</b> <b>s</b> eye diffraction have been studied and the diffraction patterns with the width less than 1 in the far field have been achieved. Another surface waves (CWs) different from SPs on tungsten films were studied. It was demonstrated that the CWs have beaming effect as well.

Comparing the kinetics for sulfonation by <b>liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 homogenates of male rat, male mouse, and humans revealed that sulfonation was about 30 times more efficient by male rat <b>liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 than by human <b>liver</b> <b>S</b> 9, whereas the catalytic efficiency by male mouse and human <b>liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 was about the same.

40|$|Ketamine {{is widely}} used in {{veterinary}} medicine and in medicine. Ketamine is metabolized to its active metabolite norketamine principally by liver CYP 3 A. Drug metabolism alterations during aging have severe consequences particularly in anesthesiology and very few studies on older animals were conducted for ketamine. The objective {{of the present study}} is to assess the influence of aging on CYP 3 A metabolism of ketamine. <b>Liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 fractions from 3, 6, 12 and 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats were prepared and Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined for primary metabolic pathways. The derived maximum enzyme velocity (i. e. Vmax) suggests a rapid saturation of the CYP 3 A enzyme active sites in <b>liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 fractions of 18 -month old rats. Observed Vmax for <b>Liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 fractions from 3, 6 and 12 month old male Sprague Dawley rats were 2. 39 (+- 0. 23), 2. 61 (+- 0. 18), and 2. 07 (+- 0. 07) respectively compared to 0. 68 (+- 0. 02) for <b>Liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 fractions from 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats. Interestingly, we observed a 6 to 7 fold change in the derived Km when comparing <b>Liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 fractions from 18 month old male Sprague Dawley rats with <b>Liver</b> <b>S</b> 9 fractions from younger rats. Our results suggest that rat CYP 3 A enzyme undergoes conformational changes with age particularly in our geriatric group (e. g. 18 month rats) leading significant decrease in the rate of formation of norketamine. Moreover, our results strongly suggest a severe impairment of CYP 3 A ketamine mediated metabolism. Comment: 16 pages, 1 table, 2 figure...|$|R
