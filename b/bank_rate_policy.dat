40|$|This essay {{examines}} Norwegian {{monetary policy}} under the final {{decades of the}} classical international gold standard regime prior to World War I. While the evidence clearly demonstrates that the commitment to gold convertibility was the overall objective, the character of monetary policy {{was determined by the}} inherent tension between Norges Bank’s role as the guardian of the nation’s most important reserve of foreign exchange and the role as manager of the domestic currency. In order to solve this tension, a core point of monetary policy was to shelter the domestic money supply from changes in the balance of payments. Rather than forcefully reducing domestic circulation during seasonal fluctuations in the flow of gold, Norges Bank operated with a relatively large reserve of notes and foreign securities which took the strain. The effect of this policy was interest rate smoothing and increased freedom for exercising discretionary judgment. Moreover, I present evidence demonstrating that interest rate decisions were influenced by a number of domestic concerns and not only the external balance.

The implications of the study is that monetary policy in a developing country {{plays an important role in}} increasing the growth rate of the economy by influencing the cost and availability of credit, by controlling inflation and maintaining equilibrium in the balance of payments.

40|$|Expectations {{of market}} {{participants}} {{play an important}} role in monetary policy making. The main reason for this is that expectations influence the behaviour of investors and prices in financial markets. In this article, we present two sources of information on the expectations of financial market participants regarding the central <b>bank’s</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate.</b> Both the yields of government securities and the survey of interest rate expectations conducted by Reuters contain information on what the market expects the future path of the <b>policy</b> <b>rate</b> to be, but sometimes these two sources of information convey substantially different messages. Our analysis helps to understand this phenomenon by shedding light on two key factors behind it. On the one hand, forward rates calculated from the yield curve contain a risk premium and exceed the expected value of the future central <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate.</b> On the other hand, analysts in the Reuters’ survey report the most likely value of the future central <b>bank</b> <b>policy</b> <b>rate</b> as their forecasts, instead of the average value of all possible scenarios.

Clearly, there are compelling arguments for bank management to carefully consider the factors that might increase customer retention rates. Several studies have emphasised the significance of customer retention in the banking industry (see Dawkins and Reichheld, 1990; Marple and Zimmerman, 1999; Page et al., 1996; Fisher, 2001). However, there has been little effort to investigate factors that might lead to customer retention. Most of the published research has focused on the impact of individual constructs, without attempting to link them in a model to further explore or explain retention. If retention criteria are not well managed, customers might still leave their banks, no matter how hard bankers try to retain them. This paper examines the impact of several retention-relevant constructs that influence consumers' decisions to stay with or leave their banks in New Zealand. These constructs were rated by customers as having strong effects on loyalty to their banks. Demographic characteristics (i. e. age, gender, educational level and income) were also assessed for their contribution to intentions of staying with or finding alternative banks. Results suggest that the most important constructs were customer satisfaction, followed by corporate image and switching barriers. There was also evidence that customers' age groups and level of education contributed to explaining respondents' propensity to stay with their current banks...|$|R

Subject to various sensitivity checks, we find that contractionary monetary policy shock has a temporary negative effect on the degree of economic activity and price level. We find that using output gap instead of GDP alleviates the price puzzle. In general, prices are driven mainly by foreign factors and the European Central Bank monetary policy shock on Slovak prices is more powerful than that of the National Bank of Slovakia.

Robust forms of the policy rule are tested empirically for three inflation-targeting countries converging to the euro, i. e. the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary.
