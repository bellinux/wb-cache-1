In 1867, she created her first butter sculpture, when, after the failure of the farm's cotton crop, she sought a source of supplemental income. Farm women of the time often created decoratively <b>shaped</b> <b>butter</b> using butter molds, but rather than molding, Brooks sculpted the <b>butter</b> into <b>shapes</b> such as shells, animals, and faces. Rather than traditional sculpting tools, she used [...] "common butter-paddles, cedar sticks, broom straws and camel's-hair pencils". Her customers appreciated the skillfully sculpted butter, and there was a good market for her works. She continued producing her butter sculptures for {{about a year and a}} half, then took a break from it for a few years.|$|R
