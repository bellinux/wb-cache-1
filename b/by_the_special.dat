5|$|Moonraker was {{intended}} by its creator Ian Fleming {{to become a}} film even before he completed the novel in 1954, since he based it on a screenplay manuscript he had written even earlier.

Budgetary issues caused the film to be primarily shot in France, with locations also in Italy, Brazil, Guatemala and the United States.

5|$|A silver boom {{occurred}} in England after {{the discovery of}} silver near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of silver were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland – up to three to four tonnes of silver were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe. The result was a local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th-century royal finances. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting alluvial deposits and governed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> Stannary Courts and Parliaments. Tin formed a valuable export good, initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for silver, with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, {{as well as in}} Devon. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by silver production.|$|E

5|$|Stanley {{called the}} General Assembly into special session in February 1917. At issue was reformation of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt {{unjustly}} burdened agricultural interests. The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually. Though Kentucky was {{in better shape}} financially than many of its peers, Stanley still sought to balance the budget. The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed {{of many of the}} bills he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by M. M. Logan. Additional taxes were passed on distilled spirits, oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses. Assessments on the value of property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of fair market price, rose dramatically. To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property. With the dramatic increase in funds yielded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education. The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.|$|E
