40|$|Optimisation {{algorithms}} used to automatically size structural members commonly involve stress constraints to avoid material failure. Therefore {{the cost of}} optimisation grows rapidly {{as the number of}} structural members is increased due to the corresponding {{increase in the number of}} constraints. In this work, an efficient method for large scale stress constrained structural sizing optimisation problems is proposed. A convex, separable, and scalable approximation for stress constraints which splits the approximation into a local fully stressed term and a global load distribution term is introduced. Predictor-corrector interior point method, an excellent option for large scale optimization problem, is chosen to solve the approximate subproblems. The core idea in this work is to achieve computational efficiency in the optimization procedure by avoiding the construction and the solution of the Schur complement system generated by the interior point method. Avoiding the Schur complement, and explicit sensitivity analysis, eliminates the high cost of solving stress constrained problems within the interior point optimisation. This is achieved using the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, and a new preconditioner is proposed specifically for stress constrained problems. The proposed method is applied to a number of <b>beam</b> <b>sizing</b> problems. Numerical results show that optimal complexity is achieved by the algorithm, the computational cost being linearly proportional to the number of sizing variables. </p...|$|E

By varying the separation of the slits, <b>beam</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from 50 to 500 um can be measured with a resolution of approximately 5 um.

40|$|When using a commonly-used quadri-wave lateral {{shearing}} interferometer wavefront sensor (QWLSI WFS) for <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> {{measurements on}} a high power CO 2 laser, artefacts have been observed in the measured irradiance distribution. The grating in the QWLSI WFS not only generates the diffracted first orders that are required for introducing the shear, but also diffracts significantly into higher orders. Consequently, in the few millimeters of free space propagation between the QWLSI WFS grating and its imaging device, the <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> may increase significantly (particularly for infrared wavelengths). This error is typically not accounted for in the subsequent processing of measurement data. To gain insight in this undesirable behavior, physical models of the QWLSI WFS using both complex wave propagation and analytic propagation of the D 4 sigma beam diameter (and its associated M 2) throughout the system have been developed. These models show excellent agreement to experimental data, and indicate that in typical situations the sensor-induced <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> error can easily be 40 % or more. Although the QWLSI WFS may not originally be intended for <b>beam</b> <b>size</b> measurements, in most industrial applications cost- and volume limitations will often lead to multiple use of sensor data.
