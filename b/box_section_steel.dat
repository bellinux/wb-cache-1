50|$|The Sonic 7 was {{conceived}} as more civilised {{alternative to the}} Rocket. Though still a roadster (though a windscreen, doors & roof are available as optional extras) it does feature an enclosed cockpit. Though {{very similar to the}} Rocket mechanically, it uses different, simplified, chassis constructed from straight, <b>box</b> <b>section</b> <b>steel</b> instead of the Rocket's curved, tubular sections. Launched in February 2008, it remains in production and has been sold in UK, USA, South Africa & the Netherlands and Hungary (via a distributor).|$|E
5000|$|Rock sliders are {{typically}} made of heavy-duty <b>box</b> <b>section</b> <b>steel,</b> although {{they can also}} be made from tubular steel as well. They run along each side of the vehicle, from just behind the front wheel to just before the rear wheel, just below the level of the door sills. They are affixed to the vehicle's chassis, and their function is to protect the door sills and door bottoms from damage when crossing large obstacles (such as rocks - hence the name).|$|E
5000|$|The NC {{series was}} updated for the 2014 model year with an {{increase}} in engine capacity to 745 cc (through a 4 mm increase in bore), with power rising to 40.3 kW at 6,250 rpm and torque to 68 Nm at 4,750 rpm. The NC750 Integra also received a new aluminum swing arm, which superseded the <b>box</b> <b>section</b> <b>steel</b> arm of the NC700 Integra [...] The increased performance was also matched with a software update to the dual clutch transmission and taller gearing that provide improvement to fuel economy. Minor changes to the fairing and seat also provide increased leg room for taller riders.|$|E

50|$|The Concept Centaur GT was a kit car first {{built by}} Concept Cars Ltd of Middleton, Leicestershire, in 1973 and marketed from 1974 to 1977. The design {{was very much}} {{influenced}} by the Probe 15 from Adams Probe Motor. The car is famous for possibly being the lowest car ever made being only 94 cm (37 in) high. It {{was based on the}} Hillman Imp mechanicals and the body was a GRP-and-plywood monocoque with <b>box</b> <b>section</b> and <b>steel</b> tube reinforcement. The number of models produced is disputed, both 26 and 52 cars have been quoted.|$|R

50|$|The Wildcat is {{available}} with a {{five or six}} speed Tremec manual gearbox mated to a live rear axle with a rear limited slip differential; independent rear suspension may be specified when ordering. A 2.8:1 axle ratio is fitted as standard, but other ratios are possible. The driveline claimed to accept up to 1000 bhp. The chassis is a <b>box</b> <b>section</b> <b>steel</b> structure with built-in roll and side impact protection. The fully adjustable suspension includes front double unequal length wishbones, and a rear live axle with four locating links. Brakes are front and rear ventilated discs with four pot calipers. It has {{rack and pinion steering}} with 2.9 turns from lock to lock, and may be powered or unpowered.|$|E
5000|$|The revised chassis {{was again}} made of <b>box</b> <b>section</b> <b>steel</b> and was {{cruciform}} braced. The side members rose over the rear axle {{and were not}} underslung like the Consort. The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs but retained traditional leaf springs and live axle at the rear. Automatic chassis lubrication continued to be fitted, operating [...] "thermostatically every time the engine warm(ed) up", and the propeller-shaft centre bearing was [...] "prepacked with grease" [...] so did not require lubrication. [...] However, the propeller shaft itself was not served by the system and four grease points required [...] "attention every 1,000 miles". Worm and double roller steering was used. The Regency's hybrid Girling hydro-mechanical brakes were upgraded to fully hydraulic during production of the Regency II.|$|E
50|$|Melling's concept, The Hellcat car {{is said to}} have 1175 hp {{delivered}} by a 6-litre V10 engine with the block and heads milled from solid billets of aluminium rather than cast. Taking influence from TVRs, the car is front-engined with rear-wheel-drive using a fibreglass monocoque body and <b>box</b> <b>section</b> <b>steel</b> chassis, independent wishbone suspension and a six speed trans-axle, from the Chevrolet Corvette. Its weight is estimated at 1,200 kg, with 60 mi/h km/h coming up in an F1-rivalling 2.8 seconds, and a Vmax of 200 mph-plus. Melling planned a GT1 version to challenge Aston Martins, Vipers and Corvettes at Le Mans in 2007. The cabin is race-inspired with deep bucket seats, harnesses and carbon trim. The plan was for only 50 a year to be produced in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and sold through one national dealer. So far, the Hellcat and its power plant remain on the drawing board.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The current local {{stability}} criteria (KBC 2009, AISC 2010) are enacted through {{theoretical and}} {{experimental studies of}} ordinary steels, but the mechanical properties of high strength steels are different from ordinary steels. The high strength steel in the applicability of design criteria should be needed to review because of increasing market demanding for high strength steel in the high-rise and long span buildings. In this study, stub columns of H-shaped and <b>box</b> <b>section</b> with various <b>steel</b> grades subjected to concentric loading were investigated, and these steels were checked to the applicability of current local stability criteria. The difference between the ordinary steel and high strength steel was compared. As a result of comparison with various steel grades, most specimens {{were satisfied with the}} design criteria, but some specimens with lower tensile strength were not reached the required strength. It is considered that the uncertainty of material was the higher when the tensile strength of material was the lower...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnitude}} {{and distribution of}} residual stresses in structural carbon <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> have been thoroughly investigated. However, few residual stress measurements have been made on structural stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sections.</b> Stainless <b>steel</b> has differing material stress-strain characteristics and thermal properties to carbon steel, both of which influence the formation of residual stresses. This suggests that established carbon steel residual stress models may not be appropriate for stainless steel. With increased use of stainless steel in load bearing applications, {{it is important to}} establish the residual stresses that exist within structural members. An experimental program to quantify the residual stresses in stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sections</b> from three different production routes has therefore been carried out. Comprehensive residual stress distributions have been obtained for three hot rolled angles, eight press braked angles and seven cold rolled <b>box</b> <b>sections,</b> with a total of over 800 readings taken. This paper presents the experimental techniques implemented and the residual stress distributions obtained as well as discussing the assumptions commonly made regarding through thickness residual stress variations. In the hot rolled and press braked sections, residual stresses were typically below 20 % of the material 0. 2 % proof stress, though for the cold rolled <b>box</b> <b>sections,</b> whilst membrane residual stresses were relatively low, bending residual stresses were measured to be between 40 % and 70 % of the material 0. 2 % proof stress...|$|R
50|$|The OSCARs {{also include}} several new safety features. The doors on older rolling stock such as V sets are all {{unlocked}} at every station (even short platforms). V Sets have doors {{which must be}} slid open for alighting/boarding and G Sets have push buttons. However, on the H set, the guard is able to select the number of doors to be opened at a station. This feature is aimed at preventing incidents where passengers may fall from the carriage when stopped at a short platform. The H sets have been fitted with Dellner SP couplings, compatible with the Millennium Trains and the Hunter railcars. They are able to absorb {{the impact of a}} collision, and the anti-climbers on the H Sets will also reduce the force of impact. The trains also have a different body design. Instead of the entire body being of the same design, such as the Tangara, the driver's cab is built like a protective cage, made of fibreglass and supported by a <b>box</b> <b>section</b> <b>steel</b> frame, which stretches {{to the end of the}} guard's door. The rest of the train is made from conventional stainless steel.|$|E
40|$|Initial {{distortion}} and {{residual stress}} {{are well known}} {{as the most important}} initial imperfection factors and have a significant effect in decreasing the ultimate strength of compression members. The present work focuses on predicting the ultimate strength of welded <b>box</b> <b>section</b> <b>steel</b> compression members regarding initial imperfection factors. Beam compared with shell type of Finite Element (FE) models varied in slenderness ratio and initial distortion are used to assess the accuracy of present numerical results. The comparison of result between FE models and design strength formulations in some specifications are used to assess the ultimate strength formulations of bridge specifications according to the behavior of current steel compression members. It can be observed from numerical results that FE models and design strength by JSHB 2012 and AISC 2005 /AASHTO 2010 have good agreement each other which means that the specifications have good capability in assessing the ultimate strength of steel compression members. Parametric study of the ultimate strain varied in slenderness ratio and load versus displacement curves of compression members are also introduced in order to perform more detail steel columns displacement behaviour. Finally, present work proposed a flowchart in designing steel compression members with the expectation that it will be helpful as reference for researchers and engineers in practical fields...|$|E

40|$|Behaviour under torsion is an {{important}} performance-related property of automotive <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> A previous experimental study has identified joining technique, section thickness and section area as the major influencing factors on the torsional behaviour of <b>box</b> hat <b>sections.</b> Using these test results as the basis, a finite element modelling strategy that can simulate the behaviour of adhesively bonded and spot-welded automotive <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to torsion is presented. The numerical study investigated the effects of material representation, mesh density and layout, and joining technique representation on the stiffness, elastic limit and ultimate strength of the <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> The final model, calibrated and validated against test results obtained from previous work, was used in an extensive study, presented in the companion paper (Part 2), to further {{the understanding of the}} behaviour of torsionally loaded <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> and its implications on weight reduction of automotive structures...|$|R

40|$|Single <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> and T-joints (two <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> joined {{together}} at right angles) {{are commonly used}} to represent automotive components, such as pillars and sills, in laboratory testing. In the work presented herein, the torsional properties of T-joints were determined both experimentally and numerically. A factorial-design test programme comparing adhesive-bonded and spot-welded T-joints was carried out. Numerical models, generated using a general-purpose finite element program and validated against the test results, were used to investigate further the behaviour {{of the connection between}} the two <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> in a T-joint. The joining technique and the joint eccentricity at the connection (the distance of the join from the vertical <b>box</b> <b>section)</b> were found to influence the torsional properties of T-joints.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an experimental investigation of a novel FRP-concrete composite floor system. The system consists of a moulded glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) grating adhesively bonded to square pultruded GFRP <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> as structural formwork for a concrete slab. Holes cut into the top flange of the <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> at a variable spacing allow concrete ‘studs’ to form at the grating/box section interface. During casting, GFRP dowels are inserted into the holes to further connect the grating and <b>box</b> <b>sections.</b> Following component tests on the concrete-filled grating and shear connectors, six (300 x 150) mm and 3000 mm long slab specimens were designed and tested under five-point bending. From the resulting load-deflection curves, {{it was determined that}} all specimens behaved elastically and fully compositely until the initial peak was reached. No slip was observed between the concrete and GFRP <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> until the longitudinal shear failure occurred at the initial peak. The load capacity carried on increasing at a reduced stiffness in a progressive manner, with significant residual strength and slip observed. All specimens failed by the separation of the webs and flange at the upper corners of the <b>box</b> <b>sections</b> due to the large curvature induced. Full-scale experimental results demonstrated that the controlled longitudinal shear failure provided deformability to the overall system and a robust interaction between the concrete and FRP formwork was achieved...|$|R
