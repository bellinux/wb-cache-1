5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
5|$|The {{controllers}} {{were designed}} to <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> enough to survive the forces of launch, and proved to be extremely resilient to damage. During {{the investigation of the}} Challenger accident the two MECs (from engines 2020 and 2021), recovered from the seafloor, were delivered to Honeywell Aerospace for examination and analysis. One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E

25|$|Once {{they had}} decided on their 23 characters, they {{returned}} to London {{for a meeting with}} the BBC. Everyone agreed that EastEnders would <b>be</b> <b>tough,</b> violent on occasion, funny and sharp—set in Margaret Thatcher's Britain—and it would start with a bang (namely the death of Reg Cox). They decided that none of their existing characters were wicked enough to have killed Reg, so a 24th character, Nick Cotton was added to the line-up. He was a racist thug, who often tried to lead other young characters astray. When all the characters had been created, Smith and Holland set about casting the actors for the show.|$|E

While the Texans and Chiefs had signed Jake Delhomme and Kyle Orton, respectively, prior to McNabb becoming a free agent, the Bears had not signed anyone and expressed interest in adding McNabb. It was ultimately {{decided that it was}} too late to add a free agent quarterback for the playoff hunt, as it would <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> to grasp their offense in the short period of time. The Bears subsequently signed Josh McCown.|$|E

He chose fighter training at Williams Air Force Base in Chandler, AZ. The group commander was known to <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> on his students, and Givens chose this location so he could be formed into a great fighter pilot.|$|E
