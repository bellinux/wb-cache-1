5|$|After {{the split}} with the Bahá'ís, some Azalis were {{very active in}} secular reform {{movements}} and the Iranian Constitutional Revolution (19051907), including Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi Kermani and Mirza Abd-al-Hosayn Kermani. However, the community was still suppressed as a heresy and the accusation of being an Azali was often enough for most to <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true. Coupled with the Azali practice of taqiyya (dissimulation) determining {{whether or not a}} particular figure in Persian politics was an Azali is difficult.|$|E

In this episode, Scully, working alone, pursues a cult that worship a slug-like organism and <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Second Coming of Jesus Christ; but in her efforts to save an injured stranger, she discovers she is in over her head.|$|E

5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois to <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strange. Peter then {{states that it}} is no {{stranger}} than when Darth Vader from the film franchise Star Wars was a parking attendant. Vader is then shown in the contemporary world as a failure, and making minimum wage. This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright. After Stewie takes over Brian's radio show, the two begin playing random sound clips from various films and television shows, including dialogue from the 1993 drama film Philadelphia, which was acknowledged as a mistake by Stewie.|$|E
5|$|Both Orkney and Shetland saw a {{significant}} influx of Norwegian settlers {{during the late}} 8th and early 9th centuries. Vikings made the islands the headquarters of their pirate expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland. In response, Norwegian king Harald Fairhair (Harald Hårfagre) annexed the Northern Isles, comprising Orkney and Shetland, in 875. (It is clear that this story, which appears in the Orkneyinga Saga, {{is based on the}} later voyages of Magnus Barelegs and some scholars <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> apocryphal.) Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty.|$|E

He and fellow Group members Brian Roedecker (Allan Zinyk) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) identify the victim as Rebecca Damsen. Damsen's email correspondence leads them to a San Jose address; Watts finds the bodies of both the owner and Damsen in a nearby graveyard. By the bodies is another number, which they determine to be an IP address.|$|E

Dr Matthew Roney, a paleontologist, examines the remains and reconstructs a dwarf-like humanoid with a large brain volume, which he believes to be a primitive man. As further excavation is undertaken, {{something that looks like}} a missile is unearthed; further work by Roney's group is halted because the military <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an unexploded Second World War bomb.|$|E
5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E
