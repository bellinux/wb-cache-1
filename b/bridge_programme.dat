40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} ‘knowledge economy’ where ‘innovation’ and ‘responsiveness’ are vital, tertiary {{education can be}} at a point transformation. Since the late 1990 s the New Zealand government began to shift part of its tertiary education policy with an increasing focus on what is commonly called ‘foundation’ education. The shift was aimed at ensuring all New Zealanders are equipped for the knowledge economy and raising the skills of individuals. A variety of research and education programmes were launched, and existing foundation or <b>bridging</b> <b>programmes</b> strengthened through policy, research and educational endeavours. <b>Bridging</b> education <b>programmes</b> (a subset of foundation education) are designed to prepare non-traditional and under-prepared students for ongoing study at a higher level. This current research sought to identify {{the influence of a}} university <b>bridging</b> <b>programme</b> (Level 4) on students who progressed into further study at undergraduate level. The <b>bridging</b> <b>programme</b> commenced in 2003 providing a pathway for students into undergraduate health degrees. The key question for this thesis was: how does bridging education influence students? To determine the influence of the <b>bridging</b> <b>programme,</b> this research was based on a case-study of seven students who completed four or eight papers in the <b>bridging</b> <b>programme.</b> Participants were in ongoing study (for at least one year) in a Bachelor of Health Science (any major). The methodology was qualitative in design, drawing extensively on a case-study approach to research the influences of the <b>bridging</b> <b>programme.</b> The method of data collection utilised was individual semi-structured interviews with former bridging students to ascertain their perceptions, views and experiences of the influence of a <b>bridging</b> <b>programme,</b> both historically and currently. In examining this unique context, information on the influences of bridging education was explored and the importance of bridging education, from the participant’s perspective, understood more clearly. This thesis and the research within revealed that the influence of the <b>bridging</b> <b>programme</b> began at the participant’s time of enrolment and continued into their undergraduate study and their lives. The <b>bridging</b> <b>programme</b> influenced the way participant’s interacted with a range of factors including: the institution; their undergraduate programme; with educators and peers; and with family, friends and others in society. Equally, it is acknowledged that these factors influenced the participant’s, facilitating or impeding their ongoing learning. The participants also identified several challenges (financial and relational) related to the influence of tertiary study which they faced. The research revealed the programme influenced their ongoing success and continuation in undergraduate study. The programme provided an effective bridge into tertiary education (academically, emotionally and socially). Participant’s acknowledged the influence on their cognitive and meta-cognitive growth and development. The range of tertiary leaning skills and knowledge gained and/or enhanced was considerable. Close links between the academic skills taught in the <b>bridging</b> <b>programme</b> and required in undergraduate study were evident. Positive improvements in confidence, self-efficacy and motivation were also attributed to the influence of the programme. Holistic personal development occurred as the skills and knowledge gained and developed were transferred and extended from academia into other areas of the lives of former bridging students and thus further influenced their family, personal friends and society. The influence of the <b>bridging</b> <b>programme</b> has enabled new opportunities, ways of being and employment to become more than a dream, but a reality which the participants continue to move towards. Overall, it could be claimed that the influence of the <b>bridging</b> <b>programme</b> was holistic. A series of recommendations are provided for theory, policy and practice.

40|$|Prezi PresentatieIn {{the last}} decade China and other rising powers have {{received}} increased attention from policy makers, academicians and development practitioners. Notwithstanding {{a growing number of}} reports and books that intend to give an overview of the approaches, characteristics or influence of several rising powers in general or in a certain sector, there is still a lack of studies that analyze their presence and influence in one specific country and compare China’s approaches with that of other rising powers on the basis of specific programs and projects. This article explores this issue by comparing the governmental assistance in agriculture and food security of China to Malawi– a country which has only gained interest from the rising powers relatively recently - with that of Brazil, India, South Africa. It looks more specifically at the influence that these rising powers exert on the decision-making process in Malawi, as well as the discourse and practice of the development approaches. The main arguments of the article are that (1) the perception about the influence and potential contribution of the rising powers differs greatly between the traditional donor community and that of the Malawian government and this difference {{can be explained by the}} limited coordination and cooperation among traditional donors and rising powers as well as by the importance of ideational influence; (2) despite some similarities there are important differences in the type of influence and the modalities (incl. budget, financing mechanisms and capacity development approaches) between the four rising powers in Malawi Research project and methodology The study features in a four year research (2012 - 2015) entitled ‘Challenging the Status-Quo. The impact of the emerging economies on the global governance of development cooperation’ commissioned by the Flemish Policy Research Centre for Foreign Affairs, Entrepreneurship and Development Cooperation. The project focuses specifically on the governmental cooperation of Brazil, India, China and South Africa in the health sector in Mozambique and the agricultural and food security sector in Malawi. Some fifteen different projects and programs are studied in more depth: incl. in Malawi (for China:) the agricultural demonstration centre, the South-South Cooperation with FAO; and the agricultural technology transfer with DFID; (for Brazil:) the home grown school feeding programme with the WFP; and cotton four programme; (for India:) the Innovation <b>bridge</b> <b>programme</b> with USAID; the Technical assistance programme in cotton; (for South Africa:) the general cooperation agreement. This specific article uses the Anatomy of Influence framework - developed by Harmer et al. in their assessment of the influence of rising powers on global health - to analyze the ways influence is exerted and draws on information collected during field work in Malawi in 2013 (policy documents and interviews with more than 60 representatives of OECD-DAC donors, rising powers, the Malawian government and other development actors), interviews with Chinese experts in Beijing in 2014.

40|$|Context Several key {{performance}} indicators of macro-economic conditions and public finances show a positive evolution or a sustained above-EU-average performance in recent years, such as for the budget deficit and unemployment. Other structural trends are confirmed, such as the declining share of industry in value added and the high importance of SME’s in the economy. In terms of integration in global value chains, Belgium has seen a light improvement {{in recent years in}} its world export shares in goods and services. Productivity has grown and is comparable (or better) than in many other EU countries. For its political and regulatory environment, Belgium keeps reporting good but not leading scores. For its digital economy, Belgium is part of the ‘lagging ahead’ cluster of countries. The use of information and communication technologies to deliver government services is increasing, as reflected in Belgium’s position on e-government rankings. R&I Actors - summary Belgium is characterized by a well-developed Triple Helix. Besides 17 federal scientific institutes, many regional research centers and collaborative platforms {{play a key role in}} the innovation ecosystem, such as the strategic research centers (Flanders), the competitiveness poles (Wallonia), the Bridge platforms (Brussels) and the collective centers (both in Flanders and Wallonia). The major part of the scientific output is delivered by the universities, while more than half of domestic expenditures on R&D in Belgium is financed by the business sector. R&I Challenges Any assessment of the R&I system in Belgium should take into account that, while Belgian research and innovation performance is not at the top in the EU, the country has managed to consolidate its position of a strong innovator over many years. In line with this observation, the policy mix and focus of policy effort have not changed dramatically over the last five years or even, it could be argued, over a decade. While most of R&D&I policy is devised and implemented at the level of the regions and communities, the innovation challenges are formulated at the echelon of the entire country. In other words, they constitute a common denominator of the challenges at the subnational level. Challenge 1 : Promote fast growing enterprises in innovative sectors With a share of employment in high-growth enterprises of only 5. 9 %, Belgium is well under the EU average of 9. 1 %, ranking 23 rd in the EU. In addition, many fast-growing Belgian firms do not operate in innovative sectors, but in sectors such as construction and transport. Given the growth challenge facing Belgium – and Europe as a whole – and the pivotal role of high-growth, innovative SMEs, increasing their prevalence is a key policy challenge. In Wallonia, the Marshall Plan 4. 0 envisages fomenting the creation of enterprises through the "entrepreneurial generations 2015 - 2020 " project, the further development of competitive clusters based on the ‘Competitiveness Poles’, and new instruments that foster the creation of innovative enterprises. An example of the latter is W. IN. G, an equity platform for financing the growth of digital start-ups. The Walloon Small Business Act is a comprehensive plan to stimulate the creation and growth of SMEs, amongst other by improving access to finance, with the "charte bancaire" as an example of a concrete initiative. In Flanders, an important strategic decision that is expected to strengthen the creation of innovative start-ups, is the merger of two strategic research centres (imec and iMinds), combing top research in microelectronics with expertise in software and business incubation. Other measures addressing the challenge include the “SME growth subsidy”, which was created in 2016. In the Brussels Capital Region, knowledge transfer from academia to business is supported, amongst others through the <b>Bridge</b> <b>programme.</b> Enabling mechanisms are also further developed, such as financing of innovative companies through the Brussels Regional Investment Company (S. R. I. B.) and hosting and incubation structures provided by Citydev. At federal level, various tax incentives for R&D are in place to create an attractive fical climate for R&d intensive companies, including start-ups. A key measure is the partial exemption of the wage withholding for researchers, which strengthens the demand for highly qualified staff, tying it to the 2 nd innovation challenge. Challenge 2 : Addressing the expected shortage of human resources for R&I While the labour force in Belgium is generally well-qualified, the share of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) graduates is low at 15. 7 % compared to the EU 28 average of 25. 4 %. Although the share of STEM students in total inflow in higher education has shown an increasing trend in recent years, demand exceeds the number of graduates. Shortages in these fields are considered as a potential major barrier for future innovation and economic growth and are already emerging for certain functions, such as ICT experts. More generally, there is a skill mismatch in the labour market, which is mainly related to an undersupply of highly-skilled job-seekers and to an over-representation of low-skilled job seekers. The Country Specific Recommendations for Belgium of June 2016 highlight the continued importance of human capital policy to boost the capacity to innovate. This challenge is closely intertwined with the first one, since the presence of fast-growing firms in innovative sectors crucially depends on highly qualified human capital in the domains of IT, biotech, material science, etc. As mentioned in the 1 st challenge, the federal government's influence over this policy domain is only indirect, but nonetheless important. Through fiscal measures it exerts a substantial influence on the demand for highly skilled workers, in particular through the policy of a reduced wage withholding tax for researchers, which will be continued in the coming years. The Marshall Plan 4. 0 in Wallonia aims to better align the supply of graduates in Wallonia to business needs, amongst others through the set-up of an inventory of "professions of the future". In order to attract external talent, the region has also introduced mechanisms like the "Beware Fellowships" to attract foreign talent. In Flanders, joint efforts involving the policy domains of science and innovation on the one hand, and education and training on the other, have been launched to increase the number of secondary students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM subjects) and encourage them to opt for a career in exact sciences or technology. The "STEM Action Plan 2012 - 2020 " has, among others, resulted in the STEM Monitor, an indicator dashboard that systematically tracks inflow into, and successful completion of, STEM studies at various levels of education. The "STEM Charter" is rolled out on a large scale and already brings together more than 50 companies and organisations which have indicated that they lend their full support to the STEM initiative. Finally, policy attention in all regions has also increasingly turned towards attracting foreign researchers or researchers from the own Community that are active abroad, through schemes like Odysseus and Pegasus 2 (Flanders), Ulysse (Wallonia) and Attract (Brussels). status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{marketing}} of postgraduate programmes by 'Western' universities demands academic communication among scholars from divergent cultural backgrounds, though each may bring distinctive learning traditions and values. At the University of Adelaide an Integrated <b>Bridging</b> <b>Programme</b> (IBP) offers international postgraduates {{the opportunity to}} develop languages and skills for successful acculturation. Evaluations of this programme reveal that both postgraduates and their supervising staff often assume unquestioningly that only the newly-recruited foreign postgraduates need to change their academic goals and practices, especially in relation to critical thinking and to studying in a different postgraduate research culture. This paper argues that in this commercial educational context, the challenge to learn is on both sides. Valid 'transcultural' education requires that the values of Western academic tradition be critiqued through the perceptions and experiences of international scholars.

Communication training needs are more complex when there are cultural, ethnic and language differences between nurses, other health professionals and patients. DESIGN: A qualitative, exploratory research design using semi-structured interviews. METHODS: All (nine) organisations involved in conducting the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency approved preregistration <b>bridging</b> <b>programmes</b> for overseas qualified nurses within the state of Victoria, Australia, were involved in the study. Participants were 12 nurse educators employed in these organisations. Thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Three macro themes emerged about the overseas qualified nurses 2 ̆ 7 intercultural communication: (1) pre-existing barriers and enablers to intercultural communication, for example, nurses 2 ̆ 7 reluctance to engage in communicative strategies that build rapport with patients, (2) transitional behaviours and impact on communication, including maintenance of perceived cultural hierarchies between health professionals and (3) development of communicative competence, including expanding one 2 ̆ 7 s repertoire of conversational gambits. CONCLUSIONS: The findings point to the domains and causes of communication challenges facing overseas qualified nurses in new healthcare settings as well as strategies that the nurse educators and nurses can adopt.

The majority of students entering Transition Mathematics 1 (TM 1), the introductory level of the MLC suite of courses, possess limited mathematical knowledge coupled with a very negative view of mathematics. As this negativity is often a consequence of repeated failure, resulting in a fear of mathematics and many not progressing beyond Year 10, the MLC’s task is significant. In order to engage and increase the success of these students, the MLC has taken advantage of the innovation afforded by the Tablet PC. The Tablet PC has been utilised to deliver lectures to internal TM 1 students and for creating instructional videos for external (distance) students. Two studies were conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the technology in each mode of delivery. This paper will provide a background of <b>bridging</b> <b>programmes</b> at CQUniversity, explain how the Tablet PC is utilised within TM 1, summarise the findings of each of the studies and outline of how the results have been used to further enhance the delivery of all transition mathematics courses thus improving the learning outcomes of students...|$|R
