5|$|Rain {{came in the}} night. The {{cold front}} that would <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> the smog was {{forecasted}} to arrive between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. Shortly after 9 a.m. the wind arrived, moving mostly from the northeast between 6–10 miles per hour and bringing cooler temperatures in the 50s°F (10–15°C). Glenn at the Interstate Sanitation Commission sent a message advising the alert to end at 9:40a.m., based on weather and air readings. Shortly after noon, Governor Rockefeller declared {{the end of the}} alert; New Jersey and Connecticut also ended their alerts that day.|$|E

25|$|A {{possibility}} {{causing the}} variation is the Sahel, {{a strip of}} semi-arid land on the southern border of the Sahara.

25|$|In 1965, the Mariner 4 probe {{discovered}} that Mars had no global magnetic field {{that would protect}} the planet from potentially life-threatening cosmic radiation and solar radiation; observations made in the late 1990s by the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter confirmed this discovery.

25|$|The first {{bridge at}} the site was a brick {{suspension}} bridge opened on 25 February 1854. It was rebuilt as a multilayer bridge and opened with rail tracks on an upper truss level on 2 January 1879. In order to strengthen the railway, a new steel truss railway bridge opened on 9 May 1931. The former bridge was then rebuilt as a wider road bridge. An accident on 15 April 1940 caused the fire department to <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> one of the pillars, collapsing the superstructure. A new road bridge was completed in 1943. The two were supplemented with a separate pathway bridge in 1977. There are plans to replace the existing bridges with a four-land road and three-track railway bridge, scheduled for no later than 2030.|$|E
25|$|Four Kuznetsov NK-86 two-spool with five-stage LP compressors, six-stage HP compressors, annular {{combustor}} cans, single-stage HP turbine and two-stage LP turbine turbofan engines {{power the}} Il-86.

The forward-facing ejectors <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> detritus during taxi. International Standard Atmosphere hourly fuel consumption per engine is 7.7t (16,975lb) at maximum continuous rated thrust, 6t/13,230lb at nominal maximum thrust, 5.1t (11,243lb) at 85% thrust, 4.2t/9260lb at 70%, 3.6t (7,937lb) at 60%, 2.45t (5,400lb) at 40% and 1t (2,205lb) at idle. Overall hourly fuel consumption at long-range cruise and 190t (419,000lb) is 9.75t (21,495lb) reducing to 7.79t (17,174lb) at 140t (308,650lb). Outboard engine pylons on the latter two-thirds of all Il-86s are marginally extended to cut drag.|$|E
25|$|After a star {{passes through}} the {{asymptotic}} giant branch (AGB) phase, the short planetary nebula phase of stellar evolution begins as gases <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> from the central star at speeds of a few kilometers per second. The central star is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB. As the gases expand, the central star undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss. In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the central star is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse. During the first phase, the central star maintains constant luminosity, {{while at the same}} time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation to ionize the increasingly distant gas cloud. The star becomes a white dwarf, and the expanding gas cloud becomes invisible to us, ending the planetary nebula phase of evolution. For a typical planetary nebula, about 10,000years passes between its formation and recombination of the star.|$|E

500|$|By August 2006, {{the album}} has sold 290,000 copies in the United States. Reviewing 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters dubbed the album [...] "a unique record [...] It's as if they're {{stepping}} in {{to show the}} young bands {{how to do it}} right, as songs like 'Bitter Peace', 'Death's Head', and the terrific 'Stain of Mind' <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> anything that young pretenders have put out." [...] Writing in The Guardian, journalist Joel McIver said although the album was as musically heavy and lyrically dark as any of Slayer's previous releases, it exhibited the groove-based style of the then popular nu-metal sound.|$|E

Dave Meltzer gave commentary for the result in January 2016, describing Wrestle Kingdom 9 as [...] "the <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> show of" [...] 2015 and [...] "the peak show {{of the rise of}} New Japan Pro Wrestling from very low levels for much of the late 00s".|$|E

500|$|More than 80 soil types {{support a}} wide variety of flora within the monument. These soils stem from past and present {{geologic}} activity as well as ongoing additions of organic matter from life forms on or near the surface. Adapted to particular soil types and surface conditions, these plant communities range from riparian vegetation near the river to greasewood and saltgrass on the alluvial fans to plants such as hedgehog cactus in rocky outcrops at high elevation. Important to many of these communities is a black cryptobiotic crust that resists erosion, stores water, and fixes nitrogen used by the plants. The crust is composed of algae, lichens, mosses, fungi, and bacteria. Other areas of the monument have little or no flora. Volcanic tuffs and claystones that lack essential nutrients support few microorganisms and plants. Likewise, hard rock surfaces and steep slopes from which soils wash or <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> tend to remain bare.|$|E
500|$|After making Hard Boiled in Hong Kong, {{director}} John Woo {{decided to}} take an offer {{to work in the}} United States, where he would find himself happier as a filmmaker with a preferable work pace and working with more reasonable hours. Woo was first offered this job in the United States by Universal Pictures chairman Tom Pollock after he had seen Woo's film The Killer. Universal was not eager to have Woo direct an entire feature and only agreed after what producer James Jacks called a [...] "difficult period of convincing". Universal was worried about having an Asian director on set who had limited command of English on a large scale project. They hired American director Sam Raimi to oversee the film's production and to have him on standby if Woo was not able to fulfill his role as a director. Raimi was very excited to work with Woo as he was fan of his Hong Kong films. Raimi was also confident in Woo's directorial skills, stating that [...] "Woo at 70% is still going to <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> most American action directors working at 100%." ...|$|E

500|$|Pair {{instability}} supernovae {{occur when}} an oxygen core {{in an extremely}} massive star becomes hot enough that gamma rays spontaneously produce electron-positron pairs. [...] This causes the core to collapse, but where the collapse of an iron core causes endothermic fusion to heavier elements, the collapse of an oxygen core creates runaway exothermic fusion which completely unbinds the star. [...] The total energy emitted depends on the initial mass, {{with much of the}} core being converted to 56Ni and ejected which then powers the supernova for many months. [...] At the lower end stars of about [...] produce supernovae that are long-lived but otherwise typical, while the highest mass stars of around [...] produce supernovae that are extremely luminous and also very long lived; hypernovae. [...] More massive stars die by photodisintegration. [...] Only population III stars, with very low metallicity, can reach this stage. [...] Stars with more heavy elements are more opaque and <b>blow</b> <b>away</b> their outer layers until they are small enough to explode as a normal type Ib/c supernova. [...] It is thought that even in our own galaxy, mergers of old low metallicity stars may form massive stars capable of creating a pair instability supernova.|$|E
