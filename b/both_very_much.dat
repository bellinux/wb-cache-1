25|$|Beloved and Sethe are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> emotionally {{impaired}} as {{a result}} of Sethe’s previous enslavement. Slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child, which has devastating consequences for both parties. Furthermore, the earliest need a child has is related to the mother: the baby needs milk from the mother. Sethe is traumatized by the experience of having her milk stolen because it means she cannot form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter.|$|E
25|$|After the Grand Prix, it {{had already}} been decided to {{extensively}} redesign Silverstone's layout. Nearly every part of Silverstone (except Copse, Abbey and all of the straights, save the Farm Straight) was redesigned. The ultra-high speed Club and Stowe corners were made slower and a chicane was placed before Stowe. Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel were re-designed as very fast snaky esses that proved to be even more challenging than the original series of corners- the considerable amount of lateral g from side to side became the highlighted challenge of the new circuit. A new twisty infield section called Luffield was created in place of the Farm straight and the Bridge chicane. Despite these alterations, the Grand Prix and World Sportscar circuses <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> approved of the new layout; Silverstone was still fast, which is what it has always been known for.|$|E
60|$|We were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> out of breath. We {{spoke in}} panting, broken sentences.|$|E
50|$|Renfrow {{competed in}} two races in 1997 for the Turnage team. He was 32nd at Bristol and 24th at Richmond, <b>both</b> without <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to comment on. He did not finish either race.|$|R
60|$|That {{assurance}} {{and advice}} removed the last shadow of anxiety from Fan's mind, and after some more conversation they returned home, <b>both</b> feeling <b>very</b> <b>much</b> happier {{than when they}} had started for this eventful walk.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{sat down}} {{on one side of}} the sand-garden, and Nathan on the other, and both busied {{themselves}} in digging and building little houses. They <b>both</b> became <b>very</b> <b>much</b> interested, and sat some time very still, until, at length, Rollo looked around to see what Nathan might be doing.|$|R
60|$|As he said himself, and as {{many men}} found out rather to their surprise, there were two Burkes, <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> at your service.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear, hear," [...] cried Ogilvie; [...] "and I {{should like}} to know {{what is to be done}} with Brand and Anson, for they are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> down with fever of some sort this morning." ...|$|E
60|$|And this {{conversation}} was continued by Ralph and George when Bob {{was obliged to}} drive ahead, <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> excited about it, and both building air-castles {{on the strength of}} the idea, even until the weary horses trotted up the lane to the Kenniston farm-house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stepped {{out before}} {{breakfast in the}} snow! Impossible!' says the King, {{sticking}} his fork into a sausage. 'My dear, take one. Angelica, won't you have a saveloy?' The Princess took one, being very fond of them; and at this moment Glumboso entered with Captain Hedzoff, <b>both</b> looking <b>very</b> <b>much</b> disturbed.|$|R
5000|$|Race lepcha, Moore. The North-West Himalayan and Southern Indian race of M. malsara, closely {{resembling}} it in {{both the}} wet- and dry-season forms. It differs in having the transverse discal band crossing <b>both</b> wings <b>very</b> <b>much</b> narrower and not showing through {{at all on the}} upperside; the ocelli are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> smaller and more obsolescent. Underside in the dry-season form irrorated as in M. malsara with short, transverse, dark brown striae.|$|R
50|$|Dakor is {{connected}} through rail and road. Dakor is a {{station on the}} Anand-Godhra Broad Gauge rail line. Anand and Nadiad are around 30 km away and <b>both</b> are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> connected by rail and roads. Ahmedabad and Vadodara are about 90 km away and both cities are connected with rail, road and by air.|$|R
60|$|On our way upstairs, I {{called her}} {{attention}} to the sudden disappearance of Mrs. Crupp's pitfalls, and also to the prints of recent footsteps. We were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> surprised, coming higher up, to find my outer door standing open (which I had shut) and to hear voices inside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] he repeated, {{and then}} he laughed. [...] "You are not, Jane; and if you {{will return to the}} city of Opar and ask them who dwell there they will tell you that I was not dead a few short hours ago. No, dear, we are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{end of it}} was," [...] ses Alf, [...] "that you and Mrs. Pearce was <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> upset, as o' {{course you}} couldn't marry while 'er fust was alive, {{and the last thing}} I see afore I woke up was her boxes {{standing}} at the front door waiting for a cab." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{architecture}} of the stupa and the terracotta plaques bear great resemblance to the Somapura Mahavihara, Paharpur (Bangladesh) which, too, was founded by the same king Dharmapala. In plan <b>both</b> are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> alike with the significant difference that Somapura is centred on a central temple rather than a stupa. Vikramashila monastery is also larger and has fort-like projections on its outer wall.|$|R
6000|$|Madame Duchesne and Myra both uttered exclamations of pleasure. [...] "They {{are family}} jewels," [...] Myra said, [...] "and {{my father and}} mother <b>both</b> prize them <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> How strange they should have been on these men!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{very last}} concerts {{were held in}} October of 2016. Live Nation had for years been {{demanding}} too large of a cut on tickets, and it eventually got to be too much. This {{was on top of}} the payments made to the artists and crews, who the 25th anniversary movie says worked for free. <b>Both</b> things <b>very</b> <b>much</b> unbeknownst to the public, and The Bridge School continued to knowingly mislead fans.|$|R
6000|$|... "Queer thing altogether, sir," [...] Mr. Jarvis admitted; [...] "a queer business, sir. However, it's {{over and}} done with, and the less said about it, the better. We are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> obliged to you, Mr. Neville, for your kind offices, and I am only thankful that {{the results have been}} so satisfactory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} also, sir, {{and so does}} my wife. But to tell the truth, sir, we were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{attached}} to Sir Charles, and his death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall." ...|$|E
60|$|By no {{conceivable}} mental gymnastics {{could he}} {{think of the}} two as antagonists. Between them there was no imaginable issue. They had <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the same scientific disposition; with perhaps more dash and inspiration {{in the quality of}} Hugh; more docility and method in the case of Karl. Until war had smashed them one against the other....|$|E
50|$|Despite having early {{disputes}} with Hikaru, she slowly begins to harbor feelings {{for him as}} they share some adventures during the war, discovering <b>both</b> have <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in common. In the final episode, Hikaru realizes Misa {{is in love with}} him, and after the climactic final battle, they marry and become members of the SDF-2 Megaroad-01 crew to leave on a stellar exploration and colonization mission in 2012. Shortly thereafter, Misa and Hikaru have a daughter, Miku Ichijyo, who is born in space during 2013.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have hoped}} so, dear Miss Todd"--he {{had taken a}} moment to consider, and {{thought that he had}} better drop the Sarah {{altogether}} for the present. [...] "In myself, I can safely say that it has been so. With you, I feel that I am happy, and at my ease. Your modes of thought and way of life are all such as I admire and approve,"--Miss Todd again bowed--"and--and--what I mean is, that I think we <b>both</b> live <b>very</b> <b>much</b> after the same fashion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To hear is to obey," [...] {{answered}} {{the big red}} colonel, and caught the child by her arm. But at that moment Tiktok raised his dinner-pail and pounded it so forcibly against the colonel's head that the big officer sat down upon {{the floor with a}} sudden bump, looking <b>both</b> dazed and <b>very</b> <b>much</b> astonished.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} Jonas, [...] "you, Rollo, {{were playing}} here alone. Your little cousin {{came to see}} you; and you were very glad to have him come. He helped you build, and {{when he wanted to}} have the window in a particular way, you ought to have let him. To quarrel with a visitor for such a cause as that, was very ungentlemanly and unkind. So you see you were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to blame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I read Bessie's {{letter about}} a couple of hours ago, and I congratulate you <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> I think that you will have the sweetest and loveliest wife in South Africa, Captain Niel; and I think that Bessie will have a husband any woman might be proud of;" [...] and she half bowed and half curtseyed to him as she said it, with a graceful little air of dignity that was very taking.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry," [...] said Mrs. Drane, [...] "that I {{should appear}} to have been discourteous to one who had done us a service, for which, I assure you, we are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> obliged, but Dr. and Mrs. Tolbridge managed the whole affair of our removal from Mrs. Brinkly's house, and I did not suppose there was any one, besides them and ourselves, who would take the {{slightest}} interest in the matter." ...|$|E
60|$|The first milking {{lesson was}} a droll one; but after several scares and many vain attempts, Rose at last managed to fill her cup, while Ben held Clover's tail {{so that it}} could not flap, and Dr. Alec kept her from turning to stare at the new milkmaid, who objected to <b>both</b> these {{proceedings}} <b>very</b> <b>much.</b>|$|R
50|$|Her {{name and}} titles were {{revealed}} when her grandfather, King Carl XVI Gustaf, {{met with the}} cabinet on 26 February 2014. Her first name was chosen by her parents as one that they <b>both</b> liked <b>very</b> <b>much</b> after considering {{a very large number}} of other names. It has been used previously by four Swedish queens, but then only in full as Eleonora. Her middle names honour her great-grandaunt Princess Lilian, Duchess of Halland, and her paternal grandmother. Leonore was registered with the surname Bernadotte in the Swedish registry.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the walls}} two {{historical}} church buildings survive, <b>both</b> built <b>very</b> <b>much</b> more recently than the kremlin itself. The St. Nicholas Cathedral (Никольский собор), topped off with {{no fewer than}} five onion domes, was built in 1681, replacing an earlier timber structure. Nearby is the Church of the beheading of St John the Baptist (Церковь Иоанна Предтечи), architecturally very different, consecrated in 1821 and most recently rebuilt in 1901-1904. While the St. Nicholas Cathedral follows the traditional Russian style, the John the Baptist Church, with its single dome, follows neoclassical principals.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{indebted to}} you, sir, for your politeness in calling," [...] he said, with {{excessive}} civility of manner. [...] "But our stay {{at this place}} has drawn to an end. I only came here for the re-establishment of my daughter's health. She has benefited greatly by the change of air, and we have arranged to return home to-morrow. Otherwise, we should have gladly profited by your kind offer of tickets for the ball." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] ejaculated the Captain; then rising he {{carefully}} closed {{and locked the}} door before continuing the conversation. They were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> interested in it; but when it was at last over, and the Captain took his departure, Rosie did not bounce away as usual with tumbled hair and merry flushed face. She left the drawing-room looking pale and a little scared perhaps, {{and for the rest of}} the day was unusually silent and subdued.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{then said}} that he meant to try a very short {{pendulum}} indeed, and he asked Mary to tie one up for him, not more than an inch in length. She, however, {{said that it would}} not be necessary to tie it to the branch; but, instead of that, she took hold of the string of one of the pebbles which was already hanging before them, about an inch above the pebble itself, and then set the pebble in motion; and they were <b>both</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> interested in observing how quick it vibrated to and fro.|$|E
60|$|A {{long time}} ago there lived a king and queen who had no children, {{although}} they <b>both</b> wished <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for a little son. They tried not to let each other see how unhappy they were, and pretended to take pleasure in hunting and hawking {{and all sorts of}} other sports; but at length the king could bear it no longer, and declared that he must go and visit the furthest corners of his kingdom, {{and that it would be}} many months before he should return to his capital.|$|R
60|$|<b>Both</b> lads were <b>very</b> <b>much</b> disturbed, {{and with}} good reason. Arnold Baxter had been an enemy to Mr. Rover for years, and this meant a good deal when the desperate {{character}} of the man was taken into consideration. He was a well-educated fellow, but cruel and unprincipled to the last degree, and one who would hesitate at nothing {{in order to accomplish}} his purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{population}} of the Tehsil is more than 85000 persons. It was about 79000 according to 1998 census. The central town Koozkalai has an approximate {{population of}} 6500+ persons. Literacy rate in Martung is very low; less than 7% for male and less than 1% for female on the average. This figure is a little high for larger villages like Kabalgram, Koozkalai, Shaga, Karindara and Manzkalai. There was only one secondary school for boys in the area till 2006, and a few middle and primary schools for both boys and girls. Number of students and level of education <b>both</b> are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> below standards in all the educational institutes.http://www.shangla.net/papolation.html ...|$|R
