50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{characteristic of the}} southern birch mouse is the dark stripe {{down the center of}} the back, which is bordered by two narrow <b>bright</b> stripes on <b>both</b> <b>sides.</b> From head to rump it measures from 56 to 72 mm, with a tail from 110 to 130% of the main body length. The background fur color is gray-brown.|$|R
50|$|The foliage is {{produced}} in flattened sprays with scale-like leaves 2-15 mm long; they are arranged in opposite decussate pairs, with the successive pairs closely then distantly spaced, so forming apparent whorls of four; the facial pairs are flat, with the lateral pairs folded over their bases. The leaves are <b>bright</b> green on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the shoots with only inconspicuous stomata. The foliage, when crushed, gives off an aroma somewhat akin to shoe-polish.|$|R
5000|$|Calocedrus decurrens, California {{incense cedar}} (syn. Libocedrus decurrens), {{is native to}} western North America. It is a large tree, {{typically}} reaching heights of 40-60 m and a trunk diameter of up to 3 m (maxima, 69 m tall and 3.9 m diameter), and with a broad conic crown of spreading branches. The leaves are <b>bright</b> green on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the shoots, and the cones 2-2.5 cm long. It {{is by far the}} most widely known species in the genus, and is often simply called [...] "incense cedar" [...] without the regional qualifier.|$|R
40|$|Many {{organizations}} and users {{are working hard}} to secure themselves from the growing threats of computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and other malicious codes. Computer viruses attacks are problems created by men or women and they are problems that can also be controlled by men or women. In the end, it is basically a war between virus writers and virus fighters. There are <b>bright</b> minds on <b>both</b> <b>sides,</b> and it looks like this fight is not going to end. This research intends to find the pattern of computer viruses attacks and perform a prediction on the next occurrence of virus. Other than that, this research also will propose a new way to cure from computer viruses attacks. The findings of this research are hope be able to shed some light for all of us...|$|R
40|$|On a Seasat image (23. 5 -cm wavelength) of the Durmid Hills in {{southern}} California, the San Andreas fault is {{expressed as a}} prominent southeast-trending tonal lineament that is bright on the southwest side and dark on the northeast side. Field investigation established that the bright signature corresponds to outcrops of the Borrego Formation, which weathers to a rough surface. The dark signature corresponds to sand and silt deposits of Lake Coahuila which are smooth at the wavelength of the Seasat radar. These signatures and field characteristics agree with calculations of the smooth and rough radar criteria. On Landsat and Skylab images of the Durmid Hills, the Borrego and Lake Coahuila surfaces have similar bright tones and the San Andreas fault is not detectable. On a side-looking airborne radar image (0. 86 -cm wavelength), both the Borrego and Lake Coahuila surfaces appear rough, which results in <b>bright</b> signatures on <b>both</b> <b>sides</b> of the San Andreas fault. Because of this lack of roughness contrast, the fault cannot be distinguished. The wavelength of the Seasat radar system is well suited for mapping geologic features in the Durmid Hills that are obscure on other remote sensing images...|$|R
