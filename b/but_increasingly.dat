5|$|As {{a working-class}} woman, Anning was an {{outsider}} {{to the scientific}} community. At the time in Britain women {{were not allowed to}} vote, hold public office, or attend university. The newly formed, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> influential Geological Society of London did not allow women to become members, or even to attend meetings as guests. The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, and work in the newly opening factories.|$|E
5|$|Kenilworth {{remained}} a ruin during the 18th and 19th centuries, still {{used as a}} farm <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> also popular as a tourist attraction. The first guidebook to the castle, A Concise history and description of Kenilworth Castle, was printed in 1777 with many later editions following in the coming decades.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' {{applies to}} animals and all life forms. This precept isn't {{found in the}} oldest verses of Vedas, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> becomes {{one of the central}} ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD. In the oldest texts, {{numerous}} ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{influence}} of Frederick II and Christian IV, both {{of whom had been}} inspired by the castles of France, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style. In parallel, the half-timbered style became popular for ordinary dwellings in towns and villages across the country.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
5|$|Commerce {{continued}} to be {{an essential part of}} the economy of early Pittsburgh, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly,</b> manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.|$|E

5|$|Many {{insects are}} {{considered}} pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include {{those that are}} parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce insecticides, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> rely on methods of biological pest control, or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered {{a key element of}} integrated pest management.|$|E
5|$|Niven lived much of {{his life}} in the United States, {{although}} upon the outbreak of the Second World War, he returned to Britain to fight, and was re-commissioned as a lieutenant in the Highland Light Infantry. At {{the end of the war}} he returned to the US and continued his film work, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> appeared on American radio and television channels, and later on their British counterparts. In the latter medium he appeared frequently in the Four Star Playhouse series, as well as producing some editions. For his roles in both television and on film, Niven was honoured with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He died in 1983 from a virulent form of motor neurone disease at the age of 73.|$|E
5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important. In the early 1990s this led him into a debate with Derek Briggs, who had begun to apply quantitative cladistic techniques to the Burgess Shale fossils, about the methods to be used in interpreting these fossils. Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method of classification in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
50|$|Purpurocardia purpurata is {{a marine}} bivalve mollusc {{in the family}} Carditidae. Its genus was long {{included}} in Venericardia, <b>but</b> is <b>increasingly</b> treated as distinct.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the type}} genus of {{subfamily}} Venericardiinae. The closely related Purpurocardia was for long included here as a subgenus, <b>but</b> is <b>increasingly</b> considered distinct.|$|R
25|$|The ancestry {{of living}} organisms has {{traditionally}} been reconstructed from morphology, <b>but</b> is <b>increasingly</b> supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence.|$|R
5|$|Since the Turtle’s {{emergence}} {{over two}} centuries ago, the international playing field has leveled. The monopoly over submersible technology once {{held by the}} United States was lost over time as other navies around the world modernized and adopted submarine warfare. From the innovations of John Holland {{in the early twentieth}} century to the German U-boat campaigns of the World Wars, and the nuclear-powered ICBM submarines of the Cold War, modern navies embraced the submarine, first, for missions of reconnaissance and commerce-raiding, <b>but,</b> <b>increasingly,</b> in offensive, attack roles. In the postwar era, the submarine has become a central component of modern navies. Submarine usage has gone far beyond Bushnell’s conception of lifting naval blockades designed to bleed a country dry of their imports to become an essential arm of offensive naval warfare and power projection.|$|E

25|$|Merriman, who Molteno had {{appointed}} {{to oversee the}} Cape's war effort, initially worked hard to cooperate with Frere, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> came to share Molteno's views on the ineptitude and injustice of British imperial policy in southern Africa.|$|E
25|$|In the Postbellum era (1865–1877), York {{remained}} a regional center for local agriculture, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{became an important}} industrial center, with such industries as steam engines, railroad manufacturing, and papermaking coming to the forefront. York also features some unique architecture ranging from colonial era buildings to large gothic churches.|$|E
25|$|Denmark's {{architecture}} became {{firmly established}} in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style.|$|E

25|$|After Le Grand Macabre, Ligeti would {{abandon the}} use of pastiche, <b>but</b> would <b>increasingly</b> {{incorporate}} consonant harmonies (even major and minor triads) into his work, albeit not in a diatonic context.|$|R
50|$|For these reasons, LASNEX is {{somewhat}} controversial in the ICF field. More accurately, LASNEX generally predicted a device's low-energy behaviour quite closely, <b>but</b> becomes <b>increasingly</b> inaccurate as the energy levels are increased.|$|R
25|$|The HDMI {{interface}} is {{a compact}} audio/video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed/uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant device to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device. It is mainly {{used in the}} consumer area, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> used in professional devices including uncompressed video, often called clean HDMI.|$|E
25|$|The {{images on}} coins {{initially}} changed rapidly, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> each community {{settled on a}} single image or set of images. Some of these were the symbol or image of an important deity in the city or visual puns on the city's name, {{but in many cases}} their meaning is obscure and may not have been chosen for any special reason.|$|E
25|$|West Ealing follows, {{which is}} very similar to Acton – it is also a large {{residential}} district and has a very similar stretch of shops concentrated on the Uxbridge Road. West Ealing has a few more retail outlets similar to those in Ealing Broadway, <b>but</b> <b>increasingly</b> since the 1990s, it has begun to differ from Ealing Broadway in the types of shops that it offers.|$|E
