25|$|New Westminster {{soon had}} an {{opportunity}} to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Captain Moore, when the bitterly cold winter of 1861-62 froze the Fraser River from Lulu Island to Hope and isolated New Westminster from December until March 12, when Moore used the Flying Dutchman paddlewheel first and spent three days smashing a passage through the ice so supplies could be delivered to the little community.|$|E

Though proud to have helped pass the Reform Bill, Macaulay never ceased to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> his former patron, Lansdowne, who remained a great friend and political ally.|$|E

500|$|Elgar {{was another}} {{composer}} who had cause to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted {{it at the}} Queen's Hall in March 1920 to [...] "great applause" [...] and [...] "frantic enthusiasm", the composer wrote to him: [...] "With the sounds ringing in my ears I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym.... I feel that my reputation {{in the future is}} safe in your hands." [...] Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought [...] "the grandeur and nobility of the work" [...] to wider public attention.|$|E
500|$|This is a {{farewell}} {{to love and}} life, [...] "an anguished lament and grief built around the words 'muoio disperato' (I die in despair)". Puccini insisted on the inclusion of these words, and later stated that admirers of the aria had treble cause to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> him: for composing the music, for having the lyrics written, and [...] "for declining expert advice to throw the result in the waste-paper basket". The lovers' final duet [...] "Amaro sol per te", which concludes with the act's opening horn music, did not equate with Ricordi's idea of a transcendental love duet {{which would be a}} fitting climax to the opera. Puccini justified his musical treatment by citing Tosca's preoccupation with teaching Cavaradossi to feign death.|$|E

500|$|The Mercer-Roosevelt affair became wider public {{knowledge}} in 1966, when revealed in [...] "The Time Between the Wars", {{a memoir of}} the decades 1920s and 1930s, written by Jonathan W. Daniels, (1902-1981), a former Roosevelt aide from 1943 to 1945. When {{the news of the}} memoir's contents broke, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr., (1914-1988), said that he had no knowledge of an affair between Rutherfurd and his father, while Rutherfurd's daughter Barbara flatly denied that any such romance had occurred. Well-known historian/author Arthur Schlesinger Jr., (1917-2007), stated of the affair that if Rutherfurd [...] "in any way helped Franklin Roosevelt sustain the frightful burdens of leadership in the second world war, the nation has good reason to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> her".|$|E
500|$|After the Hiroshima bombing, Truman {{issued a}} {{statement}} announcing {{the use of the}} new weapon. He stated, [...] "We may <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Providence" [...] that the German atomic bomb project had failed, and that the United States and its allies had [...] "spent two billion dollars on the greatest scientific gamble in history—and won". Truman then warned Japan: [...] "If they do not now accept our terms, they may expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth. Behind this air attack will follow sea and land forces in such numbers and power as they have not yet seen and with the fighting skill of which they are already well aware." [...] This was a widely broadcast speech picked up by Japanese news agencies.|$|E
500|$|Maurice Richardson, of The Observer, {{considered}} the novel [...] "the usual sado-masochistic free-for-all, plus octopuses". The unnamed critic in The Manchester Guardian referred to Johnson's [...] "sex, snobbery and sadism" [...] complaint. They highlighted the [...] "sinister... cult of luxury {{for its own}} sake", with Bond's enjoyment of branded and bespoke products, but disagreed with part of Johnson's summary that the novel {{was a sign of}} moral decay; rather, [...] "we should <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Fleming for providing a conveniently accessible safety-valve for the boiling sensibility of modern man." [...] This reviewer also conceded that while [...] "the casualties take place on a somewhat narrower front than usual, they are heavy". In April 1958, Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work, referring to both that paper's review of Dr. No and the article in The Twentieth Century. Fleming partly accepted the criticism concerning the exclusivity of Bond's objects, such as cigarettes and food, but defended it on the basis that [...] "I had to fit Bond out with some theatrical props". These included his cocktail, ("The Vesper") and Bond's diet. Fleming called these devices [...] "vulgar foibles" [...] which he was saddled with, although maybe, he suggested, [...] "Bond's luxury meals are simply saying 'no' to toad-in-the-hole and tele-bickies." ...|$|E

A reviewer from Rap-Up said, [...] "Kelly Rowland turns her tears into art in the eye-popping video for 'Rose Colored Glasses'..." [...] They focused on the choice of visuals, saying that [...] "the clip shows the Destiny's Child alum struggling with a relationship, while numerous wardrobe changes, vivid colors, doves, and stunning shots of Kelly burst onto the screen." [...] Liz Goodwin of Gather.com agreed with the visuals, saying, [...] "In the music video, Kelly Rowland's body is looking fantastic. (Though she could switch up the weave for another hairstyle.) The outfits are hot– she’s looking fit! Kudos to Kelly for pulling off the very, very low-cut corset without falling out of it! She can <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> gravity for still being on her side...and for double-sided tape." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator said, [...] "We hope two things happen now that Kelly Rowland’s Rankin-directed 'Rose Colored Glasses' music video has premiered: 1.) you like it and show Miss Kelly some love on iTunes, and 2.) radio programmers in this fine country open their ears and show Miss Kelly major love on the airwaves...Kelly looks truly stunning in this video, from the opening shot of her wearing a dress shirt and tie to the couture dresses she vamps in expertly." ...|$|E
500|$|Messenger {{points out}} that Rommel had many reasons to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Hitler, {{including}} his interference to arrange for him to receive command of an armoured division, his elevation {{to the status of}} a national hero, and continued interest and support from the dictator. Remy states that the attachment to Hitler went much deeper than any gratefulness could explain, and that Hitler had become Rommel's source of motivation. Some, like Randall Hansen, highlight the similarities in background and personality that facilitated the rapport between the two, while others, like Richard Overy, state that Rommel's main appeal to Hitler was that he was everything Hitler was not, while the political scientist Roland Detsch, in a review of Maurice Remy's book, comments that despite Remy's efforts, the strange relationship remains hard to understand. Wolfram Pyta remarks that Hitler did not compete with Rommel for the war leader image because the two complemented each other perfectly. They were similar {{in the sense that they}} were the only ones with a cultural presence and objects around whom German society's grand narrative was being built, thus Rommel was the only German general who would have been capable of challenging Hitler's rule, had he ever crossed the Rubicon from his [...] "apolitical-to-the-core" [...] military world and developed a serious, critical view of Hitler's political dealings. However, Rommel himself had fallen for Hitler's charisma almost until the end.|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to Slay Tracks by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover {{is different from the}} original in that the line [...] "that I had to {{get the fuck out of}} this town" [...] was changed to [...] "that I had to get right out of this town". The [...] "Box Elder" [...] cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered [...] "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." [...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> them for that." ...|$|E
