Using stator-flux oriented vector control, the double-fed induction gained a high dynamic performance when the stator side was controlled operating in a unite power factor condition. In this paper a novel simplified space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) method was proposed to simplify the calculation.

The IC 50 values determined with voltage-clamp pulses to 0 mV were 4. 6 M and 57 M for quinidine and quinine, respectively. Block of HERG by quinidine (and its iso-mer quinine) was enhanced by progressive membrane depo-larization and accompanied by a negative shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation.

40|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem for}} Aircraft Manufacturers {{has been the}} difficulty in carrying out accurate and robust simulations of the complete aircraft power network, while including numerous models {{from a variety of}} individual equipment suppliers. Often the models are of variable or low quality, with ill-defined parameters or behavior, and in many cases of the wrong level of abstraction to be appropriate for large scale network simulations. In addition, individual equipment suppliers often provide poor models for network integration, with a common issue being low robustness of models leading to lack of convergence, excessive simulation times and delays in development due to the need for rework and extensive testing of these models. In order to address this specific issue a complete library of power electronic system models for Aerospace applications has been developed that encompasses the range of functions from elementary components (passives, devices, switches and magnetic components), intermediate building <b>blocks</b> (<b>rectifiers,</b> inverters, motors, protection devices) and finally complete system models (variable frequency starter generators, power converters, battery and storage elements, transformers). These models have been developed in partnership with several key aircraft equipment suppliers and in partnership with Airbus to ensure that the resulting models are complete and robust. Specific equipment models were also developed in this library including permanent magnet generators, synchronous machines, environmental control systems, wing ice protection systems, power electronic modules and advanced power protection systems. The specific models have been validated against reference and measured data to ensure that they are consistent and accurate. This paper will describe the techniques used to achieve more robust models, using model based engineering, the integration of specific equipment models into the complete aircraft network and the validation of the behavior against measured results. The paper will provide the results of a complete aircraft power network highlighting how the individual models are integrated into the overall network model and the inherent robustness ensure effective, accurate and robust simulations...|$|R

40|$|Inward {{rectification}} {{induced by}} mono- and diaminoalkane application to inside-out membrane patches was studied in Kir 2. 1 (IRK 1) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both monoamines and diamines block Kir 2. 1 channels, with potency increasing as the alkyl chain length increases (from 2 to 12 methylene groups), indicating a strong hydrophobic {{interaction with the}} blocking site. For diamines, but not monoamines, increasing the alkyl chain also increases the steepness of the voltage dependence, at any concentration, from a limiting minimal value of ∼ 1. 5 (n = 2 methylene groups) to ∼ 4 (n = 10 methylene groups). These observations lead us to hypothesize that monoamines and diamines <b>block</b> inward <b>rectifier</b> K+ channels by entering deeply into a long, narrow pore, displacing K+ ions {{to the outside of}} the membrane, with this displacement of K+ ions contributing to “extra” charge movement. All monoamines are proposed to lie with the “head” amine at a fixed position in the pore, determined by electrostatic interaction, so that zδ is independent of monoamine alkyl chain length. The head amine of diamines is proposed to lie progressively further into the pore as alkyl chain length increases, thus displacing more K+ ions to the outside, resulting in charge movement (zδ) increasing with the increase in alkyl chain length...|$|R

The dissociated neurons were transferred into a recording chamber mounted on an inverted microscope and potassium currents were recorded by standard patch-clamp techniques under voltage-clamp modes. Results: Norepinephrine inhibited the whole potassium currents of the medial vestibular nuclear neurons. Outward potassium currents were more suppressed in 4 mM 4 -aminopyridine and norepinephrine added solutions than 4 mM 4 -aminopyridine only, but were not suppressed in 10 mM tetraethylammonium and norepinephrine added solutions compared to 10 mM tetraethylammonium only.

40|$|Venoms {{from five}} Old World and two New World {{scorpions}} were tested {{for their ability}} to block various K channels in rat brain synaptosomes.

The venoms from the Old World scorpions all blocked the A-type K channel but not the delayed rectifier K channel; only venom from the Israeli scorpion, Leiurus quinqestriatus hebraeus (Lqh), blocked the Ca 2 -activated K channel.

40|$|Atrial and {{ventricular}} tachyarrhythmias can be perpetuated by up-regulation of inward rectifier potassium channels. Thus, it may {{be beneficial}} to <b>block</b> inward <b>rectifier</b> channels under conditions in which their function becomes arrhythmogenic (e. g., inherited gain-of-function mutation channelopathies, ischemia, and chronic and vagally mediated atrial fibrillation). We hypothesize that the antimalarial quinoline chloroquine exerts potent antiarrhythmic effects by interacting with the cytoplasmic domains of Kir 2. 1 (IK 1), Kir 3. 1 (IKACh), or Kir 6. 2 (IKATP) and reducing inward rectifier potassium currents. In isolated hearts of three different mammalian species, intracoronary chloroquine perfusion reduced fibrillatory frequency (atrial or ventricular), and effectively terminated the arrhythmia with resumption of sinus rhythm. In patch-clamp experiments chloroquine blocked IK 1, IKACh, and IKATP. Comparative molecular modeling and ligand docking of chloroquine in the intracellular domains of Kir 2. 1, Kir 3. 1, and Kir 6. 2 suggested that chloroquine blocks or reduces potassium flow by interacting with negatively charged amino acids facing the ion permeation vestibule of the channel in question. These results open a novel path toward discovering antiarrhythmic pharmacophores that target specific residues of the cytoplasmic domain of inward rectifier potassium channels. —Noujaim, S.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. Proarrhythmic {{effects have}} been {{observed}} with the selective histamine 1 (H 1) receptor antagonist drug astemizole, a widely prescribed antihistamine. The metabolites of astemizole {{and those of other}} antihistamine compounds have not been implicated as causative agents of cardiac arrhythmias. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether desmethylastemizole, the principal metabolite of astemizole, <b>blocks</b> delayed <b>rectifier</b> potassium (K+) channels. Background. QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes are associated with astemizole intake and have been ascribed to block the repolarizing K+ currents, specifically the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier iKr. Astemizole undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, and its dominant metabolite, desmethylastemizole, has a markedly prolonged elimination time. We report the clinical observation of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes in a patient with undetectable serum concentrations of astemizole (< 0. 5 ng/ml) and “therapeutic” concentrations of desmethylastemizole (up to 7. 7 ng/ml or 17. 3 nmol/liter). Methods. The perforated patch clamp recording technique was used to study the effects of desmethylastemizole (20 nmol/liter) on action potentials and iKr in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. Results. Desmethylastemizole produced action potential prolongation and the induction of plateau early afterdepolarizations. Under voltage clamp conditions, desmethylastemizole suppressed iKr amplitude by ≈ 65 %. The drug E- 4031 (100 nmol/liter), which selectively blocks iKr, had a similar effect on current amplitude. Conclusions. Desmethylastemizole, the major astemizole metabolite, blocks the repolarizing K+ current iKr with high affinity. The clinical observation of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes found with astemizole intake may principally be caused by the proarrhythmic effects of its metabolite desmethylastemizole...|$|R
40|$|Dopamine D 2 receptors signal {{through the}} {{pertussis}} toxin (PTX) -sensitive Gi/o and PTX-insensitive Gz proteins, {{as well as}} through a G protein-independent, β-arrestin/glycogen synthase kinase- 3 -dependent pathway. Activation of these receptors in pituitary lactotrophs leads to inhibition of prolactin (PRL) release. It has been suggested that this inhibition occurs through the Gi/o-α protein-mediated inhibition of cAMP production and/or Gi/o-βγ dimer-mediated activation of inward rectifier K+ channels and inhibition of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. Here we show that the dopamine agonist-induced inhibition of spontaneous Ca 2 + influx and release of prestored PRL was preserved when cAMP levels were elevated by forskolin treatment. We further observed that dopamine agonists inhibited both spontaneous and depolarization-induced Ca 2 + influx in untreated but not in PTX-treated cells. This inhibition was also observed in cells with <b>blocked</b> inward <b>rectifier</b> K+ channels, suggesting that the dopamine effect on voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel gating is sufficient to inhibit spontaneous Ca 2 + influx. However, agonist-induced inhibition of PRL release was only partially relieved in PTX-treated cells, indicating that dopamine receptors also inhibit exocytosis downstream of voltage-gated Ca 2 + influx. The PTX-insensitive step in agonist-induced inhibition of PRL release was not affected by the addition of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, and lithium, an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase- 3, but was attenuated in the presence of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, which inhibits Gz signaling pathway in a protein kinase C-dependent manner. Thus, dopamine inhibits basal PRL release by blocking voltage-gated Ca 2 + influx through the PTX-sensitive signaling pathway and by desensitizing Ca 2 + secretion coupling through the PTX-insensitive and protein kinase C-sensitive signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|Whole {{cell and}} single channel patch clamp {{recording}} {{were used to}} study the properties of two types of voltage gated potassium channels in rat neurons. Neurons were dissociated from either the locus coeruleus or hippocampus of neonatal rats and grown in primary cell culture for 6 to 17 days before recording. Cultured neurons from both these brain areas were found to express whole cell A-currents and delayed rectifier currents, similar to those seen in other neurons. The conductance of single A-current channels in locus coeruleus neurons was 14. 8 pS, although this declined at positive membrane potentials. This reduction in unitary amplitude was shown {{to be due to}} voltage dependent block of the channel by intracellular magnesium and sodium ions. The Kd values of the blocking reactions at 0 mV membrane potential were 15. 7 mM for magnesium and 76. 0 mM for sodium, the Kd of each block decreasing with increasing membrane depolarisation. The conductance of single delayed rectifier channels in hippocampal neurons was 18. 4 pS. Gating of this channel could be explained by a model in which the channel had one open state, four closed states and three inactivated states. This scheme was not consistent with a Hodgkin-Huxley model of voltage dependent gating, but instead favoured a model whereby gating occurred in a cooperative manner. Gating could be altered by changing the permeant ion from potassium to the less permeable rubidium; this had the effect of specifically slowing all channel closing rate constants. The rubidium permeability of this channel was 75 % of the potassium permeability. External tetraethyl ammonium ions <b>blocked</b> delayed <b>rectifier</b> channels at two independent sites, each block having different kinetic properties.

A-type currents {{have not been}} reported {{to occur in the}} phasic muscles of the stomach. We used conventional voltage-clamp techniques to identify and characterize A-type currents in myocytes isolated from the murine antrum. A-type currents were robust in these cells, with peak current densities averaging 30 pA pF− 1 at 0 mV. These currents underwent rapid inactivation with a time constant of 83 ms at 0 mV. Recovery from inactivation at − 80 mV was rapid, with a time constant of 252 ms. The A-type current was blocked by 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) and was inhibited by flecainide, with an IC 50 of 35 μM. The voltage for half-activation was − 26 mV, while the voltage of half-inactivation was − 65 mV. There was significant activation and incomplete inactivation at potentials positive to − 60 mV, which is suggestive of sustained current availability in this voltage range. Under current-clamp conditions, exposure to 4 -AP or flecainide depolarized the membrane potential by 7 - 10 mV. In intact antral tissue preparations, flecainide depolarized the membrane potential between slow waves by 5 mV; changes in slow waves were not evident. The effect of flecainide was not abolished by inhibiting enteric neurotransmission or by <b>blocking</b> delayed <b>rectifier</b> and ATP-sensitive K+ currents. Transcripts encoding Kv 4 channels were detected in isolated antral myocytes by RT-PCR. Immunocytochemistry revealed intense Kv 4. 2 - and Kv 4. 3 -like immunoreactivity in antral myocytes. These data suggest that the A-type current in murine antral smooth muscle cells is likely to be due to Kv 4 channels.

We have generated transgenic long QT syndromes type 1 (LQT 1) and type 2 (LQT 2) rabbits that lack slow delayed rectifier K+ currents (IKs) or rapidly activating K+ currents (IKr) and used them as a model system to detect the channel-blocking properties of anesthetic agents. Therefore, LQT 1, LQT 2, and littermate control (LMC) rabbits were administered isoflurane, thiopental, midazolam, propofol, or ketamine, and surface ECGs were analyzed. Genotype-specific heart rate correction formulas {{were used to determine}} the expected QT interval at a given heart rate. The QT index (QTi) was calculated as percentage of the observed QT/expected QT. Isoflurane, a drug that blocks IKs, prolonged the QTi only in LQT 2 and LMC but not in LQT 1 rabbits. Midazolam, which <b>blocks</b> inward <b>rectifier</b> K+ current (IK 1), prolonged the QTi in both LQT 1 and LQT 2 but not in LMC. Thiopental, which blocks both IKs and IK 1, increased the QTi in LQT 2 and LMC more than in LQT 1. By contrast, ketamine, which does not block IKr, IKs, or IK 1, did not alter the QTi in any group. Finally, anesthesia with isoflurane or propofol resulted in lethal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (pVT) in three out of nine LQT 2 rabbits. Transgenic LQT 1 and LQT 2 rabbits could serve as an in vivo model in which to examine the pharmacogenomics of drug-induced QT prolongation of anesthetic agents and their proarrhythmic potential.

Block by phenylalkylamines added to the bath resembles state-dependent block of squid K § channels by internally applied quarternary ammonium ions (Armstrong, C. M. 1971.

Slow recovery from block is attributed {{to the existence of}} a blocked-inactivated state, because recovery was faster in three situations where recovery from inactivation is faster: (a) at high [K+]o, (b) at more negative potentials, and (c) in cells with type l K + channels, which recover rapidly from inactivation. The block rate was used as a bioassay to reveal the effective concentration of drug at the block site. When external pH, pHo, was varied, block was much faster at pHo 10 than pHo 7. 4, and very slow at pHo 4. 5.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mechanism}} by which 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) <b>blocks</b> the delayed <b>rectifier</b> type potassium (K+) channels present on lipopolysaccharide-activated murine B lymphocytes was investigated using whole-cell and single channel patchclamp recordings. 4 -AP (1 p,M- 5 mM) was superfused for 3 - 4 min before applying depolarizing pulses to activate the channel. During the first pulse after application of 4 -AP above 50 p,M, the current inactivated faster, {{as compared with the}} control, but its peak was only reduced at high concentrations of 4 -AP (K d = 3. 1 mM). During subsequent pulses, the peak current was decreased (K d = 120 p,M), but the inactivation rate was slower than in the control, a feature that could be explained by a slow unblocking process. After washing out the drug, the current elicited by the first voltage step was still markedly reduced, as compared with the control one, and displayed very slow activation and inactivation kinetics; this suggests that the K + channels move from a blocked to an unblocked state slowly during the depolarizing pulse.

Mechanical responses of the muscle, end-plate potentials and miniature end-plate potentials, and extracellularly recorded nerve ending currents were recorded. In the mouse diaphragm nerve-muscle preparations, neostigmine 1 mumol litre- 1 continued to produce some antagonism of tubocurarine-induced block after cholinesterase had been inactivated completely by diisopropyl fluorophosphate 22 mumol litre- 1. In the mouse triangularis sterni preparation, neostigmine 0. 1 - 1 mumol litre- 1 increased the quantal content of the end-plate potential in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect appeared to be sufficient {{to account for the}} cholinesterase-independent antagonistic action to tubocurarine under the conditions of the experiments. Neostigmine 1 - 100 mumol litre- 1 depressed the amplitude of the K+ currents of the perineural waveforms in a concentration-dependent manner, and this may account for its ability to increase the quantal content of the end-plate potential. Although inhibition of acetyl-cholinesterase is the main mechanism of action of neostigmine, the drug also exerts an additional direct action on motor nerve endings to <b>block</b> the delayed <b>rectifier</b> K+ channels and enhance transmitter release.

In the present study we investigated the potency of clofilium and its tertiary analog LY 97241 to inhibit K+ channels, encoded by the human ether-a-go-gorelated gene (HERG). Clofilium blocked HERG channels in a voltage-dependent fashion with an IC 50 of 250 nM and 150 nM at 0 and + 40 mV, respectively. LY 97241 was almost 10 -fold more potent (IC 50 of 19 nM at + 40 mV). Other cloned K+ channels which are also expressed in cardiac tissue, Kv 1. 1, Kv 1. 2, Kv 1. 4, Kv 1. 5, Kv 4. 2, Kir 2. 1, or KKs, were not affected by 100 -fold higher concentrations. Block of HERG channels by LY 97241 was voltage dependent {{and the rate of}} HERG inactivation was increased by LY 97241. A rise of [K+] 0 decreased both, rate of HERG inactivation and LY 97241 affinity. The HERG S 631 A and S 620 T mutant channels which have a strongly reduced degree of inactivation were 7 -fold and 33 -fold less sensitive to LY 97241 blockade, indicating that LY 97241 binding is affected by HERG channel inactivation. In summary, the antiarrhythmic action of clofilium and its analog LY 97241 appears to be caused by their potent, but distinct ability for blocking HERG channels...|$|R
40|$|Basal {{dendrites}} of prefrontal cortical neurons receive strong synaptic {{drive from}} recurrent excitatory synaptic inputs. Synaptic integration within basal dendrites is therefore {{likely to play}} an important role in cortical information processing. Both synaptic integration and synaptic plasticity depend crucially on dendritic membrane excitability and the backpropagation of action potentials. We carried out multisite voltage-sensitive dye imaging of membrane potential transients from thin basal branches of prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons before and after application of channel blockers. We found that backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) are predominantly controlled by voltage-gated sodium and A-type potassium channels. In contrast, pharmacologically <b>blocking</b> the delayed <b>rectifier</b> potassium, voltage-gated calcium, or Ih conductance had little effect on dendritic AP propagation. Optically recorded bAP waveforms were quantified and multicompartmental modeling was used to link the observed behavior with the underlying biophysical properties. The best-fit model included a nonuniform sodium channel distribution with decreasing conductance with distance from the soma, together with a nonuniform (increasing) A-type potassium conductance. AP amplitudes decline with distance in this model, but to a lesser extent than previously thought. We used this model to explore the mechanisms underlying two sets of published data involving high-frequency trains of APs and the local generation of sodium spikelets. We also explored the conditions under which IA down-regulation would produce branch strength potentiation in the proposed model.

Patch clamp, short-circuit current, and electronic cell sizing techniques were used to investigate {{the role of the}} outward rectifier in transepithelial chloride secretion and cell volume regulation, the two main functions that have been proposed for this channel in epithelia. Patch clamp studies of the human cell lines PANC- 1 and T$ sb{ 84 }$ showed that the chloride channel blockers IAA- 94 and NPPB decrease the open probability of the outward rectifier, with half-maximal inhibition at 15 $ mu$M and 23 $ mu$M, respectively. At these concentrations the blockers did not affect cAMP-induced short-circuit current. They did inhibit the regulatory volume decrease (RVD) which occurs after hypotonic cell swelling, but only at much higher concentrations. Moreover, the commonly-used inhibitor DIDS, which <b>blocks</b> the outward <b>rectifier</b> in the 10 - 20 $ mu$M range, had no effect on the RVD when tested at 100 $ mu$M.

Besides a quickly activating delayed rectifier channel and a HERG-like channel, a slowly activating potassium channel with biophysical properties {{identical to those}} of rat eag (r-eag) channels was detected, here referred to as h-eag. h-eag shows a marked Cole–Moore shift, i. e. the activation kinetics become very slow when the depolarization starts from a very negative holding potential. In addition, extracellular Mg 2 + and Ni 2 + strongly slow down activation. Application of acetylcholine induces a fast block of the current when recorded in the perforated patch mode. This block is presumably mediated by Ca 2 +, as about 1 μm intracellular Ca 2 + completely abolished h-eag outward current. When cells were grown {{in the presence of}} 10 μm retinoic acid in order to synchronize the cell line in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, h-eag current was reduced to less than 5 % of the control value, while the delayed rectifier channel was expressed more abundantly.

Acute application of 10 μm retinoic acid <b>blocked</b> the delayed <b>rectifier</b> channel but enhanced the h-eag current.

[...] Acute poisoning can be fatal, leading to cardiovascular collapse and death in 2-18 hours, and in general is treated using a symptomatic and supportive approach. Diagnosis of toxicity is based on history and clinical presentation, and in general specific levels are not useful. Several levels of evidence strongly indicate diphenhydramine (similar to chlorpheniramine [...] ) can <b>block</b> the delayed <b>rectifier</b> potassium channel and, as a consequence, prolong the QT interval, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.No specific antidote for diphenhydramine toxicity is known, but the anticholinergic syndrome has been treated with physostigmine for severe delirium or tachycardia. Benzodiazepines may be administered to decrease the likelihood of psychosis, agitation, and seizures in patients who are prone to these symptoms.|$|R
40|$|Haloperidol, a first-generation an-tipsychotic, {{has been}} {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of inten-sive care unit (ICU) delirium. 1 In an at-tempt to use effective, and potentially safer agents, clinicians have increasingly ordered second-generation antipsy-chotics (SGAs) for managing ICU deliri-um. However, only olanzapine, quetiap-ine, and ziprasidone have been studied for ICU delirium in a prospective, ran-domized controlled manner. 2 - 4 Other SGAs with literature supporting their use for delirium include aripiprazole and risperidone. However, these data involve only non-ICU populations. 5 - 17 Antipsychotics primarily exert their action through dopamine antagonism. Examples of adverse effects related to this mechanism include drug-induced movement disorders and neuroleptic ma-lignant syndrome. These types of ad-verse events {{are less likely to be}} caused by SGAs than by haloperidol. 18 Proper-ties of SGAs that may account for a low-er adverse effect burden include sero-tonin 5 -HT 2 A antagonism, faster dissociation from the dopamine D 2 receptor, and/or lower D 2 receptor occupan-cy. 19, 20 An additional adverse effect of many antipsychotics is prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval. A medi-cation’s ability to cause QTc interval prolongation is likely related to the degree to which it <b>blocks</b> the delayed <b>rectifier</b> potassium channel, which is responsible for ventricular re-polarization. 21 Delays in ventricular repolarization manifest as longer QTc intervals, a surrogate marker for torsades de pointes (TdP). 22 TdP is a polymorphic ventricular arrhyth-mia that may present as lightheadedness and syncope, and in rare cases, can be fatal. 23 A QTc interval greater than 450 milliseconds for men and 470 milliseconds for women indicates prolongation, with QTc intervals greater than 500 milliseconds or a change from baseline that exceeds 60 milliseconds being considered clinically significant. 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanism of}} action of terikalant, an investigational antiarrhythmic agent known to <b>block</b> the inward <b>rectifier</b> and other potassium currents, {{has not yet been}} fully clarified. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to analyse the in vitro electrophysiological effects of terikalant in canine isolated ventricular muscle and Purkinje fibers by applying the standard microelectrode technique. The effects of terikalant on the duration of action potential at a stimulation cycle length of 1000 ms and on the maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential in right ventricular papillary muscle were examined at 1, 2. 5, 10, and 20 mu M concentrations. Terikalant significantly prolonged the action potential duration measured both at 50 % and 90 % of repolarization in concentration-dependent manner. The maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential was unaffected at 1 and 2. 5 mu M concentrations. However, this parameter was significantly reduced at 10 and 20 mu M concentrations of terikalant. In Purkinje fibers terikalant (2. 5 mu M) also produced a marked action potential lengthening effect. Frequency dependence (cycle length of 300 - 5000 ms) of the action potential lengthening effect of terikalant was studied at a concentration of 2. 5 mu M. Prolongation of the duration of action potential occurred in a reverse frequency-dependent manner both in papillary muscle and Purkinje fibers, with a more pronounced frequency-dependence observed in Purkinje fibers. The onset kinetics of the terikalant (10 mu M) induced block of the maximum upstroke velocity of the action potential was rapid (0. 6 +/- 0. 1 beat(- 1) n= 6) like that of Class I/B antiarrhythmics, and the offset (recovery) kinetics of the drug (2956 696 ms, n= 6) best resembled that of Class I/A antiarrhythmic drugs. It was concluded that terikalant, unlike pure Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, has combined mode of action by lengthening repolarization and blocking the inward sodium current in a use-dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{properties}} of cloned Kir 2 channels with the properties of native rectifier channels in guinea-pig (gp) cardiac muscle. The cDNAs of gpKir 2. 1, gpKir 2. 2, gpKir 2. 3 and gpKir 2. 4 were obtained by screening a cDNA library from guinea-pig cardiac ventricle. A partial genomic structure of all gpKir 2 genes was deduced by comparison of the cDNAs with the nucleotide sequences derived from a guinea-pig genomic library. The cell-specific expression of Kir 2 channel subunits was studied in isolated cardiomyocytes using a multi-cell RT-PCR approach. It was found that gpKir 2. 1, gpKir 2. 2 and gpKir 2. 3, but not gpKir 2. 4, are expressed in cardiomyocytes. Immunocytochemical analysis with polyclonal antibodies showed that expression of Kir 2. 4 is restricted to neuronal cells in the heart. After transfection in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) the mean single-channel conductance with symmetrical K+ was found to be 30. 6 pS for gpKir 2. 1, 40. 0 pS for gpKir 2. 2 and 14. 2 pS for Kir 2. 3. Cell-attached measurements in isolated guinea-pig cardiomyocytes (n = 351) revealed three populations of inwardly rectifying K+ channels with mean conductances of 34. 0, 23. 8 and 10. 7 pS. Expression of the gpKir 2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes showed inwardly rectifying currents. The Ba 2 + concentrations required for half-maximum block at - 100 mV were 3. 24 μm for gpKir 2. 1, 0. 51 μm for gpKir 2. 2, 10. 26 μm for gpKir 2. 3 and 235 μm for gpKir 2. 4. Ba 2 + <b>block</b> of inward <b>rectifier</b> channels of cardiomyocytes was studied in cell-attached recordings. The concentration and voltage dependence of Ba 2 + block of the large-conductance inward rectifier channels was virtually identical to that of gpKir 2. 2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Our results suggest that the large-conductance inward rectifier channels found in guinea-pig cardiomyocytes (34. 0 pS) correspond to gpKir 2. 2. The intermediate-conductance (23. 8 pS) and low-conductance (10. 7 pS) channels described here may correspond to gpKir 2. 1 and gpKir 2. 3, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) <b>blocks</b> the delayed <b>rectifier</b> type potassium (K+) channels present on lipopolysaccharide- activated murine B lymphocytes was investigated using whole-cell and single channel patch-clamp recordings. 4 -AP (1 microM- 5 mM) was superfused for 3 - 4 min before applying depolarizing pulses to activate the channel. During the first pulse after application of 4 -AP above 50 microM, the current inactivated faster, {{as compared with the}} control, but its peak was only reduced at high concentrations of 4 -AP (Kd = 3. 1 mM). During subsequent pulses, the peak current was decreased (Kd = 120 microM), but the inactivation rate was slower than in the control, a feature that could be explained by a slow unblocking process. After washing out the drug, the current elicited by the first voltage step was still markedly reduced, as compared with the control one, and displayed very slow activation and inactivation kinetics; this suggests that the K+ channels move from a blocked to an unblocked state slowly during the depolarizing pulse. These results show that 4 -AP blocks K+ channels in their open state and that the drug remains trapped in the channel once it is closed. On the basis of the analysis of the current kinetics during unblocking, we suggest that two pathways lead from the blocked to the unblocked states. Computer simulations were used to investigate the mechanism of action of 4 -AP. The simulations suggest that 4 -AP must bind to both an open and a nonconducting state of the channel. It is postulated that the latter is either the inactivated channel or a site on closed channels only accessible to the drug once the cell has been depolarized. Using inside- and outside-out patch recordings, we found that 4 -AP only blocks channels from the intracellular side of the membrane and acts by reducing the mean burst time. 4 -AP is a weak base (pK = 9), and thus exists in ionized or nonionized form. Since the Kd of channel block depends on both internal and external pH, we suggest that 4 -AP crosses the membrane in its nonionized form and acts from inside the cell in its ionized form...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the phenylalkylamines, verapamil and D 600, and related compounds, <b>block</b> inactivating delayed <b>rectifier</b> K+ currents in rat alveolar epithelial cells, was investigated using whole-cell tight- seal recording. Block by phenylalkylamines added to the bath resembles state-dependent block of squid K+ channels by internally applied quarternary ammonium ions (Armstrong, C. M. 1971. Journal of General Physiology. 58 : 413 - 437) : open channels are blocked preferentially, increased [K+]o accelerates recovery from block, and recovery occurs mainly through the open state. Slow recovery from block is attributed {{to the existence of}} a blocked-inactivated state, because recovery was faster in three situations where recovery from inactivation is faster: (a) at high [K+]o, (b) at more negative potentials, and (c) in cells with type l K+ channels, which recover rapidly from inactivation. The block rate was used as a bioassay to reveal the effective concentration of drug at the block site. When external pH, pHo, was varied, block was much faster at pHo 10 than pHo 7. 4, and very slow at pHo 4. 5. The block rate was directly proportional to the concentration of neutral drug in the bath, suggesting that externally applied drug must enter the membrane in neutral form to reach the block site. High internal pH (pHi 10) reduced the apparent potency of externally applied phenylalkylamines, suggesting that the cationic form of these drugs blocks K+ channels at an internal site. The permanently charged analogue D 890 blocked more potently when added to the pipette than to the bath. However, lowering pHi to 5. 5 did not enhance block by external drug, and tertiary phenylalkylamines added to the pipette solution blocked weakly. This result can be explained if drug diffuses out of the cell faster than it is delivered from the pipette, the block site is reached preferentially via hydrophobic pathways, or both. Together, the data indicate the neutral membrane-bound drug blocks K+ channels more potently than intracellular cationic drug. Neutral drug has rapid access to the receptor, where block is stabilized by protonation of the drug from the internal solution. In summary, externally applied phenylalkylamines block open or inactivated K+ channels by partitioning into the cell membrane in neutral form and are stabilized at the block site by protonation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the effects of eliprodil, a noncardiac drug with neuroprotective properties, on the cardiac repolarisation under in vitro circumstances, under normal {{conditions}} and after the attenuation of the ‘repolarisation reserve' by <b>blocking</b> the inward <b>rectifier</b> potassium current (IK 1) current with BaCl 2. In canine right ventricular papillary muscle by applying the conventional microelectrode technique, under normal conditions, eliprodil (1 μM) produced a moderate reverse rate-dependent prolongation of the action potential duration (7. 4 ± 1. 5, 8. 9 ± 2. 1 and 9. 9 ± 1. 8 % at cycle lengths of 300, 1000 and 5000 ms, respectively; n= 9). This effect was augmented in preparations where IK 1 was previously blocked by BaCl 2 (10 μM). BaCl 2 alone lengthened APD in a reverse frequency-dependent manner (7. 0 ± 1. 3, 14. 2 ± 1. 6 and 28. 1 ± 2. 1 % at cycle lengths of 300, 1000 and 5000 ms, respectively; n= 8). When eliprodil (1 μM) was administered to these preparations, the drug induced a marked further lengthening relative to the APD values measured after the administration of BaCl 2 (12. 5 ± 1. 0, 17. 6 ± 1. 5 and 20. 5 ± 0. 9 % at cycle lengths of 300, 1000 and 5000 ms, respectively; n= 8). In the normal Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart, eliprodil (1 μM) produced a significant QTc prolongation at 1 Hz stimulation frequency (12. 7 ± 1. 8 %, n= 9). After the attenuation of the ‘repolarisation reserve' by the IK 1 blocker BaCl 2 (10 μM), the eliprodil-evoked QTc prolongation was greatly enhanced (28. 5 ± 7. 9 %, n= 6). In two out of six Langendorff preparations, this QTc lengthening degenerated into torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Eliprodil significantly decreased the amplitude of rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), but slow component (IKs), transient outward current (Ito) and IK 1 were not considerably affected by the drug when measured in dog ventricular myocytes by applying the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. The results indicate that eliprodil, under normal conditions, moderately lengthens cardiac repolarisation by inhibition of IKr. However, after the attenuation of the normal ‘repolarisation reserve', this drug can induce marked QT interval prolongation, which may result in proarrhythmic action...|$|R
