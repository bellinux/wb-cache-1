40|$|Herodotus´ History is {{the first}} extant {{literary}} work in which the activities and the characters of the main agents of the Greco-Persian wars were described. The course of history, according to Herodotus, is regulated by the gods and is {{a manifestation of the}} divine will, but altogether, {{for the first time the}} author reflects on the importance of a human agent in history and ones´ personal resolve in a given situation. Herodotus´ interest is focused on historical personalities, their role in the historical events and the motivation of their actions. His History is a series of political biographies. Herodotus´ main source of information about historical personalities is oral tradition. One of the most mysterious characters among the politicians of the Greco-Persian wars is Themistocles. Greek tradition of him is very ambiguous: he is regarded both as a hero and a liberator of Greece and at the same time as a selfish renegade. This status of the tradition of Themistocles is usually defined in the contemporary research as a Themistoclean myth or a Saga of Themistocles. The legend was built up around Themistocles quite early, as it is evident already in Herodotus´ and Thucydides´ texts. The latter of the historians in his excursus on Themistocles complements the former (namely, Thucydides’ History relates the events, that took place after the Xerxes´ campaign; Herodotus has passed them over in silence). This notwithstanding, Thucydidean characteristization of Themistocles tallies with his portrait as depicted by Herodotus: Themistocles is presented as a political genius and the most efficient politician of his time. Thucydides´ story exculpates him from the treachery charges and indicates that he fled to Persia for the reason of the Sparta´s plotting against him. Herodotus, on the other hand, never mentions the fact of treachery and Themistocles exile. He just drops a hint that Themistocles foresaw that the atitude towards him may change in the future, and concludes by saying that it later actually happened (τά περ ὦν καὶ ἐγένετο). Themistocles emerges into Herodotean narrative as a homo novus in politics, he is a character with no past and no future. This is an obvious contradiction to historical reality. Both the introduction to the narrative and the whole Herodotean logos about Themistocles, in which the main focus is made on his deceits and tricks, albeit for good purpose, gave rise to the belief that Herodotean account of Themistocles is written in a hostile vein. The present article demonstrates a different approach to the Herodotean Themistocles and shows that the style of the Themistoclean logos in Herodotus is similar to the style of the traditional trickster-tales. Herodotus admired artful deception that not only inveigle others into complying but also promote self-preservation. Trickster, when a human being, is lowly and unimportant, but he gaines victory over socially superior and moral antagonist. Therefore Herodotus makes Themistocles to step into history as homo novus and decreases the military merits of Aristeides, whom Herodotus admires as the most just and the best of all the Athenians; at the same time he is, according to Herodotus, the arch-enemy of Themistocles. Themistocles, as like as the protagonist of the trickster-tales, <b>breaks</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> <b>and</b> (in Herodotus´ text) getts away with it. He achieves salvation both for Greece and for himself through deception. Just for the sake of good story, there is no need for the narrator to mention what actually happened later on...|$|E

The procedure obviates the need for generating multizone grids for such geometries, {{as reported in the}} literature. This has been possible because the enhanced elliptic grid generator automatically generates clustered grids without manual prescription of decay parameters needed with the conventional approach. In fact, these decay parameters are calculated as decay functions as part of the solution, and they are not constant over a given boundary.

40|$|The {{assignment}} investigates how {{the novel}} Mænd der hader kvinder (2005) by Stieg Larsson <b>breaks</b> down <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> between men <b>and</b> women, reality and fiction, hero and antihero, and between victim and executioner. It also looks into {{how the two}} film adaptations, Mænd der hader kvinder (2008) and The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo (2011), relate to the novel and how they treat the themes within the book. In our analysis of the novel and the two adaptations, we have applied the relevant theories to the subject {{from a number of}} sources. Using John Cawelti’s theories from Adventure, Mystery, and Romance (1977), we analyzed genre and formula; Mænd der hader kvinder begins as a formal work, which follows the traditional mystery formula. But Larsson further develops the formal structure, resulting in the surprise of the audience. The assignment also deals with Gunhild Aggers theory about how a novel can be a bestseller from Den skandinaviske krimi: bestseller og blockbuster (2010). According to her theory Mænd der hader kvinder is a bestseller because Larsson has blended and mixed different genres, each of which are popular. To see how the two adaptations relate to the novel, we have used Geoffrey Wagners theory about Three modes of Adaption from The Novel and The Cinema (1975) and Peter Schepelerns theory from Fra bog til film -typiske træk i danske filmatiseringer (2010). By Wagners terms, the Swedish adaptation is a commentary because there are changes in the storyline, but it is made with respect for the original work. The American adaptation is a transposition because it is basically a reproduction of the novel. By Schepelerns terms the strategy of the director of the American adaptation is to preserve the original work as much as possible. And the strategy of the director of the Swedish adaptation is to change and omit parts of the original. Judith Butler's theories about gender from Gendertrouble (1990 / 2010), is used to describe how the character Lisbeth Salander is genderfluid in the novel. In the end, a conclusion can be drawn. It tells that Stieg Larsson has broken <b>boundaries</b> in <b>the</b> genre as he develops the formula and mixes the genres. We can also conclude, that both the novel and the two adaptations truly <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> <b>and</b> challenge traditional conventions between our themes, which shows how Mænd der hader kvinder has broken boundaries in many ways...|$|R

Firstly, a flexible packed stretched media is {{installed in the}} bottom of the basin to increase the efficiency of the still. Secondly, a vibratory harmonic effect is applied. The flexible packed media is formed from stretched helical coiled copper wires, which is considered as a good media for heat absorbing and transferring and as simple thermal storage system. Also, a vibrator (resonator) is installed in the middle of the system structure. The target of using the vibrator is to generate forced vibration to excite the flexible packed media to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> layer <b>and</b> surface tension of the saline water and improve convective heat transfer, and also to excite the condensed polycarbonate glass cover to assist the condensed droplets to slide down before it becomes bigger and possibly falls down in the basin, thus increasing the water vaporization and condensation. The performance is compared with the conventional solar stills (CSS). The vibratory excitation effect is accounted by the new parameter 'vibratory performance gain'. The productivity due to added backed helical wires is found to be 3. 4 l/m day, with efficiency of about 35 %, and the productivity with vibration is increased to be 5. 8 l/mday and the average daily efficiency is about 60 %.

This attitude has actually changed during the last decade, because it was realized that research on rare diseases may help finding solutions valid also for common conditions. Indeed, while we all invoke translational research as the way to adapt results of laboratory studies into therapeutic interventions for patients, rare diseases often need the opposite path: we observe rare patients in the clinical practice, then we find out that they have a genetic defect, and finally we reproduce the defect in an animal model to extend the observation further beyond the clinic.

This project examines this reencounter {{through the lens of}} the controversial Yorubization—or re-Yorubization—of the religions of Regla de Ocha, also known as Santeria, and Ifá. Through an ethnography of affective belonging and emancipatory desire in Havana, Santiago de Cuba, and the provinces of Holguín, Ciego de Ávila, and Guantánamo, this work examines how “African Traditionalists” mobilize select aspects of the Yorùbá Traditional Religion (YTR) and Yorùbá language of Nigeria in order to circumvent Cuban prohibitions regarding gender and carve out novel spaces of religious autonomy and authority.

In the Ilé-Ifé 2 ̆ 6 dotbelow;-rooted Aworeni lineage in Havana, the “Àràbà of Cuba” and other babaláwos (priests) mobilize the recently-imported dùndún 2 ̆ 2 talking drums 2 ̆ 2 of Yorùbáland as a means to “re-Yorubize” Cuban Ifá and to promote the spread of Nigerian-rooted institutions in Cuba. In eastern Baracoa and western Havana, all-male Egúngún masquerade is additionally gaining prominence as a Yorùbá-inspired means of worshiping and 2 ̆ 2 working with 2 ̆ 2 the dead. This project interrogates how various forms of engagement with sound and listening inform—and, often, constitute—central practices of assertion for practitioners of Nigerian-style Ifá-òrì 2 ̆ 6 scedil;a in Cuba. In a larger sense, this project points to the ongoing ways in which the contemporary African continent continues to influence and transform the landscape of gender and belief in contemporary Cuba. ...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} how the biography of Gozanga Duque, available at his official site at the Fundação Casa de Rui Barbosa, is structured and how it is similar to the narrative of the Traditional History. In this way biography meets a place of legitimacy as a discourse of “truth”. This study seeks {{to understand}} how history and biography maintain a relationship with “reality” and fiction. Theorists like Jacques Rancière, Juan José Saer and Nietzsche help us on the issues on the relationship between “truth” and “appearance”, fiction and no-fiction. Rancière understands that the “real” needs to be fictionalized to be thought; Saer shows a dual character of fiction: the empirical and the imaginary; <b>and</b> Nietzsche <b>breaks</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> between “reality” <b>and</b> “appearance. We can develop a notion of biography and history without resorting to the old discourse of “truth” and we can think about art objects without the opposition between the fictional and the no-fictional. Este ensaio procura discutir como a biografia de Gonzaga Duque, disponível no site oficial da Fundação Casa de Rui Barbosa, estrutura-se e, assim, assemelha-se à lógica estrutural da narrativa da História Tradicional. Dessa maneira, a biografia encontra um lugar de legitimidade como um discurso de “verdade”. Para atender ao objetivo deste texto, procuramos compreender como procedem os gêneros história e biografia e a relação que mantêm com “realidade” e ficção. Teóricos como Jacques Rancière, Juan José Saer e Nietzsche nos ajudam a pensar a relação entre “verdade” e aparência, ficção e não-ficção. Rancière entende que, para ser pensado, o real precisa ser ficcionado; já Saer destaca um caráter duplo da ficção: o empírico e o imaginário; e Nietzsche desfaz as fronteiras entre a “realidade” e a “aparência”. Assim, podemos elaborar uma noção de biografia e história livre do velho ranço do discurso da “verdade” e pensarmos os objetos de arte sem a preocupação com a oposição ficcional e não-ficcional...|$|R
40|$|Short {{historical}} {{overview of}} animal welfare sciences: how a societal concern {{has become a}} transdisciplinary subject Animal welfare is a recent scientific topic, the origins {{of which can be}} found in philosophy, physiology (with the introduction of the stress concept), and ethology (with the description of animal behavioural repertoire and needs). In the 1970 ’s, animal welfare became a subject for applied research; the aim was {{to improve the quality of}} animal life. Animal welfare was first studied within specific disciplines, e. g. ethologists compared the behaviour of farm animals to that of their wild counterparts and identified behavioral needs. Stress was then found to be related not only to physiology but also psychology. Stress, behavioural needs, and preferences are closely related to each other. Similarly, the links between animal welfare and health were studied, e. g. a malaise behaviour has been identified and the relationship between stress and immunity was highlighted. More recently, frameworks developed in human psychology were applied to animals in order to identify the emotions they may experience. Such studies require that researchers from one discipline interact with researchers from other disciplines, enabling cross-fertilization of concepts. Researchers in animal welfare quickly understood the value of using various indicators covering a wide range of possible disorders such as abnormal behavior, disease, production defects, emotional states, etc. However, this was not per se an interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinarity is well illustrated by the Welfare Quality® project. During this project, a comprehensive assessment tool of animal welfare was developed on the basis of what matters to animals, as identified by researchers in animal science, and what matters to society as identified by social scientists. We believe that the issue of animal welfare needs to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> between disciplines <b>and</b> beyond disciplines to engage stakeholders and society as a whole. Transdisciplinarity, e. g. going between and beyond disciplines, will be essential to build a holistic approach and be able to effectively improve the welfare of animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand in}} the data storage has been driving the {{explosive}} development of non-volatile memories (NVMs). Based on the field effect transistor (FET), flash memory has benefitted from the geometric scaling and dominated the electronics market. However, as Moore’s Law approaches its limit, flash memory is facing challenges from technical issues and economic concerns. Therefore, for a feasible next-generation NVM solution, a novel non-FET based replacement of flash memory is urgently desired. Among different candidates, resistive switching memory (RRAM) has attracted broad interest. 	In this work, we present studies on RRAMs and related reconfigurable devices. First, we systematically investigate the “sneak-path” issue of crossbar RRAM arrays and specify the selector device requirement in the one-selector-one-resistor (1 S 1 R) configuration. We analyze the crossbar array from a perspective of device-circuit interaction and propose optimized benchmarks. 	Next, we develop a tantalum oxide (TaOx) based selector with high nonlinearity (~ 10000) and good uniformity. The conduction mechanism of this selector {{is found to be}} thermionic emission and tunneling emission. A HfO 2 switching layer is integrated with the proposed selector to constitute a self-rectifying RRAM cell with high LRS selectivity (~ 5000), which can potentially enable Mbit crossbar array. 	Further, we demonstrate sub-nA operation current in a Cu based conductive bridge RAM (CBRAM) device for the first time, which offers significant energy savings during program and read steps. An improved cell with a built-in barrier/rectifying layer is developed to enhance device reliability. Apart from low current, other attractive properties including high on/off ratio (> 100 x), retention (over 10000 seconds at 100 °C) and endurance (500 cycles without external current compliance) can be obtained. 	Additionally, we explore coupling the ionic migration process in resistive switching devices with transistor operation. A reconfigurable top-gate transistor is developed for the LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3 two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) system. By incorporating ionic processes in the gate stack, we show that the channel conductivity can be modulated in a non-volatile manner by an external electric field. 	Finally, we propose a novel in-memory computing architecture using crossbar RRAM arrays, which <b>breaks</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundary</b> between computing <b>and</b> memory...|$|R
