500|$|On {{taking the}} role of Jigsaw, Bell said - [...] "I did Saw <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{fascinating}} location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh. I did not anticipate the ending when I read the script, so I was quite caught by surprise {{and it was clear}} to me that if the filmmakers shot the scene well, the audience would be caught by surprise as well. The film was worth doing for that moment alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Nutter said of {{the episode}} [...] "I really worked hard {{to make it a}} special show, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> special. It was Gillian's {{post-traumatic}} stress episode, because she had not really had the opportunity to vent her feelings about the whole Duane Barry situation. This was an opportunity to sit back and let all that happen." [...] Carter particularly liked the scene where a clearly disturbed Scully hugs Mulder, claiming it was a [...] "tender moment" [...] between two characters that had not shown that much affection for each other.|$|E
500|$|With word of {{the episode}} out, {{backlash}} began. The studio received at least one bomb threat and Driscoll received a telephone call informing him {{he was going to}} Hell. DeGeneres was followed by car to the studio on at least one occasion by a [...] "suspicious man". Some within the entertainment industry assumed that the coming out was simply a ratings stunt, to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I did it selfishly for myself and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great thing for the show, which desperately needed a point of view." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. No. I told Harry she was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would make}} it easier for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Mr. Bevan. It wasn't that. It wasn't that at all. Oh, I am so sorry. I don't {{know why}} I laughed. <b>It</b> {{certainly}} wasn't <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> funny. It's tragic. There's been a dreadful mistake!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't he? Well, I {{am glad to}} hear <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{might be}} HIS doing. This, you know, I am {{speaking}} of. This letter." ...|$|R
500|$|Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights, intending Harold Becker to direct and Robert Shapiro to produce. Tom Stoppard {{wrote the first}} draft of the screenplay, on which Ballard briefly collaborated. Becker dropped out, and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer. Lean explained, [...] "I worked on it for about a year and in the end I gave it up <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too similar to a diary. It was well-written and interesting, but I gave it to Steve." [...] Spielberg felt [...] "from the moment I read J. G. Ballard's novel I secretly wanted to direct myself." [...] Spielberg found the project to be very personal. As a child, his favorite film was Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Spielberg's fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father's stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in the China-Burma Theater. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited rewrite before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script.|$|E
500|$|In January 1966, Wilson {{commenced}} recording {{sessions for}} the Beach Boys' forthcoming album Pet Sounds, which {{was largely a}} collaboration with lyricist Tony Asher. When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with {{a substantial portion of}} a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style. [...] According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but neither their brother Dennis nor Love were, while Asher recalls that Dennis, Love, and Al Jardine [...] "certainly" [...] expressed frustration with the new music and its lyrics. Love said: [...] "When it got to that period of Brian's life that's when he started doing a lot of drugs. We were touring a lot and we'd come back in and do an album like Pet Sounds, for instance, and some of the words were so totally offensive to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too nauseating." [...] One of his specific points of objection was the original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", then known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", a reference to the ego deaths associated with psychedelics. Brian also believed that the band was worried about him separating from the group, and that they [...] "resisted" [...] the increasing number of vocal roles he had given to himself. Love wrote that he [...] "would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with". Dennis denied that the band disagreed with Brian's direction on Pet Sounds, calling the rumors [...] "interesting," [...] that there was [...] "not one person in the group that could come close to Brian's talent," [...] and that he [...] "couldn't imagine who" [...] would have resisted Brian's leadership.|$|E
2500|$|Mike Love said [...] "some of {{the words}} were so totally {{offensive}} to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too nauseating." [...] The original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", created a stir within the group. He opposed the song's original message, though Jardine recalled {{that the decision to}} change the lyrics was ultimately Brian's: [...] "Brian was very concerned. He wanted to know what we thought about it. To be honest, I don't think we even knew what an ego was... Finally Brian decided, 'Forget it. I'm changing the lyrics. There's too much controversy.'" [...] On Love's reaction to the album, Jardine commented: [...] "Mike was very confused... Mike's a formula hound â€“ if it doesn't have a hook in it, if he can't hear a hook in it, he doesn't want to know about it.... I wasn't exactly thrilled with the change, but I grew to really appreciate it as soon as we started to work on it. It wasn't like anything we'd heard before." [...] Carl Wilson said: [...] "I loved every minute of it. He [...] could do no wrong. He could play me anything, and I would love it." [...] Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but not Dennis and Mike. Author John Tobler wrote that Dennis and Bruce Johnston loved the album, but that Jardine felt [...] "It sure doesn't sound like the old stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much," [...] said Jack. [...] "I {{left your}} house <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{better for you}} and her {{that no one should}} know of my being there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{submitted}} to <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{right to do}} so, there being no other apparent means at hand of attaining the late Mr. Meeson's end. Also"--and she paused.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was no holiday. <b>I</b> went abroad <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{right to}} make certain inquiries--" [...] He stopped there, unwilling {{to return to a}} subject that was painful to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{got rid of}} her," [...] said Captain Barber. [...] "I got a {{housekeeper}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time you got married. Now do you see?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then I lampooned two {{prominent}} citizens outrageously--not {{because they had}} done anything to deserve, but merely <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty to make the paper lively.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor fellow! I {{brought him}} here just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a pity {{that a man}} born and bred like a gentleman should never see {{the inside of a}} {{comfortable}} house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will--if you fellers won't take me in as {{a working}} partner. I made the {{suggestion}} only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be more pleasant to travel in a company of three." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} once {{calling you}} 'George,' {{in one of}} my amiable fits, about ten years ago. <b>I</b> did <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would offend you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind; {{most likely}} {{nothing of the}} kind will ever come in your way, and they have not the {{slightest}} claim on you. I only threw <b>it</b> out, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> right just to speak of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know I have no ill-feeling towards you at all. I {{gave you}} a piece of my mind <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty. If you think I stepped over the limits of--moderation, I am willing and ready to apologise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{a matter}} which we will not discuss over the telephone," [...] was the calm reply. [...] "I rang you up {{to tell you this}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> well that you should know quickly. I ask you now {{what you are going to}} do." ...|$|E
60|$|You talk {{of me as}} if I were a tame cat. I don't want to brag, John, {{but after}} all, I've shown that I'm fit for {{something}} in this world. I went to the Cape <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty. I intend to marry Jenny for the same reason.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what could}} I do? I got that thing <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> safer than a pistol, but I really think it's worse. I might have murdered them all, if I'd lost my temper,--and just for half-a-dozen apricots!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{repeated}} Mr. Penway {{with iron}} resolution. [...] "No young woman. No young woman whatsoever. I noticed <b>it</b> particularly, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> strange, don't you know--what I mean is, don't you know, strange there shouldn't be!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{questions}} {{which it is}} of no avail to answer. I have come out with you now <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> well {{that we should have}} a final opportunity of understanding each other. You understand me at any rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You won't believe me; you cannot believe me! for I do {{not even}} know. I have taken and {{exchanged}} letters--whose contents I never saw--between the Confederates and a spy who comes to this house, but who is far away by this time. I did it because I thought you hated and despised me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my duty to help my cause--because {{you said it was}} 'war' between us--but I never spied on you. I swear it." ...|$|E
60|$|I remembered {{then that}} a {{paragraph}} of just that size had been carefully {{cut out of}} Wednesday's paper before I was allowed by Aunt Emma to read it. Aunt Emma always glanced over the paper first, indeed, and often cut out such offending paragraphs. But I never attached much importance to their absence before, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> merely a little fussy result of auntie's good old English sense of maidenly modesty. I supposed she merely meant to spare my blushes. I knew girls were often prevented on particular days from reading the papers.|$|E
60|$|I {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1876. At fifteen I was a man among men, and if I had a spare nickel I spent it on beer instead of candy, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more manly to buy beer. Now, when my years are nearly doubled, I am out on a hunt for the boyhood which I never had, and I am less serious {{than at any other}} time of my life. Guess I'll find that boyhood! Almost the first things I {{realized}} were responsibilities. I have no recollection of being taught to read or write--I could do both at the age of five--but I know that my first school was in Alameda before I went out on a ranch with my folks and as a ranch boy worked hard from my eighth year.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] said Maggie. [...] "He's very unhappy, Tom. The {{lawsuit is}} ended, and I came {{to tell you}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would be better for}} you to know it before you came home, and I didn't like only to send you a letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't mean {{to deceive}} you, Lucy," [...] said Maggie, {{as soon as}} she could speak. [...] "It always made me wretched that I felt what I didn't like you to know. <b>It</b> was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would all be conquered, and you might never see {{anything}} to wound you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{also put}} on the bed a few volumes of Goethe, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be so {{pleasant}} to read him in his own country. And I {{decided to take a}} sponge, together with a small portable bath, because a cold bath is so refreshing the first thing in the morning.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I came {{in again}} {{to tell you}} {{something}} which I ought to have told you just now, and I have come to say it at once because I am afraid I shan't be able to to-morrow. Mr. Julian was the young man I spoke to you of a long time ago, and I should have told you all about him, but you said he was your young man too, and--and I didn't know what to do then, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> wrong in me to love your young man; and Berta, he didn't mean me to love him at all, but I did it myself, though I did not want to do it, either; it would come to me! And I didn't know he belonged to you when I began it, or I would not have let him meet me at all; no I wouldn't!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} knew, before Mr. Eames started, {{that he was}} going to Italy to find me and my husband?" [...] said Mrs. Arabin. Then Lily put Mr. Crosbie {{altogether}} out of her head, and became aware that he was not to be the subject of the coming conversation. She was almost sorry that it was so. There was no doubt in her mind as to what she would have said to any one who might have taken up Crosbie's cause. On that matter she could now have given a very decisive answer in a few words. But on that other matter she was much more in doubt. She remembered, however, every word of the note she had received from M. D. She remembered also the words of John's note to that young woman. And her heart was still hard against him. [...] "Yes," [...] she said; [...] "Mr. Eames came here one night and told us why he was going. I was very glad {{that he was going}}, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, yes," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "that is {{all true}} enough, but I {{told him to}} send for you. In fact, I insisted upon it. I did it, of course, for his sake; for I knew that the {{arrangement}} would be of advantage to him in various ways, but I was also glad to be of service to your daughter, of whom I had heard a good report. Furthermore, I interested myself very much in getting you lodgings, and found you a home at Mrs. Brinkly's that I hoped you would like. If I had not done so, I {{think you would have}} been obliged to go to the hotel, which is not pleasant and much more expensive than a private house. I do not mention these things, madam, because I wish to be thanked, or anything of that sort; far from it. I did what I did <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> right; but I must admit, if you will excuse my mentioning it, that I was surprised, to say the least, that I was not consulted, in the slightest degree, on the occasion of your leaving the home I had secured for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Davy, dear. If I ain't been azackly as {{intimate}} with you. Lately, as I used to be. It ain't <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't love you. Just {{as well and}} more, my pretty poppet. <b>It's</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> better for you. And for someone else besides. Davy, my darling, are you listening? Can you hear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't think I {{came here}} looking for you, Theresa. Your vanity {{shall not be}} tickled by any such misapprehension. Our meeting is wholly fortuitous. I broke with the life {{academic}} and I had to go somewhere. To be honest, I came into the Klondike <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> the place you were least liable to be in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good lady," [...] said I, [...] "you {{must not}} corner me. <b>I</b> came here <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would be a}} good place in which to stop awhile and grumble undisturbed; and as you say it is proper to be unceremonious, may I ask how you happen to be here, and if you sail your boat yourself?" ...|$|R
