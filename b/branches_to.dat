5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves supply sensation to {{the larynx}} below the vocal cords, gives cardiac <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> the deep cardiac plexus, and <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> the trachea, esophagus and the inferior constrictor muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscles that can open the vocal cords, are innervated by this nerve.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} the {{junction}} for a Great Central <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Renishaw Ironworks while a Midland <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> the ironworks passed under the platforms. There {{was also a}} <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Renishaw Park colliery.|$|R
50|$|The line then {{approaches}} the Heimeranplatz S-Bahn station. North of Heimeranplatz the South Ring divides into a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> the central station, a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Laim marshalling yard and a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Pasing, {{known as the}} Sendlinger Spange ("Sendling clasp").|$|R

5|$|As the {{recurrent}} nerve hooks {{around the}} subclavian artery or aorta, it gives off several branches. There is suspected {{variability in the}} configuration of these <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> the cardiac plexus, trachea, esophagus and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.|$|E
5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder. In some recorded cases, PGAD was caused by, or caused, a pelvic arterial-venous malformation with arterial <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> the clitoris; surgical treatment was effective in these cases.|$|E
5|$|Churches of Christ are {{autonomous}} Christian congregations {{associated with}} one another through distinct beliefs and practices. Represented chiefly in the United States and one of several <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> develop out of the American Restoration Movement, they claim Biblical precedent for their doctrine and practice and trace their heritage {{back to the early}} Christian church as described in the New Testament.|$|E

50|$|The {{power grid}} of Bornholm {{consists}} of a 60 kV-ring line connecting the substations Hasle, Olsker, Østerlars, Dalslunde, Bodilsker, Aakirkeby, Rønne-Syd, Rønne Power Station, Viadukten, Snorrebakken. Apart from the section between Ronne-Syd and Snorrebakken, it is an overhead line. From this ring line several 60 kV lines branch, which are all implemented as underground cables. These are the <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Allinge starting at Olsker, that to Gudhjem starting at Østerlars, a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Svaneke starting at Dalslunde, a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Svaneke via Nexo starting at Bodilsker, a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Poulsker starting at Bodilker. A further <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Westhaven starts at Rønne Power Station. A further connection built as underground cable connects Hasle substation with Rønne-Nord, Viadukten and Ronne-South.|$|R
5|$|The {{constitution}} under Article 312 {{provides for}} All India Civil Services <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> {{be set up}} by giving the power to the Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Parliament of India) to resolve by a two-thirds majority to establish new all-India services. The Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service and Indian Forest Service are set up under this constitutional provision.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{emerge as}} {{branches of the}} left and right subclavian arteries. They travel upward through transverse foramina – spaces in the cervical vertebrae and then emerge as two vessels, one on the left and one on the right of the medulla. They give off one of the three cerebellar branches. The vertebral arteries join in front of the middle part of the medulla to form the larger basilar artery, which sends multiple <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> supply the medulla and pons, and the two other anterior and superior cerebellar branches. Finally, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries. These travel outwards, around the superior cerebellar peduncles, and {{along the top of the}} cerebellar tentorium, where it sends <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> supply the temporal and occipital lobes. Each posterior cerebral artery sends a small posterior communicating artery to join with the internal carotid arteries.|$|E
5|$|When a Purkinje cell axon enters one of {{the deep}} nuclei, it <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> make contact with {{both large and small}} nuclear cells, but the total number of cells {{contacted}} is only about 35 (in cats). Conversely, a single deep nuclear cell receives input from approximately 860 Purkinje cells (again in cats).|$|E

5|$|In Dewey County, SH-34 crosses SH-47, {{two miles}} (3km) south of Leedey, and crosses the Canadian River near the unincorporated {{settlement}} of Trail. The highway then passes through Camargo. Just east of Vici, SH-34 joins US-60 and SH-51 for a one-mile (1.6km) concurrency, then SH-34 heads north again at Vici. The highway passes through Sharon north of Vici, then joins US-183/US-270/SH-3 four miles (6km) southeast of Woodward. At Woodward, SH-34 again sets {{off to the}} north alone, and right after crossing the North Canadian River, SH-34C <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> the east about two miles (3km) north of Woodward, connecting to Boiling Springs State Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s {{the number of}} {{passengers}} using the branch stabilised at about 800 people each weekday. In 2009 the Chesham branch saw 427,000 journeys each year. The proposal to close the Aylesbury–Marylebone route was dropped, and instead the line was upgraded and equipped with fast British Rail Class 165 trains in the early 1990s. These reduced the travel time between Chalfont& Latimer and Marylebone to 33 minutes, increasing usage of the line as a commuter route. The Chesham branch was proposed as a terminus for the original Crossrail scheme, which would have seen Crossrail trains running from Paddington to serve the stations between Rickmansworth and Aylesbury and the Chesham branch, allowing London Transport to withdraw from Buckinghamshire and cut the Metropolitan line back to serve only the <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> Watford and Uxbridge. The bill proposing the scheme was defeated in Parliament and abandoned in 1995, and the revived scheme authorised by the Crossrail Act 2008 {{did not include the}} <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> Aylesbury and Chesham. By this time the little-used Central line branch from Epping to Ongar had closed, with the last services running on 30 September 1994, leaving Chesham—already the westernmost point of the London Underground network since 1961's withdrawal from Aylesbury—as the northernmost point on the London Underground.|$|E
5|$|Nuptial flight occurs after rain {{for several}} days, taking place between summer and mid-autumn (December to March). The males and virgin queens emerge from their nest, and unlike other species who mate {{on the ground}} or climb onto nearby trees or <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> fly off from, the {{reproductive}} alates will fly from the nest. Recorded nuptial flights usually took place on hilltops. M. nigriceps queens are not known to seal up their entrance during colony foundation, unlike other Myrmecia species such as M. regularis. Workers can live exceptionally long, with an average lifespan of 2.2 years; maximum longevity in workers varied from 2.1 to 2.4 years.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally the {{communicating}} <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> {{the anterior}} cutaneous and saphenous {{branches of the}} femoral is continued down, as a cutaneous <b>branch,</b> <b>to</b> the thigh and leg, as the cutaneous branch of the obturator nerve.|$|R
50|$|Mission creep followed, {{as several}} {{branches}} were proposed in October 1829, including a three-mile <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Wick Limestone Rocks; {{this was not}} in fact built. A 43 chain <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Soundwell Colliery from Siston Common was built, as was a 25 chain <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Londonderry Wharf on the River Avon; also proposed at this time was a Shortwood Colliery branch from Mangotsfield; this was actually built by the B&GlosR.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{interchange}} with Line 1 at Port Marianne, {{then the}} line travels southeast on Avenue de la Mer and Route de Carnon, and splits with a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Lattes and a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Pérols.|$|R
5|$|The Act {{authorised}} a canal from Taunton to Topsham with <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> Tiverton and Cullompton. Water supply {{would be}} derived from proposed reservoirs, one on the River Tone and two on the River Culm, and from any other available sources within 2000yd (1.8km) {{of the line of}} the canal. The canal company was also authorised to improve the River Tone near Taunton, and to raise £220,000, plus an additional £110,000 if required. Navigation onwards from Taunton was via the River Tone and the River Parrett. Construction did not start immediately.|$|E
5|$|The Army Service Forces was {{abolished}} on 14 May 1946, on {{the recommendation}} of War Department's Simpson Board, but the Army Ground Forces remained. Devers' November 1945 testimony before the board had urged that the Army Service Forces be retained. Army Ground Forces was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization gathered pace, the strength of the army shrank dramatically. Devers was faced with the unpleasant task of informing many officers that they were being demoted. One reform that he did achieve was {{to reduce the number of}} combat <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> just three: infantry, armor and artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company was {{incorporated}} on 31 July 1845 and, having acquired the Blaenavon Tramroad {{in the same}} year, it rebuilt and extended the line, which re-opened from Pontypool to Blaenavon (North) on 2 October 1854. Two short and steep <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> Cwmfrwdoer and Cwmnantddu were opened in 1870, with a third to Abersychan and Talywain in 1879. A 99-year lease of the line was granted to the Great Western Railway from 1 August 1875 and the railway company acquired the line on 1 August 1880.|$|E
5|$|The SIRT {{discontinued}} passenger {{service on}} the North Shore <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> Arlington and the South Beach <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> Wentworth Avenue at midnight on March 31, 1953 because of city-operated bus competition; the South Beach Branch was abandoned shortly thereafter, while the North Shore <b>Branch</b> continued <b>to</b> carry freight. By 1955, the third rail on both of the lines were removed. On September 7, 1954, SIRT made an application to discontinue all passenger {{service on the}} Tottenville Branch on October 7, 1954. A large city subsidy allowed passenger service on the Tottenville <b>Branch</b> <b>to</b> continue.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the Four-coupled Joy {{locomotives}} entered service in 1883, the Eastern System mainline from East London was open as far as Queenstown with a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> King William's Town, the two Midland System main&shy;lines from Port Eliza&shy;beth were respectively open to Graaff Reinet and approaching Rosmead via Cradock with a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Grahamstown, while the Western System mainline from Cape Town was approaching De Aar with a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Malmesbury.|$|R
50|$|In 1944, {{passenger}} services on the NLR Poplar branch ceased. Freight traffic continued on the <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> the docks on the Isle of Dogs until 1980. The trackbed {{of the southern}} part of the <b>branch,</b> from Poplar <b>to</b> Bow, was used for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> Stratford.|$|R
5|$|The federal Ministry of External Relations and {{its local}} all-union {{affiliates}} would regularly convene {{at the federal}} Council of Ministers and its Union Republics <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> discuss the policy, duties and responsibilities of the MER. This joint gathering led to more participation from the union republics on foreign policy implementation, elaboration and coordination. This organ also discussed international problems and solved such problems in the international arena.|$|E
5|$|The {{levels are}} {{displayed}} in an overworld with a branching, tree structure. The player must pursue multiple <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> further the story. Optional, side-story branches do not advance the main plot but have the hardest puzzles. The story is told through chains of emails, which are unlocked by completing puzzles. The player assumes {{the role of an}} American Muslim National Security Agency agent who determines whether the hacked emails are pertinent to national security. The ethics of government surveillance are a core theme of the game.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{sections}} of the canal {{were given to the}} Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966, while the <b>branches</b> <b>to</b> the dairy at Bason Bridge and the Highbridge Wharf lasted until 1972.|$|E
50|$|The line {{also had}} a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> West End, Pennsylvania, that was {{abandoned}} in 2011, and a <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, known as the Mifflin Branch. And {{it also has a}} small industrial branch located near Belle Vernon, Pennsylvania.|$|R
