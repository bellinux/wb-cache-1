30|$|The {{education}} level is measured {{based on the}} International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). In order to facilitate the comparison and {{in line with the}} literature 16, the educational achievements are categorized in three groups (low, medium and high) taking the values 1, 2 and 3. The low education group comprises of the ISCED levels 0 to 2 (early childhood education to lower secondary education). The medium level covers the ISCED levels 3 to 4 (upper secondary education to short-cycle tertiary education) while the high {{education level}} subsumes the ISCED levels 5 and 6 (<b>bachelor</b> <b>or</b> <b>equivalent</b> to doctoral <b>or</b> <b>equivalent).</b> These <b>education</b> variables are constructed as simple averages over the three categories taking the values 1, 2 or 3. With respect to the source countries, the education level is calculated over all individuals living in the EU- 10 countries or EU- 2 countries. For example, the education variable for the 15 - 24 year old EU- 2 source cohort denotes the average education level of the 15 - 24 year old Bulgarians and Romanians together. The same logic applies to the calculation of the proportion of employed persons in the source.|$|R
