50|$|Assuming {{the wheel}} and axle does not {{dissipate}} or store energy, that is it has no friction or elasticity, the power input by the force applied to the wheel must equal the power output at the axle. As {{the wheel and}} axle system rotates around its <b>bearings,</b> <b>points</b> on the circumference, or edge, of the wheel move faster than points on the circumference, or edge, of the axle. Therefore, a force applied {{to the edge of}} the wheel must be less than the force applied {{to the edge of the}} axle, because power is the product of force and velocity.|$|R
40|$|Utilization time {{of maximum}} power losses (UTL) {{has been applied}} for {{determination}} of energy losses in power grids. UTL is a parameter allowing for accurate estimation of energy losses. Using the maximum load time for UTL determination, better results {{can be achieved by}} decomposing the load duration graph (LDG) into two parts: the base and the delta ones. Bearing in mind that the latter occupies a smaller area of the entire LDG, the goal is achieved, since the errors can be caused only by the inaccuracy of delta part calculation. Based on this method it is possible to calculate UTL directly from the load graph and to achieve the same accuracy as with the classical method and with the smaller number of load measurements needed. By modifying this method once again, we can estimate UTL from the load graph based on its <b>bearing</b> <b>points</b> which are bending and flex points of the load time curve. The load time graph is decomposed into columns, each of them being contained between two neighboring <b>bearing</b> <b>points.</b> The UTL of each column is calculated to obtain the total UTL, which is the sought for value. The UTL of a column takes into account the minimum load value within the column, the maximum load time and the UTL of its upper part, both of the last quantities depending on the degree of the load curve diversion from a straight line...|$|R

5000|$|A {{roller screw}} is a {{mechanical}} actuator {{similar to a}} ball screw that uses rollers as the load transfer elements between nut and screw instead of balls.

Standard roller screw actuators can achieve dynamic load ratings above 130 tons of force (exceeded in single-unit actuator capacity only by hydraulic cylinders).|$|R
