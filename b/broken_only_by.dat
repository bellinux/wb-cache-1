25|$|This planar {{geometry}} and rectilinear nature are also echoed and scaled down {{in nearly every}} individual member of the structure’s interior and exterior façade. Metal paneling, glazing, exterior ornamentation are all representative of the buildings overall dimension. Furthermore, it is evident from any elevation, that rectilinear overlap has been transferred from plan to section. This relentless linearity is <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the two abstract pod shapes and the cylindrical columns, in {{what appears to be}} an intentional play by the architect to create interest and tension.|$|E
25|$|When {{her father}} died in 1826 she moved {{with her mother and}} sister to a small country house near Hülshoff called Rüschhaus. Here she led a constricted, {{monotonous}} existence, <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> a few trips to the Rhine and Bonn. She composed poetry, but not prolifically. In 1834 her sister Jenny married Joseph von Laßberg, a specialist in medieval German poetry. The following summer, Annette and her mother travelled to Laßberg's castle Eppishausen in the Swiss Alps. She was inspired by the scenery and on friendly terms with Laßberg, but neither he nor his friends appreciated modern literature and Droste's hopes that they might help her to publish her work came to nothing.|$|E
25|$|The Compromise proved widely popular politically, {{and both}} parties {{committed}} {{themselves in their}} platforms to the finality of the Compromise on sectional issues. The strongest opposition in the South occurred in the states of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, but Unionists soon prevailed, spearheaded by Georgians Alexander Stephens, Robert Toombs, and Howell Cobb {{and the creation of}} the Georgia Platform. The peace was <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the divisive Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 introduced by Stephen Douglas, which had the effect of repealing the Missouri Compromise and led directly to the formation of the Republican Party, whose capture of the national government in 1860 led directly to the secession crisis of 1860–1861.|$|E

25|$|In 758, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur {{attempted}} to strengthen diplomatic {{ties with the}} Khazars, ordering Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami, one of his nobles and the military governor of Armenia, to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan Baghatur, but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general Ras Tarkhan invaded south of the Caucasus in 762–764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.|$|E
25|$|That night, four Royal Thai Army 105mm howitzers were smuggled {{across the}} Mekong into Chinamiao, {{with one of}} them {{becoming}} embarrassingly stuck in Mekong sand until it was freed at dawn. At 11:30 on 15 December, GMS 1 entered Vientiane from the north, only to be stopped by PAVN artillery and small arms fire from Wattay. At 13:30, Kouprasith sent 80 troops in an attempted amphibious landing to cut off Kong Le's retreat, but the waterborne force overshot its objective. Meantime, BP 1 paratroopers loyal to Phoumi moved door to door hunting down Kong Le's BP 2 paratroopers who had been isolated, but continued to snipe away.

25|$|Sampras {{was known}} for his natural attacking serve-and-volley game, all-round game, and strong {{competitive}} instinct. Sampras's best surface was undoubtedly the fast-playing grass courts, Sampras won seven Wimbledon titles (1993–95, 1997-2000), <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> a loss in the 1996 quarterfinals to eventual winner Richard Krajicek, tying him with William Renshaw and one behind Roger Federer for the most titles in Wimbledon history. Sampras also shares the record of five US Open titles in the Open Era with Jimmy Connors and Federer. He won back-to-back US Open titles in 1995 and 1996, despite vomiting on the court at 1–1 in the final set tiebreak due to dehydration in the 1996 quarterfinals against Àlex Corretja. Combined with his two Australian Open titles, this gave Sampras a total of fourteen majors won on grass and hard courts.|$|E

25|$|The English Electric Canberra is a {{twin-engine}} bomber aircraft, {{capable of}} conducting high-altitude flights and {{making use of}} jet propulsion. The overall design {{has been described as}} being of a simple nature, somewhat resembling a scaled-up Gloster Meteor fighter, except for its use of a mid-wing. The Canberra principally differed from its preceding piston-powered wartime bombers via its twin Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. The fuselage was circular in cross section, tapered at both ends and, cockpit aside, entirely without protrusions; the line of the large, low-aspect ratio wings was <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the tubular engine nacelles. The Canberra had a two-man crew under a fighter-style cabin which was furnished with a large blown canopy, but delays {{in the development of the}} intended automatic radar bombsight resulted in the addition of a bomb aimer's position housed within the nose. The pilot and navigator were positioned in a tandem arrangement on Martin-Baker ejection seats.|$|E

Most characteristic of all is the Baroque spire of the Church of Our Saviour with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top. Other important spires are those of Christiansborg Palace, the City Hall and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a modern art venue. Not quite so high are the Renaissance spires of Rosenborg Castle and the [...] "dragon spire" [...] of Christian IV's former stock exchange, so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.|$|E

500|$|At {{his young}} age, Middleton was {{required}} to complete a year of preparatory school before being enrolled in the four-year program at Mississippi A In essence he did a final {{year of high school}} while living in the dormitory and following the regimen of the students at the college. [...] The students were treated like cadets at a military academy, marching to and from all meals, and beginning their day with the first bugle call at 5:30a.m. Every week day was the same: cleanup and study time in the morning, march to breakfast, a usually short chapel call, classes from 8:30 to 4:00, <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> lunch, athletics from 4:00 to 6:30p.m., dinner, and then study from 7:30 to 10:00p.m., followed by the playing of taps at 10:30, and lights out at 10:40. While Middleton did not particularly savor the military atmosphere, he settled into the routine, and the year passed quickly. [...] The highlight of his preparatory year came on 10 February 1905 when John Philip Sousa brought his band to A, attracting people from around the state, and packing the 2000-seat mess hall. The train that would take the band to its next stop was held up for over an hour as the concert was extended by repeated calls for encores.|$|E
500|$|There {{are various}} names for this {{topographic}} feature. The Metacomet Ridge {{is described by}} some sources as a traprock ridge beginning on the Holyoke Range in Belchertown, Massachusetts, and ending at the Hanging Hills in Meriden, Connecticut. A 2004 report conducted for the National Park Service extends that definition to include the entire traprock ridgeline from Greenfield, Massachusetts, to Long Island Sound. The Sierra Club has referred to the entire range in Connecticut as [...] "The Traprock Ridge". Geologically and visually, the traprock ridgeline exists as one continuous landscape feature from Belchertown, Massachusetts, to Branford, Connecticut at Long Island Sound, a distance of , <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> the river gorges of the Farmington River in northern Connecticut and the Westfield and Connecticut Rivers in Massachusetts. [...] Until January 2008, the United States Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) did not recognize Metacomet Ridge, Traprock Ridge or any other name, although several sub-ranges were identified. Geologists usually refer to the overall range generically as [...] "the traprock ridge" [...] or [...] "the traprock mountains" [...] or refer to it with regard to its prehistoric geologic significance in technical terms. Further complicating the matter {{is the fact that}} traprock only accounts for the highest surface layers of rock strata on the southern three–fourths of the range; an underlying geology of related sedimentary rock is also a part {{of the structure of the}} ridge; in north central Massachusetts it becomes the dominant strata and extends the range geologically from the Holyoke Range another [...] through Greenfield to nearly the Vermont border. This article describes the entire Metacomet Ridge and all geologic extensions of it.|$|E
