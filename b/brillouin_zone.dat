25|$|These Bloch {{wave energy}} eigenstates are written with {{subscripts}} as ψn k, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present {{because there are}} many different Bloch waves with the same k (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), ψn k varies continuously with k, as does its energy. Also, for any reciprocal lattice vector K, ψn k = ψn,(k+K). Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first <b>Brillouin</b> <b>zone</b> of the reciprocal lattice.|$|E
25|$|Optical phonons have a non-zero {{frequency}} at the <b>Brillouin</b> <b>zone</b> {{center and}} show no dispersion near that long wavelength limit. This {{is because they}} correspond to a mode of vibration where positive and negative ions at adjacent lattice sites swing against each other, creating a time-varying electrical dipole moment. Optical phonons that interact in this way with light are called infrared active. Optical phonons that are Raman active can also interact indirectly with light, through Raman scattering. Optical phonons are often abbreviated as LO and TO phonons, for the longitudinal and transverse modes respectively; the splitting between LO and TO frequencies is often described accurately by the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation.|$|E

We calculate the quasi-energy spectrum of the periodically driven Heterostructure by using the Floquet's theory. When the interaction between different <b>Brillouin</b> <b>zones</b> of quasi-energy is neglected, one Majorana fermion can be created at each edge of the Heterostructure when the ratio of driven amplitude and driven frequency is larger than a minimum. Furthermore, when the interaction between the nearest <b>Brillouin</b> <b>zones</b> of quasi-energy is considered, we restrict the condition of creating Majorana fermions above with a lower limit of the driven frequency.
