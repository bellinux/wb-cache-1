A British general {{election}} {{was held in}} 1951 and the Conservatives gained power. Labour, mindful of the overwhelming opposition of Africans from both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and of the Colonial Office mandate to oversee native interests, had been lukewarm at best {{to the idea of}} federation, and had been wholly opposed to amalgamation. After the election, the bipartisan approach to federation broke down and the British laws for its creation passed only {{with the support of the}} Conservatives, with both Liberal and Labour Parties now opposed.|$|E

Just as the sale was completed, the October 1989 earthquake struck the city, damaging an old add-on closet on the north wing of the building. The damaged section {{as well as an}} old water tower were removed. Kimmel who also had properties in downtown Santa Cruz went into bankruptcy due to damages to all of his properties. Brad Ahekian, attempted to reorganize Kimmel's properties but failed and abandoned the property in July 1992. The building went into court-ordered receivership that was held by Brighton Pacific. It was then picked up in September 1992 by David Luchessi, an investor of Kimmel's.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action <b>done</b> by <b>the</b> sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works while someone else was singing. A secondary action <b>done</b> previously by <b>the</b> sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a secondary action in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works before someone else started to sing.|$|R

25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} air preheater. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E

500|$|Within {{his first}} year on Coronation Street, Thompson had acted out scenes that {{involved}} his character stealing a car, graffiting {{the wall of the}} local newsagents, and discovering that his mother's fiancée was having a gay affair with her male best friend. Still impressed with Thompson's acting ability, producers of the series had his contract extended to 2009. Reflecting on {{his first year}} in the soap, Thompson said: [...] "It's been a really strange year and a lot of things have happened. It's been absolutely brilliant. The filming is everything that I could have wanted it to be. It's fantastic and I enjoy it more than anything."

500|$|During {{his ninth}} season in 1966, Taylor did not sign a new one-year {{contract}} and instead played out his option; {{he made no}} secret that it was likely his last season with the Packers. He caught a career-high 41 passes that year but recorded the fewest rushing yards since his second season. The Packers finished atop the Western Division with a 12–2 record and defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the 1966 NFL Championship Game for their fourth NFL title in six years. In January 1967, Taylor and the Packers played in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game, known retroactively as Super Bowl I, in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. They easily defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 35–10. Taylor was the top rusher of the game with 56 rushing {{yards and a touchdown}} on a Packer Sweep play, with his score being the first rushing touchdown in Super Bowl history. [...] "It was just good blocking on a weak-side sweep play," [...] said Taylor of his touchdown run. [...] "It's a cakewalk when you get the blocking. It was just like we had <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> last five or six years." [...] The game was his final with the Packers.|$|E
500|$|In late 1847, Marx and Engels {{began writing}} {{what was to}} become their most famous work — a {{programme}} of action for the Communist League. Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, The Communist Manifesto was first published on 21 February 1848. The Communist Manifesto laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League. No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the League of the Just had <b>been</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>The</b> opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism: [...] "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the bourgeoisie (the wealthy capitalist class) and the proletariat (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the Manifesto presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting {{in the interests of the}} proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E

500|$|Businessweek {{attributed}} the sales success of Mandatory Fun to the viral music video campaign. ABC World News elaborated that Yankovic's success {{is in part}} due to the Internet's interest in viral and humorous videos catching up with what Yankovic has been doing for his entire career. Yankovic himself was amazed with the response he got from the album and video releases, stating that [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same thing for 30 years {{and all of a sudden}} I'm having the best week of my life" [...] and that he [...] "kind of stumbled on my formula for the future". He also stated, [...] "A No. 1 album is something I never had in my wildest dreams ever thought would be a reality." [...] The total collection of videos had acquired more than 46 million views within 10 days of the album's release, and six of the eight videos reached the top position on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time Trending 140 chart during that week. In contrast, Yankovic's video for [...] "Perform This Way", the lead single off Alpocalypse, only received 16.8 million views in the three years since its release, while an individual video from Mandatory Fun, like [...] "Tacky", received 12.8 million views within the first week.

500|$|The {{series has}} also been criticized for its release model in {{contrast}} to the Rock Band series, causing some players to hold contempt towards Activision. Harmonix considered the Rock Band series as a [...] "music platform", and [...] supported it with downloadable content and the ability to import songs from its games and expansions into most other games of the series. Critics argued that Guitar Hero should have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same, either through releasing expansions that could be incorporated into the main games of the series, or by issuing the songs as downloadable content. The release of Guitar Hero: Smash Hits, reworking older songs from the series to full four-instrument band support but otherwise adding no additional material, was called [...] "the definition of 'milking'" [...] by reviewers, with no observable technical limitation as to why the songs could not be added as downloadable content. Ars Technica recognized that licensing issues might have limited when songs from one single game could be played in others of the series (such as the case for [...] ), but that such cross-compatibility should have been a high priority for rhythm games. Furthermore, some expansions were praised for the additional content beyond the note-matching gameplay; Guitar Hero: Metallica is considered {{to be one of the}} series' best works to be developed by Neversoft in part due to the care that the developers took with imaging the band and the available extras for the game. Activision later revealed that both Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero would support playing songs from both Guitar Hero World Tour (both on-disc and downloadable content) and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, with music licensing being the only limiting factor on which songs could be made forward-compatible.|$|E
