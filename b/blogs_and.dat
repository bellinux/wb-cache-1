Stories of unexpected billing issues began to circulate in <b>blogs</b> <b>and</b> the technical press after the Apple iPhone's heavily advertised and anticipated release, but this video clip brought the voluminous bills to the attention of the mass media.|$|E

The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by over 12million people, but Studio 60 experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season. The seething anticipation {{that preceded the}} début was followed up by {{a large amount of}} thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as largely negative analysis in the blogosphere. In January 2007, Sorkin spoke out against the press for focusing too heavily on the ratings slide and for using <b>blogs</b> <b>and</b> unemployed comedy writers as sources. After two months on hiatus, Studio 60 resumed to air the last episodes of season one, which would be its only season.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} psychological {{aspects of}} the Internet practice of blogging, including blogging practices, <b>blogging</b> motives <b>and</b> engagement in identity exploration in emerging adulthood. Emerging adulthood is a theory of human development that proposes a new life stage between adolescence and adulthood stemming from recent societal changes (Arnett, 2000). Specifically, the study predicted that a relationship would exist between blogging motives, identity exploration, identification with themes of emerging adulthood and age. Participants were 182 bloggers aged between 18 and 57 years who maintain an English language lifestyle blog. They completed an online questionnaire comprising measures of identification with the themes of emerging adulthood, blogging practices, motives for <b>blogging,</b> <b>and</b> identity exploration through blogging. Results highlighted the personal nature of <b>blogging</b> <b>and</b> the strong link between the <b>blog</b> <b>and</b> "real life". The most popular motives for <b>blogging</b> were Self-Expression <b>and</b> Social Interaction, and results indicated that many bloggers do not believe they are engaging in identity exploration. There was a weak relationship between developmental life stage <b>and</b> <b>blogging</b> motives <b>and</b> identity exploration. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|R
