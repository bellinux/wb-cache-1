5|$|The {{son of a}} {{distinguished}} Norwegian family, Sverdrup emigrated to the United States in 1914. After serving with the US Army in World War I, he {{earned a degree in}} civil engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1921. He worked for a time for the Missouri State Highway Department before founding Sverdrup & Parcel, a civil engineering firm specializing in bridge construction, with John Ira Parcel, his former University of Minnesota engineering professor. His firm was involved in the construction of a number of important bridges, including the Washington Bridge and Amelia Earhart <b>Bridge</b> <b>over</b> the Missouri River and the Hurricane Deck <b>Bridge</b> <b>over</b> the Lake of the Ozarks.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present some}} results on systems for {{automatically}} detecting bridges in high-resolution (2. 5 m) panchromatic IKONOS satellite images using texture information, geometric models, and combinations of both. A system using simple geometric models gives good results for <b>bridges</b> <b>over</b> roads and railroads, and very bad results for <b>bridges</b> <b>over</b> larger regions such as rivers. In contrast, a system using a texture-based classification and hand-made rules applied to that classification gives good results for <b>bridges</b> <b>over</b> rivers and railroads, and bad results for <b>bridges</b> <b>over</b> roads. We have explored several methods for combining both approaches {{to achieve an}} improved detection rate with only a moderate increase in the false alarm rate. Validation showed an increase in detection rate from 57 % (geometry-based) and 33 % (texture-based) to 71 % (best combined system) ...|$|R

5|$|A {{support wall}} was built at Sørlia, {{just south of}} Steinkjer, after there was a clay landslide. Construction of the <b>bridge</b> <b>over</b> Figgja, just south of Steinkjer, was {{performed}} in 1904. The superstructure was built by Kværner of Oslo and installed between 11 November and 21 December 1904. The <b>bridge</b> <b>over</b> Steinkjerelva took up {{a significant portion of}} the old river port in Steinkjer, resulting in a spur being built to a new port location. The railway ran right through the town center, forcing 20 houses to be demolished and splitting the town in two. The arrival and route of the railway was described by some locals as vandalism. A counter-proposal which saw the line run further up and cross through Steinkjersannan and Furuskogen—and thus avoid the town itself—was discarded because it would wreck the military camp at Steinkjersannan and would be located too far from the port. There was also a major debate as to whether the station should be on the south side or north side of the river. The municipal council voted for the south side with the mayor's double vote being decisive. Construction of the <b>bridge</b> <b>over</b> Steinkjerelva started in August 1902 and was completed on 7 May 1904. A proposal to build the bridge as a swing bridge was dropped, forcing the railways to pay NOK45,402 in compensation to companies with facilities upstream.|$|E
