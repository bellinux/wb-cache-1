5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties that resulted from poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these claims are valid or not, there can <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the entire campaign was poorly conducted, {{and as a result}} there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage {{and the development of a}} sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} here is that, {{from this}} time onwards, the Hiberno-Scandinavian ruler would hold his kingship from his Munster overlord. Brian, at this stage, aspired to an even tighter dominance of Dublin that than secured by his rival, Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill , ten years earlier. There seems to <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the longer term beneficiary of Glenn Máma was Brian alone. With renewed confidence, he again moved against Máel Sechnaill| Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, even if his initiatives of 1000-1001 resulted in setbacks, one expedition into Brega resulted in his advance cavalry being slaughtered by the Uí Néill, another foray was reversed in Míde (Co Westmeath), and the Dál Cais river-fleet was impeded by the King of Tara and his Connachta allies having constructed a barrier across the Shannon. Brian, however, found a way of circumventing hit and, early in 1002, brought a large army through to Athlone and took the hostages of Connacht.|$|E

25|$|Using {{a normal}} {{distribution}} one can estimate the return period of 1950-level annual rainfall for the Dubbo region as around 375 years, or {{about three times}} the length of instrumental rainfall data.

25|$|On 10 February 1954, a {{few days}} after he talked to Pietro Scaglione, an {{assistant}} prosecutor from Palermo, Aspanu Pisciotta was assassinated by poison in his cell at Ucciardone Prison in Palermo while breakfasting with his cellmate father. The dose was a substantial 20 centigrams of strychnine, enough to kill 40 dogs. There can <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> elements of Mafia committed the crime, with the blessing of the conservative and reactionary politicians with whom they were connected. When Ciro Verdiani and Cusumano Geloso died before their natural life expectancies, suspicions of poisoning were voiced. Benedetto Minasola was murdered in 1960. The Mafioso suspected of poisoning Pisciotta was shot in 1961, and Scaglione was killed by the Mafia while serving as Prosecutor General of Palermo in 1971.|$|E
25|$|His {{advances}} must {{be attributed}} {{mainly to the}} influence of his contemporary Rasmus Christian Rask. Rask was born two years later than Grimm, but his remarkable precocity set him beyond his years. In Grimm's first editions, his Icelandic paradigms are based entirely on Rask's grammar, and in his second edition, he relied almost entirely on Rask for Old English. His debt to Rask can be appreciated only by comparing his treatment of Old English in the two editions; the difference is very great. For example, in the first edition he declines dæg, dæges, plural dægas, without having observed the law of vowel-change pointed out by Rask. (The correct plural is dagas.) There can <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the appearance of Rask's Old English grammar was the primary impetus for Grimm to recast his work from the beginning. To Rask also belongs the merit of having first distinctly formulated the laws of sound-correspondence in the different languages, especially in the vowels (those more fleeting elements of speech previously ignored by etymologists).|$|E

[...] The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911, when Gaston Méliès directed The Immortal Alamo. The battle became more widely known after it was featured in the 1950s Disney miniseries Davy Crockett, which was largely based on myth. Within several years, John Wayne directed and starred {{in one of the}} best-known, but questionably accurate, film versions, 1960's The Alamo. In 2004 another film, also called The Alamo, was released. CNN described it as possibly [...] "the most character-driven of all the movies made on the subject". It is also considered more faithful to the actual events than other movies.|$|E
500|$|In Darwin's {{time there}} was no {{agreed-upon}} model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, [...] "The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown." [...] He accepted {{a version of the}} inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought [...] "there can <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism.|$|E

500|$|Palairet's {{university}} {{performances were}} {{good enough to}} earn him selection for the Gentlemen against the Players in the prestigious matches at Lord's and The Oval. Returning to Somerset, he struck a century against Gloucestershire in early July, In late August, playing Yorkshire, Palairet scored 132 out of a partnership of 346 with Hewett, establishing a record for the first wicket in first-class cricket, surpassing W. G. Grace and Bransby Cooper's 1869 total of 283. Although their record has since been beaten in first-class cricket, it remains Somerset's record partnership for the first wicket. Their partnership was described as [...] "Pure grace at one end, sheer force at the other", in H.S. Altham and E. W. Swanton's A History of Cricket. At the time, The Daily Telegraph reported that the pair remained together {{for three and a}} half hours, during which Palairet scored one six and nineteen fours. At the end of the season, he was selected in two representative sides: appearing for the West against the East, and once again for the Gentlemen against the Players, on this occasion at Hastings. In all first-class matches that year, he scored 1,343 runs, the third most of any cricketer. He was named as one of the Five Batsmen of the Year by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1893, which noted that [...] "there can <b>be</b> <b>little</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> even greater distinction awaits him in the cricket world." ...|$|E
