50|$|Gravity {{delivers}} the apatite ore, carbon (coke) and silica (gravel) to the submerged-arc furnace through feed chutes {{situated in the}} roof of the furnace. This ensures a constant packed <b>bed</b> <b>volume.</b> The gaseous product, a mixture of carbon monoxide and phosphorus gas, leaves the furnace through two symmetrically placed outlet vents situated above the ferrophosphorus tap hole in {{the roof of the}} furnace. The ferrophosphorus is tapped off, usually once per day. Slag, however, is continuously tapped through two alternating, water-cooled tap holes located 400 mm above the furnace floor. The feed material forms the major electrical and flow resistance of the smelting furnace circuit. As the feed materials descend towards the hot zone in the furnace, they start to soften and melt, significantly lowering the electrical resistance. A conductive path is thus provided between the electrodes where the Joule heating is released to attain the high temperatures and energy levels needed to effect the essential endothermic reactions.|$|E

When phosphorous recovery from sludge liquor was investigated, experimental data fitted quite well Generalized Langmuir – Freundlich isotherm (R 2 = 0. 92 for the new resin and R 2 = 0. 96 for the regenerated resin); the maximum adsorption capacity being 14. 2 and 14. 4 mg P/g respectively.

A solvent screening was performed and it was found that phenol based extractants have the highest potential.

40|$|The Irradiated Materials Examination and Testing (IMET) Facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory electropolishes {{various types}} of {{irradiated}} metal specimens prior to examination of metallurgical and mechanical properties. The standard electropolishing solution used at IMET for most specimens consists of a 7 : 1 methanol/sulfuric acid mixture, with smaller amounts of a 3 : 1 methanol/nitric acid solution and a 10 : 6 : 1 methanol/ 2 -butoxyethanol/perchloric acid solution also being used. Cobalt- 60 is {{the primary source of}} gamma radiation in the spent solutions, with lesser amounts from manganese- 54 and iron- 59. A treatment method is needed to remove most of the Co- 60 from these solutions to allow the waste solutions to be contact-handled for disposal. A wide range of adsorbents was tested for removing cobalt from the electropolishing solutions. No adsorbent was found that would treat full strength solution, but a complexing ion exchange resin (Chelex 100, BioRad Labs, or Amberlite IRC- 718, Rohm and Haas Co.) will remove cobalt and other heavy metals from partially neutralized (pH= 3) solution.

Drainage pH ranged from around 5 to about 7. 5, total Cu ranged from about 0. 01 to 3 mg/l, and Co from about 0. 008 to 0. 02 mg/l.

A new composite biosorbent has been prepared by coating chitosan onto acid treated oil palm shell charcoal (AOPSC). Chitosan loading on the AOPSC support is about 21 % by weight. The shape of the adsorbent is nearly spherical with particle diameter ranging 100 ~ 150 µm. The adsorption capacity of the composite biosorbent was evaluated by measuring the extent of adsorption of chromium metal ions from water under equilibrium conditions at 25 ºC. Using Langmuir isotherm model, the equilibrium data yielded the following ultimate capacity values for the coated biosorbent on a per gram basis of chitosan: 154 mg Cr/g.
