[...] With pickoffs, Molina throws from behind left-handed batters to obfuscate the runner's view of his motion to first base. [...] <b>Besides</b> <b>studying</b> hitters at the plate, Molina also studies base runners to watch their decision-making process about stealing bases or when they are less guarded against a pickoff.

60|$|Father Adolf had {{actually}} met Satan {{face to face}} more than once, and defied him. This {{was known to be}} so. Father Adolf said it himself. He never made any secret of it, but spoke it right out. And that he was speaking true there was proof in at least one instance, for on that occasion he quarreled with the enemy, and intrepidly threw his bottle at him; and there, upon the wall of his study, was the ruddy splotch where it struck and broke. But it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and were sorriest for. Some people charged him with talking around in conversation that God was all goodness and {{would find a way to}} save all his poor human children. It was a horrible thing to say, but there was never any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it was out of character for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and truthful. He wasn't charged with saying it in the pulpit, where all the congregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it is easy for enemies to manufacture that. Father Peter had an enemy and a very powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up the valley, and put in his nights studying the stars. Every one knew he could foretell wars and famines, though that was not so hard, for there was always a war, and generally a famine somewhere. But he could also read any man's life through the stars in a big book he had, and find lost property, and every one in the village except Father Peter stood in awe of him. Even Father Adolf, who had defied the Devil, had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his tall, pointed hat and his long, flowing robe with stars on it, carrying his big book, and a staff which was known to have magic power. The bishop himself sometimes listened to the astrologer, it was said, for, <b>besides</b> <b>studying</b> the stars and prophesying, the astrologer made a great show of piety, which would impress the bishop, of course.|$|E

40|$|Abstract It {{is asked}} to which extent the impact of {{religion}} and religious beliefs can be influential in architectural works. Historically, it seems that {{a study on the}} transformation in religious beliefs can be of great importance to track this impact. Advent of Islam into Iran and change of religion in Iran can be {{known as one of the}} most influential transformations in people’s beliefs, followed by abundant consequences at social, cultural and art areas. Architecture, as one of manifestations of culture and civilization, indicates many transformations, beliefs and willingness of a community. Thus, hesitation in social events and attention to change of religion at the early Islamic centuries <b>besides</b> <b>study</b> on architectural and decorative features at this period and their comparison with the period of past can help to give response to the raised question. In this study, the relationship between social and religious developments analyzed. The developments at architectural and decorative areas are also examined...|$|R
40|$|The physics {{programme}} of the ALICE experiment at CERN-LHC comprises <b>besides</b> <b>studies</b> of high-energy heavy-ion collisions {{measurements of}} proton-proton interactions at unprecedented energies, too. This paper {{focuses on the}} global event characterisation {{in terms of the}} multiplicity distribution of charged hadrons and mean transverse momentum. These bulk observables become accessible because the detector features excellent track reconstruction, especially at low transverse momenta. The measurement of strange hadrons is of particular interest since the strange-particle phase-space was found to be suppressed beyond canonical reduction at lower center-of-mass energies and the production mechanism of soft particles is not yet fully understood. Here we benefit in particular from particle identification down to very low transverse momentum, i. e. 100 - 300 MeV/c, giving access to spectra and integrated yields of identified hadrons. Equipped with these features, ALICE will play a complementary role w. r. t. other LHC experiments. New interest in the soft part of pp collisions arose recently and new insights in the physics of the underlying event are expected from both, theory and experiment. ...|$|R
