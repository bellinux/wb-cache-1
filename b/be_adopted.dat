Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states would now be necessary for the article to <b>be</b> <b>adopted.</b>|$|E

They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to <b>be</b> <b>adopted</b> by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
