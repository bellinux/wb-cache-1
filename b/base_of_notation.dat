We propose algorithms for page segmentation, lyrics removal, syntactical symbol grouping and the determination of characteristic page dimensions. All algorithms are experimentally evaluated {{on a variety of}} printed books for which we also give an optimal feature set for a nearest neighbour classifier. The system is based on the Gamera framework for document image analysis. Given that we cover all aspects of the recognition process, the paper can also serve as an illustration how a recognition system for a non standard document type can be designed from scratch...|$|R
5000|$|The {{presentation}} of the Krivine machine given here is <b>based</b> on <b>notations</b> <b>of</b> lambda terms <b>based</b> that use de Bruijn indices and assumes that the terms of which it computes the head normal forms are closed. It modifies the current state until it cannot do it anymore, in which case it obtains a head normal form. This head normal form represents {{the result of the}} computation or yields an error, meaning that the term it started from is not correct. However, it can enter an infinite sequence of transitions, which means that the term it attempts reducing has no head normal form and corresponds to a non terminating computation.|$|R

The theory <b>of</b> optimal control <b>based</b> on <b>notations</b> <b>of</b> the measure theory, functional analysis and linear programming (LP), is applied in order to optimize the shape of the zone of the incoming branch of the bypass (the toe) into the coronary. First the problem is expressed as a shape optimization problem by adding a suitable criteria, where the problem is governed by variational form on a fixed domain. By using an embedding method, the class of admissible shapes is replaced by a class of positive Radon measures. Then optimization problem in measure space is approximated by a LP problem...|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> {{occurs when}} an author uses a {{mathematical}} notation {{in a way}} that is not formally correct but that seems likely to simplify the exposition or suggest the correct intuition (while being unlikely to introduce errors or cause confusion). However, the concept of formal correctness depends on time and on the context. Therefore, many notations in mathematics are qualified as abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> in some context and are formally correct in other contexts; as many notations were introduced a long time before any formalization of the theory in which they are used, the qualification <b>of</b> abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> is strongly time dependent. Moreover, many abuses <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> may be made formally correct by improving the theory. Abuse <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> should be contrasted with misuse <b>of</b> <b>notation,</b> which should be avoided.|$|R

40|$|A {{notation}} system was previously presented which can notate any rational frequency in free Just Intonation. Transposition {{of music is}} carried out by multiplying each {{member of a set}} of frequencies by a single frequency. Transposition <b>of</b> JI <b>notations</b> up by a fixed amount requires multiplication to be defined for any two notations. Transposition down requires inversion to be defined for any notation, which allows division to also be defined for any two notations. Each notation splits into four components which in decreasing size order are octave, diatonic scale note, sharps or flats, rational comma adjustment. Multiplication can be defined for each <b>of</b> the four <b>notation</b> components. Since rational number multiplication is commutative, this leads to a definition of multiplication for frequencies and thus <b>notations.</b> Examples <b>of</b> <b>notation</b> inversion and multiplication are given. Examples of transposing melodies are given. These are checked for accuracy using the rational numbers which each notation represents. Calculation shortcuts are considered which make notation operations quicker to carry out by hand. A question regarding whether rational commas should be extended from 5 -rough rational numbers to all rational numbers is considered which would greatly simplify notation multiplication. This approach is rejected since it leads to confusion about octave number. The four component {{notation system}} is recommended instead. Extensions to computer notation systems and stave representations are briefly mentioned. Comment: This fourth draft has substantially rewritten the paper to focus on notation transposition only. The prime comma algorithm is now presented in a separate paper, and the previous approach <b>of</b> <b>basing</b> <b>notation</b> on a multiplicative function is dropped in favour <b>of</b> a hybrid <b>notation.</b> Peer review and journal publication are intended at some point, all comments and relevant feedback gratefully receive...|$|R

40|$|Subdivision is a {{powerful}} method for smooth visualization of coarse meshes. An initial mesh of arbitrary topology is subsequently subdivided until the surface appears smooth and visually pleasing. Because of {{the simplicity of the}} algorithms and their data structure they have achieved much attention. Most schemes exhibit undesirable artifacts in the case of irregular topology. A more general description of subdivision algorithms is required to be able to avoid artifacts by changing parameters and also the topology of subdivision. We develop a partition of the algorithms to sub-algorithms and combinatoric mappings. An algebraic notation enables the description of calculations on the mesh and steering the algorithm by a configuration file. Opposite to index <b>based</b> <b>notation</b> <b>of</b> tensor-product surfaces the algebraic notation is even applicable for irregular and non-tensor-product surfaces. Variations of these sub-algorithms and mappings lead to known and new subdivision schemes. Further, the [...] ...|$|R
