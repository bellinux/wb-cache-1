To this end, formal definitions for agricultural produce, actual import data, applied <b>tariff</b> data and <b>bound</b> <b>tariff</b> rates and <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> information were used to investigate the extent to which it is possible and feasible to increase tariffs. The analysis shows that in general the policy space available to South African agriculture is limited because of, among others, WTO binding and treaty obligations under the EU and SADC agreements.

The {{international}} dairy sector {{is one of}} the most heavily protected commodity sectors in agriculture. Following the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade liberalization all nontariff barriers to trade were converted, through the process of tariffication, into tariffs. However, in the dairy sector, the border measure most commonly adopted by developed countries was a system of <b>tariff</b> rate <b>quotas.</b> <b>Tariff</b> rate <b>quotas</b> are two-tiered <b>tariffs</b> which allow a small quantity of the product to be imported at a low or zero tariff, while quantities above the minimum access amount are charged much higher and often prohibitive <b>tariffs.</b> <b>Tariff</b> rate <b>quotas</b> cause the excess supply curve facing an importing country to be discontinuous at the minimum access amount.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{liberalization}} studies can be influenced decisively by {{the methodology of}} import tariff aggregation. This article deals with different measures used to aggregate import tariffs. Therefore, {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of different aggregation measures are discussed theoretically. In the empirical part of the paper, the simple average and the trade-weighted average of <b>bound</b> and applied <b>tariffs</b> are calculated for different agricultural products of the EU. The analysis considers ad valorem and specific tariffs as well as <b>tariff</b> rate <b>quotas.</b> Additionally, for the applied tariffs, a distinction is made between MFN-tariffs and bilateral preferential tariff rates. Using the same data base, the product specific Trade Restrictiveness Index (TRI) and the Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index (MTRI) are calculated. Because of the poor data availability at the detailed tariff-line level, a simple partial equilibrium application of these indices is implemented, which can be extended to the whole import tariff data base of an economic trade model. The results show a strong correlation between all aggregation methods, but the size of the import tariffs differs highly, depending on the aggregation measure used. Furthermore, high differences between <b>bound</b> and applied <b>tariffs</b> for some EU agricultural products are calculated. agriculture in international trade, <b>tariff</b> aggregation, <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs,</b> applied tariffs, Trade Restrictiveness Index (TRI), Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index (MTRI), Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

Analysts use such measures as arithmetic or trade-weighted average tariffs, Non-Tariff Barrier (NTB) coverage ratios and measures of tariff dispersion. All such measures are without theoretical foundation. In this paper we develop and characterise a theoretically-based index number of trade policy which is appropriate to trade negotiations. We characterize an index of trade policy restrictiveness defined as the uniform tariff equivalent which maintains the same volume of trade as a given set of <b>tariffs,</b> <b>quotas,</b> and domestic taxes and subsidies. We relate this volume-equivalent index to the Trade Restrictiveness Index, a welfare-equivalent measure, and relate changes in both indexes to changes in the generalised mean and variance of the tariff schedule. Applications to international cross-section and time-series comparisons of trade policy show that the new index frequently gives a very different picture than do standard indexes.

40|$|The use of tariff-rate quotas as a {{protectionist}} device has not {{yet been}} quite well understood. There is a widespread understanding that the offer of an additional <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> will generate a growth in the volume exported equivalent to the extra amount yielded. However, this may not happen, due to the characteristics of the tariff-quota system. Given the demand curve for a certain product, only one of the three components of the tariff-quota mechanism is determinant in restraining imports: the volume of the quota, the in-quota or the extra-quota. In addition, the estimate of gains in the value exported must include the increase in the ?quota-rent? allowed by the additional quota. This paper aims to point out the importance of an accurate assessment of the effects of additional <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> for some Brazilian agricultural exports. The study focuses on the case of the offer made by the European Union in the negotiations for a Mercosur-EU free trade agreement. ...|$|R

40|$|After {{joining the}} WTO in 2002, Taiwan allowed rice imports {{for the first}} time by {{implementing}} an import quota subject to a special safeguard tariff. In 2003, the import quota was expanded to a two-tier <b>tariff</b> rate import <b>quota</b> system. Although Taiwan maintained land set-asides and domestic support prices for producer sales to the State Trading Enterprise, the latter was limited to importing only 65 percent of the import quota with the rest sold to private traders. This sudden transformation of the Taiwanese import regime and rice market along with the government proposal for a "strategic alliance" amongst traders highlights the importance of studying the effects of policy reforms in the framework of imperfect domestic market structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Taiwanese rice policy reforms using a computational partial equilibrium model. The impact of import controls, price supports, land set-aside and alternative market structures are assessed, including the potential change in regimes within the <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> system. Our results show that the "strategic alliance" proposed by the agricultural authority will further distort the domestic market. Elimination of the domestic support price and land set-aside improves social welfare independent of the market structure while a change in the market structure towards competition is always social welfare improving regardless of domestic policy instruments. But the policy regime of the <b>tariff</b> <b>quota</b> (the in-quota <b>tariff</b> versus the out-of-quota <b>tariff</b> versus the <b>quota)</b> and hence social welfare is sensitive to changes in both domestic policy instruments and market structure. <b>tariff</b> rate <b>quota,</b> strategic alliance, domestic support, market structure, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|R
