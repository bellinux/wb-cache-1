The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven {{games in the}} conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals. They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> won the series in five games.|$|E
5|$|The land in question, {{which had}} been part of the Seneca Nation's {{traditional}} territory for centuries before the American Revolution, comprised part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a tract of land disputed after the war between claims of New York and Massachusetts. By a December 16, 1786 interstate compact, the states agreed that Massachusetts would retain the proprietary rights and the pre-emption rights, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> would retain governmental rights. After the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, the federal government ratified their compact.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{as in the}} UK, the Hicklin test of {{obscenity}} applied, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> {{case law}} had established that books should be judged by their effects on adults rather than on children and that literary merit was relevant. Ernst obtained statements from authors including Dreiser, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Upton Sinclair, Ellen Glasgow and John Dos Passos. Besides, freedom of expression was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. To make sure these supporters did not go unheard, he incorporated their opinions into his brief. His argument relied on a comparison with Mademoiselle de Maupin by Théophile Gautier, which had been cleared of obscenity in the 1922 case Halsey v. New York. Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The Well did. According to Ernst, The Well had greater social value because it was more serious in tone and made a case against misunderstanding and intolerance.|$|E
50|$|Three {{nights later}} on October 4, 1975, the Colonels met the NBA's <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Knicks at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. Louie Dampier scored 23 for the Colonels <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> Earl Monroe led all scorers with 26 as the Knicks won 107-102.|$|R
50|$|Other cities, like Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, {{had good}} natural harbors, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> {{advantage}} over other {{cities of the}} Eastern Seaboard was that the Hudson River and the Erie Canal formed the only water-level route through the Appalachian Mountains.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E

25|$|On the Giants next possession, {{they scored}} on a 12-play, 57-yard drive in which they burned the 49ers with a fake field goal, {{starting}} out in normal kicking formation before switching into a shotgun formation with holder Jeff Rutledge as the quarterback. San Francisco's field goal blocking unit was caught without enough defensive backs {{on the field and}} Rutledge ended up throwing the ball to a wide open Bavaro for a 23-yard gain on the 49ers 5-yard line. A penalty pushed them back 10 yards, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> still scored on third down with Simms' 15-yard pass to receiver Bobby Johnson. The situation only got worse for San Francisco from there, as Montana was knocked out of the game due to a hit by nose tackle Jim Burt, while linebacker Lawrence Taylor intercepted his pass and returned it 34 yards for a touchdown, giving the Giants a 28-3 halftime lead.|$|E
25|$|Several {{organizations}} {{of family members}} {{of people who have}} died in the attacks are calling for an independent investigation into the attacks. In 2009, a group of people, including 9/11 Truth movement activist Lorie Van Auken and others who have lost friends or relatives in the attack, appealed to the City of New York to investigate the disaster. The New York City Coalition for Accountability Now collected signatures to require the New York City Council to place the creation of an investigating commission on the November 2009 election ballot. The group collected more than enough signatures to put the proposal before the voters, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Supreme Court Justice Edward Lehner stated that the petition overstepped what is allowable by city law, and ruled that, despite wording in the petition to allow for elements ruled invalid to be stricken, it {{would not be allowed to}} appear on the ballot.|$|E
25|$|A Trip to Chinatown (1891) was Broadway's long-run {{champion}} (until Irene in 1919), {{running for}} 657 performances, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> runs {{continued to be}} relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until the 1920s. Gilbert and Sullivan were both pirated and imitated in New York by productions such as Reginald de Koven's Robin Hood (1891) and John Philip Sousa's El Capitan (1896). A Trip to Coontown (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans on Broadway (largely inspired by the routines of the minstrel shows), followed by ragtime-tinged shows. Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century, composed of songs written in New York's Tin Pan Alley, including those by George M. Cohan, who worked to create an American style distinct from the Gilbert and Sullivan works. The most successful New York shows were often followed by extensive national tours.|$|E

More importantly, Tittle led the NFL with 36 touchdown tosses, breaking his one-yard-old single-season of 33. <b>But</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> passing game was to be severely tested by the league's acknowledged defensive leader: The Chicago Bears.|$|R

500|$|To {{begin the}} 1928 season, the Yankees {{went on a}} 34–8 run and took a sizable lead.

Coming off a 54-home run regular season, Ruth had three more and a [...]625 batting average in the Series, while Gehrig batted [...]545 with four home runs. With the Yankees' run of three straight league pennants and two World Series titles came criticism from fans of other teams, who decried the team's dominance. Calls to [...] "Break up the Yankees!"

The reverse shows {{a map of the}} Great Lakes region with nine stars to represent its cities: Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, Duluth, Milwaukee, Rochester, Toledo and Toronto. Cleveland gets the largest star, which is transfixed by a compass. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their book on commemoratives, stated that [...] "we have not found documentation, but we suspect that the compass was intended to show Cleveland as the center of industry within a radius of approximately 900 miles", thus encompassing, the authors suggested, not only the Great Lakes cities represented, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Boston, Washington, and St. Louis.

500|$|Mattingly did {{not return}} to the Yankees for their 1996 season, and the club {{replaced}} Showalter with Joe Torre. Although the managerial change met with a mixed reception by the press, Torre received praise for his handling of players as his managerial career progressed; Olney remarked {{that he was able to}} [...] "defuse powder-keg issues and serve as a buffer between Steinbrenner and the players." [...] Jeter won the AL Rookie of the Year Award in his first full season with the Yankees, and Pettitte with 21 wins was second in AL Cy Young Award voting and Rivera posted an 8–3 record and 2.09 ERA as the club won a division title. New York reached the 1996 World Series, where they lost the first two games at home to the Atlanta Braves by a combined score of 16–1. <b>But</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> won three straight contests in Atlanta, including a Game 4 in which they scored eight straight runs to rally from a 6–0 deficit. With a 3–2 win in Game 6, the Yankees won the World Series for the first time in 18 years. For 1997, the Yankees signed starting pitcher David Wells and allowed closer John Wetteland to leave in free agency, enabling Rivera to inherit the role. The 1997 Yankees earned a wild card playoff berth, but lost three games to two against the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS.|$|E
500|$|In August, all of Hansen's {{appearances}} came in Giants losses, {{the first}} of which was on August 7—he pitched the two final innings against the Cardinals, allowing one hit but no runs. After a scoreless inning on August 12, Hansen appeared in back-to-back games against Boston on August 17 and 18, walking one and striking out one in the former game and allowing two runs in [...] of an inning in the latter. He allowed a run to Philadelphia on August 19, then pitched in consecutive games on August 27 and 28, the second and first games of doubleheaders, respectively. The Giants lost to St. Louis, 11–2, on August 27; Hansen allowed one unearned run in that game. The next day, he pitched two perfect innings against the Cincinnati Reds, striking out one, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> was defeated, 10–3. In his first September game, Hansen earned his final decision of the season when he defeated Pittsburgh, 9–5, pitching one scoreless inning in relief of Hank Behrman. He pitched the next game as well—the following day against Brooklyn—but the Giants were shut out, 8–0. He made a scoreless appearance against Philadelphia on September 6, and allowed 4 runs in [...] innings on September 8, raising his ERA from 4.18 to 4.64. Hansen made his final appearance on September 11 with a perfect [...] of an inning, striking out the only batter he faced; his final game of the season was logged on September 18, but he faced no batters and did not physically appear in the game.
