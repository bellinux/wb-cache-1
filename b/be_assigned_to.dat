This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species.|$|E

3000|$|The {{first step}} in the test {{assembly}} is to determine the number of blocks and the assignment of items to those blocks. The function block_design facilitates this process with two required arguments and one optional argument. The n_blocks argument specifies the number of blocks while the item_parameters argument takes a data frame of item parameters. The default allocation of items to blocks is a spiraling design. For 1, 2, [...]..., H item blocks, the first item <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block 1, item 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the block 2, and item H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block H. The process is continued such that item H+ 1 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block 1, item H+ 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block 2 and item H+H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block H until all items <b>are</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> a block.|$|R

Codex Vaticanus was not in this list. In the second (1796) edition of his Greek NT, Griesbach added Codex Vaticanus as {{a witness to the}} Alexandrian text in Mark, Luke, and John. He still believed the first half of Matthew represented the Western text-type.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{development}} is commonly divided {{into the following}} stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth {{development is}} an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> a particular developing tooth. This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.|$|E
5|$|Two 20th century {{developments}} in geology {{had a big}} effect on paleontology.

5|$|Battles {{occur when}} the player {{character}} encounters an enemy while traversing the world. Combat takes place in real-time, and in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these abilities are powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters {{that can be used}} when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a set number of special attacks to learn, which can hit single or multiple targets and can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> different buttons on the controller.|$|E

Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the carrier.|$|E

5|$|Finucane was {{now one of}} the 45 {{pilots in}} his class to have {{completed}} 100 hours of piloting time on aircraft since he joined the RAF. After completing basic flight training on 28 October 1938, Finucane was classed as an average pilot, but deemed to be competent enough to <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> advanced flying school. With effect from the following day, he was granted a short-service commission as an acting pilot officer (on probation) and sent to 8 Flying Training School, RAF Montrose in Scotland.

5|$|HMS Resistance was {{the first}} capital ship in the Royal Navy to be fitted with a ram and was given the {{nickname}} of Old Rammo. She was initially assigned to the Channel Squadron, but {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean Squadron in 1864, the first ironclad to <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> that squadron. Resistance was rearmed in 1867 and became a guardship when recommissioned in 1869. The ship was reassigned to the Channel Fleet in 1873 before reverting to her former duties in 1877. Resistance was decommissioned in 1880 and was used for gunnery and torpedo trials beginning in 1885. The ship was sold for scrap in 1898 and foundered the following year en route to the breaker's yard. Her wreck was salvaged and later scrapped.|$|E
5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a fixed axis, freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area of effect. Four Artes can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> each character, and each Arte can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} on all British mainline journeys {{to change}} engines at convenient locations {{to avoid the}} lengthy process of re-coaling. The Coronation locomotives were therefore strategically stationed at key points between London and Glasgow and they would <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the shed at that location. The chosen locations were at London (Camden shed), Crewe (Crewe North), Carlisle (Upperby) and Glasgow (Polmadie). It {{was only in the}} latter days of steam that the mix of shed assignments became more fluid.|$|E

5|$|Kagan {{believes}} that while Alcibiades was a commander of considerable ability, {{he was no}} military genius, and his confidence and ambitions went far beyond his skills. He thus was capable of important errors and serious miscalculations. Kagan argues that at Notium, Alcibiades committed a serious error in leaving the fleet {{in the hands of}} an inexperienced officer, and that most of the credit for the brilliant victory at Cyzicus must <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> Thrasybulus. In this judgement, Kagan agrees with Cornelius Nepos, who said that the Athenians' extravagant opinion of Alcibiades's abilities and valor was his chief misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Military squads can <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> a barracks {{to train}} in and a uniform (armor and a weapon) can be chosen. Squads can be {{directly}} commanded to attack enemies. Crossbows {{can be made for}} ranged attacks and a range with targets can be constructed for training. Walls can be carved into fortifications and be used by ranged-units during attacks. Training areas can be made to train war animals like dogs. Players can use traps and engineering in addition to training an army. Traps can be made by constructing mechanisms and using metal or wood to construct large weapons like spikes, ax blades or cages. More complex lever-operated and pressure plate-triggering trap components are available.|$|E
