Agriculture continues to be a major <b>business,</b> <b>if</b> no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil.

25|$|The medieval guild was {{established}} by charters or letters patent or similar authority by the city or the ruler and normally held a monopoly on trade in its craft within the city in which it operated: handicraft workers were forbidden by law to run any <b>business</b> <b>if</b> they were not members of a guild, and only masters were allowed {{to be members of}} a guild. Before these privileges were legislated, these groups of handicraft workers were simply called 'handicraft associations'.|$|E
25|$|Damages may be {{general or}} consequential. General damages are those damages which {{naturally}} flow from {{a breach of}} contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties {{at the time of}} contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost <b>business</b> <b>if</b> that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car.|$|E

30|$|Taken together, Tables  3 and 9 and Fig.  2 b {{suggest that}} many {{individuals}} who are self-employed are doing so voluntarily.

25|$|Companies {{occupy a}} special place in private law, because they have a legal {{personality}} separate from those who invest their capital and labour to run the business. The general rules of contract, tort and unjust enrichment operate in the first place against the company as a distinct entity. This differs fundamentally from other forms of business association. A sole trader acquires rights and duties as normal under the general law of obligations. If people carry on business together with a view to profit, they are deemed to have formed a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 section 1. Like a sole trader, partners will be liable on any contract or tort obligation jointly and severally in shares equal to their monetary contribution, or according to their culpability. Law, accountancy and actuarial firms are commonly organised as partnerships. Since the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, partners can limit the amount they are liable for to their monetary investment in the <b>business,</b> <b>if</b> the partnership owes more money than the enterprise has. Outside these professions, however, the most common method for businesses to limit their liability is by forming a company.|$|E
25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The {{important point is that}} officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her <b>business.</b> <b>If</b> the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E

500|$|Pikes Hotel is {{a luxury}} hotel, set in a 15th-century stone mansion, a finca, which was a farm for centuries. It is {{accessed}} off a long lane leading from the main road from Sant Antoni de Portmany.

[...] It {{is considered to be}} one of the most famous or infamous hotels on the island and has been cited as one of the [...] "world's true spiritual homes of rock'n'roll hedonism." [...] Iain Stewart of The Rough Guide to Ibiza considers Pikes Hotel to be an [...] "almost legendary, relaxed and idiosyncratic rural hotel, popular with visiting celebrities."

500|$|From the 1860s onwards, various schemes were {{promoted}} {{to build a}} railway line, either through Glendale or over the Milfield Plain. [...] In 1881 the Central Northumberland Railway was proposed, linking Newcastle upon Tyne with Ponteland, Rothbury, Wooler and Kelso. [...] The threat posed by the proposal spurred the North Eastern Railway to put forward a branch line of its own between Alnwick, Wooler and Cornhill on Tweed. [...] The company was strongly supported by the tradespeople of Alnwick, who were concerned {{at the loss of}} <b>business</b> <b>if</b> the farmers of Glendale had a direct raillink to the rival market and shops in Rothbury. [...] Both schemes were presented to Parliament in 1881, and it was the North Eastern Railway's route which gained approval, with the Alnwick and Cornhill Act passed in 1882. [...] The single-track line opened on 5 September 1887, having cost £272,267 to build. [...] From Wooler, it ran through Kirknewton and Kilham to Mindrum, before turning north to Cornhill on Tweed, where it joined the line from Tweedmouth to Kelso. [...] There was no station at Kilham, but sidings were built to handle goods traffic.|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my <b>business</b> <b>if</b> gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white.

500|$|Despite {{his initial}} success, Duncan {{was unable to}} retain control {{in the face of}} a more {{widespread}} revolt on 15 May among the ships based at the Nore, which became known as the Nore Mutiny. Led by a sailor named Richard Parker, the Nore mutineers quickly organised and became a significant threat to water traffic in the Thames Estuary. Duncan was informed that his fleet at Yarmouth might be ordered to attack the mutineers and, although reluctant, responded, [...] "I do not shrink from the <b>business</b> <b>if</b> it cannot otherwise be got the better of". When rumours of the plan reached the fleet at Yarmouth, the crew of Venerable also expressed their distaste with the plan, but reaffirmed their promise of loyalty to their admiral whatever the circumstances. News then arrived that the Dutch fleet under De Winter was preparing to sail, and Duncan's fleet was ordered by Lord Spencer to blockade the Dutch coast. Duncan issued orders for the fleet to weigh anchor, but the men disobeyed and ship after ship overthrew their officers and joined the mutineers at the Nore. Eventually Duncan was left with only his own Venerable and Hotham's Adamant to contain the entire Dutch fleet. Duncan later wrote that, [...] "To be deserted by my own fleet in the face of the enemy is a disgrace which I believe never before happened to a British admiral, nor could I have supposed it possible." ...|$|E
