5|$|The Big Four Bridge {{was first}} {{conceived}} in Jeffersonville in 1885 by various city interests. The Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company {{was formed in}} 1887 to construct the Big Four Bridge, after a charter {{by the state of}} Indiana; Kentucky also chartered the company in 1888. The riverboat industry, a big economic factor in Jeffersonville, had requested that the bridge be built further upstream from the Falls of the Ohio, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Army Corps of Engineers approved the building site, even after the vocal protestations.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones {{to the north of}} the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|The Davis Cup {{was founded}} in 1900 as the International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Four members of Harvard University wished to {{challenge}} Great Britain in a tennis competition. One of the American players, Dwight F. Davis, designed a tournament format and ordered a sterling silver trophy from Shreve, Crump & Low for approximately $1,000. The first match, held at Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts, was won by the American team 3–0. There was no match the following year, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> retained the trophy in 1902, beating Great Britain 3–2. This was followed by four successive victories for Britain, from 1903 to 1906. The 1904 Davis Cup saw new teams compete for the first time, as Belgium and France entered.|$|E

5|$|When Grant had {{returned}} to America from his costly world tour, he had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home. Wealthy friends bought him a home on Manhattan's Upper East Side, and to make an income, Grant, Jay Gould, and former Mexican Finance Secretary Matías Romero chartered the Mexican Southern Railroad, with {{plans to build a}} railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City. Grant urged Chester A. Arthur, who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881, to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico. Arthur and the Mexican government agreed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Senate rejected the treaty in 1883. The railroad was similarly unsuccessful, falling into bankruptcy the following year.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, with World War II {{raging in}} Europe <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> not yet at war, Feynman {{spent the summer}} working on {{ballistics}} problems at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor had brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of {{what would become the}} Manhattan Project. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, which would electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the calutron that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more efficient than the calutron, but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled {{to determine whether or not}} it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In February 1836 Edwards landed 170 {{black people}} in Texas, taking {{advantage}} of the confusion surrounding the end of the Texas Revolution and the establishment of the independent Republic of Texas, which had not yet outlawed the importation of slaves. William Fisher, the customs collector on the Brazos River, wrote to the Texas Constitutional Convention that Edwards did not report the importation to the authorities, and Fisher went to Edwards' plantation to confront Edwards. Because of uncertainty about the legality of importing slaves, Fisher did not seize the slaves but referred the issue to the newly formed Texas Government after securing a monetary bond from Edwards. Although the new Texas Republic eventually outlawed the importation of slaves from anywhere <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Edwards' landing of slaves from Cuba in early 1836 was never prosecuted. After this, Edwards also established a slave market on Galveston Bay, near present-day San Leon. In 1837, he was sued by Robert Peebles for fraud involving the sale of a slave with tuberculosis to Peebles. Peebles won the case.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{initially}} considered using {{a hydrogen}} bomb for the project, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Air Force vetoed this idea {{due to the}} weight of such a device, {{as it would be}} too heavy to be propelled by the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 warhead, a small, lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1.7 kiloton yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the hidden side of the Moon, near the terminator, where it would detonate on impact. The dust cloud resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{has also}} suffered serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967 it {{was listed as}} an endangered species, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies in the Southern United States stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate, and in 1987 it {{was removed from the}} endangered species list. Much research into alligator ranching has been undertaken at the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, a large area of marshland in the state of Louisiana. The resulting data has increased understanding of penning, stocking rates, egg incubation, hatching, rearing, and diet, and this information has been used at other establishments around the world. Income from the alligators kept at Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge contributes to conservation of the marshland. A study examining alligator farms in the United States showed that they have generated significant conservation gains, and poaching of wild alligators has greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} first played in 1895 and met six more times through 1923. In those early matches, Johns Hopkins scored a {{combined}} sixty points to Maryland's three. In 1924, Maryland fielded its first varsity-level lacrosse team, which defeated Hopkins, 4–2, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) awarded the Blue Jays the co-national championship (along with Syracuse). Since that season, the teams have met annually {{with the exception}} of a two-year hiatus due to World War II. Johns Hopkins won three straight national titles from 1926 to 1928, where each season culminated with a victory over Maryland. In 1928, Maryland had a perfect 9–0 record until Johns Hopkins defeated the Terps in the season finale, 6–3. At season's end, a single-elimination tournament was held to determine which team would represent the United States in a trial lacrosse competition during the Summer Olympics. Maryland defeated Navy and Rutgers to advance to the final game, where they were again bested by Johns Hopkins.|$|E

5|$|In 1985 {{he played}} for Team USA at the IIHF World Championships. Vanbiesbrouck posted a 6–3–0 record, {{defeating}} three of three top ranked teams in the world (Canada, Czech Republic and Sweden). He later noted that those three victories gave him the confidence to be successful at the NHL level. The Americans were the second seed following the preliminary round. However they failed to win a single game in the championship round and finished the tournament in fourth place. Individually Vanbiesbrouck {{was named to the}} Second All-Star team. Two years later he played in his second World Championship. He was unable to duplicate his prior success posting a 2–5–0 record, as Team USA finished in seventh place one position away from being relegated to Division I. During 1987 Vanbiesbrouck also participated in the Canada Cup, registering a 2–2–0 record with a 2.25 GAA. He registered the lowest GAA in the tournament, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> finished in fifth place. He played in two more World Championships in 1989 and 1991 going 1–2–1 and 3–4–2 respectively, as the US improved to sixth place in 1989 and finished just short of winning a medal in 1991 placing fourth. Vanbiesbrouck was named to the Canada Cup team in 1991, but spent the tournament as Mike Richter's back-up. He played only one game in the tournament defeating Finland 4–3. The United States finished the Canada Cup in second place losing the best of three championship to Canada 2–0.|$|E
