5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the <b>bilayer</b> and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural <b>bilayer</b> behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic <b>bilayer</b> behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the <b>bilayer</b> surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, sometimes even with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E
5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a lipid <b>bilayer</b> {{can exist}} in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the <b>bilayer,</b> but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase <b>bilayer</b> have less mobility.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Ka, {{which is a}} measure of how much energy is needed to stretch the <b>bilayer,</b> Kb {{is a measure of}} how much energy is needed to bend or flex the <b>bilayer.</b> Formally, bending modulus is defined as the energy required to deform a membrane from its intrinsic curvature to some other curvature. Intrinsic curvature is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the head group to that of the tail group. For two-tailed PC lipids, this ratio is nearly one so the intrinsic curvature is nearly zero. If a particular lipid has too large a deviation from zero intrinsic curvature it will not form a <b>bilayer</b> and will instead form other phases such as micelles or inverted micelles. Addition of small hydrophilic molecules like sucrose into mixed lipid lamellar liposomes made from galactolipid-rich thylakoid membranes destabilises bilayers into micellar phase. Typically, Kb is not measured experimentally but rather is calculated from measurements of Ka and <b>bilayer</b> thickness, since the three parameters are related.|$|E

5|$|The lipid <b>bilayer</b> (or {{phospholipid}} <b>bilayer)</b> {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of {{two layers}} of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid <b>bilayer,</b> as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid <b>bilayer</b> is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|The lipid <b>bilayer</b> is {{very thin}} {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid <b>bilayer</b> making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the <b>bilayer</b> is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the lipid <b>bilayer</b> in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} lipid <b>bilayer</b> in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the lipid <b>bilayer</b> is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic <b>bilayer</b> core, as discussed in Transport across the <b>bilayer</b> below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single lipid <b>bilayer</b> (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E
50|$|Droplet Interface <b>Bilayers</b> (DIBs) are lipid encased {{droplets}} {{that form}} <b>bilayers</b> {{when they are}} put into contact. DIBs can be formed to create tissue-like material {{with the ability to}} form asymmetric <b>bilayers,</b> reconstitue proteins and protein channels or made for use in studying electrophysiology.|$|R
40|$|Freestanding {{phospholipid}} <b>bilayers</b> {{have been}} assembled spanning shallow, micrometer-sized wells etched into a Si wafer substrate {{so that the}} <b>bilayers</b> are near (within hundreds of nanometers) but not {{in contact with the}} wafer surface. The proximity of the <b>bilayers</b> to the highly reflective Si/SiO 2 interface allows them to be probed by using fluorescence-interference techniques. These interferometry measurements show that the <b>bilayers</b> are curved and that the curvature can be varied by changes in osmotic pressure. Furthermore, the ionophore gramicidin can be incorporated into the <b>bilayers,</b> making them selectively permeable to monovalent cations. This freestanding architecture may overcome surface-interaction problems that occur when cell membrane proteins are introduced into solid supported <b>bilayers,</b> while also allowing for high-precision measurements of changes in fluorophore position by interferometry...|$|R

5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in <b>bilayer</b> permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic <b>bilayer</b> core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the key}} methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to mimic this asymmetry in the laboratory in model <b>bilayer</b> systems. Certain types of very small artificial vesicle will automatically make themselves slightly asymmetric, although the mechanism by which this asymmetry is generated {{is very different from}} that in cells. By utilizing two different monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett deposition or a combination of Langmuir-Blodgett and vesicle rupture deposition it is also possible to synthesize an asymmetric planar <b>bilayer.</b> This asymmetry may be lost over time as lipids in supported bilayers can be prone to flip-flop.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a shear modulus, but like any liquid, the shear modulus is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the <b>bilayer,</b> and <b>bilayer</b> mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. <b>Bilayer</b> mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E
40|$|Currently {{there is}} a lively {{discussion}} concerning Fermi velocity renormalization in twisted <b>bilayers</b> and several contradicted experimental results are reported. Here we study electronic structures of the twisted <b>bilayers</b> by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS). The interlayer coupling strengths between the adjacent <b>bilayers</b> are measured according to energy separations of two pronounced low-energy van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the STS spectra. We demonstrate that {{there is a}} large range of values for the interlayer interaction in different twisted <b>bilayers.</b> Below the VHSs, the observed Landau quantization in the twisted <b>bilayers</b> is identical to that of massless Dirac fermions in graphene monolayer, which allows us to measure the Fermi velocity directly. Our result indicates that the Fermi velocity of the twisted <b>bilayers</b> depends remarkably on both the twisted angles and the interlayer coupling strengths. This removes the discrepancy about the Fermi velocity renormalization in the twisted <b>bilayers</b> and provides a consistent interpretation of all current data.

40|$|AbstractThe lateral {{organization}} of lipids and proteins in cell membranes {{is recognized as}} {{an important factor in}} several cellular processes. Cholesterol is thought to function as a modulator of the lateral segregation of lipids into cholesterol-poor and cholesterol-rich domains. We investigated how the affinity of cholesterol for different phospholipids, as seen in cholesterol partitioning between methyl-β-cyclodextrin and large unilamellar vesicles, was reflected in the lateral {{organization of}} lipids in complex <b>bilayers.</b> We especially wanted to determine how the low-Tm lipid affected the lateral structure. Partition experiments showed that cholesterol had a higher affinity for N-oleoyl-sphingomyelin (OSM) than for palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) <b>bilayers,</b> but the highest preference was for N-palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (PSM) -containing <b>bilayers.</b> Partial phase diagrams of POPC/PSM/cholesterol and OSM/PSM/cholesterol <b>bilayers</b> at 23 °C and 37 °C were used to gain insight into the lateral organization of lipids in <b>bilayers.</b> Analysis of phase diagrams revealed that the phospholipid composition of cholesterol-poor and cholesterol-rich domains reflected the affinity that cholesterol exhibited toward <b>bilayers</b> composed of different lipids. Therefore, the determined affinity of cholesterol for different phospholipid <b>bilayers</b> was useful in predicting the cholesterol-induced lateral segregation of lipids in complex <b>bilayers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Inelastic neutron {{scattering}} {{was used to}} study the effect of 5 and 40 mol% cholesterol on the lateral nanoscale dynamics of phospholipid membranes. By measuring the excitation spectrum at several lateral q (||) values (up to q (||) = 3 (- 1)), complete dispersion curves were determined of gel, fluid and liquid-ordered phase <b>bilayers.</b> The inclusion of cholesterol had a distinct effect on the collective dynamics of the <b>bilayer's</b> hydrocarbon chains; specifically, we observed a pronounced stiffening of the membranes on the nanometer length scale in both gel and fluid <b>bilayers,</b> {{even though they were}} experiencing a higher degree of molecular disorder. Also, {{for the first time we}} determined the nanoscale dynamics in the high-cholesterol liquid-ordered phase of <b>bilayers</b> containing cholesterol. Namely, this phase appears to be "softer" than fluid <b>bilayers,</b> but better ordered than <b>bilayers</b> in the gel phase...|$|R
5|$|Most polar {{molecules}} {{have low}} solubility in the hydrocarbon {{core of a}} lipid <b>bilayer</b> and, as a consequence, have low permeability coefficients across the <b>bilayer.</b> This effect is particularly pronounced for charged species, which have even lower permeability coefficients than neutral polar molecules. Anions typically have {{a higher rate of}} diffusion through bilayers than cations. Compared to ions, water molecules actually have a relatively large permeability through the <b>bilayer,</b> as evidenced by osmotic swelling. When a cell or vesicle with a high interior salt concentration is placed in a solution with a low salt concentration it will swell and eventually burst. Such a result would not be observed unless water was able to pass through the <b>bilayer</b> with relative ease. The anomalously large permeability of water through bilayers is still not completely understood and continues to be the subject of active debate. Small uncharged apolar molecules diffuse through lipid bilayers many orders of magnitude faster than ions or water. This applies both to fats and organic solvents like chloroform and ether. Regardless of their polar character larger molecules diffuse more slowly across lipid bilayers than small molecules.|$|E
5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate <b>bilayer</b> phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the <b>bilayer</b> surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a zwitterionic headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
5|$|A {{supported}} lipid <b>bilayer</b> (SLB) {{as described}} above has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs. This parallel artificial membrane permeability assay PAMPA technique measures the permeability across specifically formulated lipid cocktail(s) found to be highly correlated with Caco-2 cultures, the gastrointestinal tract, blood–brain barrier and skin.|$|E
40|$|Micropatterned {{phospholipid}} <b>bilayers</b> {{on solid}} substrates offer an attractive platform for various applications, {{such as high}} throughput drug screening. We have previously developed a photopolymerization-based methodology for generating micropatterned <b>bilayers</b> composed of polymerized and fluid lipid <b>bilayers.</b> Lithographic photopolymerization of a diacetylene-containing phospholipid (DiynePC) allowed facile fabrication of compartmentalized arrays of fluid lipid membranes. Herein, we report on a key experimental parameter that significantly influences the homogeneity {{and quality of the}} fabricated polymeric <b>bilayers,</b> namely the temperature at which monolayers of monomeric DiynePC were formed on the water surface and transferred onto solid substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett/Langmuir-Schaefer (LB/LS) technique. Using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy, it was found that polymerized <b>bilayers</b> were homogeneous, if <b>bilayers</b> of DiynePC were prepared below the triple point temperature (ca. 20 C) of the monolayer, where a direct transition from the gaseous state to the liquid condensed state occurred. <b>Bilayers</b> prepared above this temperature had a markedly increased number of crack-like line defects. The differences were attributed to the domain structures in the monolayer that were transferred from the water surface to the substrate. Domain size, rather than the molecular packing in each domain, was concluded to {{play a critical role in}} the formation of defects. The spontaneous curvature and area changes of <b>bilayers</b> were postulated to cause destabilization and detachment of the films from the substrate upon polymerization. Our present results highlight the importance of controlling the domain structures for the homogeneity of polymerized <b>bilayers</b> required in technological applications...|$|R

5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid <b>bilayer</b> is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid <b>bilayer</b> membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the lipid <b>bilayer</b> is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial <b>bilayer</b> and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the <b>bilayer.</b> Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid <b>bilayer.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The kinetic {{characteristics}} of the opening and closing of the excitability-inducing material (EIM) channel in oxidized cholesterol and in brain lipid <b>bilayers</b> are compared. The kinetics of the opening and closing of individual ion-conducting channels in <b>bilayers</b> doped with small amounts of EIM are determined from discrete fluctuations in ionic current. The kinetics for approach to steady-state conductance are determined for lipid <b>bilayers</b> containing many channels.

5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each <b>bilayer</b> is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid <b>bilayer</b> membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers exhibit {{high levels}} of {{birefringence}} where the refractive index in {{the plane of the}} <b>bilayer</b> differs from that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units.

5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids.
