5|$|After Extreme Rules, Orton began pairing with Daniel <b>Bryan</b> {{despite their}} poor {{relationship}} {{to face a}} common enemy in the Shield. On the June 14 SmackDown, Orton teamed with <b>Bryan</b> and Kane to end the Shield's unpinned and unsubmitted streak in televised six-man tag matches. Three days later at Payback, Orton and Bryan's poor teamwork resulted in an unsuccessful challenge for Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins' WWE Tag Team Championships. The following night on Raw, Orton and <b>Bryan</b> faced off in a no disqualification match, which Orton won via referee stoppage after <b>Bryan</b> suffered a legitimate nerve injury. Four days later on SmackDown, Orton was defeated by <b>Bryan</b> in a singles match via countout. Orton and <b>Bryan</b> faced {{each other for the}} third time on the next Raw, but their match ended in a no-contest after both men were counted out. Later that night, Orton was defeated by <b>Bryan</b> in a Street Fight Match after he was forced to submit to the Yes! Lock with a kindo stick applied to the move.|$|E
5|$|Batista and Orton {{decided to}} work {{together}} to assault <b>Bryan,</b> and the original referee returned to the match. At ringside, Batista threw <b>Bryan</b> down with a Batista Bomb onto the Spanish announce table, while Orton immediately combined with an inverted version of his signature RKO maneuver. As both <b>Bryan</b> and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table, only Batista emerged unscathed. Medical personnel arrived and carted <b>Bryan</b> away on a stretcher. Batista attacked Orton, who retaliated with a DDT onto the floor. Suddenly, <b>Bryan</b> got off the stretcher and crawled back to the ring, where he was set upon by Orton.|$|E
5|$|Boone offers <b>Bryan</b> $25,000 {{to break}} up with Shannon but <b>Bryan</b> asks for $50,000 and Boone agrees. Boone also reveals that <b>Bryan</b> {{is not the first}} man he has paid off to leave Shannon alone. Shannon refuses to leave with Boone. He realizes that Shannon lied to him to get the money, and she has done this all the other times he had to pay off her boyfriends. <b>Bryan</b> says that Boone's mother stole money away from her, and she is getting what is {{rightfully}} hers. After a brief fight with <b>Bryan</b> in which he is beaten, Boone leaves. That night, a drunk Shannon comes to Boone's hotel room and tells him that <b>Bryan</b> stole the money. She tells Boone that she knows he loves her and, although he first tries to refuse her advances, they sleep together. Later, Shannon persuades Boone not to tell their parents.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bryan</b> arrived {{quietly and}} took rooms at a modest hotel; the Nebraskan later {{calculated}} {{that he spent}} less than $100 while in Chicago.

5|$|In early 2011, Kim {{participated in}} fewer matches on television, as {{she became the}} {{on-screen}} girlfriend of Daniel <b>Bryan.</b> She also began accompanying him to the ring during his matches. At that time, <b>Bryan</b> was managed by Nikki and Brie Bella, and after they discovered Daniel <b>Bryan</b> kissing Kim backstage, they assaulted Kim, starting a feud with her. On January 30 at the Royal Rumble, the Bella Twins once again assaulted Kim. The following night on Raw, Kim was at ringside during Bryan's match against Tyson Kidd. After the match, the Bellas entered the ring, Nikki slapped <b>Bryan</b> and Kim attacked her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} match on the {{pay-per-view}} {{portion of the}} show, Daniel <b>Bryan</b> faced Triple H; the winner would be inserted in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event later that night. Triple H was announced and accompanied by Stephanie McMahon. <b>Bryan</b> kicked away Triple H's handshake and started the match strongly, including performing a tornado DDT off the apron. Triple H gained the advantage by driving Bryan's injured arm into the announce table and continually attacking the arm including a hammerlock belly-to-back suplex on the apron. <b>Bryan</b> refused to submit to Triple H's submission holds of the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface, instead reversing to his signature Yes! Lock, but Triple H reached the ropes to break the hold. Triple H countered Bryan's signature running knee with a spinebuster and his signature Pedigree maneuver, but <b>Bryan</b> kicked out at two. After another series of counters, <b>Bryan</b> hit his running knee for the three count and the win. After the match, McMahon slapped <b>Bryan,</b> distracting him long enough for Triple H to attack him from behind. Triple H placed Bryan's injured arm against the ring post and hit it with a steel folding chair. <b>Bryan</b> had to be attended to by medical staff while Triple H and McMahon celebrated on the stage.|$|E

5|$|The balloting {{began the}} {{following}} morning, July 10, with {{a two-thirds vote}} necessary to nominate. <b>Bryan,</b> who remained at his hotel, sent word to the Nebraska delegation to make no deals on his behalf. He stood second out of fourteen candidates in the first ballot, behind Bland. On the second ballot, <b>Bryan</b> still stood second, but had gained as other candidates had fallen away. The third ballot saw Bland still in the lead, but <b>Bryan</b> took the lead on the fourth ballot. According to Jones, {{it was clear that}} Bland could not win, and that <b>Bryan</b> could not be stopped. On the fifth ballot, the Illinois delegation, led by Governor Altgeld, switched its votes from Bland to <b>Bryan.</b> Other delegations, seeing that <b>Bryan</b> would be nominated, also switched, securing the victory. Nevertheless, he won the nomination without the votes of the gold delegates, most of whom either left the convention or refused to vote.|$|E
5|$|The event, {{featuring}} commentary by Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler and Booker T, {{began with}} the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match. During the bout, Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a ladder propped between the ring apron and the announcers' table with a powerbomb. The ladder was bent in half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside. Near {{the end of the}} match, Barrett, Rhodes and <b>Bryan</b> were the only three in the ring. <b>Bryan</b> put Rhodes in a guillotine choke submission hold on top of the ladder {{in the middle of the}} ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of the ladder. After <b>Bryan</b> knocked Rhodes off the ladder, Barrett got <b>Bryan</b> onto his shoulders and tried to throw him off. <b>Bryan</b> countered with repeated elbow strikes to Barrett's head. <b>Bryan</b> then kicked Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest.|$|E

5|$|With Orton {{trapped in}} Bryan's {{submission}} hold, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon emerged from backstage {{and pulled the}} original referee {{out of the ring}} to prevent the match from ending. Triple H then sent in referee Scott Armstrong on his behalf, as Batista performed the Batista Bomb on a distracted <b>Bryan.</b> Armstrong made the count, but <b>Bryan</b> kicked out at two. A charging Batista was sent into the ring post when <b>Bryan</b> dodged. With no disqualifications in a triple threat match, <b>Bryan</b> kicked referee Armstrong in the head, following with a suicide dive out of the ring onto Triple H, Stephanie McMahon and Armstrong. Triple H tried to retaliate with a sledgehammer, but <b>Bryan</b> snatched it and used the sledgehammer on Triple H, knocking him off the ring apron. This ended Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's interference in the match.|$|E
5|$|After Tillman {{returned}} from Chicago to South Carolina, he suggested he had delivered an intentionally radical speech {{so as to}} allow <b>Bryan</b> to look statesmanlike by comparison. This interpretation was mocked by his enemies. Tillman is not known to have otherwise discussed his feelings at the failure of his presidential bid, and the political grief was likely overwhelmed by personal sadness {{a week after the}} convention when his beloved daughter Addie died, struck by lightning on a North Carolina mountain. Tillman campaigned for <b>Bryan,</b> but was a favorite target of cartoonists denigrating the Democratic candidate and supporting the Republican, former Ohio governor William McKinley. <b>Bryan</b> had also been nominated by the Populists, who selected their own vice presidential candidate, Georgia's Thomas E. Watson. Tillman was active in efforts to get Watson to withdraw, having a 12-hour meeting with the candidate, apparently without result. Tillman traveled widely to speak on Bryan's behalf, and drew large crowds, but his speeches were of little significance. Despite undertaking an arduous campaign, <b>Bryan</b> lost the election. Simkins suggested that Tillman, by helping forge an image of the Democratic Party as anarchic, contributed to Bryan's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Although {{given the}} first name Lewis, Willkie was known from {{childhood}} by his middle name. Herman Willkie, who had come from Prussia with his parents at age four, was intensely involved in progressive politics, and in 1896 took his sons to a torchlight procession for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings <b>Bryan,</b> {{who had come to}} Elwood during his campaign. The Willkie boys had a sidewalk fight with Republican youths, and though the Willkies won their battle, <b>Bryan</b> did not, defeated by former Ohio governor William McKinley. When <b>Bryan</b> ran again in 1900, he stayed overnight at the Willkie home, and the Democratic candidate for president became the first political hero for the boy who would later seek that office.|$|E

50|$|At Wimbledon, the <b>Bryans</b> {{were beaten}} in the quarter-finals by Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea. The <b>Bryans</b> began the North American hard court season in fine fashion by winning their first title in Atlanta, {{defeating}} Colin Fleming and Gilles Müller in the final. The <b>Bryans</b> followed {{this with a}} triumph at the 2015 Citi Open over Dodig and Melo in the final. Their momentum continued at the 2015 Rogers Cup in Montreal where they defeated Daniel Nestor and Édouard Roger-Vasselin in the final to claim a 5th title in Canada, 35th Masters 1000 title and 6th title of the season.|$|R
5|$|At the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Democrats {{nominated}} William Jennings <b>Bryan</b> {{for president}} and adopted a platform calling for the free coinage of silver.
