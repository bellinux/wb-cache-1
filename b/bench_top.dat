25|$|This {{traditional}} tail vise {{also uses}} one large screw, either wooden or metal. It {{consists of a}} movable block {{with one or more}} dog holes in it, the movable block rides in a large mortise in the workbench. The jaw has a face that contacts the <b>bench</b> <b>top,</b> and the dog holes are in line with the dog holes on the <b>bench</b> <b>top.</b> The two main varieties of this vise depend on whether the screw nut is mounted in the bench or on the dog hole block. When the screw nut is mounted on the dog hole block the installation is more complicated and expensive, but the screw does not move in and out as the vise is used.|$|E
25|$|Most {{workbenches}} {{are made}} from solid wood; the most expensive and desirable are made of solid hardwood. Benches may also be made from plywood and Masonite or hardboard, and bases of treated pine and even steel. There are trade offs with the choice of construction material. Solid wood has many advantages including strength, workability, appearance. A plywood or hardboard <b>bench</b> <b>top</b> {{has the advantage of}} being stable, relatively inexpensive, and in some ways it's easier to work with - particularly for a woodworker who doesn't yet have hand tools. The practical drawbacks of a plywood or composite <b>bench</b> <b>top</b> are that they don't hold their corners and edges well, and they can't be resurfaced with a plane - something that is needed from time to time.|$|E
25|$|Another ancient {{method of}} holding the work is the hold fast or {{holdfast}}. A holdfast looks like a shepherd's crook. The shank goes into {{a hole in the}} <b>bench</b> <b>top</b> and the tip of the hook is pressed against the work from above. The holdfast is set by rapping the top with a mallet, and released by hitting the back side. A good holdfast works remarkably well, and is inexpensive and easy to install.|$|E

50|$|Due to its thermal {{stability}} and chemical inertness, slate {{has been used}} for laboratory <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> and for billiard table tops.

25|$|One {{popular and}} cheap source for <b>bench</b> <b>top</b> {{material}} is old bowling alley lanes. These are usually made from thick, high-quality laminated maple. Two problems present themselves with bowling alley wood: first, the waxes {{used on the}} surface for bowling frequently contain silicone and other substances that can play havoc with work pieces at finishing time - a little silicone on a project will cause trouble with many finishes, and won't manifest it until it's too late. The other problem with bowling alley wood is nails. Most pieces have loads of nails buried in them, which do not mix well with woodworking tools.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a planing stop or dog ear, which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} <b>bench</b> <b>top.</b> The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he can tell a lot about what is going on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} tail vise uses {{one large}} screw, either wooden or metal. It {{is made in}} the form of a frame, with the back part of the frame fitting under the bench, and the movement of that frame located and restrained by a [...] complex system of sliding tongues and grooves, and runners, such that smooth left and right movements of the frame are possible, but forward and backward movements, or rotative movements of the frame are impossible. The jaw has a face that contacts the <b>bench</b> <b>top,</b> and it has one or more dog holes on the top—often 3 to 4, each spaced 5 inches apart—that are in line with the dog holes located on the front face (apron) of the bench—numerous holes, each also spaced 5 inches apart. This is the least expensive option for a tail vise, but it is by far the most complex to design, construct and maintain. Tage Frid and Frank Klausz popularized this type of tail vise in North America, although its origin dates back to northern Europe (most probably Germany) in the 18th century.|$|E

50|$|Some {{changes to}} the {{homestead}} have occurred. In October 1936 a fire started in a chip heater chimney in the homestead's ceiling and destroyed the ceiling and rafters of the bathroom on the western wing. There is evidence of a more recent fire in the laundry. The kitchen was changed from a wood stove with marble <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> to a modern stove plus laminated <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> in the 1960s. The small verandah in the service wing was enclosed as an eating area for Burton Persse and his family. The two original bathrooms have been altered; one was modernised and the other stripped and converted to an office by 1971. The wall between the former cook's room and the kitchen has been removed. In 1996 the roofing was noted as corrugated iron. However, Dods favoured flat iron roofing, and {{this appears to be}} the roofing in a photograph taken in 1919. The vertical timber blinds around the piazza, apparent in early photographs, have been removed.|$|R
50|$|Public taste {{moved away}} from monumental masonry, and demand for Trethewey's skills waned.

Trethewey passed his company on to his children and grandchildren, and these days Trethewey Artisan Stone is a major supplier of stone kitchen <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> in the South Island.|$|R

40|$|The Analytical Development Section of Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) was {{requested}} by the Facilities Disposition Projects (FDP) to determine the holdup of enriched uranium in the 321 -M facility {{as part of an}} overall deactivation project of the facility. The 321 -M facility was used to fabricate enriched uranium fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the production reactors. The results of the holdup assays are essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to meet criticality safety controls. This report covers holdup measurements on two sawbench components that were used for cutting U-Al fuel rods. The benches contained U-Al residue scattered on the <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> and bagged up in plastic containers. It was very important to obtain an estimate of the HEU content of this residue in order to remove criticality concerns before vacuuming it into a much smaller volume. A portable high purity germanium (HPGe) detection system and a portable sodium iodide (NaI) detection system were used to determine highly enriched uranium (HEU) holdup and to determine holdup Np- 237 and Am- 241 that were observed in these components. The measured Np- 237 and Am- 241 contents were especially important in these components because their presence is unusual and unexpected in 321 -M. It was important to obtain a measured value of these two components to disposition the saw benches and to determine whether a separate waste stream was necessary for release of these contaminated components to the E-Area Solid Waste Vault. The reported values for Np- 237 are < 0. 8 mg on each of the two <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> and < 3 {micro}g in the bag of chips. The reported values for Am- 241 are < 500 ng on the two <b>bench</b> <b>tops</b> and < 15 ng in the bag of chips. Our results demonstrate an upper limit of {sup 235 }U content of 0. 4 g on the two benchtops and of 0. 1 mg in the bag of chips. These reported values completely eliminated the criticality concerns. This report discusses the methodology, non-destructive assay (NDA) measurements, and results of the holdup measured {{for each of the three}} actinide species in these saw benches...|$|R
