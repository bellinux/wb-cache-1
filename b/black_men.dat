5|$|The exact {{death toll}} during the New York Draft Riots is unknown, but {{according}} to historian James M. McPherson, 119 or 120 people were killed. In all, eleven <b>black</b> <b>men</b> were lynched over five days. The riots forced hundreds of black people to flee the city. Violence by longshoremen against <b>black</b> <b>men</b> was especially fierce in the docks area.|$|E
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising {{the great majority}} of <b>black</b> <b>men.</b> White male-only primary elections also served to reduce the influence of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|Five Percenter {{membership}} plunged after Clarence13X's death, but rebounded in 1970 {{after new}} leadership emerged and revitalized the group. After his death, {{the group was}} not dominated by a single leader. This {{may have been a}} result of their teaching that all <b>black</b> <b>men</b> are gods, which rendered authoritarian leadership untenable.|$|E

5|$|In July 1910 {{racial tension}} flared towards the African-American {{community}} after a tremendous upset victory by African-American boxer Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada. Mobs of whites roamed throughout Omaha rioting, {{as they did}} in cities across the U.S. The mobs wounded several <b>black</b> <b>men</b> in the city, killing one.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{had contributed}} more {{manpower}} to the Allied cause in World War II, proportional to white population, {{than any other}} British dominion or colony, and more than the UK itself. According to figures compiled by MacDonald for his War History of Southern Rhodesia, 26,121 Southern Rhodesians served {{in the armed forces}} during the conflict, of whom 2,758 were commissioned officers. Broken down by race and gender, there were 15,153 <b>black</b> <b>men,</b> 9,187 white men, 1,510 white women and 271 coloured and Indian men. Of the 8,390 who served outside the territory, 1,505 were <b>black</b> <b>men,</b> 6,520 were white men, 137 were white women and 228 were coloured or Indian men.|$|E

50|$|The {{acquittal}} of a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> {{accused of}} shooting a white {{police officer in}} Alabama in 1981 was the erstwhile reason given by murderers for the lynching of Michael Donald, a 19-year-old <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> on March 21. After Josephus Andersonan, a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> in Mobile, Alabama, was charged {{with the murder of}} a white police officer but acquitted at trial.|$|R
5|$|Statistics on lynchings {{began to}} be {{collected}} in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African Americans {{have been killed by}} extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South. Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial relationships as a means to maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between <b>black</b> <b>men</b> and white women could carry severe penalties for <b>black</b> <b>men.</b> A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow mores was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.|$|E

5|$|Despite Governor Catts' {{change of}} attitude, white mob action {{frequently}} occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom {{was covered by}} newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four <b>black</b> <b>men</b> from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves {{to go to the}} polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee's black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright's lynching, whites shot and hanged two more <b>black</b> <b>men</b> in Perry; next they burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the mayhem}} {{of the storm}} and plane landing, the mob turns its focus back on the young <b>black</b> <b>man</b> who is getting burned to death. When the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> politely asks for a quick death, Jed Wilson, {{a leader of the}} lynch mob, refuses, saying, [...] "...ain't no Christians around tonight." [...] The <b>black</b> <b>man</b> burns to death, his corpse turning to ashes.|$|R

50|$|I {{realized}} {{now that}} militancy {{in the best}} sense of the word was the only answer where the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> was concerned, that any <b>black</b> <b>man</b> who wasn't a militant in 1970 was either blind or a coward.|$|R
5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and native-born Americans were usually social outcasts who had few other employment options or {{they were trying to}} escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men were recruited by the Navy. It was unlawful for <b>black</b> <b>men</b> to serve in the Navy, but the shortage of men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E
5|$|In December, 2,000–3,000 people {{gathered}} at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, to protest the killings of unarmed <b>black</b> <b>men</b> by police. At least twenty members of a protest that had been using the slogan were arrested. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, BLM protested the police shooting of Dontre Hamilton, who died in April. Black Lives Matter protested the shooting of John Crawford III. The shooting of Renisha McBride was protested by Black Lives Matter.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, BLM protesters {{shut down}} Allen Road in Toronto, Ontario, protesting the {{shooting}} deaths of two <b>black</b> <b>men</b> {{in the metropolitan}} area—Andrew Loku and Jermaine Carby—at the hands of police. In September, BLM activists shut down streets in Toronto, rallied against police brutality, and stood in solidarity with marginalized black lives. Black Lives Matter was a featured part of the Take Back the Night event in Toronto.|$|E
5000|$|A motorbiker (Stefan Merki), who {{early in}} the film was unable to start his motorcycle, boards a tram in Berlin, and {{witnesses}} a <b>black</b> <b>man</b> (Paul Outlaw) sitting down next to an elderly white woman (Senta Moira). In the entire 12 minutes, the old woman racially abuses the <b>black</b> <b>man,</b> stating that <b>blacks</b> stink, are unintelligent, criminal and the perfect carrier for AIDS. The biker feels uncomfortable, but does not dare to interrupt. The <b>black</b> <b>man</b> stays quiet for the entire film, until the tram controller arrives: when the old woman produces her ticket, he grabs and swallows it. When the old woman accuses the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> of eating her ticket, he coolly shows his valid ticket to the controller; the latter nods at him and arrests the old woman. The punch line is that both the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> and the old woman are [...] "Schwarzfahrer" [...] now: the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> who rides a train, is a non-offensive [...] "black rider", while the old woman now is a real law-breaking Schwarzfahrer (i.e. fare dodger). The one passenger the viewer knows who never possessed a ticket, the motorbiker, escapes without the controller checking his ticket.|$|R
60|$|The valley {{guarded by}} the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> now lay before him, and from afar Peronnik beheld him, chained by {{one foot to}} a rock at the entrance, and holding the iron ball which never missed its mark and always {{returned}} to its master's hand. In his head the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> had six eyes that were never all shut at once, but kept watch one after the other. At this moment they were all open, and Peronnik knew well that if the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> {{caught a glimpse of}} him he would cast his ball. So, hiding the colt behind a thicket of bushes, he crawled along a ditch and crouched close to the very rock to which the <b>black</b> <b>man</b> was chained.|$|R

5|$|The Navy asked Congress to {{give each}} victim's family $5,000. Representative John E. Rankin (D-MS) insisted the amount be reduced to $2,000 when he learned most of the dead were <b>black</b> <b>men.</b> Congress settled on $3,000 in compensation. Years later, on March 4, 1949, the heirs of {{eighteen}} merchant seamen killed in the explosion were granted a total of $390,000 after gaining approval of their consent decrees in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.|$|E
5|$|The {{only real}} {{threat of a}} black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted {{to make clear that}} the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that <b>black</b> <b>men</b> were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising <b>black</b> <b>men</b> not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E

5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that <b>black</b> <b>men</b> were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
