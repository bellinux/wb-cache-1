500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> character. It was good to see those dents in her armour I think".|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{views of}} Pornography {{have been more}} favourable. In his {{biography}} of the Cure, Never Enough: The Story of the Cure, Jeff Apter wrote that it [...] "turned out to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of album—just like Lou Reed's Berlin or Bowie's coke-fueled Low—that required some distance and a good few years of music history to be really appreciated". In 1995, Mark Coleman of Rolling Stone noted that Pornography {{had come to be}} [...] "revered by Cureheads as a masterstroke", while noting that [...] "normal listeners will probably find it impenetrable". Stewart Mason of AllMusic found it to be [...] "much better than most mainstream critics of the time thought", {{but at the same time}} [...] "not the masterpiece some fans have claimed it to be" [...] and [...] "just a bit too uneven to be considered a classic". In 2004, Jaime Gill of BBC Music singled out the album's [...] "sonic depth and sheer relentless conviction" [...] for praise, adding that without these qualities, its [...] "extraordinary misanthropy would be laughable". Uncut called Pornography [...] "a masterpiece of claustrophobic self-loathing".|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} of the Bautista bat flip celebration, which could be viewed during the beta, received wide media coverage, with sites such as Yahoo! Sports, FOX Sports, CBS Sports, {{as well as the}} MLB's own Cut4 news subsidiary reporting on it. Critics who played the game's beta gave it generally positive reviews. Samit Sarkar of Polygon stated that [...] "NHL 17 is shaping up to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of game that could bring the series back to its previous-generation heights," [...] complimenting the game's gameplay improvements and the new additions to the EASHL mode. Jake Sundstrom of SB Nations Fear the Fin blog enjoyed the game's team and arena builders, but commented that they need [...] "a little more depth". Brian Mazique of Forbes lauded the game's graphics, stating that [...] "NHL continues {{to be one of the}} most attractive sports games available." [...] He also praised the game's improved AI systems for CPU teammates and opponents as well as the online connectivity. He was more critical of the HUT mode's menus and the game's presentation, calling it [...] "beyond stale and outdated." [...] Mazique enjoyed the EASHL mode, but felt that the player creation feature was limited in options. SB Nation writer SkyonAir, of the Stanley Cup of Chowder blog, praised the player and team creators as well as the gameplay overhaul for goaltenders. While he criticized the beta's lack of game modes offered, he recommended the game to readers.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} {{which appeared in}} The New York Times, Williams said that the choices {{for many of the}} pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen, Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony), which features prominently in the film, was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script. Some of the other choices, such as Gideon's playing of Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that [...] "hey are some writer's conception of what this character might have listened to." [...] Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet (Op. 64, No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because [...] "t seemed to me to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of thing a woman like this would play on the radio." [...] The New York Times characterized the score as [...] "evocative" [...] and said it was [...] "thoroughly modern" [...] while also being [...] "interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks." [...] The piece heard when Anderton is shown entering his apartment and he tells his computer system [...] "I'm home" [...] is the 2nd movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, known as the [...] "Pathetique" [...] Symphony.|$|E

Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure." [...] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They're so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Parental anxiety may not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of stuff children's films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Medieval {{philosophers}} {{who used}} Aristotelian concepts frequently distinguished between substantial forms and accidental forms. A substance necessarily possesses {{at least one}} substantial form. It may also possess a variety of accidental forms.

The substantial form of substance S consists of S's essential properties, the properties that S's matter needs in order to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of substance that S is. In contrast, S's accidental forms are S's non-essential properties, properties that S can lose or gain without changing into {{a different kind of}} substance.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{opponents of}} Warren's view {{believe that what}} matters morally is not that one be {{actually}} exhibiting complex mental qualities of the sort she identifies, but rather that one have in oneself a self-directed genetic propensity or natural capacity to develop such qualities. [...] In other words, what is crucial is that one <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of entity or substance that, under the right conditions, actively develops itself {{to the point of}} exhibiting Warren's qualities at some point in its life, even if it does not actually exhibit them because of not having developed them yet (embryo, infant) or having lost them (severe Alzheimer's). [...] Because human beings do have this natural capacity—and indeed have it essentially—therefore (on this view) they essentially have a right to life: they could not possibly fail to have a right to life. Further, since modern embryology shows that the embryo begins to exist at conception and has a natural capacity for complex mental qualities, therefore the right to life begins at conception.|$|E
2500|$|Scott Foundas at Variety {{calls the}} film [...] "pleasant," [...] and gives much credit to {{director}} Pasquin.

Foundas also gives high marks to Allen's work in the picture, calling his presence the [...] "pic's winningest asset." [...] Steve Simels at TV Guide writes that the film [...] "has genuine wit and pathos," [...] some well drawn characters, [...] "and a couple of sly comic performances." [...] However, Simels did state that [...] "none of these virtues can completely compensate for the film's utterly conventional message of uplift." [...] Simels gave praise {{to some of the}} lead performances, crediting Greg Germann in particular for nearly stealing the film, calling his portrayal [...] "truly a marvel to behold." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly called the film a [...] "standard-transmission vehicle;" [...] she gives credit, however, to star Allen's performance, saying that the character he plays in the film [...] "just so happens to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of average-Joe character that continues to make Allen such a tidy, non-Joe bundle." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of music that I felt as though I wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. Back when I was doing Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E

It had to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of sleeve you'd fall in love with ... And I think it works that way – the effect in window displays is stunning." [...] Enya was [...] "very happy" [...] with the cover, calling it [...] "very classic" [...] and [...] "in taste with the music", not portraying her as the latest [...] "girl on the scene" [...] when compared to other female solo artists at the time, such as Madonna and Kylie Minogue. The artwork provided the inspiration to the music video for [...] "Orinoco Flow". Dickins decided against the inclusion of a detailed set of liner notes and lyrics with their translations as it encouraged the listener to conjure up their own images and understanding when they play it, a decision that Enya supported.|$|E
2500|$|On May 23, 2005, Lieberman {{was one of}} {{fourteen}} senators, dubbed the [...] "Gang of 14," [...] who forged a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial filibuster, thus avoiding the Republican leadership's implementation of the so-called [...] "nuclear option". [...] Under the agreement, the Democrats would exercise the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an [...] "extraordinary circumstance," [...] {{and three of the}} filibustered Bush appellate court nominees [...] (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) [...] would receive a vote by the full Senate, which resulted in their confirmation. Lieberman refused to support a filibuster against Supreme Court Justice nominee Samuel Alito. Alito was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 31, 2006 by a vote of 58-42, becoming the Court's 110th Justice. Lieberman voted against the Alito confirmation in the final Senate vote. On the John Roberts nomination as the Chief Justice of the United States, Lieberman believed that Roberts did not seem to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of right-wing candidate the [...] "Gang of 14" [...] feared the president would select.
