It has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that when someone sits in it, the person dies. About four people <b>are</b> <b>said</b> to have died, and Easby then banned people from sitting in the chair. The chair <b>was</b> <b>said</b> to <b>be</b> owned by Napoleon. It has <b>been</b> <b>said</b> that the chair is haunted by the ghost of Amanda, a red mist that <b>is</b> <b>said</b> to kill people who sit in the chair.

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event that a person is experiencing a painful headache.|$|E
5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground for judicial review. Rather, it should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive decision is disproportionate it can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.|$|E

5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings. Fish {{is used as}} a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups. Thus a pond that contained a single species might <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them.

Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible.

5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Philosophers of {{language}} distinguish among the lexical or linguistic {{meaning of the}} sentence uttered, what <b>is</b> <b>said</b> by an utterance of the sentence, and speaker's meaning, or what is conveyed by the speaker to her audience.

5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|Golondrina {{points are}} {{widespread}} {{across much of}} central, southern, and western Texas, with distribution extending northward along the Balcones Escarpment. They are particularly prevalent across the South Texas Plains, so much so as to <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to represent the first unique cultural pattern in the area. Most Golondrina specimens from the South Texas Plains are not excavated but rather found on the site's surface. They often appear as part of mixed collections with artifacts of later periods. Several sites have also been found in Arkansas {{as well as in}} the Lower Pecos Canyonlands and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León.|$|E
5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, the {{language}} is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script. In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar), but {{much of what is}} to <b>be</b> <b>said</b> is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E

5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla {{war against the}} Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links {{between the two sides}} of the Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E
5|$|Little can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of the {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports {{the theory that the}} ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more can}} <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of Padarn, though he later {{attracted}} the usual hagiography, the Vita Sancti Paternus, which recounts many supposed {{details of his}} life. He {{may have been more}} closely associated with late Romano-British civilization than some other early British saints, as his dedications are apparently connected by Roman roads. Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn Helen) crosses the river Rheidol. Sarn Helen passes close to Strata Florida and Llanddewi Brefi which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were the three most important ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion.|$|E
