40|$|AbstractCost {{and expense}} {{stickiness}} {{is an important}} issue in accounting and economics research, and the literature has shown that cost stickiness cannot be separated from managers’ motivations. In this paper, we examine the effects that earnings management has <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. Defining small positive profits or small earnings increases as earnings management, we observe significant expense stickiness in the non-earnings-management sub-sample, compared with the earnings-management sub-sample. When we divide expenses into R&D, advertising and other general expenses, we find that managers control expenses mainly by decreasing general expenses. We further examine corporate governance’s effect <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. Using factor analysis, we extract eight main factors and find that good corporate governance reduces expense stickiness. Finally, we investigate the interaction effects of earnings management and corporate governance <b>on</b> <b>expense</b> stickiness. The empirical results show that good corporate governance can further reduce cost stickiness, although its effect is not as strong as that of earnings management...|$|R

40|$|With {{the loss}} of a lower limb, amputees lack the active muscle {{empowered}} control of the ankle that is important for balance control. We examined single-leg stance on prosthesis vs. sound limb <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> narrow ridges in transtibial amputees. When <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> the prosthetic limb, the lateral displacement of the center of pressure was reduced and was compensated by an increase in counter-rotation. We show that single-leg stance on a prosthetic limb can be compared to <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> a narrow ridge. Standing on a prosthetic limb involves the same balance mechanisms as <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> narrow ridges of 40 -mm to 20 -mm width. Yet, the ability to <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> a narrow ridge with the sound limb was only a weak predictor for an amputee's ability to stand on the prosthetic limb. Balancing in single-leg stance on a prosthetic limb is not a common activity. The ability to compensate with the sound limb may therefore be functionally more important than the ability to stay in dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> the prosthetic limb. (C) 2016 IPEM.
