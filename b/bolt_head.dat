25|$|Either the <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> or the nut can be torqued. If one has {{a larger}} bearing area or {{coefficient}} of friction it will require more torque to provide the same target preload. Fasteners should only be torqued if they are fitted in s.|$|E
25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E

The analyses included full 360 -degree geometry, varying inlet and outlet configurations, different exhaust pressures, and both including and neglecting the flange <b>bolt</b> <b>heads.</b> With <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> included, the predicted coupling guard surface temperatures approximately matched values measured in the field. In the particular field problem addressed here, the measured temperatures were 219 to 222 ?F (104 - 106 ?C), while the CFD predicted temperature ranged from 209 - 227 ?F (98 - 108 ?C). Among the important findings are: The moving <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> generate much of the heat in a coupling guard; Properly placed outlet ports can use the <b>bolt</b> <b>heads</b> as a blower, increasing air flow through the coupling guard and lowering the temperature; Small reductions in exhaust pressure can lower the coupling guard surface temperature significantly. Numerous plots, graphs, and tables give insight into the flow field inside the coupling guard. These analyses can guide the design of coupling guards with lower surface temperatures...|$|R

2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either the <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and {{is a function of the}} bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued <b>bolt</b> <b>head</b> or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|E
2500|$|The M3 was an automatic, {{air-cooled}} blowback-operated {{weapon that}} fired {{from an open}} bolt. [...] Constructed of plain [...]060-in. thick sheet steel, the M3 receiver was stamped in two halves that were then welded together. [...] The M3 was striker-fired, with a fixed firing pin contained inside the bolt. The bolt was drilled longitudinally to support two parallel guide rods, upon which were mounted twin return (recoil) springs. This configuration allowed for larger machining tolerances while providing operating clearance {{in the event of}} dust, sand, or mud ingress. The M3 featured a spring-loaded extractor which was housed inside the <b>bolt</b> <b>head,</b> while the ejector was located in the trigger group.
