5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics. The player controls a cursor {{to direct the}} main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. Jennifer can walk and run, although running will reduce her stamina, in which case she may recover her stamina <b>by</b> <b>sitting</b> on the floor. Jennifer's character portrait {{in the corner of}} the screen will change depending on her stamina level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them as inventory for later use. The layout of items changes with each play-through.|$|E
5|$|During the Dakota War of 1862, {{in which}} Sitting Bull's {{people were not}} involved, several bands of eastern Dakota people killed an {{estimated}} 300 to 800 settlers and soldiers in south-central Minnesota in response to poor treatment {{by the government and}} in an effort to drive the whites away. Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities. In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led <b>by</b> <b>Sitting</b> Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta. The Lakota and Dakota were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.|$|E
5|$|By 1824, New Hampshire was {{a hotbed}} of partisanship, with figures such as Woodbury and Isaac Hill {{laying the groundwork for}} a party of Democrats in support of General Andrew Jackson. They opposed the {{established}} Federalists (and their successors, the National Republicans), who were led <b>by</b> <b>sitting</b> President John Quincy Adams. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the 1828 presidential election between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office, but Franklin Pierce won his first election: Hillsborough town moderator, a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.|$|E

5|$|Scientifically, the light-observation {{experiments}} were unsuccessful, as both target locations {{were covered by}} thick cloud cover. However, Schirra was able to view lightning near Woomera, and noted the lights of a city {{a few hundred miles}} from Durban. The filtered photography for the Weather Bureau worked as planned, with 15photographs taken; the conventional color photography was less successful, with several of the 14photographs unusable due to overexposure or excess cloud cover. In the end, the conventional photographs were not used for scientific examination due to these problems. Schirra noted that the sheer amount of cloud coverage, worldwide, could provide problems for future activity of this kind; however, Africa, and the south-western United States, were perfectly clear. Postflight medical examination of Schirra disclosed nothing significant other than a degree of orthostatic hypotension caused <b>by</b> <b>sitting</b> inside the cramped capsule for hours.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} John Marshall Harlan, who {{had served}} in the Union Army. In joint debates across the state, McCreary stressed what many Kentuckians felt were abuses of power by Republican President Ulysses S. Grant during the Reconstruction Era. Harlan countered by faulting the state's Democratic politicians for continuing to dwell on war issues almost a decade after the war's end. He also attacked what he perceived as Democratic financial extravagance and the high number of pardons granted <b>by</b> <b>sitting</b> Democratic governor Preston Leslie. Harlan claimed these as evidence of widespread corruption in the Democratic Party. McCreary received solid support from the state's newspapers, nearly all of which had Democratic sympathies. Despite a late infusion of cash and stump speakers in favor of his opponent, McCreary won the general election by a vote of 130,026 to 94,236.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} a tag team elimination match, in which The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) teamed with the Nasty Boys (Jerry Sags and Brian Knobbs) to face Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake). The rules stated that when any man was eliminated, his tag team partner {{would also be}} eliminated. Blake Beverly and Typhoon began the match, but Beau and Earthquake soon entered the ring as well. The Natural Disasters gained control of the match by attacking Blake Beverly, and the Nasty Boys entered the ring to assist the Disasters. Blake attacked Sags and tagged out of the match. Beau entered but was bodyslammed by Sags; Sags got distracted, however, which allowed Beau to suplex him and bring DiBiase into the match. Money Inc. took turns attacking Sags until Earthquake entered the ring. Earthquake performed an Earthquake splash <b>by</b> <b>sitting</b> on Beau Beverly to pin him and eliminate both Beverly Brothers. Earthquake fought DiBiase, but both men eventually left the ring and were replaced by their partners. Typhoon performed a splash on Schyster but was tripped by DiBiase. Schyster pinned Typhoon to eliminate The Natural Disasters. While Schyster was celebrating, Sags quickly pinned him to win the match for the Nasty Boys.|$|E

5|$|By 1420, James's {{standing}} at Henry V's court improved greatly; he {{ceased to be}} regarded as a hostage and more of a guest. James's value to Henry became apparent in 1420 when he accompanied the English king to France where his presence was used against the Scots fighting on the Dauphinist side. Following the English success at the siege of Melun, a town southeast of Paris, the contingent of Scots were hanged for treason against their king. James attended Catherine of Valois's coronation on 23 February 1421 and was honoured <b>by</b> <b>sitting</b> immediately on the queen's left at the coronation banquet. In March, Henry began a circuit of the important towns in England as a show of strength and it was during this tour that James was knighted on Saint George's day. By July, the two kings were back campaigning in France where James, evidently approving of Henry's methods of kingship, seemed content to endorse the English king's desire for the French crown. Henry appointed the Duke of Bedford and James as the joint commanders of the siege of Dreux on 18 July 1421 and on 20 August they received the surrender of the garrison. Henry died of dysentery on 31 August 1422 and in September James was part of the escort taking the English king's body back to London.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1994–1995 NBA season, Rodman {{clashed with the}} Spurs front office. He was suspended {{for the first three}} games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19games. After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team. In the 1995 NBA Playoffs, the 62-win Spurs with reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Award winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions Houston Rockets who had only won 47games. It was thought that Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon {{would have a hard time}} asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers <b>by</b> <b>sitting</b> down on the court, could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.|$|E
