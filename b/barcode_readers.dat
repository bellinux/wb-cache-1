5|$|Helium–neon lasers, {{a type of}} low-powered {{gas laser}} {{producing}} a red beam, had various practical applications which included <b>barcode</b> <b>readers</b> and laser pointers, before they were almost universally replaced by cheaper diode lasers.|$|E
5|$|PoweredUSB is a {{proprietary}} extension that adds four additional pins supplying up to 6A at 5V, 12V, or 24V. It {{is commonly used}} in point of sale systems to power peripherals such as <b>barcode</b> <b>readers,</b> credit card terminals, and printers.|$|E
25|$|Laser diodes are {{the most}} common type of lasers produced, with a wide range of uses that include fiber optic communications, <b>barcode</b> <b>readers,</b> laser pointers, CD/DVD/Blu-ray disc reading/recording, laser printing, laser {{scanning}} and light-beam illumination.|$|E

25|$|A SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) card is an {{extension}} of the SD specification to cover I/O functions. SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the Palm Treo, but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support GPS receivers, modems, <b>barcode</b> <b>readers,</b> FM radio tuners, TV tuners, RFID readers, digital cameras, and interfaces to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and IrDA. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.|$|E
25|$|A barcode is an optical, machine-readable, {{representation}} of data; the data usually describes {{something about the}} object that carries the barcode. Originally barcodes systematically represented data by varying the widths and spacings of parallel lines, and may {{be referred to as}} linear or one-dimensional (1D). Later two-dimensional (2D) codes were developed, using rectangles, dots, hexagons and other geometric patterns in two dimensions, usually called barcodes although they do not use bars as such. Barcodes were initially scanned by special optical scanners called <b>barcode</b> <b>readers.</b> Later application software became available for devices that could read images, such as smartphones with cameras.|$|E

25|$|Laser diodes find wide use in {{telecommunication}} {{as easily}} modulated and easily coupled light sources for fiber optics communication. They {{are used in}} various measuring instruments, such as rangefinders. Another common use is in <b>barcode</b> <b>readers.</b> Visible lasers, typically red but later also green, are common as laser pointers. Both low and high-power diodes are used extensively in the printing industry both as light sources for scanning (input) of images and for very high-speed and high-resolution printing plate (output) manufacturing. Infrared and red laser diodes are common in CD players, CD-ROMs and DVD technology. Violet lasers are used in HD DVD and Blu-ray technology. Diode lasers have also found many applications in laser absorption spectrometry (LAS) for high-speed, low-cost assessment or monitoring of the concentration of various species in gas phase. High-power laser diodes are used in industrial applications such as heat treating, cladding, seam welding and for pumping other lasers, such as diode-pumped solid-state lasers.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{applications}} of diode lasers primarily {{make use of}} the [...] "directed energy" [...] property of an optical beam. In this category, one might include the laser printers, <b>barcode</b> <b>readers,</b> image scanning, illuminators, designators, optical data recording, combustion ignition, laser surgery, industrial sorting, industrial machining, and directed energy weaponry. Some of these applications are well-established while others are emerging.|$|E
2500|$|During Land's {{tenure as}} Secretary of State, she {{implemented}} {{a plan to}} expand online service options, improve services at branch offices to create shorter lines for customers, and make use of more reliable election equipment. The Grand Rapids Press editorial board praised Land for her technological transformation of state services. According to the Michigan Legislature, Land implemented “other advancements, [...] include the introduction of Self-Service Stations for easy license plate tab renewals and creation of an online Branch Office Locator that provides customers with office locations, hours, and services simply by entering their zip code, city or county". Land championed the effort to implement more reliable voting machines,while also installing magnetic <b>barcode</b> <b>readers</b> in all branch offices to speed up transactions and ensure accuracy.|$|E
