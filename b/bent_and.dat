5|$|Aksel Winther, <b>Bent</b> <b>and</b> Jørgen's handler, {{signals to}} them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the Abwehr, the German {{military}} intelligence service. <b>Bent</b> <b>and</b> Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of retaliation by the Nazis. However, Winther claims orders from the government in exile in London. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Later, Jørgen, his wife, Bodil, and their daughter, Ann, celebrate the girl's birthday on their car as they are without money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Three weeks later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the Danish Army Intelligence. He says {{there will be no}} more attacks, as they need peace to assemble men for a big attack. The three agree that they should not follow Spex's order, and later Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his wife and daughter; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.|$|E
5|$|Cheadle Hulme did {{not grow}} around a church like many English villages, but instead grew from several hamlets {{that existed in}} the area. Many of the names of these hamlets still appear in the names of areas, {{including}} Smithy Green, Lane End, Gill <b>Bent,</b> <b>and</b> Grove Lane. Some of the many farms such as Orish Mere Farm and Hursthead Farm which covered the area also retain their names in schools that were built in their place.|$|E

5|$|Set {{after the}} Nazi {{invasion}} of Denmark, the film {{focuses on the}} Holger Danske resistance group's Bent Faurschou Hviid (known as Flammen) and Jørgen Haagen Schmith (known as Citron). In a bar, Bent flirts with a woman, who identifies herself as Ketty Selmer and disturbs him by saying his real name. <b>Bent</b> <b>and</b> Jørgen follow the woman, and she tells Bent she is an emissary from Stockholm to Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine army marched from Constantinople through Komotini, Drama and Serres {{and reached}} the Rupel gorge on the Struma river. From there the army entered the Strumitsa valley {{and reached the}} {{vicinity}} of the village of Klyuch, where the river <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> approached Belasitsa and Ozgrazhden. There the army was stopped by a thick wooden wall, defended by Bulgarian soldiers. The Byzantines attacked the palisade immediately, but were repulsed with heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally <b>bent,</b> <b>and</b> the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
50|$|Other {{prominent}} co-founders include former Prime Minister Poul Schlüter, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, {{university professors}} Nicolai Juul Foss, Jesper Lau Hansen, <b>Bent</b> Jensen, <b>and</b> Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard. Also included are well-known journalists <b>Bent</b> Blüdnikow <b>and</b> Samuel Rachlin and cultural personalities such as <b>Bent</b> Fabricius-Bjerre <b>and</b> Michael Laudrup.

5|$|In the four-armed form, a {{right hand}} holds a parashu (axe) and another makes an abhaya mudra (gesture of reassurance), {{or one of}} the right arms is {{slightly}} <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> rests on the head of Shiva's bull mount, Nandi, while the other is held in the abhaya mudra gesture. Another configuration suggests that a right hand holds a trishula (trident) and another makes a varada mudra (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow <b>bent,</b> <b>and</b> the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E
5|$|After {{several members}} of the {{resistance}} are killed by the Gestapo, Winther suspects they have an informant among them. Later, Bent visits Ketty's hotel room, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Jørgen visits his wife and advises her boyfriend to treat her properly or he will return. In a meeting, Winther says the informer is Ketty and orders her death. Bent meets Ketty; she tells him she works for both Winther and army intelligence, and that Winther does not work for the British. Winther, involved with Gilbert and Seibold, had ordered them to be killed in order not {{to be seen as a}} traitor. <b>Bent</b> <b>and</b> Jørgen search for Winther in the bar and discover that he has escaped to Stockholm. They realize it is a trap, and they escape from the Gestapo men. They decide to kill Karl Heinz Hoffmann, the Gestapo's leader, and then take over the favorite Gestapo restaurant. Bent cannot kill Hoffmann because they have to get away when he notices the police coming. That night, Ketty says to Bent that he and Jørgen should go to Stockholm. In the meeting, they are offered positions in the Danish Army but they refuse. A man called Ravnen gives them the name of the real informer, and Jørgen soon kills him.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily <b>bent</b> <b>and</b> damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

40|$|For weakly regular bent {{functions}} in odd characteristic the dual function is also bent. We analyse a recently introduced construction of nonweakly regular <b>bent</b> functions <b>and</b> show {{conditions under which}} their dual is bent as well.

We analyse self-duality for bent {{functions in}} odd characteristic, and characterize quadratic self-dual bent functions. We construct non-weakly regular <b>bent</b> functions with <b>and</b> without a <b>bent</b> dual, <b>and</b> <b>bent</b> functions with a dual bent function of a dierent algebraic degree...|$|R
