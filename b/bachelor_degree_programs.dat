40|$|Abstract: A {{phenomenon}} that prevails in university classrooms, {{particularly among the}} undergraduates, is their silent and reticent behaviors during classroom hours. This study was undertaken {{to test the hypothesis}} that such behaviors can be ascribed to what we have labeled as “classroom participation anxiety”, a type of situation anxiety not unlike communication apprehension. The population for this study comprised undergraduate students taking courses in “English for Occupational Purposes ” in a university in Malaysia. The study investigated whether differences existed in classroom participation anxiety between male and female students; between local and international students; between students from the six <b>bachelor</b> <b>degree</b> <b>programs.</b> In addition, the study also investigated whether predictive relationships existed between perceived oral competence in English, students ’ motivation to study, teachers ’ verbal and non-verbal immediacy behaviors with classroom participation anxiety. The findings revealed that statistically significant differences existed between local and international students and between students from the six <b>bachelor</b> <b>degree</b> <b>programs.</b> However, no statistically significant mean differences existed in classroom participation anxiety between male and female students. The results also revealed that only two correlates were significantly predictive of classroom participation anxiety: perceived oral competence in English and teachers ’ verbal immediacy behaviors...|$|E
