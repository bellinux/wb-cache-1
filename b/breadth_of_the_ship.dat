60|$|It is not {{wonderful}} that <b>the</b> launch <b>of</b> a craft, at once so splendid and so curious, should have caused much interest and {{excitement in the}} neighbourhood in which it took place.

40|$|While {{excavating}} a late fourth-century Roman merchantman off <b>the</b> coast <b>of</b> Yassiada, Turkey in 1967, archaeologists discovered another, {{more recent}} wreck lying across <b>the</b> stern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman wreck. The artifact assemblage, dendrochronology, and carbon- 14 dating indicated that <b>the</b> wreck was <b>of</b> Ottoman origin and dated {{to the late}} sixteenth-century. In 1982 and 1983, archaeologists under <b>the</b> auspices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Institute <b>of</b> Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M University returned to the site to fully excavate the vessel and raise its timbers for detailed study and conservation at <b>the</b> Bodrum Museum <b>of</b> Underwater Archaeology in Turkey. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to analyze <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull by building upon previous preliminary reconstruction efforts to determine <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> intended form and function. To accomplish this task, 1 : 10 scale drawings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timbers were used to construct a half <b>breadth</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> By matching <b>the</b> nail holes on the recovered planking to <b>the</b> preserved remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> framing, {{it was possible to}} assess the hull's contours through transfer to a lines drawing. The resulting drawings show a moderately sized vessel with a wide flat bottom. In order to place the reconstruction into perspective, archaeological remains of similar shipwrecks and period iconography were consulted in order to suggest <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> type and function. Four shipwrecks were found that have similar construction features to those on the Ottoman wreck. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrecks had the same unusual knuckle joints used in securing futtocks to frames that the Ottoman wreck has, shedding light on design and construction philosophy <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> in <b>the</b> eastern Mediterranean. <b>The</b> preliminary analysis <b>of</b> period iconography in conjunction with <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> similar shipwrecks indicated that the vessel was a cargo carrier that may have ties to the Ottoman navy. Four types <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> from <b>the</b> same general period, the felluca, polacre, and shebek were found to have similar design features to the Ottoman wreck, but the closest iconographic parallel was the saique, which was a two-masted cargo carrier found in the Black Sea and <b>the</b> west coast <b>of</b> Turkey between <b>the</b> sixteenth and eighteenth centuries...|$|R

40|$|ASME 2016 35 th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering OMAE 2016 The {{ultimate}} longitudinal {{bending strength}} {{is the most}} fundamental strength {{to ensure the safety}} of ships not only in the intact but also in the damage condition. In conjunction with this, when a hull girder cross section is symmetric with respect to the centerline and subjected to pure vertical bending moment, the neutral axis is always horizontal and moves only vertically during the progressive collapse behavior. On the other hand, when the cross section is damaged at asymmetric positions, the neutral axis rotates. Both rotation and translation need to be taken into account and the problem needs to be treated as a biaxial bending problem. This paper discusses the influence of asymmetrically damaged ships on the ultimate hull girder strength. When such damages take place at the asymmetric location of cross sections, not only the translation but also the inclination of instantaneous neutral axis take place during the process of the progressive collapse. To investigate of this effect, the Non-Linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is employed. A Three-Hold Model of Single Hull Bulk Carrier is taken to be analyzed. The model is simply supported at the fore and aft end cross sections, which are assumed to be rigid. The forced rotations are applied at the both ends under the zero-axial force condition. In order to investigate the influence the rotation of the neutral axis due to asymmetric damage on ultimate strength, the full <b>breadth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> is modeled. The damage is assumed in the middle hold, which is modeled by the finer mesh than both-side holds. The collision damage is modeled by removing the plate and stiffener elements at the damage region assuming the compete loss of the capacity at the damage part. To achieve a better balance of efficiency and accuracy, the FEM analysis is divided into three phases. In the phase one, the relatively fast rotational velocity of loading is given both ends of the model within the elastic range. Then in phase two, the rotational velocity is stopped, giving the global damping coefficient in order to eliminate the vibration. In the phase three, to minimize the dynamic effect, the relatively slow rotational velocity is imposed to the model until the ultimate longitudinal strength is attained. The analysis conditions were determined by the trial and error approach. For the validation results obtained by Finite Element Analysis of the asymmetrically damaged hull girder, the simplified method is adopted. The Finite Element Method of ultimate strength analysis of damaged hull girders can be a practical tool for the ship hull girders after damages, which has become one of the functional requirements in IMO Goal Based Ship Construction Standard...|$|E
