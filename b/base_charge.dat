25|$|Detailed {{transistor}} {{models of}} transistor action, {{such as the}} Gummel–Poon model, account for the distribution of this charge explicitly to explain transistor behaviour more exactly. The charge-control view easily handles phototransistors, where minority carriers in the base region are created by the absorption of photons, and handles the dynamics of turn-off, or recovery time, which depends on charge in the base region recombining. However, because <b>base</b> <b>charge</b> is not a signal that is visible at the terminals, the current- and voltage-control views are generally used in circuit design and analysis.|$|E
25|$|The gun fired semi-fixed {{ammunition}}, {{similar to}} the ammunition of the M2; it used the same projectiles and the same 105mm Cartridge Case M14, but with different propelling charge. The latter used faster burning powder to avoid incomplete burning; it consisted of a <b>base</b> <b>charge</b> and four increments, forming five charges from 1 (the smallest) to 5 (the largest). In an emergency, gunners were authorized to fire M1 HE rounds prepared for the Howitzer M2, but only with charges from 1 to 3. M1 HE rounds for the M3 could be fired from an M2 with any charge.|$|E
25|$|Utility {{companies}} are typically legally responsible {{for maintaining the}} electrical infrastructure that brings power to our cities, neighborhoods, and individual buildings. Utility companies typically own this infrastructure up to the property line of an individual parcel, {{and in some cases}} own electrical infrastructure on private land as well. Utilities have expressed concern that the use of Net Metering for ZNE projects threatens the Utilities base revenue, which in turn impacts their ability to maintain and service the portion of the electrical grid that they are responsible for. Utilities have expressed concern that states that maintain Net Metering laws may saddle non-ZNE homes with higher utility costs, as those homeowners would be responsible for paying for grid maintenance while ZNE home owners would theoretically pay nothing if they do achieve ZNE status. This creates potential equity issues, as currently, the burden would appear to fall on lower-income households. A possible solution to this issue is to create a minimum <b>base</b> <b>charge</b> for all homes connected to the utility grid, which would force ZNE home owners to pay for grid services independently of their electrical use.|$|E

Brian Paddick, the Liberal Democrat candidate, suggested exempting delivery vehicles from the charge. Johnson was elected and immediately announced that the emissions <b>based</b> <b>charges</b> would not be implemented.|$|R

2500|$|The Army {{failed to}} {{appreciate}} that the naval [...] ammunition was not in its inventory until after the guns had already been produced. It asked Krupp to modify the guns to use its standard [...] ammunition, but it proved uneconomic to do so. It deployed the guns in fixed locations, i.e. on coast-defense duties, [...] to minimize the burden on its logistical system. Ultimately the Army ordered eight 21cm replacement barrels, but only four had been built before six weapons were captured or destroyed during the Battle of Normandy and the whole exercise became futile. It used the German naval system of ammunition where the <b>base</b> <b>charge</b> was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first.|$|E

40|$|The {{idea of the}} {{efficient}} use of roads, which requires users {{to pay for the}} traffic congestion cost that they impose on an urban road network, is long established (Pigou, 1920; Walters, 1961). However, the gap between the constructive theory of road pricing and its real world application is significant due to the issue of public acceptance, technical feasibility, and the cost of implementation (Sharp, 1966; Verhoef et al, 1995; Stenman and Sterner, 1998; and Sumalee, 2000). Different charging regimes have been developed and studied including time or delay <b>based</b> <b>charging,</b> distance <b>based</b> <b>charging,</b> cordon or boundary <b>based</b> <b>charging,</b> and area <b>based</b> <b>charging</b> (Holland and Watson, 1978; May, 1992; Oldridge, 1990; Smith et al, 1994; and Ison, 1998). The cordon charging system is the core of the study in this paper where we are looking for criteria for the judgmental design of cordons. We use the term “judgmental cordon design” to describe the process to identify the best locations to levy the charges and specify the optimal <b>charge</b> levels <b>based</b> on professional judgment. This paper reviews the literature to identify design criteria in section 2, and then it describes a survey with six UK local authorities in section 3. Section 4 presents the results of the survey and finally section 5 discuss the results and draw the conclusions...|$|R

In the offline approach, transport and IMS elements (SGSN, GGSN, P, I and S-CSCF) report their charging information to Charging Data Function (CDF) and then CDF creates a call detail record (CDR) and sends it via an interface to the billing domain [33].|$|R

50|$|The gun fired fixed (HEAT M66) and semi-fixed ammunition, {{fitted with}} 75mm Cartridge Case M5A1 (type II) and (type I) accordingly.

40|$|We {{consider}} a {{framework in which}} several service providers offer downlink wireless data access service in a certain area. Each provider serves its end-users through opportunistic secondary spectrum access of licensed spectrum, and needs to pay primary license holders of the spectrum usage based and membership <b>based</b> <b>charges</b> for such secondary spectrum access. In these circumstances, if providers pool their resources and allow end-users to be served {{by any of the}} cooperating providers, the total user satisfaction as well as the aggregate revenue earned by providers may increase. We use coalitional game theory to investigate such cooperation among providers, and show that the optimal cooperation schemes can be obtained as solutions of convex optimizations. We next show that under usage <b>based</b> <b>charging</b> scheme, if all providers cooperate, there always exists an operating point that maximizes the aggregate revenue of providers, while presenting each provider a share of the revenue such that no subset of providers has an incentive to leave the coalition. Furthermore, such an operating point can be computed in polynomial time. Finally, we show that when the charging scheme involves membership <b>based</b> <b>charges,</b> the above result holds in important special cases...|$|R
