5|$|Southern {{business}} owners sought {{to reproduce the}} profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage, in which disproportionately <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt. Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared {{a large proportion of}} <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> in the South. These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South. Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly the same fashion. However, a person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{industrial}} unrest, trade unions for <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> were instituted in 1946, though they lacked power and influence. Workers at the UMHK continued to demand higher wages, and strikes were {{common in the}} colony for the next decade. Nevertheless, both wages and living conditions improved significantly {{in the years after}} the war. The war began a second wave of industrialisation that lasted right up to Congolese independence in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> {{did most}} of the post-hurricane cleanup work, and the few caskets {{available}} for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites. Additionally, the white victims received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in downtown West Palm Beach, which was the only mass gravesite to receive a timely memorial.|$|E

5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers during the war provoked strikes and riots from the workforce. Whites in the colony were allowed to form trade unions {{for the first time}} during the war, and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by <b>black</b> <b>workers.</b> In October 1941, white workers in the colony unsuccessfully attempted a general strike across the colony.|$|E
5|$|While {{critical}} of the strike, the public did not necessarily support the cause of equal employment opportunities for <b>black</b> <b>workers.</b> A public opinion poll conducted in Philadelphia during the strike showed that only a slim majority of the city's population felt that blacks should be hired as motormen and conductors, but that a significant majority opposed having a strike over this issue.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American workers gained greater acceptance in industry than previously, but discrimination remained a problem for many <b>black</b> <b>workers.</b> During the war, city officials passed the first municipal integration ordinance, allowing African Americans to eat at city-owned (but not private) lunch counters. In May 1944, when a black sailor in uniform was refused service at a privately owned lunch counter, the action prompted peaceful sit-in protests at several downtown diners. No changes in Jim Crow segregation policies at lunch counters resulted, but Saint Louis University admitted its first black students starting in August 1944.|$|E

5|$|Since {{even before}} the {{official}} entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941, Philadelphia had been one on the major industrial war production centers in the U.S. By 1944 Philadelphia was regarded as the second largest war production center in the country. During that period the black population of the city grew substantially, and tensions with the predominantly white population began to increase. The Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) ran the city's huge public transportation system, including subways, buses and trolleys; {{by the time of}} the strike, it carried over one million people per day. By 1944, the PTC's eleven thousand strong workforce included 537 black employees. However, the PTC's <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> had been restricted to holding menial jobs; none were allowed to serve as conductors or motormen – positions that were reserved for white employees. As early as August 1941, black employees started pressuring the PTC for fairer employment practices that would allow upgrading of <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> to the more prestigious jobs hitherto reserved for whites. Their efforts were rebuffed by PTC management, who claimed that the current union contract contained a clause prohibiting any significant change in employment practices and customs without the union's approval (although the contract said nothing about race). The leader of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Employees Union (PRTEU), Frank Carney, proved to be equally reticent and claimed that he was not authorized by the union members to consider a request to allow promotions of black employees.|$|E
5|$|British rule in Nyasaland radically {{altered the}} local {{indigenous}} power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most {{of the land}} acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work {{and the demand for}} labour created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced to rely on a system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata.|$|E
5|$|Mandela took Xuma's {{place on}} the ANC {{national}} executive in March 1950, and that same year was elected national president of the ANCYL. In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African, Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule. Mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not ANC-led, but a majority of <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> took part, resulting in increased police repression {{and the introduction of}} the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups. At the ANC national conference of December 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.|$|E

5|$|St. Louis {{suffered}} {{as much or}} more than comparable cities {{in the early years of}} the Great Depression. Manufacturing output fell by 57 percent between 1929 and 1933, slightly more than the national average of 55 percent, and output remained low until World War II. Unemployment during the Depression was high in most urban areas, and St. Louis was no exception (see table). <b>Black</b> <b>workers</b> in St. Louis, as in many cities, suffered significantly higher unemployment than their white counterparts. To aid the unemployed, the city allocated funds starting in 1930 toward relief operations. In addition to city relief aid, New Deal programs such as the Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement construction jobs also reduced the number of persons on direct relief aid by the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The host {{association}} between Myrmecia and eucharitid wasps began several million years ago; M. forficata larvae are the host to Austeucharis myrmeciae, {{being the first}} recorded eucharitid parasitoid of an ant, and Austeucharis fasciiventris is a parasitoid to M. gulosa pupae. M. pilosula is affected by a gregarines parasite that changes an ants colour from their typical black appearance to brown. This was discovered when brown workers were dissected and found to have gregarinasina spores, while <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> showed no spores. Another unidentified gregarine parasite is known to infect the larvae of M. pilosula and other Myrmecia species. This gregarine parasite also softens the ant's cuticle. Other parasites include Beauveria bassiana, Paecilomyces lilacinus, Chalcura affinis, Tricoryna wasps, and various mermithid nematodes.|$|E
5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} for black people to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E

5|$|Two calamities in {{the autumn}} of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to {{strengthening}} support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's accommodationism. First, President Teddy Roosevelt dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes {{as a result of the}} Brownsville Affair. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, riots broke out in Atlanta, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every black person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the Republican Party, because Republicans Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>Black</b> <b>workers</b> {{never had}} the {{opportunity}} to learn a skill, and most AFL unions did not organize unskilled workers.

25|$|The {{migration}} in turn created new demographic {{challenges in the}} North. White workers were competing against new labor; in some cases, the <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> were used as pawns {{in an effort to}} break unions. There were widespread efforts to recruit <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> and in reaction, efforts to thwart recruitment. Black migrants were restricted to specific neighborhoods in northern cities where the buildings were in poor condition and rents were high, forcing them to live in dense conditions.|$|E
25|$|King {{traveled}} to Memphis, Tennessee, {{in support of}} striking African American city sanitation workers. The workers had staged a walkout on February 11, 1968, to protest unequal wages and working conditions imposed by then-mayor Henry Loeb. At the time, Memphis paid <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> significantly lower wages than whites. Several sanitation workers had been killed on the job due to unsafe working conditions. In addition, unlike white workers, <b>black</b> <b>workers</b> received no pay if they stayed home during bad weather; consequently, most blacks were compelled to work even in driving rain and snowstorms.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment {{during the}} Depression was {{particularly}} significant in urban areas, and St. Louis {{was no exception}} (see table). <b>Black</b> <b>workers</b> suffered significantly higher unemployment, and they often were fired and replaced by white workers, especially after mandatory minimum wage laws took effect in the mid-1930s. In the meatpacking plants and steel mills, <b>Black</b> <b>workers</b> bore the brunt of labor force reductions; of 591 workers laid off in steel mills in 1931, 401 were Black. Many Blacks working in domestic service were paid only in room and board, while skilled Black craftsmen were unable to join local unions and were shut out of construction jobs. In other cases, minimum wages were not paid to <b>black</b> <b>workers,</b> who were blackmailed into averring that they were receiving the proper pay. In spite of the discrimination in the workplace, direct relief aid was provided equitably to Blacks in the city. After 1933, Blacks in the city voted overwhelming for the Democratic Party, a shift from their traditional support of the Republican Party.|$|E
