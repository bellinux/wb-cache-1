500|$|On March 7, 2011, it was {{reported}} that Universal would not proceed with At the Mountains of Madness because del Toro was unwilling to compromise on the $150 million budget and R rating. The director later reflected, [...] "When it happened, this has never happened to me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> cried that weekend a lot. I don't want to sound like a puny soul, but I really was devastated. I was weeping for the movie." [...] The project collapsed on a Friday, and del Toro signed to direct Pacific Rim the following Monday.|$|E
500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> think that {{for some of these}} shows you don't need to {{understand}} everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I am going to do this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a slightly positive review {{and gave it}} a B- rating. He wrote, [...] "The Office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior, but there’s a certain charm to it." [...] McNutt noted that, despite feeling that the episode's description of [...] "Darryl teaches Nellie how to eat a taco" [...] was a poor move on NBC's part, he thought they [...] "could have spent more time with Nellie learning how to eat a taco." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode, noting, [...] "For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that actually has a lot going on. Whether the stuff that’s happening is actually meaningful or significant in any way is up for debate, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> enjoyed most of this episode." ...|$|E

500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill Donohue, {{president}} of the Catholic League, in a critical review that appeared in 1996 wrote: [...] "If this sounds like nonsense, well, it is." [...] Though he admired Hitchens generally {{as a writer and}} [...] "provocateur", Donohue has said that Hitchens was [...] "totally overrated as a scholar ... sloppy in his research". Donohue released a book to coincide with Saint Teresa's canonization, entitled [...] "Unmasking Mother Teresa's Critics". In an interview, Donohue said, [...] "Unlike Hitchens, who wrote a 98-page book with no footnotes, no endnotes, no bibliography, no attribution at all, just 98 pages of unsupported opinion, I have a short book too. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> have more footnotes than I have pages in the book. That’s because I want people to check my sources." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} in Curve, O'Connor commented, [...] "I'm a dyke… although I haven’t been very open {{about that and}} throughout {{most of my life}} I've gone out with blokes because I haven't necessarily been terribly comfortable about being a big lesbian mule. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> am a dyke." [...] However, soon after in an {{interview in}} The Independent, she stated, [...] "I believe it was overcompensating of me to declare myself a lesbian. It was not a publicity stunt. I was trying to make someone else feel better. And have subsequently caused pain for myself. I am not in a box of any description." [...] In a magazine article and in a programme on RTÉ (Ryan Confidential, broadcast on RTÉ on 29 May 2003), she stated that while most of her sexual relationships had been with men, she has had three relationships with women.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{wanted to}} go away and hide behind a thicket and kick myself, <b>but</b> what <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> did was to give Pups part of my meat. I reproached myself for my {{injustice}} to him. How often had I been deceived in the surface appearance of people and things and dogs! Most of our judgments are wrong. We do not see clearly.|$|R
5000|$|Melinda Beasi, {{writing for}} Manga Bookshelf gave Aron's Absurd Armada a {{positive}} review. Beasi wrote, when reviewing the opening {{sections of the}} comic: [...] "This is a supremely silly comic, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>actually</b> mean that as a criticism. It's light and whimsical, and though I had to read it {{through a couple of}} times to really get the premise, I found it genuinely enjoyable." ...|$|R
60|$|Water deluged the boat, <b>but</b> missed me. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> smelled that fish, {{he was so}} close. What {{must surely}} have been terror for me, had <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> seen and {{realized}} the peril, gave place to flashing thought of the one and great chance for a wonderful picture of a big swordfish close to the boat. That gripped me. While I changed the focus on my camera I missed seeing the next two jumps. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> heard the heavy sousing splashes and the yells of Dan and R. C., with the shrill screams of the ladies.|$|R
2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it does sound shockingly bad though." ...|$|E

60|$|One of {{our friends}} used to tell an anecdote of the black servant of a visitor at Niagara, who could express his delight, on seeing the falls, in no other way than by peals of laughter; and perhaps I ought to {{hesitate}} to confess it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> imitated the Negro, as this glorious view broke suddenly upon me. Mine, however, was a laugh of triumph, for I instantly discovered that my feelings were not quite worn out, {{and that it was}} still possible to awaken enthusiasm within me, by the sight of an admirable nature.|$|E

5000|$|Baio {{remembered the}} film fondly:Great movie. Loved it then. Love it today. I get more people asking about that movie than anything, no lie. And I had a ball making that. A cute, fun teen movie, {{and it made}} money. And it had Scatman Crothers! He was a good guy, and {{supposedly}} he smoked pot every day. That’s what <b>I</b> was told, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>actually</b> know. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> got to work with Willie Aames, {{and it was a}} great experience ... Good people. Good crew. Good director.|$|R
60|$|Theodore did {{not seem}} in the least to resent having been locked in for two hours. I think {{he must have been}} asleep most of the time. Certainly I heard a good deal of {{shuffling}} when first I reached the landing outside the door; <b>but</b> when <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> walked into the apartment with an air of quiet unconcern Theodore was sprawling on the chair-bedstead, with eyes closed, a nose the colour of beetroot, and emitting sounds through his thin, cracked lips which I could not, Sir, describe graphically in your presence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thrice, Mr. John. The {{first time}} was thirty years ago; and I confess I lost him, on that occasion, by want of science; for the art is not learned in a day, and I had then {{followed}} the business but ten years. The second time was five years later: and I had then been fishing expressly for the old gentleman, about a month. For near a minute, {{it was a matter}} of dispute between us, whether he should come out of the lake or I go into it; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> got his gills in plain sight. That was a glorious haul! Washington did not feel better the night Cornwallis surrendered, than I felt on that great occasion!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{friend who}} had invited me to this {{spectacle}} felt its inadequacy so keenly, {{in spite of my}} protests, that he questioned the policemen for some very squalid or depraved purlieu that he might show me, for we were in the very heart of Whitechapel, but failing that, because the region had been so very much reformed and cleaned up since the dreadful murders there, he had no recourse but to take me on top of a tram-car and show me how very thoroughly it had been reformed and cleaned up. In a ride the whole length of Whitechapel Road to where the once iniquitous region ceased from troubling and rose in a most respectable resurrection as Stepney, with old-fashioned houses which looked happy, harmless homes, I could only be bidden imagine avenues of iniquity branching off on either hand. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> saw nothing slumlike; indeed, with a current of cool east wind in our faces, which the motion of the tram reinforced, the ride was an experience delightful to every sense. It was significant also of the endlessness of London that as far as the tram-car took us we seemed as far as ever from the bounds of the city; whatever point we reached there was still as much or more London beyond.|$|E
60|$|I {{examined}} the vessel, the berth I was to occupy, {{made a great}} many shy glances at the captain, to ascertain his character by that profound expedient, analyzing his looks, and finally determined to ship, on condition Neb should be taken as an ordinary seaman. As soon as Marble heard this last proposal, he explained the relation in which the black stood to me, and earnestly advised his being received as a seaman. The arrangement was made accordingly, and I went at once to the notary and signed the articles. Neb was also found, and he was shipped too; this time regularly, Mr. Hardinge attending and giving his sanction to what was done. The worthy divine was in excellent spirits, for that very day he had made an arrangement with a friend at the bar to place Rupert in his office, Mrs. Bradfort insisting on keeping her young kinsman in her house, as a regular inmate. This left on the father no more charge than to furnish Rupert with clothes, and a few dollars of pocket-money. But I knew Rupert too well to suppose he would, or could, be content with the little he might expect from the savings of Mr. Hardinge. I was not in want of money. My guardian had supplied me so amply, that not only had I paid my debt to {{the owners of the}} John, and fully equipped myself for the voyage, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> possessed dollars enough to supply all my probable wants during the expected absence. Many of the officers and men of the Crisis left behind them orders with their wives and families to receive their wages, in part, during their absence, as letters from time to time apprised the owners that these people were on board, and in discharge of their several duties. I determined on giving Rupert the benefit of such an arrangement. First presenting him with twenty dollars from my own little store, I took him with me to the counting-house, and succeeded, though not without some difficulty, in obtaining for my friend a credit of twenty dollars a-month, promising faithfully to repay any balance that might arise against me in consequence of the loss of the ship, or of any accident to myself. This I was enabled to do on the strength of my credit as the owner of Clawbonny; for, as is usual in these cases, I passed for being much richer than I really was, though far from being poor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} really had--a--a sitting," [...] said Theobald, {{speaking}} very slowly. [...] "I have taken notes, you know; I have got my grand fundamental impression. That's the great thing! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> have not <b>actually</b> had her as a model, posed and draped and lighted, before my easel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear that; but why did not {{you tell me that}} before? If I had known as much this morning I {{certainly}} would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; <b>but</b> as <b>I</b> have <b>actually</b> paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{all these}} circles I {{have heard the}} great and noble of the land freely spoken of and canvassed, and {{if there had been}} the least shadow of a {{foundation}} for any such accusations, I certainly should have heard it recognized in some manner. If in no other, such warm friends as I have heard speak would have alluded to the subject in the way of defence; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>actually</b> never heard any allusion of any sort, as if there was any thing to be explained or accounted for.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually, Debbie Reynolds {{took the}} role of Adelle. She had a {{contract}} with NBC to be an uncredited producer of a film, so she chose this, taking no salary. [...] "They put up $750,000 and hired Marty Ransohoff {{to be on the}} set, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> produced it," [...] said Reynolds.|$|E
5000|$|Laigh Raines of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode with 4/5 commenting on Thorpe's new appearance, [...] "sometimes {{he is really}} {{annoying}} <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> found him pretty funny this week. He's such {{a pain in the}} ass but his dumb humor is sometimes right on key. I can't believe Gil's dad was Jay's nemesis." ...|$|E
5000|$|Work on [...] "Desperado" [...] {{continued}} during Schultz and Monroe's {{stay in the}} house, {{where they}} were joined by Rihanna, James Fauntleroy and Derrus Rachel for the final result. For the developing process of the song, Schultz, who also produced it, commented, [...] "One thing led to another and she cut it <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> never really presented the record to her. Hey but if I did, I would’ve probably been like, ‘Hey, this is Rihanna. This is crazy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Of {{his youth}} {{growing up in}} a quiet rural area, he said that this allowed him to involve himself in the pursuit of music: <b>But</b> where <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> grew up was just {{completely}} removed from anything resembling a town or a city. It was an hour away from the nearest supermarket. What that granted me was a lot of isolation and when you are bored you tend to work really hard on your interests. I was granted a lot of opportunity to play the guitar, listen to music and read about music. So it probably would have been a different story if I grew up in a town somewhere.|$|R
5000|$|What really {{happened}} is that I used a setting like New Orleans, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> would <b>actually</b> be talking about thing from my own life. Certainly a song like [...] "Green River" [...] - which you may think would fit seamlessly into the Bayou vibe, but it's actually about the Green River, as I named it - it was actually called Putah Creek by Winters, California. It wasn't called Green River, but in my mind I always sort of called it Green River. All those little anecdotes are part of my childhood, {{those are things that}} happened to me <b>actually,</b> <b>I</b> just wrote about them and the audience shifted at the time and place.|$|R
2500|$|The {{beautiful}} grisette looked {{sometimes at}} the gloves, then sideways to the window, {{then at the}} gloves, and then at me. [...] I was not disposed to break silence. I followed her example: [...] so, I looked at the gloves, then to the window, then at the gloves, and then at her, and so on alternately. I found I lost considerably in every attack: she had a quick black eye, and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration, that she look'd into my very heart and reins. It may seem strange, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> could <b>actually</b> feel she did." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to his {{colleague}} Craig Boddington, a fellow writer on gun topics: [...] "Legend {{has it that}} {{he worked for the}} CIA. We never knew that for sure, but I know he was with the anti-castro movement and {{he spent a lot of}} time in Rhodesia during the long bush war. With Jack one never knew where fact, legend and myth intertwined - <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> saw his Congo Cross awarded to him by Moise Tshombe for his courage in that long forgotten insurgency." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ph.D. Kirill Pankratov {{commented on}} the theory of Satter and Putley in the Johnson's Russia List: [...] "these {{allegations}} are not new, and were kept afloat {{for a long time}} already, mostly by people close to Berezovsky and his money. I know it is very hard for people like David Satter and Jeremy Putley to understand, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> do believe there aren’t many people in Russia willing to purposefully kill hundreds of their own citizens for some political cause." [...] In the letter Pankratov provided four reasons against that theory.|$|E
5000|$|... "I was the {{one that}} {{actually}} devised it, Mike Claydon {{was the one}} who took the credit for it, <b>but</b> <b>i</b> was <b>actually</b> piddling around at the time as his junior. On the mixer at the time, we had compressors, Maurice was playing at piano at the time, just piddling around and I started feeding the piano into a series of these compressors and then screwed them up until he got his lovely metallic sort of sucking sound, and that was the birth of that sound, Maurice, assumed it was Michael, so he took the credits.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, English actress Lesley-Anne Down {{discussed}} {{her experiences}} {{of sexual harassment}} by Spiegel in the 1970s, recalling: [...] "I went up to his suite, and before I’d even said hello, he’d stuck his tongue in my mouth. He then shoved some perfume {{in my hand and}} invited me to come in. There {{was a little bit of}} being chased around the tables in the room, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> never <b>actually</b> did the deed. Nowadays, actresses are protected by an entourage, but back then, we weren’t. I can’t ever remember going for a meeting and not expecting something to occur." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} in parents’ name spelling {{is not a}} mistake. Originally, the family name was spelled with [...] "dz". Marek Niedźwiecki explains it: [...] "When my older sister was applying to University, {{it turned out that}} in some of her school reports the name was spelled Niedźwiedzka with <<dz>> and in some others - with <<c>>. For her to be accepted at University, it had to be unified. Apparently, it was easier and shorter to spell the name with <<c>>. So, in my birth certificate the name is spelled with <<dz>> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am <b>actually</b> Niedźwiecki with <<c>>." ...|$|R
