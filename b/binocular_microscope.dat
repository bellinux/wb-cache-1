25|$|The Ceramic Technology Laboratory was {{established}} in 1977 {{under the direction of}} Dr. Prudence Rice, then UF professor of Anthropology. Pottery analysis plays an integral role in archaeological research at the museum as it constitutes the predominant material remaining at most archaeological sites investigated by museum curators. In addition pottery constitutes a very significant proportion of the Anthropology collections. The Ceramic Technology Laboratory is equipped for basic paste characterization studies: <b>binocular</b> <b>microscope</b> for gross identification of temper or paste constituents; a petrographic microscope for precise mineral identification in thin section; an electric furnace used for refiring experiments and for comparative investigation of clay samples collected from the vicinity of archaeological sites. Analysis of physical and mineralogical properties of the pottery are undertaken to provide precise data to address research questions regarding chronology, provenience or manufacturing origins, processes of production, culture change, and the development of social and economic complexity in prehistoric Florida, the Southeastern US, and the Caribbean Basin. The department is committed to the continuance of this research program as the capacity for in-house specialized analysis of pottery enhances the competitiveness for research grants.|$|E
500|$|Many {{interesting}} characters {{served at}} the Mint {{during the early years}} of operation. One was John Leonard Riddell, who served as melter and refiner at the Mint from 1839 to 1848, and, outside of his job, pursued interests in botany, medicine, chemistry, geology, and physics. He invented the <b>binocular</b> <b>microscope.</b> He also wrote on numismatics, publishing in 1845 a book entitled Monograph of the Silver Dollar, Good and Bad, Illustrated With Facsimile Figures, and two years later an article by him appeared in DeBow's Review called [...] "The Mint at New Orleans—Processes Pursued of Working the Precious Metals—Statistics of Coinage, etc." [...] Riddell was not held in high esteem by everyone, however: his conflicts with other Mint employees were well-documented, and at one point he was accused of being unable to properly conduct a gold melt.|$|E

40|$|Microlaryngeal surgery evolved {{with the}} {{development}} of suspension laryngoscopy and <b>binocular</b> <b>microscopes</b> for enhanced visualization. Development of microla-ryngeal instrumentation followed rapidly {{to meet the demands of}} the otolaryngology–head and neck surgeon. Advancement of laser technology further enhanced the surgeon’s ability to sharply dissect tissue using a hands-off approach and added hemostatic capability to the cut-ting edge. Similarly, endoscopic sinus surgery has evolved with application of minimally invasive instru-mentation. The recent introduction of powered surgical instruments, combining cutting capability and suction, facilitates removal of diseased or anatomically variant tissue from sinus cavities. Powered surgical instrumentation applied to micro-laryngeal surgery and surgery of the airway, as demon-strated in this report, provides the head and neck sur-geon with a novel approach for surgery of the airway. Combining telescopic video control and powered instrumentation with suspension laryngoscopy provides superior visualization and access for rapid removal of obstructing lesions and controlled excision of vocal fold pathoses...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{fluorescence}} of tubercle bacilli {{stained with}} auramine and rhoda-mine {{does not require}} ultra-violet light. It {{can be caused by}} blue light up to 406 mp. A’copper sdphate ammonia liquid filter, suitably diluted, will transmit this wave-band. A gelatin screen filter, absorbing all light below 510 mp. is used in the eyepiece. Normal, high intensity projection Alament lamps, combined with lamp condensers of large aperture, provide suitable light sources. The numerical aperture of the microsoope condenser must be fully used by immersion in glycerol. The fluorescence is vellry bright with the usual biological, and certain <b>binocular,</b> <b>microscopes.</b> The simplicity of the equipment enables fluorescence microscopy of tubercle bacilli to be used at low cost in any laboratory. The phenomenon of fluorescence as applied to stained bacilli may be described as follows. Certain fluorochroms (e. g. auramine) absorb light of a certain wave-length, and convert it into light energy of another wave-length. This effect is observed by illuminating the specimen with suitable light passed through a filter which transmits a wave-band capable of causing fluorescence, and b...|$|R
