5|$|The {{material}} {{of the type}} species of Knoetschkesuchus, K. langenbergensis, comes from a marly limestone bed (numbered as Bed 83, not Bed 93 as reported by some publications) containing recrystallized micritic intraclasts, located within the Langenberg Quarry in the Harz Mountains near Goslar, Lower Saxony, Germany. These deposits have been dated to the Upper Kimmeridgian stage of the Jurassic - specifically, to the regional equivalent of the Upper Kimmeridgian known as the Mittleres Kimmeridge, and belong to the Süntel Formation. Although well-preserved, fossils from this quarry were recovered generally by regular <b>blasting</b> <b>operations</b> in the quarry.|$|E
5|$|The {{quarries}} and mines made {{increasing use of}} mechanization {{from the}} start of the 20th century, with electricity replacing steam and water as a power source. The Llechwedd Quarry introduced its first electrical plant in 1891, and in 1906, a hydro-electric plant was opened in Cwm Dyli, on the lower slopes of Snowdon, which supplied electricity to the largest quarries in the area. The use of electric saws and other machinery reduced the hard manual labour involved in extracting the slate, but produced much more slate dust than the old manual methods, leading to an increased incidence of silicosis. The work was also dangerous in other ways, with the <b>blasting</b> <b>operations</b> responsible for many deaths. A government enquiry in 1893 found that the death rate for underground workers in the slate mines was 3.23 per thousand, higher than the rate for coal miners.|$|E

50|$|In wheel blasting, a {{spinning}} wheel propels the abrasive against an object.

40|$|Blast {{fragmentation}} is {{a measure}} of efficiency in an open cast <b>blast</b> <b>operation.</b> Specific Charge (SC) plays an influential role on the fragmentation distribution, the quality of product and the production cost. Dynamic properties of rocks can be used for estimation of rock fragmentation and specific charge. Fragmentation analysis by digital image processing is a low cost and quick method. In this paper, the results of the seismic refraction technique are presented for Choghart Iron ore mine in central Iran. The P-wave velocity of the ore body has been measured at the site. The source of vibration generation was by hammering. The fragmentation resulting from blasting was monitored using a digital camera. Split Desktop software was used to quantify fragmentation size distribution. The mean fragmentation size of P 50 was obtained as representative of the average fragmentation size. SC of ANFO was calculated. The relationship between SC with P 50, Vp and Dynamic Elasticity Modulus (Edyn) were obtained. It was found that P 50 and SC are increased with increased Vp and Edyn.

40|$|Road {{aggregate}} is {{the largest}} component contributing to road construction. In Sri Lanka, naturally occurring sources that suits construction work are not available. Therefore, this requirement is most commonly fulfilled by excavating rocks and crushing them to suitable sizes. Demand for road aggregate has increased due to the current development of highway sector in Sri Lanka, {{and it is difficult}} to satisfy the requirement. In some areas of the country, especially in the Northern region, it is hard to fulfill these requirements due to several reasons such as archeological sites and environmental-sensitive forest areas. Therefore, quality control and fulfillment of the requirement with the available limited sources is a challenge. Considering the use of crushed rock for road construction, it is important to select materials in an acceptable quality. Especially when crushed rock is used for the road bases and surfacing, these properties play a vital role in ensuring durability. To ensure the quality, various tests have been introduced by relevant authorities. When selecting a source to produce crushed rock as road construction material, production from the selected source have to satisfy certain requirements. The los angeles abration value (LAAV) and aggregate impact value (AIV) is the two important tests which ensure the strength requirement of road aggregate. With the <b>blasting</b> <b>operation,</b> a considerable variation of rock fragmentation is noted. This is mainly due to the explosive quantity used for <b>blasting</b> <b>operation.</b> Types and features of explosives and blasting design also play an important role of rock mass fragmentation. In Sri Lanka, blasting design patterns and the explosives used do not vary considerably. But usage of explosives changes in continuous operation even the place is unchanged. These changes may be due to environmental conditions such as rainy seasons or due to some significant change of nature and properties of rock mass. The objective of this study was to identify the changes of AIV and LAAV with the use of explosive percentage used for the <b>blasting</b> <b>operation</b> and improve the strength of road aggregate by controlling the explosive usage for aggregate production. There was not found a relationship between explosive usage for blasting and the aggregate strength properties. But the significant relationship was found between the LAAV and AIV of the aggregate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn <b>blasting</b> <b>operation,</b> {{the aim is}} {{to achieve}} proper {{fragmentation}} and to avoid undesirable events such as backbreak. Therefore, predicting rock fragmentation and backbreak is very important to arrive at a technically and economically successful outcome. Since many parameters affect the blasting results in a complicated mechanism, employment of robust methods such as artificial neural network may be very useful. In this regard, this paper attends to simultaneous prediction of rock fragmentation and backbreak in the <b>blasting</b> <b>operation</b> of Tehran Cement Company limestone mines in Iran. Back propagation neural network (BPNN) and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) are adopted for the simulation. Also, regression analysis is performed between independent and dependent variables. For the BPNN modeling, a network with architecture 6 - 10 - 2 is found to be optimum whereas for the RBFNN, architecture 6 - 36 - 2 with spread factor of 0. 79 provides maximum prediction aptitude. Performance comparison of the developed models is fulfilled using value account for (VAF), root mean square error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R 2) and maximum relative error (MRE). As such, it is observed that the BPNN model is the most preferable model providing maximum accuracy and minimum error. Also, sensitivity analysis shows that inputs burden and stemming are the most effective parameters on the outputs fragmentation and backbreak, respectively. On the other hand, for both of the outputs, specific charge is the least effective parameter...|$|R
