5|$|At the 2006 U.S. Championships, the {{de facto}} Olympic qualifier, Lysacek was third after the short program, but pulled up to win the free skate, {{finishing}} second overall. He {{was named to the}} 2006 Winter Olympic team along with Johnny Weir and Matthew Savoie. At the Olympics, following a 10th-place finish in the short program, Lysacek became sick with the stomach flu. Unable to practice, he stayed in <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Olympic village, receiving fluids from IVs. After considering withdrawing, he decided to skate the next day and went on to skate a career-best free skate. He finished his free skate with eight triple jumps and was ranked third of the night. He finished fourth overall, seven points below the bronze. He commentated on his free-skating program on Olympic Ice the next day with Scott Hamilton and Mary Carillo.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single <b>bed.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E

He screams for the nurse, but she has already been bitten and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E

5|$|The two battalions of the 27th Infantry {{went into}} a {{perimeter}} defense {{just north of the}} village of Soi-ri. The 1st Battalion, on the left of the road, took a position with C Company on high ground in front, and with A Company on a ridge behind it. On their right, B Company was placed parallel to A Company, and carried the line across the stream and the narrow valley to the road. There the 2nd Battalion took up the defense line with E Company on the road and F Company on its right, while G Company held a ridge behind F Company. Thus, the two battalions presented a four-company front, with one company holding a refused flank position on either side. A platoon of tanks took positions on the front line, two tanks on the road and two in the stream bed, with four more tanks in reserve. The artillery went into firing positions behind the force. Six bazooka teams took up positions in front of the infantry positions along the road and in the stream <b>bed.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the ROK 1st Division remained in control of the high ground {{on either side of the}} 27th Infantry positions.|$|E

40|$|MM thesis - P&DMCharlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic (CMJA) Hospital has {{experienced}} a shortage of critical beds {{for a period of}} more than thirteen years without investigating the factors that are contributing to the shortage. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the underlying factors that contributed to the shortage of critical care <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> CMJA Hospital. The study also focused on the implications of the hospital strategic plan regarding the factors identified, and proposed interventions to resolve the shortage of critical care <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> CMJA hospital. The hospital’s strategic plan had measures in place to begin to address the shortage. Findings revealed that the main factor that contributed to the shortage of critical care <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hospital was the shortage of critical care nurses. The study recommended that the South African Nursing Council should develop a curriculum for lower categories of nurses to function in critical care areas...|$|R

25|$|On 17 January 1369, Peter I of Cyprus {{was assassinated}} by {{three of his}} own knights, in his own <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Palace of La Cava, Nicosia. He was succeeded by his son Peter II of Cyprus. However Hugh saw another {{opportunity}} to claim the throne of Cyprus and left the Peloponnese to travel to Nicosia, effectively abandoning his campaign. Marie continued the civil war until 1370. Unable to secure victory, Marie sold her rights to Philip II for 6,000 gold pieces. Her fiefdoms of Vostitsa and Nivelets were sold to Nerio I Acciaioli, later Duke of Athens. She only retained her fiefdom of Kalamata.|$|E
25|$|Eugene {{returned}} to Vienna from the War of the Polish Succession in October 1735, weak and feeble; when Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen married in February 1736 Eugene was {{too ill to}} attend.

When his servants arrived to wake him the next morning, 21 April 1736, they found Prince Eugene dead after choking from phlegm in his throat, presumably after suffering from pneumonia. Eugene's heart was buried with those of others of his family in Turin. His remains were carried in a long procession to St. Stephen's Cathedral, where the body was interred in the Kreuzkapelle.|$|E

25|$|Flashman surrenders to fear {{in front}} of {{witnesses}} only a few times, and is never caught out again. During the siege of Piper's Fort, in the first novel, Flashman cowers weeping in his <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the final assault; the only witness to this dies before relief comes. He breaks down while accompanying Rajah Brooke during a battle with pirates, but the noise drowns out his blubbering, and he recovers enough to command a storming party of sailors (placing himself {{right in the middle}} of the party, to avoid stray bullets). After the Charge of the Light Brigade, he flees in panic from the fighting in the batterybut mistakenly charges into an entire Russian regiment, adding to his heroic image.|$|E
25|$|The {{main feature}} of Lions Park {{is a series}} of long terraces, formed by boulder walls and garden beds that descend the steep slope falling from Canberra Terrace. A number of trees are planted {{throughout}} this area, including wind-stunted endemic Eucalypt species and Grevillea robusta. Along the Canberra Terrace boundary is a small car park with a garden <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> southern end. A sandstone block in this garden displays a plaque containing historical information about the lighthouses. To the east of the garden bed is a boulder set in a round concrete footing with a memorial plaque dedicated to World War II servicemen attached (erected 1991). With the exception of the memorial, none of the remainder of these elements is considered to be of state-level cultural heritage significance. It is the extent of the largely undeveloped site (part of the original lighthouse reserve) that is significant, rather than the elements that comprise the park.|$|E

25|$|Following the Tombstone shootout, Virgil Earp was maimed by hidden assailants and Morgan Earp was murdered. Unable {{to obtain}} {{justice in the}} courts, Wyatt Earp took matters into his own hands. As the {{recently}} appointed deputy U.S. marshal, Earp formally deputized Holliday, among others. As a federal posse, they pursued the outlaw Cowboys they believed were responsible. They found Frank Stilwell lying in wait as Virgil boarded a train for California and killed him. The local sheriff issued a warrant for the arrest of {{five members of the}} federal posse, including Holliday. The federal posse killed three other Cowboys during late March and early April, 1882, before they rode to the New Mexico Territory. Wyatt Earp learned of an extradition request for Holliday and arranged for Colorado Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin to deny Holliday's extradition. Holliday spent the few remaining years of his life in Colorado, and died of tuberculosis in his <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Glenwood Springs Hotel at age 36.|$|E
25|$|Detectives went to Simpson's Rockingham {{estate to}} inform {{him that his}} ex-wife had been murdered. In {{the back of his}} home, they found some blood {{scattered}} all over on a white Ford Bronco. Detective Mark Fuhrman climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances—specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to Chicago late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed Kato Kaelin, who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found under the <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Simpson.|$|E
