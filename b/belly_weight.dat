40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate the genetic parameters for pork belly traits and muscles in Yorkshire pigs. Each pork belly was cut into nine parts perpendicular to the thoracic vertebrae (6 th to 14 th). Traits of belly muscles including the deep pectoral, latissimus dorsi, cutaneous trunci, rectus abdominis, external and internal abdominal oblique from 382 purebred pigs were recorded and analyzed using SAS Package (9. 1) and Derivative-free restricted maximum likelihood methods. Heritability estimates for belly traits ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 49, while they were 0. 12 to 0. 66 for belly muscles. Moderate to high heritability estimates were noted in <b>belly</b> <b>weight</b> (0. 33), belly length (0. 28), and belly width (0. 49). In belly muscles, the latissimus dorsi and deep pectoral, which are located only in the 6 th to 9 th vertebrae sections, were found to have heritability estimates ranging from 0. 21 to 0. 29 and 0. 23 to 0. 35, respectively. Strong heritability estimates were observed in the 7 th to 13 th sections of cutaneous trunci muscle ranging from 0. 42 to 0. 66. Genetic correlations of latissimus dorsi m. with belly length were positive (0. 50), while cutaneous trunci m. with <b>belly</b> <b>weight</b> also revealed a positive relationship that ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 47. The estimated genetic parameters indicate that <b>belly</b> <b>weight</b> can be improved by genetic selection. Differences in the levels of heritability occurred among various parameters of Yorkshire pork belly, which should be considered when performing selection to improve pork belly quality. Moreover, these results can provide valuable information that can be used as the basis for further investigations to improve pork belly...|$|E
40|$|Pigs {{from four}} sire lines were {{allocated}} {{to a series}} of low energy (LE, 3. 15 to 3. 21 Mcal ME/kg) corn-soybean meal-based diets with 16 % wheat midds or high energy diets (HE, 3. 41 to 3. 45 Mcal ME/kg) with 4. 5 to 4. 95 % choice white grease. All diets contained 6 % DDGS. The HE and LE diets of each of the four phases were formulated to have equal lysine:Mcal ME ratios. Barrows (N = 2, 178) and gilts (N = 2, 274) were fed either high energy (HE) or low energy (LE) diets from 27 kg BW to target BWs of 118, 127, 131. 5 and 140. 6 kg. Carcass primal and subprimal cut weights were collected. The cut weights and carcass measurements were fitted to allometric functions (Y = A CWB) of carcass weight. The significance of diet, sex or sire line with A and B was evaluated by linearizing the equations by log to log transformation. The effect of diet on A and B did not interact with sex or sire line. Thus, the final model was B) where Diet = − 0. 5 for the LE and 0. 5 for HE diets and A and B are sire line-sex specific parameters. cut weight = (1 +bD(Diet)) A(CW Diet had no affect on loin, Boston butt, picnic, baby back rib, or sparerib weights (p> 0. 10, bD = − 0. 003, − 0. 0029, 0. 0002, 0. 0047, − 0. 0025, respectively).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Data on a pig line {{selected}} for litter size (H) and a control line (C) {{were used to}} estimate the correlated responses to litter size in carcass, meat, and fat quality traits. The differences between the genetic means of animals from line H and line C were used to estimate correlated responses. No {{differences were found between}} the two lines in carcass measurements except backfat depth, which was higher (P < 0. 05) in line H (0. 69 ± 0. 28 mm). This led to a decrease (P < 0. 05) in predicted carcass lean content (− 6. 0 ± 2. 7 g/ kg). Differences in joint weight distribution between lines were primarily due to <b>belly</b> <b>weight,</b> which was higher (P < 0. 05) in line H (6. 3 ± 1. 2 g/kg). There were no important changes in meat quality traits.

40|$|Forty six barrows {{were fed}} a common diet after {{completing}} a 35 d growth trial in which 50 % received 5 mg/d of pST {{and the other}} 50 % a placebo injection. At {{the conclusion of the}} growing trial (130 lb), the pST-injected pigs were leaner (22 %) and yielded carcasses with larger longissimus muscle area (21 %). However, pigs fed to a slaughter weight of 225 lb yielded carcasses that were not different from control pigs in length, longissimus muscle area, or <b>belly</b> <b>weights.</b> Pigs administered pST during the growing phase continued to have 10 % less backfat, which resulted in a 1. 6 % greater yield of lean cuts. Postinjection growth rate of pST-treated pigs was significantly reduced for the initial 2 wk to cause an overall reduced ADG during the finishing period. Days to reach slaughter did not differ with treatment because those pigs previously receiving pST were heavier initially. There is no advantage to injecting pigs with pST during the growing phase to improve overall growth. However, pST administration during the growing phase appears to have a sustained effect on carcass fat thickness of pigs slaughtered at 225 lb...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} {{ractopamine}} and immunological castration on belly characteristics, processing yield, physicochemical and sensory quality of bacon were investigated from two crossbred pigs under different conditions of animal production, diet, management and slaughter arranged in factorial design using 2 ractopamine levels (0 and 7. 5 ppm) and 3 genders (barrows, immunocastrated and gilts). Before processing, <b>belly</b> firmness, <b>weight,</b> length, {{width and thickness}} were measured, and then, bacon processing yield evaluated. After processing, bacon slices were digitally imaged and analyzed for lean meat and fat areas, pH, instrumental color of meat and fat, cooking loss and sensory quality. The ractopamine did not alter belly characteristics, but significantly increased the process yield and decreased cooking loss. Barrows and immunocastrated pigs showed firmer bellies, which could be advantageous for bacon processing and slicing. Barrows presented the highest total area of bacon slices. The {{results of this study}} indicate that both techniques ractopamine in the finishing diets and immunocastration of pigs can be combined with no further consequences for belly processing and to bacon quality and with some advantages...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for adopting a genetic solution to protect sheep from blowfly strike on the breech {{was investigated in}} a flock of sheep that contained several animals expressing a trait characterised by low wool coverage over the breech and through a wide channel from the anus to the udder or scrotum. A scoring system (1, bare to 5, woolly) was developed and {{used to determine the}} heritability of the trait and its phenotypic and genetic correlations with other traits of importance in a sheep enterprise. In comparison to animals with woolly breeches, the skin in the breech of animals with a low bareness score was characterised by a low density of follicles producing short, medullated fibres, with histological evidence of immune rejection and follicular atrophy. The bareness score of progeny was influenced by the score of their respective sires suggesting a strong genetic component. The heritability of bareness score was moderate to high (h 2 = 0. 45 ± 0. 02, 0. 53 ± 0. 01 and 0. 38 ± 0. 02 at lamb, hogget and adult ages, respectively). The lactation status and age of ewes influenced their bareness score, resulting in a low repeatability (0. 42) of the trait between ages in females. Genetic correlations between bareness score and most other economically important traits were low. The <b>weight</b> of <b>belly</b> wool and the weight of skirtings was genetically related to bareness score (rg = + 0. 52 and + 0. 48 respectively), indicating that animals with barer breeches tend genetically towards lighter <b>belly</b> wool <b>weights</b> and lower weight of skirtings at wool classing. Selection and breeding for bareness score should achieve relatively rapid progress towards fixing the trait in a flock and without adverse effects on other important traits. Caution should be exercised in extrapolating these results to other bloodlines and environments where genetic mechanisms or environmental influences may be different. N. M. Edwards, M. Hebart and P.

40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary crude protein (CP) reduction, supplementation with {{arginine}} or leucine on intramuscular fat (IMF) content was evaluated in (Landrace × Duroc) × Pietrain pigs. One-hundred and eight barrows (67 ± 4 kg) {{were assigned to}} six diets (n= 6 pens of 3 pigs each) : four normal CP diets containing 16 % CP from 60 to 90 kg and 13 % CP from 90 to 115 kg live weight (normal protein; normal protein high Arg, normal protein high Leu or normal protein high Arg and Leu) and two low CP diets containing 14 % CP from 60 to 90 kg and 11. 8 % CP from 90 to 115 kg live weight (with or without supplementation of both amino acids). The high Leu and Arg diets were supplemented to obtain ratios of standard ileal digestible Leu/Lys and Arg/Lys of 4 and 2, respectively. While feed to gain ratio tended to increase (p< 0. 05), final weight (p< 0. 01), average daily feed intake (ADFI) (p< 0. 05) and average daily gain (ADG) (p< 0. 01) were reduced in animals fed low-protein diets supplemented with Arg and Leu compared to the ones fed low-protein diet unsupplemented. Marbling and IMF content in loin were reduced when Arg was supplemented (p< 0. 05) in normal protein diets. Supplementing these diets with Arg also reduced <b>belly</b> <b>weight</b> (p< 0. 01) and increased lean meat percentage (p< 0. 05). Contrary to the initial hypothesis, reduction of CP or dietary supplementation with Leu {{had no effect on}} IMF content and supplementation with Arg reduced it...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryTerry A. HouserThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the impact of 0 and 20 % dried distillers grains with soluble (DDGS) and increasing levels of glycerol (0, 2. 5 and 5 %) in grow-finishing rations on bacon quality and to determine the relationship between belly firmness and slicing yield for commercially produced bacon. A total of 84 barrows (PIC, initially 31. 03 kg) were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets organized in a 2 x 3 factorial with primary effects of DDGS (0 or 20 %) and glycerol (0, 2. 5, or 5 %) as fed. Belly length was measured from flank end to blade end. Belly thickness was measured at eight locations evenly spaced {{around the perimeter of the}} belly. Belly firmness was measured by centering bellies perpendicularly (skin side up and skin side down) over a stainless steel smokestick and measuring the flex between the edges on the ventral and dorsal edges of the belly. Bellies were injected at 12 % of the skinned <b>belly</b> <b>weight</b> resulting in a final concentration of 1. 74 % salt, 0. 5 % sugar, 0. 3 % sodium phosphate, 120 ppm sodium nitrite, and 500 ppm sodium erythorbate in the bellies. Bellies were cooked to an internal temperature of 53 oC, chilled, pressed and sliced for evaluation. Belly slice yield was calculated by determining the yield of # 1 type bacon slices. Proximate analysis and fatty acid analysis were evaluated by taking every 10 th bacon slice beginning from the caudal end to make a composite sample for each belly. Iodine value was calculated using the resulting fatty acid content results. Twenty bacon slices were removed from the belly one-third the length of the belly from the cranial end for sensory analysis and cooking yields. Sensory characteristics were evaluated on an 8 -point scale for brittleness, bacon flavor intensity, saltiness and off-flavor. There were no significant DDGS x glycerol interactions on any parameters measured (P > 0. 08). Inclusion of 20 % DDGS in pig diets decreased belly firmness (P < 0. 04) as measured by the belly flop fat side down method. Twenty percent DDGS decreased the percentage of myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, vaccenic acid, total saturated fatty acids, and total monounsaturated fatty acids (P < 0. 01). In contrast, 20 % DDGS increased the percentage of linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, eicosadienoic acid, total polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased unsaturated: saturated fatty acid ratios, polyunsaturated: saturated fatty acid ratios, and iodine values (P < 0. 01). Statistical correlation analysis of belly processing characteristics showed that by increasing <b>belly</b> <b>weight</b> there will be an increase in smokehouse yields (R = 0. 81), increasing smokehouse yields will increase slice yield (R = 0. 71), increasing belly thickness results in firmer bellies (R = 0. 94) and increasing belly firmness will increase slice yields (R = 0. 60). Fatty acid content did not correlate with any belly processing characteristic (R < 0. 50). Iodine values were highly correlated with Total MUFA (R = 0. 83) Total PUFA (R = 0. 79), Total TFA (R = 0. 75), and UFA: SFA ratio, and PUFA: SFA ratios (R = 0. 83). The inclusion of 0, 2. 5 and 5 % glycerol in swine diets did not affect any measured parameters in this study. In conclusion, feeding DDGS at a level of 20 % decreased belly firmness and changed the fatty acid profile; however, it did not affect belly processing or sensory characteristics. Glycerol fed at 2. 5 or 5. 0 % did not affect belly quality, fatty acid profile, or sensory characteristics of bacon...|$|E

Pigs were randomly assigned to pens based on gender (14 barrow pens, 11 gilt pens, and 23 mixed-gender pens), with 25 to 28 pigs per pen. Previously, pens of pigs were assigned to treatments containing 0, 7. 5, or 15 % bakery by-product in a completely randomized design while balancing for initial BW and gender. On d 75, treatments were implemented {{to determine the effects of}} adding 50 ppm Zn from ZnO on finishing pig performance. A total of 1, 234 pigs (PIC 337 × 1050; average BW 224. 6 lb) were used in a 28 -d study. Pens of pigs were randomly assigned to diets with and without 50 ppm added Zn from zinc oxide (ZnO) and balanced by BW, bakery by-product, and gender. All diets contained 5 ppm RAC and 83 ppm Zn from ZnO provided by the trace mineral premix. There were 24 pens per treatment. Overall (d 75 to 102), no differences (P > 0. 22) in growth performance or carcass characteristics were observed when pigs were fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn compared with the RAC control. For pigs subsampled on d 84, pigs fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn had decreased (P < 0. 05) edge belly thickness compared with pigs fed the control. For pigs subsampled on d 102, pigs fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn had decreased (P < 0. 02) backfat thickness, <b>belly</b> <b>weight,</b> and edge belly thickness; a tendency for decreased (P < 0. 07) middle belly thickness; and increased (P < 0. 01) percentage lean compared with pigs fed the RAC control. In contrast with our previous research, these data indicate that adding 50 ppm Zn from ZnO to finishing pig diets containing RAC did not improve overall performance. Consistent with the earlier research, income over feed cost (IOFC) was numerically increased with the addition of Zn...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate performance and biometrics of lambs fed different sources of forage. Twenty-four six-month-old Santa Inês female lambs were randomly allocated to four experimental diets and housed in individual stalls. They weighed on average 26. 35 ± 0. 20 kg. The diets were coast cross hay (HAY), cassava hay (CAS), dehydrated by-product of pea crop (PEA) and saccharin (SAC). The diets were formulated with the same amount of protein and energy with fixed levels of forage (60 %) and concentrate (40 %). Adaptation to the diet took 7 days, with 45 days on experiment. Weights and biometric measurements were obtained every fortnight and feed intake three times a week. Rights half-carcasses were weighed and sectioned into retail cuts, rib, loin, shoulder, belly, neck and leg, which were weighed individually. Weight gain in lambs was significantly different between diets, with those fed saccharin gaining more. Overall, treatments did not significantly affect biometric measurements. There was a significant difference for feed intake and live weight at the end of the experiment. Animals fed PEA and SAC showed the best results. Average positive correlations were found between biometric measurements and live weight. Treatment PEA had heavier hot (14. 36 kg) and cold (14. 01 kg) carcass weights than the other groups. Hot carcass kill-out was higher for animals fed PEA as well as ham <b>weight,</b> <b>belly,</b> neck and heart girth.
