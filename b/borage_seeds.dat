40|$|Borage (Borago officinalis L., Boraginaceae) is an {{herbaceous}} annual (Janick et al. 1989). Current in-terest in this crop is for its seed {{which contains}} {{a high percentage}} of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) (all- cis 6, 9, 12 -octadecatrienoic acid) in the oil. GLA is a precursor of the prostaglandin PGE 1 in the human body (Willis 1981) which is vital in many body functions, such as antithrombotic inhibitory effects on aggregation of platelets, lowering blood pressure, and inhibiting cholesterol formation (Belisle 1990). Potential medical uses of GLA include treating atopic eczema to decrease disease symptoms (Wright and Burton 1982) and reducing side effects of diabetes, such as vascular damage, altered platelet function, and arteriosclerosis (Kies 1989). Commercial seed sources of GLA include evening primrose and some Ribes species. Oil content of <b>borage</b> <b>seeds</b> averages between 300 and 380 g kg- 1 of which 20 % to 23 % is GLA. Oil and GLA content are higher in borage seed compared to those from evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) and Ribes spp. (Kleiman et al. 1964; Wolf et al. 1983). Main producers of borage seed are Canada, England, New Zealand (Nicholls 1996), The Netherlands, and the United States. US borage production was highest in North Dakota in 1999.

However, dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid (DGLA), a precursor of AA, suppresses LT generation by competing with AA for substrate utilization by 5 -LO. <b>Borage</b> (Borago officinalis) <b>seed</b> oil {{is a rich}} source of gamma linolenic acid (GLA), which is the precursor of DGLA (Figure  1). Dietary supplementation with <b>Borage</b> <b>seed</b> oil provides effective inhibition of leukotriene generation as demonstrated by significant attenuation of LT biosynthesis from circulating granulocytes in vitro in cell culture and ex vivo (Henz et al. 1999; Johnson et al. 1997; Ziboh and Fletcher 1992). However, hepatic metabolism of GLA to AA by ∆- 5 desaturase increases circulating free AA levels, which has the potential of neutralizing DGLA’s potential as a leukotriene synthesis modifier (Ferretti et al. 1997; Johnson et al. 1997; Kelley et al. 1997; Seyberth et al. 1975). Supplementation of diet with long chain omega- 3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) found in fish oils have been shown to compete with DGLA at the ∆- 5 desaturase step preventing elevations in AA as a result of providing GLA in borage oil (Barham et al. 2000; Surette et al. 2008). In the current study, the botanical omega- 3 PUFA, stearidonic acid (SDA) from the seed oil of echium (Echium plantagineum) was utilized because it bypasses the rate-limiting ∆- 6 desaturase in long chain, omega- 3 PUFA biosynthesis and thus is efficiently converted to EPA.|$|R

40|$|Background: Over {{the past}} 30 years {{substantial}} {{progress has been}} made in the medical and surgical management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite this progress, there is an increasing gap in mortality between patients with RA (1. 5 - 3. 0 fold risk) and the general population. This disparity is mainly attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the CVD risk is comparable in RA patients as to patients with diabetes mellitus. Although the reasons for this gap are not entirely clear, the traditional risk of abnormalities in lipid profiles appears to be enhanced by a chronic increase in inflammatory cytokines, resulting in accelerated atherosclerosis. Study Objective: The object of this study was to determine the effect of marine (fish oil) and botanical oils (borage oil) on lipids (TC, HDL, LDL, TG), a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with RA. The main outcome (to be presented elsewhere) was to determine whether a combination of <b>borage</b> <b>seed</b> oil rich in gammalinolenic acid (GLA) and fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is superior to either oil alone for the treatment of RA. Population and Setting: The study was an 18 month randomized, double-masked comparison of <b>borage</b> <b>seed</b> oil, fish oil, and the combination of both oils in RA patients with active synovitis. Intervention: Patients received 3. 5 gm omega- 3 fatty acids daily in a 2. 1 gm EPA/ 1. 4 gm DHA ratio (7 fish oil and 6 sunflower oil capsules daily); or 1. 8 gm /d GLA (6 borage oil and 7 sunflower oil capsules /d); or 7 fish oil and 6 borage oil capsules daily (combination therapy). Discussion: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease. Mediators of inflammation and prothrombotic factors contribute to endothelial dysfunction and development of cardiovascular disease in RA patients. Marine and botanical oils represent an excellent primary or secondary therapy for improvement of the cardiovascular risk management in RA. Patients taking these oils exhibit significant additional reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, the TC/HDL ratio, and in the atherogenic index, and experience a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol. All of these improvements in the lipid profile were seen after 9 months of therapy, and increased after 18 months of oils administration. The overall dropout rate was 51 %, and was similar across groups: 25 in the borage oil group, 28 in the fish oil group, and 22 in the combination group. Reasons for dropout were mainly gastrointestinal distress (belching, bloating, diarrhea, nausea, cramping), or an inability to swallow the large number of rather sizable capsules. This can be ameliorated by freezing the capsules and reducing their size. Among those evaluated for this study, compliance was 100 %, assessed by pill counts. Learning Outcome: All treatments were safe, thus treatment of RA patients with one or a combination of these or similar oils should prove useful for reduction of cardiovascular risk in RA patients...|$|R

Each group exhibited significant reductions in disease activity (DAS 28) at 9 months (fish: - 1. 56 [- 2. 16, - 0. 96], borage: - 1. 33 [- 1. 83, - 0. 84], combined: - 1. 18 [- 1. 83, - 0. 54]) and in CDAI (fish: - 16. 95 [- 19. 91, - 13. 98], borage: - 11. 20 [- 14. 21, - 8. 19], and combined: - 10. 31 [- 13. 61, - 7. 01]). There {{were no significant differences}} in change of RA medications among the three groups. Reduced disease activity in study patients was similar to matched patients from an RA registry, and reduction in DMARD use was greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 03) in study patients. Conclusion. All 3 treatment groups exhibited similar meaningful clinical responses after 9 months, improvements which persisted for 18 months, and a response similar to matched patients from an RA registry. Study patients were able to reduce DMARD therapy given in combination with TNF antagonists to a greater extent than registry patients. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Dr. John T. Sharp, M.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} intercropping of soybean (Glycine max L. cv. JK) with sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) and borage (Borago officinalis L.) with weed interference, an experiment {{was performed in}} randomized complete block design with 12 treatments and three replications at a field located 10 km of Shirvan during year of 2011. The treatments were included 75 % soybean: 25 %sweet basil, 50 %soybean: 50 % sweet basil, 25 % soybean: 75 % sweet basil, 75 % soybean: 25 % borage, 50 % soybean: 50 % borage and 25 % soybean: 75 % borage under weed infestation, in addition sole cropping of plants under weed control and weed interference. Intercropped plants had more success in reduction of weed density and biomass compared to monoculture. Soybean 50 : sweet basil 50, reduced the weed density by 47. 95 % and 52. 9 %, and reduced the weed biomass by 68. 91 % and 61. 87 % more than sweet basil and soybean pure stand, respectively. Investigation of dry matter accumulation showed that increasing of plant proportion in intercropping caused increasing of plant dry matter. The height of soybean and borage was increased in intercropping and weed interference, while the highest height of sweet basil was observed in monoculture at second harvest. Biological and economical yield of soybean in intercropping with sweet basil was higher than intercropping with borage. The highest harvest index was related to 50 : 50 soybean: sweet basil ratio. In this ratio, the harvest index increased 4. 9 % compared to soybean monoculture. Yield of sweet basil and borage decreased with increasing of soybean rows in intercropping. Based on area-time equivalent ratio, soybean 75 % with sweet basil and borage 25 % (based on <b>borage</b> <b>seed</b> yield) had 3 % and 4 % advantage compared to monoculture...|$|R
30|$|In summary, we {{conclude}} that as compared to corn oil, a combination of <b>borage</b> and echium <b>seed</b> oils containing 1.7 g/day of γ-linolenic acid and 0.8 g/day of stearidonic acid improves airflow obstruction in mild to moderate asthmatics who carry the variant allele in the LTC 4 synthase gene promoter (A- 444 C). Our findings suggest that botanical oil supplementation can have therapeutic potential in asthma if used in a personalized manner. Further studies examining the effects of botanical oil combinations in asthma are warranted.|$|R
