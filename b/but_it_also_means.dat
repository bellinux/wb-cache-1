25|$|As established, these {{measurements}} are taken daily from the milk bulk tank {{and not from}} individual cows. This is because testing of individual animals at each milking would be expensive, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that milk from a sick cow is diluted and averaged down by the healthy animals. Greater bulk tanks at very great commercial farms are accommodating of more sick animals in the herd, without the sick animals affecting the overall milk quality rating.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of plant-pollinator networks may have large {{consequences for the}} way in which pollinator communities respond to increasingly harsh conditions. Mathematical models, examining the consequences of this network structure for the stability of pollinator communities suggest that the specific way in which plant-pollinator networks are organized minimizes competition between pollinators and may even lead to strong indirect facilitation between pollinators when conditions are harsh. This means that pollinator species together can survive under harsh conditions. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that pollinator species collapse simultaneously when conditions pass a critical point. This simultaneous collapse occurs, because pollinator species depend on each other when surviving under difficult conditions.|$|E
25|$|Murphy concludes that,"Just as the Son of God limited {{himself by}} taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine {{action in the}} world to be in accord with {{rational}} laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E

25|$|Fluoxetine is a {{racemic mixture}} of (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where both enantiomers {{contribute}} to its biological activity. Since mono-substitution in the 4-para {{position of the}} phenoxy group (figure 4) results in selective inhibition of 5-HT re-uptake, a disubstitution i.e. 2,3- or 2,4- substitution therefore results {{in a loss of}} SERT selectivity. Fluoxetine has the widest spectrum of activity since it is the least SERT selective of all the SSRIs. Fluoxetine also has a 5-HT2C antagonist activity where it blocks the 5-HT activity of 5-HT2C receptors enhancing the release of both NE and DA. A 5-HT2C antagonist do not only help out with therapeutic effects of fluoxetine but also the tolerability of the drug. The advantage of being 5-HT2C antagonist is that it has a stimulatory effect and many patients have experienced an increase in energy, concentration and focus and a decrease in fatigue from the very first dose. The stimulant activity of 5-HT2C antagonist can however, be a disadvantage for patients with agitation, insomnia and anxiety. Another feature of fluoxetine is a weak NE re-uptake inhibition which can have clinical effect in higher doses. Fluoxetine also has a long half-life which can reduce withdrawal symptoms which are characteristic for some SSRIs after abrupt discontinuation, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that {{it takes a long time}} to clear the drug and its active metabolite after discontinuing fluoxetine treatment.|$|E

Scannavini also noted that Lopez was [...] "involved in {{every step of the}} perfume's development". In a press release issued to announce Still Jennifer Lopez, Lopez made the following statement: [...] "It means no matter what happens, I am 'still' myself.

500|$|Meanwhile, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) {{wants to}} help a grocery-store worker, Guillermo (Lin-Manuel Miranda), so she convinces Jay (Ed O'Neill) to let Guillermo pitch him a {{business}} idea: a dog-training system labeled [...] "The Good-doggy / Bad-doggy Training System", which consists of two sets of dog treats, one of them being bland {{and the other a}} tastier one with bacon. The pitch goes wrong when Guillermo's dog, Stella (Brigitte), chews on Jay's pillow and seems to prefer the bad doggy treat. Seeing that Gloria's blind encouragement is doing him no favours, Jay adopts a firm, frank tone with Guillermo and tells him that, while he has obvious skill, enthusiasm and charisma, his idea is not good. Guillermo, who had invested five years of his life in this idea, leaves in tears. Gloria follows him to apologize, but Guillermo admits that he found Jay's honesty refreshing, and has decided to reorganize his life, which means moving back in with his sister to go back to school, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that he must give the dog away. Gloria allows the dog to stay with them much to Jay's anger, which is increased when Manny walks in and believes the dog is a present for him. Jay drives the dog to the pound but Stella's sweet face makes him take her back home.|$|E

According to Rupert Gethin, the four truths are [...] "four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood {{on the night of}} his awakening." [...] They function as [...] "a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought." [...] According to K.R. Norman, probably the best translation is [...] "the truth of the noble one (the Buddha)." [...] It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing, Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for me to leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E

Thus it is, that at Greenwich, in England, where there is an {{observatory}} made for nautical purposes, the sun rises about five hours sooner than it does here. All this difference is subject to rules, and we know exactly how to measure it." ...|$|E
