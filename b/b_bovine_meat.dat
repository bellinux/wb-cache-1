40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate food choices of blowflies that have forensic importance and that feed on cadavers and to determine whether they prefer fresh or processed <b>meat.</b> <b>Bovine</b> <b>meat</b> 100 g and cat food 100 g were placed on traps which were put in cages hanged on the campus of Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine. The larvae developed in the <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> and in cat food were killed in boiling water.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAndrew P. BarkleyThe {{impact of}} {{agricultural}} trade liberalization on welfare {{is a major}} concern to the Government of Morocco. Several agricultural sectors and sub-sectors that are suffering from severe inefficiencies have been protected by the Government mainly through prohibitive import tariffs as a mean to support the income of domestic producers. Although the rhetoric in Morocco is of trade liberalization, the farm sector, with few exceptions, has largely escaped the general tendency. 		The livestock sector in general and the <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> production in particular figure among the most protected goods in the country. <b>Bovine</b> <b>meat</b> imports are imposed a prohibitive tariff rate of 254 percent. In addition, several technical barriers to trade exist in the form of rigid sanitary regulations. 		It is strategically important for Morocco's trade partners and those that are planning to negotiate different forms of trade agreements to understand the economic argument behind Moroccan protectionist policy in agriculture. The <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> market in Morocco is of high interest to major exporters given the growing size in domestic and tourist populations, the high domestic prices, as well as the increase in consumer awareness. Given its good sanitary status, Australia is a strong candidate for negotiating an agreement that will include <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> within a general agricultural package. 		The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate economic evidence and determine whether or not opening up trade of <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> will have a net positive impact on welfare. Such evidence can become a strong argument in the hands of trade negotiators for major exporting nations such as Australia. 	This study uses data from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the Ministry of Agriculture of Morocco and Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) to construct a partial equilibrium model for the <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> market. The model simulates different trade policies: closed market, free trade, quota and TRQ. Using the theory of comparative advantage and the concepts of consumer and producer surpluses, gains and losses are assessed and the net impact on welfare is evaluated. 	The empirical analysis suggests that total free trade in the <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> market results in the highest gain in social welfare when compared to protectionism (USD 246. 62 million), followed by the TRQ (USD 206. 11 million) and quota policy (USD 4. 92 million). As hypothesized, the protectionist policy results in large losses in consumers' surplus. The results of the analysis converge with the economic theory and are compelling evidence for the benefits brought by openness in the <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> trade...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that dry-aged buffalo (B. bubalis) meat becomes dark faster than <b>bovine</b> (<b>B.</b> taurus) <b>meat,</b> discouraging consumer purchase. We have investigated whether this faster darkening process might depend on structural and/or kinetic differences between buffalo and bovine myoglobins (Mbs). To this end, we have purified to homogeneity buffalo Mb from Longissimus dorsi muscle and obtained both its Mr (17, 034. 5) and the complete amino acid sequence, which, {{compared with the}} bovine one, showed three amino acid substitutions: Dbo 141 Ebu, Abo 19 Tbu and Abo 117 Dbu. As revealed by the 3 D structure, they were located {{on the surface of}} the protein, far from the heme binding pocket, and did not cause appreciable structural changes. Autoxidation rates of purified buffalo and bovine myoglobins at 37 °C, pH 7. 2, were almost identical (0. 052 ± 0. 001 h− 1 and 0. 054 ± 0. 002 h− 1, respectively), as were their oxygen-binding Kd values (3. 7 ± 0. 1 μM and 3. 5 ± 0. 1 μM, respectively). These data indicate that the structure of the heme pockets in the two proteins is similar, with similar functional properties. Moreover, the percent of MetMb values in the purified buffalo and bovine samples, after the same time from slaughtering, were almost identical (57 % and 47 %, respectively). The results presented here suggest that the faster darkening of buffalo meat depends on factors other than the oxidation rate of its Mb, as, for example, the Mb content (0. 393 ± 0. 005 g/ 100 g) and consequently its MetMb content, which is almost twice as high as <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> (0. 209 ± 0. 003 g/ 100 g), and likely other factors...|$|R

It states that “the beef production chain in the RSA, as a developing country, {{has not been able}} to keep pace with the changes of EU legislation for food safety and quality for fresh bovine meat”. A literature search is done and informal discussions have taken place with stakeholders to identify issues that potentially could cause EU market access constraints for fresh <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> from the RSA. Ten experts in the RSA are identified and have joined the expert opinion survey, in which the experts have scored the issues. Thirteen issues are identified that potentially could cause market access constraints for fresh <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> from the RSA to the EU. The thirteen issues are scored by the experts. The three issues with the highest score in causing EU market access constraints for fresh <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> from the RSA are: 1 the use of growth hormones in fresh <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> of the RSA and/or control of veterinary drugs that are prohibited in the EU; 2 the traceability and registration throughout the beef production chain; and 3 the definite political agenda by the EU to prevent competition from producers in the RSA. The legislation of the RSA does not prohibit the use of growth hormones nor require implementation of a traceability system in the beef supply chain. The investigator concludes that especially the implementation of an adequate traceability system will significantly contribute to more competitiveness and food safety in the beef production chain, despite the different circumstances (sanitary, economic and structural) that exists in the RSA comparing it with the EU. In addition, a large informal market exists in the RSA. These communal areas contain large untapped areas and need further development in order to enter the commercial market. This will add to global competitiveness and food safety.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Cooking may impair meat protein digestibility. When undigested {{proteins}} are fermented by the colonmicrobiota, {{they can}} generate compounds that potentially are {{harmful to the}} mucosa. Objectives: This study addressed the effects of typical cooking processes {{and the amount of}} <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> intake on thequantity of undigested proteins entering the colon, as well as their effects on the intestinal mucosa. Methods: Male Wistar rats (n = 88) aged 8 wk were fed 11 different diets containing protein as 20 % of energy. In 10 diets,bovine meat proteins represented 5 % [low-meat diet (LMD) ] or 15 % [high-meat diet (HMD) ] of energy, with the rest astotal milk proteins. Meat was raw or cooked according to 4 processes (boiled, barbecued, grilled, or roasted). A meat-freediet contained only milk proteins. After 3 wk, rats ingested a 15 N-labeled meat meal and were killed 6 h later after receivinga 13 C-valine injection. Meat protein digestibility was determined from 15 N enrichments in intestinal contents. Cecal shortandbranched-chain fatty acids and hydrogen sulfide were measured. Intestinal tissues were used for the assessment ofprotein synthesis rates, inflammation, and histopathology. Results:Meat protein digestibility was lower in rats fed boiled meat (94. 5 % 6 0. 281 %) than in the other 4 groups (97. 5 % 60. 0581 %, P HMD) and on myeloperoxidase activity in the proximal colon (HMD > LMD), but not on other outcomes.

The overall positive rate for Sarcocystis spp. in our samples has been 91 % (40 / 44), with S. cruzi representing the species with higher rates (68 %), followed by S. hominis (43 %) and S. hirsuta (2 %). Based on the results of specificity and applicability tests performed in this study, the newly developed protocol proved to be reliable and suitable for epidemiologic purposes...|$|R
50|$|Feline spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (FSE) is a prion disease {{thought to be}} related or identical to Bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE).This disease is known to affect domestic and captive feline species. Lezmi S. et al. (2003), suggested that this infectious agent might be spread by both haematogenous and nervous pathways. Like BSE, this disease can take several years to develop. It is probable, but not proven, that the affected animals contract the disease by eating contaminated <b>bovine</b> <b>meat.</b>|$|R

5000|$|As of 2014, the {{municipality}} of Itajaí conducted 1.61% of [...] Brazil's total export trade with $3.91B (USD) worth of goods. This figure places Itajaí as the 8th highest exporter in Brazil. [...] Of this, 86% or $3.35B (USD) {{was made up}} by the trade of animal products. The top five material goods exported by Itajaí for that year were poultry meat (52%), pork (21%), other prepared meat (9.6%), preserved meat (7.3%), and frozen <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> (2.2%).|$|R
2500|$|Seven {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} occurred under GATT. The first real GATT trade rounds concentrated on further reducing tariffs. Then, the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties {{brought about a}} GATT anti-dumping Agreement and a section on development. The Tokyo Round during the seventies {{was the first major}} attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs, and to improve the system, adopting a series of agreements on non-tariff barriers, which in some cases interpreted existing GATT rules, and in others broke entirely new ground. Because these plurilateral agreements were not accepted by the full GATT membership, they were often informally called [...] "codes". Several of these codes were amended in the Uruguay Round, and turned into multilateral commitments accepted by all WTO members. Only four remained plurilateral (those on government procurement, <b>bovine</b> <b>meat,</b> civil aircraft and dairy products), but in 1997 WTO members agreed to terminate the <b>bovine</b> <b>meat</b> and dairy agreements, leaving only two. Despite attempts in the mid-1950s and 1960s to create some form of institutional mechanism for international trade, the GATT continued to operate for almost half a century as a semi-institutionalized multilateral treaty regime on a provisional basis.|$|R
