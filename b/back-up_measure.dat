40|$|The {{building}} industry is involved directly and considerably {{in the new}} production of the cultural real estate and in the restoration and the unkeep of the one already built-up. Neither the historic buildings, nor the cultural ones, nor the artistic ones, have ever been quantified, even though one estimates {{that there are more}} than 40 % of the domestic buildings liable to be preserved. Besides, not only the cultural heritage, that is the real estate and the personal estate, could be preserved and so legally bound, but also the landscape and the environment. Due to its strategic importance in relation to the country development, the industrial system, which satisfies the need of preserving (and increasing) the enormous artistic real estate, requires a specific industrial policy and <b>back-up</b> <b>measures.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Following a {{nuisance}} raid by Japanese flying boats in May, Nimitz dispatched a minesweeper {{to guard the}} intended refueling point for Operation K near French Frigate Shoals, causing the reconnaissance mission to be aborted and leaving Yamamoto ignorant of whether Pacific Fleet carriers were still at Pearl Harbor. It remains unclear why Yamamoto permitted the earlier attack, and why his submarines did not sortie sooner, as reconnaissance was essential to success at Midway. Nimitz also dispatched his carriers toward Midway early, and they passed the intended picket line force of submarines en route to their station, negating Yamamoto's <b>back-up</b> security <b>measure.</b> Nimitz's carriers positioned themselves to ambush the Kido Butai (striking force) when it struck Midway. A token cruiser and destroyer force was sent toward the Aleutians, but otherwise Nimitz ignored them. On June 4, 1942, days before Yamamoto expected them to interfere in the Midway operation, US carrier-based aircraft destroyed the four carriers of the Kido Butai, catching the Japanese carriers at an especially vulnerable moment.|$|R
40|$|The Southeastern Anatolia Project (SAP) was {{the largest}} project in T urkey, and {{consisted}} of 13 subprojects on irrigation and energy covering an area of some 70 000 km 2 in the provinces of Sanliurfa, Mardin, Diyarbakir, Adiyaman and Gaziantep. The pur pose of this TCP project was to assist the Government {{in the organization of}} a seminar/w orkshop for senior experts in the field of integrated regional water resources development a nd management as part of the effort to ensure that SAP would contribute fully towar d overall national development without generating major resources-related problems within the regionThe seminar/workshop was organized jointly by the State Planning Organization, Project Development and Promotion Department; the Ministry of Agr iculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs; and FAO. High-level international consultants with experience with similar activities in several other countries participated in the seminar/w orkshop which was attended by 45 local staff, including policy-makers, professors, engineers a nd techniciansThe discussions covered many aspects of large-scale water resources development, and a number of conclusions and recommendations were made for the s uccess and survival of a large-scale irrigation project such as SAP. The most importan t are as followsA body should be created to be responsible for the development of th e region: such a body could be an `authority' or a `development board' and should be uniqu e and genuinely autonomous. The rate of development should not be too ambitious: exp erience gained in other countries suggests that the capacity to reclaim and settle farme rs on irrigated land ranges from 30 000 ha to 50 000 ha a yearSchemes needed to be sufficiently flexible to be able to respond to the economic and technical changes that occurred during the life of the project. Further, pl anning and coordination was required at the national level to ensure the full commitment of the various departments in charge of the government policies in the sectors affected by the project, and <b>back-up</b> <b>measures</b> were needed to support the implementation of the project. Trai ning and extension programmes were of particular importance because of the immediate need to update the skills of technicians and dryland farmer...|$|R
40|$|Natural gas {{presently}} provides {{nearly one}} quarter of New Zealand始s primary energy and, since the production started at the Maui gas field over twenty years ago, the quantity of gas used in electricity generation has more than doubled, with about {{one quarter of}} electricity demand now generated from natural gas. Gas {{has proven to be}} a competitive and versatile thermal fuel in the industrial, commercial and residential markets and is a necessary and reliable complement to renewable resources in electricity generation. Underpinning the attractiveness of gas is efficient and cost-effective combustion and generation technology and a highly reliable system of supply. Gas is supplied from the production and processing facilities in Taranaki to the principal gasfired power stations through a high-pressure transmission system. Whilst this system has operated to a high level of reliability since the 1970 始s, it does not have built into its design 1 the reliability criteria, such as N- 1, applied in electricity transmission networks whereby the loss of a linkage within the system will not cause a failure elsewhere. The reliability of the gas transmission system can be ascribed to its engineering and operational competence rather than the availability of back-up supplies through the design of the network layout. The few failures in gas supplies which have occurred have generally been of short duration and caused by damage to the transmission pipelines, such as washout by flooding or impact by digging machinery operating adjacent to the buried pipeline. Unlike the electricity transmission network, there is some storage capacity within the gas system as the gas is transmitted at high pressure (up to 86 bar) and consumers can be supplied for some time as the gas decompresses in the pipeline downstream of the damage. During the washout of the Hawkes Bay pipeline in 2004, there was sufficient compressed gas, or linepack, in the pipeline to supply the residential gas market for the week the pipeline was out of operation. However, larger industrial consumers could not receive gas during this period. Government and the gas industry is aware of this potential vulnerability to gas supplies and, through the Gas Industry Company, is replacing existing industry arrangements for dealing with critical contingencies with regulations under the Gas Act. The resulting Gas Governance (Critical Contingency Management) Regulations 2008 include, inter alia, the appointment of a critical contingency operator, the preparation of critical contingency management plans, and curtailment arrangements to reduce gas supply to consumers. They are intended to permit the more efficient management of situations when gas supply is affected by short-term production outage or physical problems with the transmission system which the market proves unable to manage although they do not specify a maximum period for which the contingency arrangements will be applied. One of CAENZ始s principal areas of activity is developing a more thorough understanding of the resilience of New Zealand infrastructure to natural hazards and the inter-dependencies between any vulnerabilities and the wider economy. The natural gas supply system is a significant part of this infrastructure and little publicized work has been undertaken to investigate the impact of sustained failures within the supply system on gas availability and the consequent impact on gas consumers, in particular the electricity generators which have a wider impact on electricity consumers. This lack of investigation is due in part to the high level of reliability of gas supplies. Whilst gas supplies may be crucial to many commercial and industrial consumers, relatively few have <b>back-up</b> <b>measures</b> in place to replace gas if it were not available. In some cases this is because the consumers始 operations require the particular properties of natural gas but in most cases it is due to the costs of making provision for back-up fuels which is deemed unnecessary given the high reliability of natural gas supply. However, this is not to say that situations cannot occur which result in a sustained shortfall of gas supplies. It is the intention of this investigation to provide a better understanding of the impact of breakdowns in the gas supply system on the availability of gas to consumers and the consequent impact on their operations. Specific attention is given to the impact of gas availability on electricity generation and the interplay between gas and electricity demand when gas is in short supply...|$|R
40|$|Motivation - Both multi-team {{systems and}} {{awareness}} displays {{have been studied}} more often in the past years, but there hasn't been much focus on {{the combination of these}} two subjects. Apart from doing so, we are particularly interested in the difficulties encountered when multi-team systems are distributed among different locations and how interface technology plays a role in overcoming these. We hypothesise that an activity awareness display will positively effect the performance of teams that are collaborating at a distance. Research approach - During an experiment we look at two teams of two persons each working together on a complex task. In total 20 multi-teams are tested. Half of them is provided with a display containing information about the other team in order to raise their activity awareness. Performance, time, communication and <b>back-up</b> behaviour are <b>measured.</b> After the task participants are questioned about their perceived performance, workload and inter-team coordination. Design - An activity awareness display should communicate the current activity being executed, the status of that activity, and the workload of the remote team. Originality/Value - The goal of this project is to lay out a theoretical base for designing tools to improve the performance of remotely collaborating teams such as Urban Search And Rescue teams missions. Take away message - An awareness display hypothetically improves multi-team performance through more back-up behaviour and less communication...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Immediate {{access to}} the {{equipment}} required for difficult airway management (DAM) is vital. However, in Japan, data are scarce regarding the availability of DAM resources in prehospital settings. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether Japanese helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) are adequately equipped to comply with the DAM algorithms of Japanese and American professional anesthesiology societies. METHODS: This nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2015. Base hospitals of HEMS were mailed a questionnaire about their airway management equipment and <b>back-up</b> personnel. Outcome <b>measures</b> were (1) call for help, (2) supraglottic airway device (SGA) insertion, (3) verification of tube placement using capnometry, and (4) the establishment of surgical airways, all of which have been endorsed in various airway management guidelines. The criteria defining feasibility were the availability of (1) more than one physician, (2) SGA, (3) capnometry, and (4) a surgical airway device in the prehospital setting. RESULTS: Of the 45 HEMS base hospitals questioned, 42 (93. 3 %) returned completed questionnaires. A surgical airway was practicable by all HEMS. However, in the prehospital setting, back-up assistance was available in 14. 3 %, SGA in 16. 7 %, and capnometry in 66. 7 %. No HEMS was capable of all four steps. CONCLUSION: In Japan, compliance with standard airway management algorithms in prehospital settings remains difficult because of the limited availability of alternative ventilation equipment and back-up personnel. Prehospital health care providers need to consider the risks and benefits of performing endotracheal intubation in environments not conducive to the success of this procedure...|$|R
