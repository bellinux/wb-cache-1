25|$|Noll {{has become}} a popular {{internet}} meme, particularly in Australia. The popular phrase 'Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title' gained popularity in 2015, with multiple Facebook pages appearing featuring the phrase. Noll acknowledged the internet fame, finding it 'very funny' and stating 'Some of the stuff they’ve done is bloody brilliant and very clever and very funny. I reckon half of the kids putting together these memes need to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> marketing team!' In January 2016 a Facebook page was created titled 'Get Shannon Noll to Groovin' the Moo 2016'. Despite the pages thousands of likes the organisers of Groovin' the Moo didn't {{reach out to the}} artist to perform. In June 2016, the 'GATchphrase' for the 2016 GAT (a theme chosen by the VCE students of Victoria to write into their papers to show group protest) was voted to be Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australia Idol title. An estimated 3,600 took part in this event. Noll is recognisable by his southern cross tattoo, an image of which was highly circulated in internet meme culture. This displays his patriotic pride and love for Australia.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Eric R. Danton of the Hartford Courant, Jean was asked about her reaction when she heard that Beyoncé was recording [...] "If I Were a Boy". She was initially surprised when people regarded her as a songwriter because she envisioned herself as [...] "do the whole artist thing as well". Jean added, [...] "It's an amazing compliment, but I was like, 'That's great, but it's going to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> album!' And it can <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> album, too, I just didn't realize how it worked... At first when I got this, people didn't know that I was an artist, so it was, like, 'Oh, this songwriter BC.'" [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the first song she ever recorded, and she initially {{did not intend to}} hand it to another singer. Jean said that the fact that Beyoncé recorded the ballad provided many opportunities, and she was approached by many people who wanted to purchase her lyrics. She refused their offers, desiring to use her songs for her own album. However, Jean still intends to write for other artists.|$|E

500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{stated that}} he wanted an [...] "epic" [...] quality to the Christmas special. The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his {{previous}} companions; Moffat said that [...] "I think he's probably reached the {{point in his life}} where he's saying, 'Friendship for me is just postponed bereavement— I want to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own for a while'." [...] Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen {{at the onset of the}} episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) in 1963 and the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) in 2005. He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s, but rejected by the production team at the time. Continuing the theme introduced with the series' first five episodes, [...] "The Snowmen" [...] was promoted like a movie. A movie poster was released in the Radio Times, showing the Doctor and Clara ascending the ladder to the TARDIS.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} {{a message of}} female strength, the song lyrics were described as [...] "goofy" [...] and [...] "fun" [...] by Larry Katz from the Boston Herald. Reading [...] "Just like the Calgon commercial / I really gotta get up out of here", Carey tells her lover that she is leaving him, making a [...] "clever" [...] reference to a commercial. In regards to the latter lyrics, Lawrence Farber from the Windy City Times wrote [...] "they are a playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple." [...] She then sings [...] "By {{the time you get}} this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way," [...] establishing that the relationship is over, and that he shouldn't even try to mend the situation. She also makes reference to his infidelity, [...] "with this one and that one / By the pool, on the beach, in the streets." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Dupri described the song's composition: ...|$|E
500|$|The single's {{video was}} {{directed}} by Jake Nava, and contains numerous wardrobe changes by Carey in a storyline involving luxurious scenery in which the singer leaves her significant other. It is presented in one continuous shot, with no edits. The video begins with a TV screen and the word 'Mimi' appearing, while on the monitor, Dupri raps his introduction. As the television fades, Carey is then shown lying in a bathtub overflowing with water and rose petals, with her hair flowing {{over the side of}} the tub. Next, the camera follows down one floor of the mansion to find Carey, decked out in bright blue makeup and high heels, as she sings [...] "By the time you get this message / It's gonna be too late / So don't bother paging me / 'Cause I'll <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way," [...] into the phone. A short scene is then shown of her lover in a strip club, receiving the message Carey had sent him. As he reads it, he blows smoke into the screen, fading to reveal Carey dressed in a trench coat and dress, before grabbing her bag and heading out the door as she sings, [...] "So I packed up my Louis Vuitton / Jumped in your ride and took off." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1997, she {{starred in}} the Australian {{ensemble}} romantic drama Under the Lighthouse Dancing and also played the lead role in the short-lived television series Sleepwalkers. In 1998, she starred alongside Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds in the TV film The Christmas Wish, played the supporting role of Giulia De Lezze in Dangerous Beauty, and provided some voice work for [...] She {{said in an interview}} in 2012, [...] "That really should not <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> résumé! I think that was early on in the day, when I was trying to beef up my résumé. I came in and did a couple days' work of voiceovers and we had to suck on [...] and then do a little mouse voice. But I was one in a hundred, so I'm sure you would never be able to identify my voice. I probably couldn't either!" [...] In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy Strange Planet and the Texan student Holly Maddux in The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer, which was based on the real life effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux's murder. In 2000, while David Lynch was expanding the rejected pilot of Mulholland Drive into a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film The Wyvern Mystery, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu that was broadcast in March of that year.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So we put the verse on there just to give me a little more presence on the record for it to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat sitting here that I love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "White" [...] {{features}} Ocean alone, and {{is similar}} to a song from his album Channel Orange with the same name. The song is a vast departure {{from the rest of the}} album, featuring Ocean gently singing in the style of Stevie Wonder. Ocean speaks a contemplative poem about the transitory mystery of love, with the song serving as an intermission from the more aggressive style of the album. The song is followed by [...] "Hcapd", with heavy synths played over Left Brain's verses about horror-related topics. Taco and Jasper Dolphin appear on the comical track [...] "We Got Bitches", another absurdist parody composition. The song has a chaotic beat, taking influence from punk rock and rave music. Braggadocio rapping is prominent on the track, with the crew screaming the chorus [...] "We got bitches, we got diamonds, we got cars, we got jacuzzis," [...] adding [...] "and yo’ bitch <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> dick!" [...] The album closer is [...] "Oldie", where Earl Sweatshirt makes his first rapping appearance in over a year. The song is a 10-minute track featuring, in order of appearance on the song, Taco, Tyler, Hodgy Beats, Left Brain, Mike G, Domo Genesis, Frank Ocean, Jasper Dolphin and Earl Sweatshirt, with Tyler closing the song with another verse. The song features the collective's blending of eccentricity and rebellion, and each rapper taking a verse to express their own topics of interest lyrically.|$|E

500|$|In 1961 the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Cry for a Shadow", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who {{is credited}} with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English {{groups such as the}} Shadows. The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time, he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction. Harrison's liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly, and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins. Within this framework he often used syncopation, as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] and [...] "Too Much Monkey Business". Another of Harrison's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves, as on [...] "I'll <b>Be</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Way". He {{was the first person to}} own a Rickenbacker 360/12, a guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart; the higher four being pairs tuned in unison. The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve-string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string. This, and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve-string guitar provided the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles' recordings. His use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Day's Night helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles' [...] "secret weapon".|$|E
500|$|Worried of Clarkson being {{continually}} typecast as {{a talent}} show winner, Davis met with various producers, primarily Max Martin, and {{encouraged them to}} produce records for Clarkson in a pop rock direction. Clarkson revealed that she expected that she'll always be labeled as an American Idol winner; she remarked, [...] "I'm the first one, so it's going to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> grave, I'm aware of that. (There's no getting away from it) so why even try?" [...] Upon their meeting, Martin presented songs he wrote with Dr. Luke. These songs include [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and a demo version of {{what would have been}} [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes". Davis wanted Clarkson to record the songs, describing them having [...] "a sharp rock edge but were still capable of being pop hits. They would push Kelly in a promising direction for her, while maintaining and even growing her audience." [...] Martin insisted that the songs should be given to rock acts, wanting to stray from his reputation for producing pop singles for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in the 1990s. Davis recalled, [...] "Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an American Idol winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song." [...] Martin and Dr. Luke eventually agreed and invited Clarkson to travel to Sweden to record the songs. Upon hearing the tracks, Clarkson was skeptical of the pop elements; and the three eventually decided to develop a rock sound, a move Clarkson claimed Davis did not approve. Davis reiterated that he was ecstatic with the prospect, claiming that she disliked it and demanded that both the songs be removed from the album. Clarkson then asserted that she wanted it to be on the record and claimed that Davis had detested [...] "Because of You" [...] instead, saying that she [...] "was a shitty writer (sic) who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon her". Davis reiterated that he loved the song and felt that Clarkson could indeed write hits.|$|E

[...] Taken aback, Kimmel retorted, [...] "You've got to. There's no getting out of it." [...] In reply, Curts muttered, [...] "Oh, hell!" [...] in tones of such disgusted resignation that everyone present, including Kimmel, burst out laughing.|$|E

2500|$|After Baylor, Rouse {{worked as}} a {{graduate}} assistant coach at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. He left the position in October 2007, and has not had another basketball job since; {{he has said that}} he has been blackballed for taping Bliss's statements. Despite the near-universal revulsion at Bliss's actions, many leading members of the college basketball coaching fraternity considered Rouse's recordings a serious breach of trust – for example, Mike Krzyzewski said that if he ever found out one of his assistants had been secretly taping him, [...] "there's no way he would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> staff". Jeff Ray, the Midwestern coach who hired Rouse, commented: [...] "I'm {{right in the middle of}} it, don't get me wrong. But sometimes the things you see are pretty disgusting. Why is there this black cloud hanging over him? He did nothing wrong. To me, this is all a testimony to the sad state of affairs of our profession." ...|$|E
2500|$|On [...] October 16, 2006, {{the tone}} of the {{messages}} changed. After Megan got home from school, Tina Meier signed onto MySpace for Megan. She was in a hurry because she had to take her younger daughter, Allison, to the orthodontist. Before she could get to the door, Megan was upset. [...] "Josh" [...] sent troubling messages to Megan, including one that said: [...] "I don't know if I want to be friends with you anymore because I've heard that you are not very nice to your friends." [...] More messages of this type were sent, some of Megan's messages were shared with others, and bulletins were posted about her. Tina told her daughter to sign off, and went to the orthodontist. She called her daughter to ask her if she signed off, and she didn't. Megan was sobbing hysterically. When her mother got home, she was furious that she hadn't signed off. She was shocked at the vulgar language her daughter was firing back. Megan then told her mother, [...] "You're supposed to be my mom! You're supposed to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> side!" [...] and then left from the computer and went upstairs. According to her father Ron Meier and a neighbor who had discussed the hoax with Drew, the last message sent by [...] "Josh" [...] read: [...] "Everybody in O'Fallon knows who you are. You are a bad person and everybody hates you. Have a shitty rest of your life. The world would be a better place without you".|$|E
