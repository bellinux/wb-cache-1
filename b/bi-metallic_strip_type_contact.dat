50|$|The lighter is a {{metal or}} plastic {{cylinder}} containing a thin flat coil of nichrome metal strip, through which high current (~10 amperes) passes when {{the device is}} activated, usually by pushing it into the socket {{as though it were}} a push-button. When pushed in, the lighter is held against the force of a spring by a clip attached to a <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip.</b> The heating element glows orange hot in seconds, causing the <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> to bend and release the mechanism, and the handle pops out, eliminating the need for the smoker to time the heating operation. If the lighter is then promptly removed from its socket, it can light a cigarette, cigar, or tinder.|$|R
5000|$|The {{automatic}} electric kettle K1 (a world first), designed in October 1955, used a <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> {{at the rear}} of the kettle: steam was forced through an aperture in the lid of the strip and this knocked the switch, turning the kettle off.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of thermal {{overload}} relay. In one <b>type,</b> a <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|R
2500|$|Domestic {{water and}} steam based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} been controlled by <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> thermostats, and this is dealt with later in this article. Purely mechanical control has been localised steam or hot-water radiator bi-metallic thermostats which [...] the individual flow. However, Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRV) are now being widely used.|$|R
5000|$|Most fan {{clutches}} are viscous or [...] "fluid" [...] couplings, {{combined with}} a bi-metallic sensory system {{similar to that in}} a thermostat. Some clutches are electronically controlled (instead of <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip).</b> These provide the potential to control the level of engagement depending on any number of inputs. Common controlling factors might include engine oil temperature, transmission oil temperature, coolant temperature, AC system pressures and ambient air temperature.|$|R
40|$|Notes on Instrumentation and Control {{presents}} topics {{on pressure}} (i. e., U-tube manometers and elastic type gauges), temperature (i. e. glass thermometer, <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> thermometer, filled system thermometer, vapor pressure thermometer), level, and flow measuring devices. The book describes other miscellaneous instruments, signal transmitting devices, supply and control systems, and monitoring systems. The theory of automatic control and semi-conductor devices are also considered. Marine engineers {{will find the}} book useful...|$|R
50|$|A {{very simple}} {{example of an}} {{instrumentation}} system is a mechanical thermostat, used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A typical unit senses temperature with a <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip.</b> It displays temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace by a mercury switch. As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.|$|R
500|$|At the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the FIA {{banned the}} use of [...] "trick brake" [...] devices, which used a <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> that changed shape when heated by the brakes to open or close off braking ducts and {{improving}} braking efficiency under certain conditions. This was deemed to be in breach of Article 11.4 of the Sporting Regulations, which states that the only permissible changes to the braking system while a car is moving must be directly controlled by the driver.|$|R
5000|$|Holiday lights can be {{animated}} using special [...] "flasher" [...] or interrupter bulbs (usually a red tipped replacement bulb {{included with}} the set) or by electronic controller. Flasher bulbs use a <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> which interrupts the series circuit when the lamp becomes hot. An electronic holiday light controller usually has a diode bridge followed by a resistor-based voltage divider, a filter capacitor and a fixed-program microcontroller. The micro-controller has three or four outputs which are connected to transistors or thyristor which control interleaved circuits, each with lamps of a single color.|$|R
25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|R
50|$|Differences in hygroscopy can be {{observed}} in plastic-laminated paperback book covers—often, in a suddenly moist environment, the book cover will curl away {{from the rest of the}} book. The unlaminated side of the cover absorbs more moisture than the laminated side and increases in area, causing a stress that curls the cover toward the laminated side. This is similar to the function of a thermostat's <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip.</b> Inexpensive dial-type hygrometers make use of this principle using a coiled strip. Deliquescence, the process by which a substance absorbs moisture from the atmosphere until it dissolves in the absorbed water and forms a solution. Deliquescence occurs when the vapour pressure of the solution that is formed is less than the partial pressure of water vapour in the air.|$|R
50|$|In use, {{a sample}} is placed between a {{measuring}} prism {{and a small}} cover plate. Light traveling through the sample is either passed through to the reticle or totally internally reflected. The net effect is that a shadow line forms between the illuminated area and the dark area. It is where this shadow line crosses the scale that a reading is taken. Because refractive index is very temperature dependent, {{it is important to}} use a refractometer with automatic temperature compensation. Compensation is accomplished {{through the use of a}} small <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> that moves a lens or prism in response to temperature changes. There are many types of refractometers and the most common types are Abbe's refractometer, Pulfrich refractometer, Immersion refractometer.|$|R

50|$|The crucial {{problem was}} to find a {{resonator}} that remained unaffected by the changing conditions met by a ship at sea. The balance wheel, harnessed to a spring, solved most of the problems associated with the ship's motion. Unfortunately, the elasticity of most balance spring materials changes relative to temperature. To compensate for ever-changing spring strength, the majority of chronometer balances used <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strips</b> to move small weights toward and away from the centre of oscillation, thus altering the period of the balance to match the changing force of the spring. The balance spring problem was solved with a nickel-steel alloy named Elinvar for its invariable elasticity at normal temperatures. The inventor was Charles Édouard Guillaume, who won the 1920 Nobel Prize for physics in recognition for his metallurgical work.|$|R
5000|$|An {{infinite}} switch, simmerstat, {{energy regulator}} or infinite controller {{is a type}} of switch that allows variable power output of a heating element of an electric stove. It is called [...] "infinite" [...] because its average output is infinitely variable rather than being limited to a few switched levels. It uses a <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> conductive connection across terminals that disconnects with increased temperature. As current passes through the bimetal connection, it will heat and deform, breaking the connection and turning off the power. After a short time, the bimetal will cool and reconnect. Therefore, infinite switches vary the average power delivered to a device by oscillating quickly between on and off states. [...] They may be used for situations that are not sensitive to such changes, such as the resistive heating elements in electric stoves and kilns.|$|R
5000|$|In 1714, the British {{government}} {{offered a}} longitude prize for {{a method of}} determining longitude at sea, with the awards ranging from £10,000 to £20,000 (£2 million to £4 million in [...] terms) depending on accuracy. John Harrison, a Yorkshire carpenter, submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based {{on a pair of}} counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to centrifugal force, which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea. Construction of his third machine, designated H3, in 1759 included novel circular balances and the invention of the <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> and caged roller bearings, inventions which are still widely used. However, H3's circular balances still proved too inaccurate and he eventually abandoned the large machines.|$|R
40|$|The general {{problem of}} {{determining}} the shape and response of two attached growing elastic Kirchhoff rods is considered. A description of the kinematics of the individual interacting rods is introduced. Each rod has a given intrinsic shape and constitutive laws, and a map associating points on the two rods is defined. The resulting filamentary structure, a growing birod, {{can be seen as}} a new filamentary structure. This kinematic description is used to derive the general equilibrium equations for the shape of the rods under loads, or equivalently, for the new birod. It is shown that, in general, the birod is not simply a Kirchhoff rod but rather, due to the internal constraints, new effects can appear. The two-dimensional restriction is then considered explicitly and the limit for small deformation is shown to be equivalent to the classic Timsohenko <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip</b> problem. A number of examples and applications are presented. In particular, the problem of two attached rods with intrinsic helical shape and uniform growth is computed in detail and a host of new interesting solutions and bifurcations are observed...|$|R

Experimental tests were conducted on a motorized test rig for a speed ranging from 0. 50 m/s to 10 m/s. The advantages and limitations of the two types of electrostatic sensor for non-contact speed measurement are discussed in detail. The results indicate that the rounded sensor outperforms the <b>strip</b> <b>type</b> sensor in terms of sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, repeatability, and accuracy...|$|R
50|$|On 1 May 1947, {{it became}} a public company and merged with Astral Equipment Ltd, a company in Dundee, Scotland that made spin dryers and refrigerators. Astral became a wholly owned subsidiary. George Wansbrough was the company {{chairman}} from 1944-54. In 1949, it produced its first automatic toaster which used a <b>bi-metallic</b> <b>strip.</b> It also produced the Simon electric floor scrubber. In 1953, it produced its first hairdryer and claimed to have 90% of the market six years later, as it sold very well. In 1954 it introduced a steam iron; these were still comparatively revolutionary twenty years later. At {{the same time it}} introduced electrical convector heaters and panel heaters (ceramic heaters). By 1957, it was the UK's leading provider of electric blankets, had produced its 10 millionth electric iron, and was producing 60% of the toasters made in the UK. It had bought Yelsen Ltd, a manufacturer of electric blankets at Ruxley in Kent, on 16 June 1957 for £112,000, which became a subsidiary. Also in June, new factories opened at the main site and Dundee. 40% of products were exported and overseas subsidiaries had been established. Morphy did not like the huge expansion of the company, but Richards thought it was too slow. Sir Patrick Bishop became chairman in 1957.|$|R

The doped source-drain contact CNTFETs outperform the Schottky contact devices with and without strain applied. The off-state current in both <b>types</b> of <b>contact</b> is similar with and without strain applied. This is because both <b>types</b> of <b>contact</b> offer very similar potential barrier in off-state. However, the on-state current in doped contact devices is much higher due to better modulation of on-state potential profile, and its variation with strain is sensitive to the device <b>contact</b> <b>type.</b> The on/off current ratio and the inverse subthreshold slope are better with doped source-drain contact, and their variations with strain are relatively less sensitive to the device <b>contact</b> <b>type.</b> The channel transconductance and device switching performance are much better with doped source-drain contact, and their variations with strain are sensitive to device <b>contact</b> <b>type.</b>|$|R
