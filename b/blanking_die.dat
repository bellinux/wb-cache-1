50|$|The {{process is}} often used on parts {{that do not have}} {{quantities}} that can justify a dedicated <b>blanking</b> <b>die.</b> The edge smoothness is determined by the shape of the cutting die and the amount the cuts overlap; naturally the more the cuts overlap, the cleaner the edge. For added accuracy and smoothness most shapes created by nibbling undergo filing or grinding processes after completion.|$|E
5000|$|Compound die: A type of die {{that has}} the die block (matrix) mounted on a punch plate with {{perforators}} in the upper die with the inner punch mounted in the lower die set. An inverted type of <b>blanking</b> <b>die</b> that punches upwards, leaving the part sitting on the lower punch (after being shed from the upper matrix on the press return stroke) instead of blanking the part through. A compound die allows the cutting of internal and external part features on a single press stroke.|$|E
5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened <b>blanking</b> <b>die</b> (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the <b>blanking</b> <b>die.</b> The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} an expert system developed for assisting die designers for design of blanking dies for sheet metal operations. The production rule-based expert system approach is utilized {{for development of}} the system. The proposed system labelled as INTBDIE is organized in form of twelve modules. Modules are coded in AutoLISP language and designed to be loaded into the prompt area of AutoCAD. For consultation, the user loads the system into the prompt area of AutoCAD. The proposed system generates friendly prompt eliciting from the user for data pertaining to the job. The recommendations imparted by the system for design of <b>blanking</b> <b>die</b> are automatically stored in various output data files which are further utilized for automatic modelling of die components and die assembly. This arrangement facilitates interfacing of design with drafting and can be operated on a PC/AT. The knowledge base of the proposed system can be modified depending upon the capabilities of a specific shop floor. As the system can be implemented on a PC having AutoCAD software, therefore its low cost of implementation makes it affordable for small and medium-sized stamping industries.
