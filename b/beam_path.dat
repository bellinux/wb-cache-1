25|$|Apertures {{are either}} a fixed {{aperture}} within the column, {{such as at}} the condenser lens, or are a movable aperture, which can be inserted or withdrawn from the <b>beam</b> <b>path,</b> or moved in the plane perpendicular to the <b>beam</b> <b>path.</b> Aperture assemblies are mechanical devices which allow for the selection of different aperture sizes, which may {{be used by the}} operator to trade off intensity and the filtering effect of the aperture. Aperture assemblies are often equipped with micrometers to move the aperture, required during optical calibration.|$|E
25|$|Manipulation of the {{electron}} beam is performed using two physical effects. The interaction of electrons with a magnetic field will cause electrons to move according to the left hand rule, thus allowing for electromagnets to manipulate {{the electron}} beam. The use of magnetic fields allows {{for the formation of}} a magnetic lens of variable focusing power, the lens shape originating due to the distribution of magnetic flux. Additionally, electrostatic fields can cause the electrons to be deflected through a constant angle. Coupling of two deflections in opposing directions with a small intermediate gap allows for the formation of a shift in the <b>beam</b> <b>path,</b> this being used in TEM for beam shifting, subsequently this is extremely important to STEM. From these two effects, as well as the use of an electron imaging system, sufficient control over the <b>beam</b> <b>path</b> is possible for TEM operation. The optical configuration of a TEM can be rapidly changed, unlike that for an optical microscope, as lenses in the <b>beam</b> <b>path</b> can be enabled, have their strength changed, or be disabled entirely simply via rapid electrical switching, the speed of which is limited by effects such as the magnetic hysteresis of the lenses.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{systems in}} a TEM {{consist of a}} {{phosphor}} screen, which may be made of fine (10–100μm) particulate zinc sulfide, for direct observation by the operator, and, optionally, an image recording system such as film based or doped YAG screen coupled CCDs. Typically these devices can be removed or inserted into the <b>beam</b> <b>path</b> by the operator as required.|$|E

40|$|WO 2008116654 A 1 UPAB: 20081018 NOVELTY - The {{detector}} has light sources e. g. infrared emitters (1 a, 1 b), {{for providing}} light having same intensities while retaining same spectral distribution. <b>Beam</b> <b>paths</b> are {{allocated to the}} light sources, where a different absorption of light occurs in the <b>beam</b> <b>paths</b> in selected wavelength regions. A polygonal mirror (4) alternately supplies {{the light from the}} <b>beam</b> <b>paths</b> to a photoacoustic measuring cell (6). The intensities of the light sources are constant such that temporal change of the light sources does not generate a photoacoustic signal, which distorts measurement of gas. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for determining concentration of an analyte in a photoacoustic measuring cell. USE - Photoacoustic detector for measuring and monitoring concentration of gaseous air pollutants in air or contaminants in a process gas and for determining concentration of an analyte in a photoacoustic measuring cell.

25|$|A TEM is {{composed}} of several components, which include a vacuum {{system in which the}} electrons travel, an electron emission source for generation of the electron stream, a series of electromagnetic lenses, as well as electrostatic plates. The latter two allow the operator to guide and manipulate the beam as required. Also required is a device to allow the insertion into, motion within, and removal of specimens from the <b>beam</b> <b>path.</b> Imaging devices are subsequently used to create an image from the electrons that exit the system.|$|E
25|$|Off-axis or offset feed– The {{reflector}} is an asymmetrical {{segment of}} a paraboloid, so the focus, and the feed antenna, are located {{to one side}} of the dish. The purpose of this design is to move the feed structure out of the <b>beam</b> <b>path,</b> so it does not block the beam. It is widely used in home satellite television dishes, which are small enough that the feed structure would otherwise block a significant percentage of the signal. Offset feed can also be used in multiple reflector designs such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, below.|$|E
25|$|A general {{limitation}} to the spatial {{resolution of this}} method is given by the blurring in the analyzer crystal which arises from dynamical refraction, i.e. the angular deviation of the beam due to the refraction in the sample is amplified about ten thousand times in the crystal, because the <b>beam</b> <b>path</b> within the crystal depends strongly on its incident angle. This effect can be reduced by thinning down the analyzer crystal, e.g. with an analyzer thickness of 40 m a resolution of about 6 m was calculated. Alternatively the Laue crystals can be replaced by Bragg crystals, so the beam doesn´t pass through the crystal but is reflected on the surface.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{tunable diode}} laser {{absorption}} spectroscopy (TDLAS), two-dimensional (2 D) distribution reconstructions of gas concentration and temperature are realized using an algebraic reconstruction technique (ART). The {{influence of the}} beam distribution and grid size on combustion field reconstruction is investigated to attain optimal reconstruction results with {{a limited number of}} beams. Under limited optical-path numbers, it shows that a better spatial resolution is attainable only when the laser <b>beam</b> <b>paths</b> are vertical and parallel to the symmetry axis of the combustion field. Furthermore, experiments with 16 <b>beam</b> <b>paths</b> using one and two flat flame combustion fields are carried out in different fuel-air equivalence ratios under room temperature.

50|$|In an {{interferometric}} autocorrelator, {{the input}} beam is split into a fixed <b>path</b> <b>beam</b> and a variable <b>path</b> <b>beam</b> using a standard beamsplitter. The fixed <b>path</b> <b>beam</b> travels a known and constant distance, whereas the variable <b>path</b> <b>beam</b> has its <b>path</b> length changed via rotating mirrors or other path changing mechanisms. At {{the end of}} the two <b>paths,</b> the <b>beams</b> are ideally parallel, but slightly separated, and using a correctly positioned lens, the two beams are crossed inside a second harmonic generating (SHG) crystal. The autocorrelation term of the output is then passed into a photomultiplying tube (PMT) and measured.|$|R
40|$|Inverse caustic problem, that is {{computing}} {{the geometry}} of a reflector and/or refractor based on a given caustic pattern, is currently not widely studied. In this paper, we propose a technique to solve the inverse caustic problem in which we compute {{the geometry of}} a semi-transparent homogeneous refractive object (caustic object) given a directional light source {{and a set of}} caustic patterns (each pattern is considered to be formed at a specified distance from the caustic object). We validate the results by using mental ray (software rendering). The novelty of our research is that we consider a set of caustic patterns whereas existing techniques only consider one caustic pattern. We employ a stochastic approach to simulate the refracted light <b>beam</b> <b>paths</b> that can approximately reconstruct the input caustic patterns. Working backward, from the computed refracted light <b>beam</b> <b>paths</b> we compute the geometry of the caustic object that can produce such light <b>beam</b> <b>paths.</b> Due to having multiple caustic patterns as the inputs, it is a challenge to reconstruct the input caustic patterns because of the differences in their shapes and intensities. We solve this problem by using a two-step optimization algorithm in which we adjust the position and size of the caustic regions in the first step and we adjust the caustic shapes in the second step. Our technique is able to construct a caustic object for a various types of input caustic patterns. Keywords: caustics, photon, reconstruction, inverse problem, stochastic...|$|R
25|$|The second {{design is}} the top-entry holder {{consists}} of a cartridge that is several cm long with a bore drilled down the cartridge axis. The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the beam axis, such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the <b>beam</b> <b>path</b> or interfering with the objective lens.|$|E
25|$|Class 4 is {{the highest}} and most {{dangerous}} class of laser, including all lasers that exceed the Class3B AEL. By definition, a class4 laser can burn the skin, or cause devastating and permanent eye damage {{as a result of}} direct, diffuse or indirect beam viewing. These lasers may ignite combustible materials, and thus may represent a fire risk. These hazards may also apply to indirect or non-specular reflections of the beam, even from apparently matte surfaces meaning that great care must be taken to control the <b>beam</b> <b>path.</b> Class4 lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock. Most industrial, scientific, military, and medical lasers are in this category. Medical lasers can have divergent emissions and require awareness of nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and nominal ocular hazard area (NOHA).|$|E
25|$|Across the Atlantic in 1922, after {{placing a}} {{transmitter}} and receiver {{on opposite sides of}} the Potomac River, U.S. Navy researchers A. Hoyt Taylor and Leo C. Young discovered that ships passing through the <b>beam</b> <b>path</b> caused the received signal to fade in and out. Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later, Lawrence A. Hyland at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft; this revelation led to a patent application as well as a proposal for further intensive research on radio-echo signals from moving targets to take place at NRL, where Taylor and Young were based at the time.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the beam}} being narrow, it will {{eventually}} spread over long distances {{due to the divergence}} of the laser beam, as well as due to scintillation and beam wander effects, caused by the presence of air bubbles in the air acting as lenses ranging in size from microscopic to roughly half the height of the laser <b>beam's</b> <b>path</b> above the earth.|$|R

25|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{by adjusting}} the magnetic lenses such that the back focal plane of the lens rather than the imaging plane {{is placed on the}} imaging apparatus a diffraction pattern can be generated. For thin crystalline samples, this produces an image that consists of a pattern of dots {{in the case of a}} single crystal, or a series of rings in the case of a polycrystalline or amorphous solid material. For the single crystal case the diffraction pattern is dependent upon the orientation of the specimen and the structure of the sample illuminated by the electron beam. This image provides the investigator with information about the space group symmetries in the crystal and the crystal's orientation to the <b>beam</b> <b>path.</b> This is typically done without using any information but the position at which the diffraction spots appear and the observed image symmetries.|$|E
2500|$|Aperture {{blockage}} - In front-fed parabolic dishes {{where the}} feed antenna {{is located in}} front of the dish in the <b>beam</b> <b>path</b> (and in Cassegrain and Gregorian designs as well), the feed structure and its supports block some of the beam. [...] In small dishes such as home satellite dishes, where the size of the feed structure is comparable with the size of the dish, this can seriously reduce the antenna gain. [...] To prevent this problem these types of antennas often use an offset feed, where the feed antenna is located to one side, outside the beam area. [...] The aperture efficiency for these types of antennas can reach 0.7 to 0.8.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} mode of {{operation}} for a TEM is the bright field imaging mode. In this mode the contrast formation comes from the sample having varying thickness or density. Thicker areas of the sample and denser areas or regions with a higher atomic number will block more electrons and appear dark in an image, while thinner, lower density, lower atomic number regions and areas with no sample in the <b>beam</b> <b>path</b> will appear bright. The term [...] "bright field" [...] refers to the bright background field {{where there is no}} sample and most of the beam electrons reach the image. The image is assumed to be a simple two dimensional projection of the sample's thickness and density down the optic axis, and to a first approximation may be modelled via Beer's law, more complex analyses require the modelling of the sample image to include phase information.|$|E
