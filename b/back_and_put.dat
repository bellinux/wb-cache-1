25|$|The British {{architect}} Edwin Landseer Lutyens, a major {{member of}} the city-planning process, was given the primary architectural responsibility. The completed Governor-General's palace turned out {{very similar to the}} original sketches which Lutyens sent Herbert Baker, from Simla, on 14 June 1912. Lutyens' design is grandly classical overall, with colors and details inspired by Indian architecture. Lutyens and Baker who had been assigned to work on Viceroy's House and the Secretariats began on friendly terms. Baker had been assigned to work on the two secretariat buildings which were in front of Viceroy's House. The original plan was to have Viceroy's House on the top of Raisina Hill, with the secretariats lower down. It was later decided to build it 400 yards <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> both buildings on top of the plateau. While Lutyens wanted Viceroy's House to be higher, he was forced to move it back from the intended position, which resulted in a dispute with Baker. After completion, Lutyens argued with Baker, because the view of the front of the building was obscured by the high angle of the road.|$|E

500|$|The {{new version}} was serialised in Tintin {{magazine}} from June to December 1965, before Casterman published it in a collected volume in 1966. Studios Hergé made many alterations to the illustrations {{as a result}} of De Moor's research. Reflecting the fact that television had become increasingly commonplace in Western Europe, Hergé changed the prose from [...] "It's a television set!" [...] to [...] "It's only a television set!" [...] However, as colour television was not yet available in Britain, the screen on the television encountered in Britain was once again reverted to black-and-white. Additionally, at least one line of dialogue was [...] "softened" [...] from the original version - in one scene where Tintin aims a pistol at two of the counterfeiters, he states, [...] "Get <b>back!</b> <b>And</b> <b>put</b> up your hands!" [...] compared to the original's [...] "One more step and you're dead!". The counterfeit notes that Tintin finds were also increased in value, from one pound to five pounds. The multiple aircraft featured throughout the story were redrawn by Studios member Roger Leloup, who replaced the depiction of planes that were operational in the 1930s to those active at the time, such as a Percival Prentice, a D.H. Chipmunk, a Cessna 150, a Tiger Moth, and a British European Airways Hawker Siddeley Trident.|$|E
