40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{evolution in}} AISI 304 {{austenitic stainless steel}} during Steckel mill rolling has been investigated. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the microstructural behaviour of the strip ends relative to the strip <b>bulk.</b> <b>Good</b> correlation between the development of hard ends that arise in the final strip and strip temperature and mean flow stress has been found by analysing mill log data. Measurement of the recrystallization kinetics under conditions that simulate Steckel mill rolling have shown that deformation temperatures below 950 °C can lead to incomplete recrystallisation during the Steckel mill inter-pass. Predictions of the time to 50 % recrystallisation (t 0. 5) are used to quantify the recrystallisation kinetics of the strip ends...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recently much {{research}} has been conducted in visual sensor networks. Compared to traditional sensor networks, vision networks differ in various aspects such as the amount of data to be processed and transmitted, the requirements on quality-of-service, and the level of collaboration among the sensor nodes. This paper deals with sensor fusion on visual sensor networks. We focus here on methods for fusing data from various distributed sensors and present a generic framework for fusion on embedded sensor nodes. This paper extends our previous work on distributed smart cameras and presents our approach toward the transforma-tion of smart cameras into a distributed, embedded multisensor network. Our generic fusion model has been completely implemented on a distributed embedded system. It provides a middleware which sup-ports automatic mapping of our fusion model to the target hard-ware. This middleware features dynamic reconfiguration to sup-port modification of the fusion application at runtime without loss of sensor data. The feasibility and reusability of the I-SENSE con-cept is demonstrated with experimental results of two case studies: vehicle classification and <b>bulk</b> <b>good</b> separation. Qualitative and quantitative benefits of multilevel information fusion are outlined in this article. Index Terms—Distributed embedded systems, middleware, sensor fusion, vehicle classification.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the authors report results of {{broadband}} dielectric spectroscopy on various samples of CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12, including {{so far only}} rarely investigated single crystalline material. The measurements extend up to 1. 3 GHz, covering more than nine frequency decades. We {{address the question of}} the origin of the colossal dielectric constants and of the relaxational behavior in this material, including the second relaxation reported in several recent works. For this purpose, the dependence of the temperature- and frequency-dependent dielectric properties on different tempering and surface treatments of the samples and on ac-field amplitude are investigated. Broadband spectra of a single crystal are analyzed by an equivalent circuit description, assuming two highly resistive layers in series to the <b>bulk.</b> <b>Good</b> fits could be achieved, including the second relaxation, which also shows up in single crystals. The temperature- and frequency-dependent intrinsic conductivity of CCTO is consistent with the Variable Range Hopping model. The second relaxation is sensitive to surface treatment and, in contrast to the main relaxation, also is strongly affected by the applied ac voltage. Concerning the origin of the two insulating layers, we discuss a completely surface-related mechanism assuming the formation of a metal-insulator diode and a combination of surface and internal barriers.

40|$|In {{industrial}} process measurement instrumentation, radar systems are well {{established for the}} measurement of filling levels of liquids in tanks. Level measurements of bulk goods in silos, on the other hand, are more challenging because the material is heaped up and its surface has typically a relatively complex shape. In this paper, the application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) reconstruction with a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system for level measurements of bulk goods is evaluated. In the proposed monostatic setup, echo signals are acquired at discrete antenna positions {{on top of the}} silo. Spatially resolved information about the surface contour of a <b>bulk</b> <b>good</b> heap is reconstructed by coherent 'delay and sum' processing. The concept has been experimentally evaluated with a 24 to 26 GHz FMCW radar system mounted on a linear stepping motor positioning unit. Measurements on a thin metal wire at different range and on a curved test-object with a diffusely scattering surface have been performed to analyze the system's point spread function (PSF) and performance. Constant range and azimuth resolutions (− 6 dB) of 15 cm and 8 cm, respectively, have been obtained up to a range of 6 m, and results of further evaluations show that the proposed concept allows more accurate and reliable level reconstructions of surface profiles compared to the conventional approach with measurements at a single antenna position...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} {{of the development of}} a dedicated cacaoterminal in the port of Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The port of Abidjan is the most important port in West Africa. The port handles about 15 million tons of cargo a year. One of the main export products is cacao. The developments in the cacao industry are mainly dictated by the biggest importer of cacao, the Port of Amsterdam. As a supplier Abidjan has to follow the developments in order to deliver the cacao according to the client's requirements. The last ten years represented a shift in the cacao shipping. While in former days the cacao was transported as general cargo, in gunnysacks on pallets, nowadays it is also possible to transport the cacao as <b>bulk</b> <b>good</b> (bulk containers or megabulk). This study consists of two parts. The first part investigates how the Port of Abidjan can seize up on to these developments and which port facilities are necessary for a dedicated cacao terminal. As cacao is a seasonal good, the cacao throughput varies throughout the year. In order to create a sufficient return on investment this variation is an important factor. The quality preservation of the cacao beans during the whole transport chain is very important. Criteria as moisture, sweat (precipitation of moisture on beans during shipping) broken beans and heating, what can cause fire, are of importance. The second part investigates the accessibility through the "Canal de Virdi", which all entering in the port ships have to pass. In order to receive the larger vessels nautical adjustments to the present port entrance are necessary. Some rigorous alternatives to increase the accessibility of the channel were proposed. It concerned alternatives that provide unconditional entrance for the above mentioned vessels. For this purpose it is proposed to replace the entire eastern breakwater in order to broaden the entrance. This is a very rigorous and expensive solution. Besides the alternatives disregard the special design of the channel mouth. It was designed to avoid the formation of a sand bar near the entrance. The shape of the entrance was specially studied for at one hand to create a maximal flushing effect of the channel {{and on the other hand}} to maintain a prevailing ebb current over the flood current. HASKONING has studied the issue and has proposed a low cost solution, which keeps the channel mouth itself unimpaired but creates a manoeuvring space directly inside the channel. The navigability should be improved, as ships will have more space and time after the narrow entrance to adjust their course and get in line with the channel's axis.

40|$|Numerical {{studies on}} {{phenomena}} {{connected with the}} discharge of silos {{have been carried out}} with the finite element program SILO and were supported by discharge tests with a small-scale silo model. In discharging computations for various silo geometries the formation of flow profiles and flow zones has been verified and their dependence on the silo geometry is shown. It is demonstrated that independent of the deformation behaviour of the silo, wave phenomena in the <b>bulk</b> <b>goods</b> can give rise to pulsating <b>bulk</b> <b>goods</b> flow and thereby to pulsating discharging pressures. The order of magnitude of pressure fluctuation depends on wall friction, kind of <b>bulk</b> <b>goods,</b> size of the opening and on the discharge start.
