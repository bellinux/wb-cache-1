500|$|The idea of {{the double}} burden is more evolved with the times {{concerning}} both sexes and their newfound roles. The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some [...] "modern men tend {{to believe in the}} principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to actually live up to that belief." [...] The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that is a little <b>bit</b> <b>higher</b> than the previous ones. Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment.

2500|$|One {{well known}} idea of his, expounded on in Michtav me-Eliyahu, is the Nekudas Habechira (point of free will). He states {{that a man}} has one point in his service to G-d where he has to fight his evil inclination, while at other points {{there will be no}} struggle, for the levels below his Nekudas Habechira have already been conquered, and he will easily win those battles of will; whereas levels higher than his Nekudas Habechira are not yet within his grasp. (For example, someone who adheres to Orthodox Judaism will have no problem keeping kosher, but may {{sometimes}} be tempted to rely on unreliable kosher supervision, while somebody farther away from religious practice will have to struggle with whether to eat a ham sandwich (which is non-kosher regardless of supervision).)
