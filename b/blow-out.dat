5|$|Water {{is usually}} only found deep inside holes {{at the bottom}} of <b>blow-out</b> craters. Animals {{therefore}} get the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.|$|E
5|$|Following the All-Star game, Wade {{recorded}} 50 {{points on}} 56.6% shooting and added 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a <b>blow-out</b> loss against the Orlando Magic. Wade became the fourth player in NBA history to score at least 50 points while his team lost {{by at least}} 20 in a game. The following game, Wade recorded a career-high 16 assists and added 31 points and 7 rebounds in a 103–91 win against the Detroit Pistons. Wade became the second player to record 15 or more assists after scoring at least 50 points since Wilt Chamberlain did so in 1968. Two games later, Wade tied a franchise record with 24 points in the fourth quarter, as he led the Heat back from a 15-point deficit in the final nine minutes of the quarter to secure a 120–115 win over the New York Knicks. For the game, Wade recorded 46 points on 55% field goal shooting, 10 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks. Wade followed the performance with a second consecutive 40-point game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Playing against his Eastern Conference rival and good friend, LeBron James, Wade registered 41 points on 53% shooting, 9 assists, 7 steals, 7 rebounds and one block as the Heat lost 107–100. The following game, in former teammate Shaquille O'Neal's return to Miami since being traded, Wade tied a career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, a steal and a block, as the Heat defeated the Phoenix Suns 135–129. Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with at least 30 points and 15 assists. Less than a week later, Wade tied his franchise record with his 78th consecutive game of scoring in double figures in a double overtime thriller against the Chicago Bulls, in which he scored the game-winning three-point basket to secure a 130–127 win. Wade finished with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Wade joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only other player in NBA history to score that many points and have that many assists in a game, while having as high of a field goal percentage. Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning and became the Heat's all-time leading scorer in a triple overtime classic against the Utah Jazz. Wade finished with 50 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists, 4 steals, and 2 blocks in a 140–129 win.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to Philadelphia for a road {{series against the}} two-time defending National League champion Phillies. In the opener, the Dodgers offense finally came alive, scoring a season-high 15 runs in a 15–9 victory. The game featured the first home run since 2007 by outfielder Jay Gibbons, who was just called up from AAA a few days before. In the second game of the series, the bats were silenced by Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt, who shut the Dodgers down 2–0. In the finale, the Dodgers jumped to a 9–2 lead thanks to 6 quality innings by Clayton Kershaw and a four RBI effort from Matt Kemp. However a poor outing from Ronald Belisario in the eighth cut the lead to 9–6 and then Jonathan Broxton was unable to retire a batter in the ninth as the Phillies stormed back for a 10–9 walk-off victory. Next the Dodgers {{traveled to}} Atlanta for a four-game series against the Braves. In the opener, the Dodgers were shut out for the 14th time in the season, this time by Tim Hudson. Hiroki Kuroda allowed just one run in seven innings (a solo home run by Brooks Conrad), {{but it was enough}} as the team lost 1–0. Ted Lilly picked up his third straight win for the Dodgers, as they won the next game 2–1. The Dodgers string of impressive performances from their starting pitchers was ended on August 15, when Vicente Padilla was pounded for eight runs in 4 inning and the Dodgers lost a <b>blow-out</b> 13–1. In the series finale, the Dodgers wasted another gem from Chad Billingsley as the bullpen blew another lead, allowing three runs in the ninth inning to fall 4–3 as Melky Cabrera hit a two-run bases-loaded walk-off single off Octavio Dotel.|$|E

500|$|With the {{championship}} returning to Asia {{for the second}} round of flyaway races, the team arrived in Singapore confident of scoring points; despite both cars advancing to the second period of qualifying and running in the top ten throughout the race, both cars retired with gearbox problems. Alonso was forced out after his car kept selecting neutral without input—a problem that affected several drivers; Button was involved in contact with Pastor Maldonado while trying to pass the slow-moving Alexander Rossi during a safety car restart before his gearbox overheated. After experimenting with a new front wing designed to improve air flow around the front tyres during free practice in Singapore, the team introduced the parts at the next race in Japan one week later. However, the team struggled with tyre pressures; following Sebastian Vettel's high-speed tyre <b>blow-out</b> during the Belgian Grand Prix, the FIA introduced a mandatory minimum tyre pressure setting on the advice of tyre supplier Pirelli. For the Japanese Grand Prix, these pressures were raised by [...] compared to the levels used during the 2014 race, which affected the MP4-30's ride height and vertical suspension travel and produced increased understeer. Despite taking advantage of grid penalties that saw them start twelfth and fourteenth respectively, Alonso and Button went on to finish eleventh and sixteenth. With the team acknowledging that the Singapore Grand Prix had represented their final opportunity to score points on merit, their focus shifted to development of their 2016 car over the final leg of {{the championship}}. In addition to the engine upgrades Honda brought to Russia, the team sought to use the high-speed and low-degradation characteristics of the Sochi Autodrom circuit to test experimental bodywork parts, including the exhaust configuration. In a race of attrition, both Button and Alonso initially finished in the points, with Button in ninth and Alonso taking tenth until Alonso was given a five-second penalty after the race that relegated him to eleventh place.|$|E

[...] He was also impressed that the entire spectacle was put together in just four weeks. MTV's James Montogomery reviewed the first North American performance of the tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He said that the tour was [...] "packed with more wattage than an overheated power plant and more costume changes than a thousand Vegas reviews, it's the kind of show that leaves you with wide eyes, ringing ears, aching limbs and absolutely zero chance of making it to work in the morning." [...] New York Daily News writer Jim Farber expected that the theatricality of the show might have obscured the songs, but instead felt that Gaga's voice was perfect and the concert actually [...] "pushed Gaga a long way towards her obvious goal – to be the queen of this pop moment." [...] Glenn Gamboa from Newsday said that Gaga [...] "built her monster-sized fame on knowing how to create a spectacle and then having the substance to back it up. For every coat made of Kermit the Frog dolls or headdresses that covered her face in red lace, there was a stomping disco anthem or tender piano ballad to match. That back and forth is the centerpiece of her Monster Ball Tour." [...] Dan Aquilante from the New York Post was critical of the show, calling it [...] "scripted, silly, and tired, right down to Gaga's patter." [...] He added that the 15 costumes Gaga wore during the two-hour plus gig were [...] "more successful helping her cement the notion of an erotic and exotic otherworld." [...] Writing in the Telegram & Gazette, Craig S.
