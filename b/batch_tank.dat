The {{cost for the}} hydrolysis of lactose by Î²-galactosidase fromAspergillus oryzae has been calculated for a <b>batch</b> <b>tank</b> reactor, with free (BTRF) and immobilized (BTRI) enzymes, a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a plug-flow tubular reactor (PFTR), considering the mass transfer behavior and deactivation of the enzyme. Enzyme immobilization is economically feasible, compared with a system with free enzymes, despite a very high cost for the enzyme attachment. At a half-life time of 80 d, the PFTR gives the lowest cost (0. 48 SEK/kg lactose), but the cost for the BTRI is just slightly higher (0. 66 SEK/kg lactose) and still {{much lower than the}} BTRF (2. 10 SEK/kg lactose) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract For many {{processes}} of industrial significance, {{due to the}} strong coupling between particle interactions and fluid dynamics, the population balance must be solved {{as part of a}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. In this work, a CFD based population balance model is tested using a batch crystallization reactor. In this CFD model, the population balance is solved by the standard method of moments (SMOM) and the quadrature method of moments (QMOM). The results of these simulations are compared to analytical solutions for the population balance in a <b>batch</b> <b>tank</b> where 1) nucleation, 2) growth, 3) aggregation, and 4) breakage are taking place separately.

So far, various processes were prepared for biodiesel production, but using transesterification method via base catalyst in batch reactors could result in a reasonable yield of biodiesel. At the present study, a <b>batch</b> <b>tank</b> reactor equipped to a helical ribbon-like agitator was designed and manufactured. Using this reactor, the production efficiency was considerably promoted and the required residence time was reduced. Experiments were conducted at 6 : 1 molar ratio of alcohol to refined soybean oil, operational temperature of 64 ?C, KOH concentration of 1 %wt oil, and three levels of agitation speed; 600, 750, and 900 rpm. The agitator design and its helicon movement led to a uniform phase formation of insoluble alcohol and oil.

40|$|Interest {{in batch}} {{processes}} has increased {{with the growing}} importance of specialty chemicals, characterized by high-value, low-capacity, short-term production and strongly nonideal mixtures. While separation {{is an important step}} in these processes, few publications deal with the feasibility and design aspects of batch distillation for azeotropic mixtures. ^ In this dissertation, a simple dynamic model is developed to describe composition changes in batch distillation by decoupling the variations in flows and compositions through a dimensionless warped time. The model is based on constant molar overflow and quasi-steady state assumptions in the column and on a differential model for the <b>batch</b> <b>tank.</b> Two types of batch distillation columns are presented: the batch rectifier, where products are withdrawn at the distillate, and the batch stripper, where products are withdrawn at the bottom. ^ Composition changes for azeotropic mixtures are complex because the sequence of cuts collected depends on the relative amount of each component in the feed. However, in the limiting case of large number of stages and large reflux or reboil ratio, a method is presented to predict the variation of the batch and product compositions as a function of time. As a result, the composition space is divided into regions leading to the same set of fractions. The method is geometrical and requires little or no computation. ^ A systematic procedure to devise a feasible sequence is proposed. This procedure includes determining suitable entrainers to break binary azeotropes. It is shown that the use of a batch stripper is essential in breaking minimum boiling binary azeotropes. The techniques developed are illustrated on the separation of methyl acetate from a quaternary azeotropic feed coming from a transesterification reactor. ^ A simple, tractable, design method is presented to estimate flows, equipment sizes, utility loads and costs for any batch column. This method provides a rapid estimate of the design targets for a variable reflux (or reboil) policy without the need of integrating the column model numerically. This policy, which approximates the constant distillate (or bottom) composition policy, shows significant cost savings over the constant reflux (or reboil) policy. ...|$|E

This system is composed of the Modified Light-Duty Utility Arm, Houdini Vehicle, Waste Dislodging and Conveyance System, Hose Management Arm, and Sludge Conditioning System. GAAT W- 9 {{has been used as}} a waste-consolidation and batch-transfer tank during the retrieval of sludges and supernatants from the seven Gunite tanks in the North and South tank farms at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Tank W- 9 was used as a staging tank for the transfers to the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs). A total of 18 waste transfers from W- 9 occurred between May 25, 1999, and March 30, 2000. Most of these transfers were accomplished using the PulsAir Mixer to mobilize and mix the slurry and a submersible retrieval-transfer pump to transfer the slurry through the Sludge Conditioning System and the {approx} 1 -mile long, 2 -in. -diam waste-transfer line to the MVSTs. The transfers from W- 9 have consisted of low-solids-content slurries with solids contents ranging from {approx} 2. 8 to 6. 8 mg/L. Of the initial {approx} 88, 000 gal of wet sludge estimated in the GAATs, a total of {approx} 60, 451 gal have been transferred to the MVSTs via tank W- 9 as of March 30, 2000. Once the waste-consolidation operations and transfers from W- 9 to the MVSTs are completed, the remaining material in W- 9 will be mobilized and transferred to the active waste system, Bethel Valley Evaporator Service Tank W- 23. Tank W- 23 will serve as a <b>batch</b> <b>tank</b> for the final waste transfers from tank W- 9 to the MVSTs.

The recommended residual waste retrieval system for cleanout of tank W- 9 consists primarily of the existing Tank Waste Retrieval System, which, is used in conjunction with a small surge vessel placed in one of the tank risers and a positive displacement pump installed inside the Primary Conditioning System containment box. Final cleanout of tank W- 9 was initiated in July and successfully completed in September 2000.

Stressed corrosion-test specimens were exposed in the <b>batch</b> dissolver <b>tank,</b> the feed adjustment tank, the BT vapor separator, the A-column feed tuink, and the BTC catch tank Generally, types 304 L and 3 O 9 SCb stainless steel exhibited comparable corrosion resistance in all environments examined. Most of the studies were conducted with these two alloys. Severe corrosion damage was encountered in the vapor phase of both the batch dissolver twin, operated at a maximum temperature of 115 deg C, and the feed adjustment tank, operated at a maximum temperature of 155 deg C. Corrosion rates for types 304 L and 309 SCb stainless steel varied from approximately 30 to 55 mpy in the <b>batch</b> dissolver <b>tank</b> during the development and the production-development periods. Vapor-phase corrosion rates in the feed adjustment tank during the lant haif of the development period ranged from 85 to 100 mpy.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mixing of}} high {{viscosity}} and viscoelastic fluids may {{be performed in}} industry using a âbutterflyâ impeller, which has received scant attention. This paper describes the characterisation of these impellers using both Newtonian and viscoelastic (Boger) fluids with an identical base viscosity under laminar flow conditions in <b>batch</b> <b>tanks</b> without baffles. Measurements are made using two rotational speeds (N= 30 or 60 rpm) {{over a wide range}} of impeller to tank diameter ratios from 0. 53 to 0. 98. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) have been used to determine local velocity fields, shear rates, flow numbers and mixing times, with impeller power number Po obtained from torque measurements. A down-pumping flow pattern is observed, with maximum normalised velocities of 25 % of the impeller tip speed observed in the axial plane, increasing to 60 % in the rotational plane due to solid body rotation. Angle resolved measurements found these to be slightly increased as the impeller passes the image plane, with viscoelastic fluids displaying a greater uniformity of velocity across the image planes due to elastic energy storage. Maximum shear rates are greatest between the impeller and the wall, yet remain low i. e. O(10) sâ 1. Mixing times obtained from PLIF show that mixing times in viscoelastic fluids show a slight reduction compared to the Newtonian equivalent.
