According to Taylor, {{it remains to be seen}} whether the United States Congress or the Executive branch of government held responsibility for officially declaring military action in Vietnam. It is the opinion of Taylor that both the President and the Congress bear responsibility, and that the Vietnam War could only be ended by an act of national will, rather than <b>by</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>means.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Within a {{few decades}} after the Reformation, governments in most of Europe sought to impose a {{particular}} religion, whether Catholicism or a variety of Protestantism, on all the population they ruled. Apart from outright war, members of the [...] "wrong" [...] church were often persecuted or driven into exile. In Catholic countries, the Spanish Inquisition and the Council of Troubles in the Habsburg Netherlands were among the bodies pursuing persecution <b>by</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>means.</b> In France, the French Wars of Religion included numerous massacres, most notoriously the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572. After a long peace following the Edict of Nantes in 1598, Louis XIV reopened {{the issue in the}} late 17th century, and the persecution known as the Dragonnades was followed in 1685 by the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the expulsion of all French Protestants. Religious refugees from both sides were common in many parts of Europe. The Vatican long remained opposed to the limited religious toleration that gradually became accepted in many parts of Europe.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{results of a}} national survey of psychiatrists in the United States about involuntary civil commitment. The questionnaire, created by the researcher, asked respondents about their knowledge of and support for various legal standards surrounding inpatient and outpatient commitment. Data from 739 members of the American Psychiatric Association indicated support for relatively limited definitions of mental disorder for purposes of commitment and relatively limited legal grounds for commitment. Respondents frequently gave inaccurate responses about the grounds for commitment in their states, as well as whether involuntary outpatient commitment is allowed in their states. A comparison of results with prior surveys of psychiatrists is provided, and policy implications are discussed.

40|$|The 1975 {{session of}} the Nebraska Legislature enacted {{sections}} 46 - 656 to 46 - 674 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes, rather optimistically entitled the 2 ̆ 2 Nebraska Ground Water Management Act. 2 ̆ 2 As the legislative statement of intent indicates, the Act is designed to manage and conserve groundwater resources {{in an effort to}} insure the present and future economic well-being of the state. The legislative intent also purports to include a 2 ̆ 2 demand, 2 ̆ 2 in the public interest, to implement management practices. However laudable this frank legislative recognition of the problem, the Act may fail to accomplish its stated purpose by not providing sufficient means for a politically feasible and constitutionally permissible solution.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{conflicting}} analytical strains {{run through the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent majority opinions {{in the area of}} state sovereign immunity. The 2 ̆ 2 supremacy 2 ̆ 2 strain stresses that, despite the Eleventh Amendment, the states remain obligated to comply with federal law, and that the Constitution envisions the 2 ̆ 2 necessary <b>judicial</b> <b>means</b> 2 ̆ 2 to enforce these obligations against the state. These means include suits by the federal government, private suits for injunctive relief, and suits seeking damages from state officials in their individual capacities. Thus, according to the supremacy strain, state sovereign immunity is unimportant because it merely bars unnecessary means of enforcing the federal obligations of the states. The 2 ̆ 2 state sovereignty 2 ̆ 2 strain, on the other hand, emphasizes that state sovereign immunity is a vital and fundamental principle of federalism and hence, for example, cannot be evaded through mere pleading maneuvers. Both analytical strains are evident in the recent opinion in Alden v. Maine. This article describes the two analytical strains and argues that the conflict between them may be coming to a head in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s doctrine concerning abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment. The recent abrogation cases suggest that an abrogation of state sovereign immunity is valid only if it is 2 ̆ 2 genuinely necessary. 2 ̆ 2 If so, and if state sovereign immunity does not bar the 2 ̆ 2 necessary <b>judicial</b> <b>means</b> 2 ̆ 2 for assuring state compliance with federal law, then it would appear that an abrogation of state sovereign immunity would never be valid. The increasing prominence of the state sovereignty strain in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions suggests that the Court may be poised to narrow the alternative remedies that until now have provided the 2 ̆ 2 necessary <b>judicial</b> <b>means</b> 2 ̆ 2 for assuring state compliance with federal law, substituting a congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. This article concludes that such a move would be problematic because, among other things, it would deny 2 ̆ 2 necessary <b>judicial</b> <b>means</b> 2 ̆ 2 of enforcing valid federal laws placing obligations on the states pursuant to Article I...|$|R

40|$|Judicial {{review of}} {{administrative}} action can generally {{be divided into}} systems characterized <b>by</b> <b>judicial</b> dualism or judicial monism. <b>Judicial</b> dualism <b>means</b> {{that there is a}} separation between administrative and ordinary courts, without a higher court supervising the uniform application of the law. The notion judicial monism is used to describe an integrated court system. Concerning judicial review of the constitutionality of legislative action one can make another basic distinction. On the one hand, there is the so-called 'American' model of decentralized judicial review. This principally means that every single judge can review the constitutionality of legislative action. On the other hand, there is the so-called 'European' or 'Austrian' or 'Kelsenian' model of centralized judicial review of legislation. In principle, there is only one centralized constitutional court, which has the exclusive power to rule on the constitutionality of legislation.
