2500|$|A hat-trick in darts is a {{score of}} three {{consecutive}} bullseyes, {{also known as the}} [...] "Alan Evans Shot", after Alan Evans scored three <b>bulleyes</b> during a match on numerous occasions.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Paeony <b>bulleye</b> (Priacanthus blochii) {{from the}} Red Sea ...|$|R
50|$|The {{common names}} Bloch's bigeye, blotched bigeye, glass-eye, paeony <b>bulleye,</b> paeony {{bulls-eye}} or bigeye, big-eye, shortfin bigeye, silver big-eye, and goggle eye {{are used for}} this species.|$|R
50|$|Priacanthus sagittarius, {{commonly}} known as arrow <b>bulleye,</b> is a marine fish native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It has been recorded as an invasive species in the Mediterranean since 2009, most likely having arrived via the Suez Canal.|$|R
40|$|Elongate <b>bulleye,</b> Priacanthus prolixus {{was first}} time {{recorded}} from the Mediterranean Sea. One specimen of P. prolixus {{was caught by}} a commercial trawler {{at a depth of}} 70 m in 7 November 2016 from İskenderun Bay, Norteastern Mediterranean Sea, Turkey. The occurrence of this species in the Mediterranean Sea is most probably due to migration from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal...|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} Roadblock of the race, one team member had to match 1 brick with 1000 {{different}} bricks, matching {{the one which}} they chose. In this leg's Detour, teams chose between Warriors Strength and Warriors Skill. In Warriors Strength, that team must take a boat to an island and perform a ladder climb and rappelling from other side to receive their next clue. In Warriors Skill, that team must hit a <b>bulleye</b> using spears and arrows from the distance of 10m to receive their clue. For this leg's Speed Bump, Paul & Francis had to each make a clay tea cup {{in order to continue}} on the race.|$|R
40|$|Cathepsin L {{could not}} be removed {{completely}} during conventional actomyosin extraction and still remained in the actomyosin of red <b>bulleye</b> surimi. Sepharose 6 B gel filtration profile showed that the main peak of cathepsin L was separated from that of actomyosin suggesting the enzyme was non-binding to actomyosin. The fractions showing the main activity of cathepsin L were pooled and mentioned as L mix. Optimal pH of cathepsin L in actomyosin and L mix was 5. 0 and the optimum temperature of L mix was 45 °C. Stability of L mix was closely related to temperature and pH. At optimum temperature 45 °C and optimum pH 5. 0, activity of cathepsin L remained 76. 8 % after 120 min. At acidic pH 4. 0, it remained 25 % of its original activity after incubation at 45 °C for 120 min. At neutral pH 7. 0, incubated at 45 °C, cathepsin L decreased the activity to 50 % within 30 min and remained only 3 % after 120 min. When incubated at low temperature 25 °C, cathepsin L kept 83 - 85 % of its original activity at pH 4. 0, 5. 0 and 7. 0. Effect of NaCl concentration on cathepsin L was related to pH. At neutral pH 7. 0, in 0. 6 M NaCl solution, cathepsin L activity was about 85 % that of pH 5. 0, indicating that cathepsin L might contribution to the gel deterioration of red <b>bulleye</b> surimi even in neutral condition. Studies of substrate specificity and effects of activators and inhibitors confirmed L mix to be a thiol-type cysteine protease...|$|R
