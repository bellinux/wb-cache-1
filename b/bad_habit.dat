50|$|The Lesson - The Lesson {{was once}} a great and lovable exaggeratedly righteous superhero who stopped the two <b>Bad</b> <b>Habits,</b> who cause people to be {{overwhelmed}} with gluttony and laziness. When the two <b>Bad</b> <b>Habits</b> got loose again, The Lesson came to stop them, but the two <b>Bad</b> <b>Habits</b> showed The Lesson. However, after verbal confrontation with the <b>Bad</b> <b>Habits</b> who complained to him, The Lesson realized people were being lazy on their own. The Lesson then tried to rid people of their <b>bad</b> <b>habits,</b> but when they ignored him he tried to pound the lesson into them, literally. His powers include flight {{and the ability to}} turn his hands into hammers. He returned where his latest lesson has Yin, Yang, Lina, Melodia, and Dave trapped in a superhero-themed TV show (most of the fake TV show had parodied DC Comics characters, the home base was a parody on the Teen Titans tower).|$|R

25|$|A {{key factor}} in {{distinguishing}} a <b>bad</b> <b>habit</b> from an addiction or mental disease is willpower. If a person has control over the behavior, then it is a habit. Good intentions can override the negative effect of bad habits, but their effect seems to be independent and additive—the bad habits remain, but are subdued rather than cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Fidgeting is the act {{of moving}} about restlessly. Fidgeting may {{be a result of}} nervousness, agitation, boredom or a {{combination}} of these. It may be a result of genes and is often an unconscious act. Fidgeting may involve playing with one's fingers, hair, or items of clothing. A common act of fidgeting is to bounce one's leg repeatedly. Rings are another common focus of fidgeting; variations include ring spinning, twirling or rolling along a table. Parents often consider fidgeting to be a <b>bad</b> <b>habit,</b> especially in schoolchildren.|$|E

25|$|The {{match against}} Lipscomb of the Atlantic Sun Conference was a contest of {{defenses}} {{with the two}} squads managing to get off only three shots in the first half. The Cougars picked up the pace in the second half, but the Bisons' keeper made four of his six saves to hold the home team scoreless. SIUE's defense turned away everything sent at them, but made a <b>bad</b> <b>habit</b> of clearing the ball over the end line to set up Lipscomb corner kicks. The game was still scoreless with {{less than two minutes}} remaining in the second extra period when the Bisons set up for their eighth corner of the game. Cougar defenders turned away two Lipscomb headers, but the final clearance rebounded off a charging Bisons forward, falling into the net past a stunned Dal Santo.|$|E

Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit. When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue, Barkley replied, [...] "It's not a problem. If you're a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems.

500|$|Observers {{commented that}} California Chrome {{appears to be}} a very {{intelligent}} horse, as he expresses curiosity about everything around him. His idiosyncrasies, included a fondness for one specific brand of horse cookies. [...] His tendency to perform a flehmen response for no obvious reason, particularly when being bathed, prompted the press to claim that he is [...] "smiling". He will deliberately stop and put his ears forward to [...] "pose" [...] for cameras when he hears them clicking. As Alan Sherman explained, [...] "He's a ham"; and exercise rider Willie Delgado gave him an additional nickname, [...] "Vogue". As a younger horse, notably in 2014, he would not walk forward out of horse vans designed for a forward exit; he would only back out, a quirk discovered by the press when he was first unloaded off of an airplane. At the Sherman stables, he had a green tetherball in his stall to play with, but his worst <b>bad</b> <b>habit</b> is that he sometimes bites.|$|E
500|$|DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire {{noted in}} a review that while the tenth season {{contains}} [...] "a lot of laughs", it is missing the emotional core of the earlier seasons. Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com has commented that around the time the tenth season aired, [...] "not only did the show start losing its status as untouchable—read: everyone stopped expecting every episode to be a masterpiece—it also developed the <b>bad</b> <b>habit</b> of building episodes around celebrity guests, who were practically never as amusing as {{they were meant to}} be." [...] Michael Passman of The Michigan Daily wrote in 2007 that [...] "in hindsight, the 10th season can now be seen as a tipping point of sorts for a number of the show's less attractive plot devices. Homer's get-rich-quick schemes start to become all too prevalent, and there are an inordinate amount of unnecessary celebrity cameos." [...] Passman did not only have negative things to say about the tenth season though. He commented that it [...] "is not the last great 'Simpsons' season ever. The last great season was the eighth. The last really good season was the ninth. But the tenth is just pretty good, nothing more, nothing less." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{her first}} day working at Ralph Lauren, Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) tries {{to get along with}} her new {{colleague}} and boss, Nancy and Kim. The latter two are smokers, and go on a cigarette break, which Rachel can't join as she doesn't smoke and she is angered to find that Nancy and Kim are busy making company decisions without her during the smoking break. Rachel fears for her position, as Kim and Nancy spend more time together during smoking breaks and have a better chance to bond, and thus Nancy is most probably going to get promotions. To make an effort and bond with her co-workers, Rachel goes with them and smokes a cigarette. She is not enthusiastic to fall into the <b>bad</b> <b>habit</b> and tries to talk Kim and Nancy into quitting which comes to no avail, later catching them smoking behind her back. Kim warns Rachel that she would fire her if she catches her with a cigarette as she doesn't want to [...] "drag her down with them". She forces Rachel to leave, just as she invites Nancy to go on a business trip to Paris with her.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft follows Locke in emphasising {{the role}} of the senses in learning; for her, as Myers writes, [...] "ideally, {{children}} should learn not from direct teaching but from living examples apprehended through the senses." [...] Wollstonecraft’s Mrs. Mason takes Mary and Caroline out into the world in order to instruct them—their very first lesson is a nature walk that teaches them not to torture but rather to respect animals as part of God's creation. Mrs. Mason uses the experiences of everyday life as a teaching tool because they are grounded in concrete realities and easily absorbed through the senses; she will seize on [...] "a <b>bad</b> <b>habit,</b> a passerby, a visit, a natural scene, a holiday festivity" [...] and then apply them to a moral lesson that she wants to inculcate into her pupils.
