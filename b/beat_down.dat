The exhaust problem was never adequately resolved, and smoke continued to <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> onto the casing while moving, obscuring the driver's vision. There was much experimentation in order to resolve this problem, {{with varying degrees of}} success, and photographic evidence shows the many guises of this project.|$|E

5|$|Next was the World Tag Team Championship {{match between}} the {{defending}} champions Rated-RKO and D-Generation X (DX). During the match, Triple H did a spinebuster on Orton and injured his right leg. The match ended when Michaels hit the referee and then assaulted Rated-RKO with a chair. DX used steel chairs to <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> Rated-RKO. After the match, DX brutalized Rated-RKO {{and left them}} a bloody mess on the announcers' tables. Triple H gave Edge a Pedigree on the announce table, and Shawn Michaels did the diving elbow drop on Randy Orton through the Spanish announce table.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, Punk {{was drafted}} to the Raw brand during the 2008 WWE draft. His first night on Raw came the {{following}} week; after Batista <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> World Heavyweight Champion Edge, Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank contract {{and won the}} World Heavyweight Championship. Later that night, Punk made his first title defense against JBL, who had challenged him shortly after his win. Punk continued to hold and defend the title until Unforgiven on September 7. Before the Championship Scramble match, Punk was attacked by The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase with Manu). Orton finished the assault by punting Punk in the head. Punk could {{not participate in the}} match due to the attack and so forfeited the title. He was replaced by Chris Jericho, who won the match and the title. He received a rematch eight days later on September 15, where he failed to regain the title in a steel cage match against Jericho.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Jeff Hardy. MVP quickly <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> Hardy and {{dominated}} {{early in the}} match. Hardy tried {{to come back with}} a mule kick from the corner, but MVP moved out of the way, leading Hardy to crash the mat face first. MVP controlled most of the match, until Hardy finally had some offense with a rope-aided corner dropkick in the corner. With the upper hand, Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP, but MVP moved out of the way. MVP tried to perform a running big boot, but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold. The match ended with Hardy winning the match, after performing the Whisper in the Wind, a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, then spinning 180°, landing on a fallen opponent back-first.|$|E

5|$|Three weeks later, McMahon {{scheduled}} another handicap match, {{with the}} Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however; instead the Spirit Squad brutally <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> Michaels, ripping apart his ring attire and, {{as part of}} the storyline, shattered his knee with a chair. McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer; however, Kenny snatched the sledgehammer away from him, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group. Triple H and Michaels revived their former team, D-Generation X (DX), and began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric pranks on the team and the McMahons (Vince and his son Shane), as well as defeating the Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E
25|$|Among McKeever's hurling honours {{was winning}} the Ulster Under 21 Hurling Championship with Derry in 1986, {{defeating}} Antrim and Down along the way. They <b>beat</b> <b>Down</b> {{in the final}} after a reply; 3-09 to 1-02. In the drawn final McKeever suffered a serious injury.|$|E
25|$|Lashley {{regained the}} {{championship}} on January 7, 2015, thanks to interference from MVP, King, Samoa Joe and Low Ki, {{as well as}} Eric Young turning on Roode. On the January 16 episode of Impact Wrestling, MVP attempted to present Lashley {{as the centerpiece of}} his The <b>Beat</b> <b>Down</b> Clan, while referencing the trio of themselves and King as the foundation of the BDC, Lashley refused {{to become a part of}} this new group, however, and decided to leave, only to be attacked by the other members, with MVP saying that the title belongs to the BDC, this turned Lashley face in the process. Lashley was a member of Team Angle at Lockdown, defeating The <b>Beat</b> <b>Down</b> Clan. On the March 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, Lashley lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Kurt Angle. On the April 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, Lashley received a rematch for the title, but was again defeated by Angle.|$|E

25|$|Later that night, DDP and Rhyno faced Kane and the Undertaker. During the match, {{there was}} {{interference}} from the Alliance. In response, The Hardy Boyz, the APA, Jericho, and Kurt Angle came {{to help their}} WWF allies, but more Alliance members came in and overwhelmed the WWF wrestlers. Backstage, many WWF and Alliance wrestlers were fighting each other, and the WWF {{seemed to be on}} the losing end of things. A truck was seen driving up to the arena, however, and Austin came out with his cue stick and proceeded to <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> any WCW and ECW wrestlers in his path. He then came to the ring, trash-talking on the way down, and <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> the Alliance wrestlers, giving Stunners to most {{of the men in the}} ring. The WWF wrestlers had cleaned house and were standing tall. The WWF seemed to be in good shape for the upcoming pay-per-view with Austin's return.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the angle}} was very {{successful}} and drew {{a lot of money}} for CMLL, El Hijo del Santo continued to wrestle as a babyface throughout the country, even teaming with Rey Mysterio in Tijuana. El Hijo del Santo began to be at odds with his heel allies, namely Scorpio, Jr. and Bestia Salvaje. Finally, in September 1998, the face turn was made official when El Hijo del Santo's partners, Villano III and Fuerza Guerrera turned on Santo. Scorpio, Jr. and Salvaje joined in on the <b>beat</b> <b>down,</b> leading Santo's next big feud.|$|E
25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Starrcade was between Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Flair {{was in his}} third reign as the champion, and his reign at the time had lasted for over a year. On September 29 at the Omni in Atlanta, after Flair {{defeated}} Nikita Koloff in a steel cage match, Nikita and Ivan Koloff attacked Flair until Rhodes came and fought them off. Ole and Arn Anderson then came, and, along with Flair, <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> Rhodes. Flair broke Rhodes' left ankle with a diving knee drop, and applied the figure four leglock.|$|E

25|$|Also on the post-Wrestlemania Raw, The Hardy Boyz {{retained}} their Raw Tag Team Championship against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, while Cesaro and Sheamus {{earned a}} title shot at Payback by defeating Enzo Amore and Big Cass.

The Revival defeated {{and continued to}} <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> New Day, injuring Kofi Kingston's ankle. The following week, The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) lost a rematch against Revival and were moved to SmackDown {{as part of the}} Superstar Shake-up.|$|E

Chavo Guerrero, Jr. came out, distracted the referee, and threw Douglas the chain. As Douglas was about to use the chain, Guerrero notified the referee of the chain, and Douglas was disqualified. Rection won the match, and Douglas <b>beat</b> <b>down</b> Rection and Guerrero.|$|E
