5|$|A dry bell {{may also}} be used for bounce dives to great depths, and then used as the {{decompression}} chamber during the ascent and later on board the support vessel. In this case it is not always necessary to transfer into a deck chamber, as the bell is quite capable of performing this function, though it would <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> cramped, as a bell is usually as small as conveniently possible to minimize weight for deployment.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E

In the FEM image, dark areas correspond to regions where the local work function φ <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> high and/or the local barrier field F <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> low, so J <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> low; the light areas correspond to regions where φ <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> low and/or F <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> high, so J <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> high.

5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, especially from the large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> clean.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} Uranus, are thought to <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> young; their age is {{probably}} significantly {{less than that of}} the Solar System. Also, like those of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as the sources of dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Uranus {{are thought to}} <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> young, and not more than 600million years old. The Uranian ring system {{probably}} originated from the collisional fragmentation of several moons that once existed around the planet. After colliding, the moons probably broke up into many particles, which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability.|$|E

5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to know one another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E
5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E

5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many {{of the larger}} houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E

5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when {{relative}} humidity approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} <b>be</b> <b>relatively</b> inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray zone of the Falls. However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of}} the ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the GameCube {{version of}} Viewtiful Joe sold through its initial {{shipment}} {{of less than}} 100,000 copies {{during the week of}} its release.

5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits.

A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E
