5|$|Hancock was {{originally}} titled Tonight, He Comes and later changed to John Hancock {{before settling on}} its final title. Prior to the film's release, marketing consultants attempted to persuade Sony Pictures to again change the title Hancock <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> vague for audiences, suggesting alternatives like Heroes Never Die, Unlikely Hero, and Less Than Hero. Despite the advice, Sony stayed with Hancock and anticipated marketing on {{the popularity of the}} film's star, Will Smith.|$|E
5|$|The SAR {{task force}} mission leader, Capt. Fred Boli in Sandy 01, called the rescue {{off for the}} time being <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> dangerous. The {{remaining}} aircraft exited to the south across the Song Meiu Giang. The area was just too hot. Hambleton and Clark would have to spend another night behind the front lines. The North Vietnamese, alerted by the American's intense efforts to find the navigator, increased their efforts to find Hambleton.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{scouting}} {{was well}} underway {{by the time}} Fargo was renewed. Principal photography began in Calgary, Alberta on January 19, 2015, and took 85 days. The city's central business district and Kensington neighborhood doubled for Kansas City, Sioux Falls, and Luverne. Production crew constructed the Waffle Hut set on the CL Ranch in neighboring Springbank. Elsewhere in the area, shooting took place in Didsbury, High River, and Fort Macleod. Initially, the weather posed a challenge for the production <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> warm for snow. To solve this problem, the production crew brought snow to the set from nearby mountains.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} competent and prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> wet. Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E
5|$|What {{happened}} next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would {{be said for}} the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in the boulevard Maillot. This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the historian of the race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent goes as far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he says was there, said the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> early. Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed, however the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on the 5 April.|$|E

5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick. The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche. The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> close to Q'umarkaj.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} make the show seem more realistic, Franks and other writers talked to his father, a former Los Angeles police officer, and several psychics. Much of the episode's content was improvised by the actors, and Roday {{included}} a pineapple in the episode, continuing the reoccurring theme on the show. James Roday talked to producers about including singing in the series' second episode, but the idea was shut down <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> soon in the show. In addition, Steve Franks considered writing one of the show's early episodes to be about a psychic claiming Shawn was a fraud, but delayed writing the episode until later. The producers attempted to include themes against smoking and the issues of friendship. Franks also included a character named Mrs. Foote, a reference to his 1999 movie Big Daddy.|$|E

25|$|These garages {{often have}} low ceiling clearances, which {{restrict}} access by full-size vans {{and other large}} vehicles.

25|$|The Dnieper {{reservoirs}} {{contain an}} additional major threat—after the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in 1986, radionuclides washed away by rains badly contaminated the bottom silt of the Kiev Reservoir and presumably the others. During {{the years following}} the disaster, there were suggestions to drain the Kiev Reservoir <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> shallow. It appeared that, if done, this could have created {{the threat of the}} tremendous amounts of radioactive dust travelling by wind, lethally affecting Europe.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Colmar (1802–1818), {{with support}} from Napoleon, set into motion {{restoration}} efforts. These efforts were interrupted by quartering needs for the French Army in 1813, and the cathedral {{was used as a}} church in 1814 {{for the first time in}} eleven years. By 1831, the reparations had been for the most part completed. The major change to the building was an iron cupola on the main eastern tower built by architect Georg Moller. But this cupola was removed in 1870 <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> heavy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{there was some}} {{controversy}} over whether university funds {{should be used to}} illuminate the Cathedral at night, or to clean the building's façade. The cleaning was abandoned <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> costly. Some Oakland residents spoke out against the cleaning, stating that the years of soot should stay as an homage to Pittsburgh's industrial past. However, the university approved nearly $5 million for cleaning and restoration of stonework on February 28, 2007. The work was completed at the end of 2007, restoring the exterior of the building to its original condition.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} the rise in abstinence-only {{education}} remains a question. To date, no published studies of abstinence-only programs have found consistent and significant program effects on delaying the onset of intercourse. In 2007, a study ordered by the U.S. Congress found that middle school students {{who took part in}} abstinence-only sex education programs were just as likely to have sex (and use contraception) in their teenage years as those who did not. Abstinence-only advocates claimed that the study was flawed <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> narrow and began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and that other studies have demonstrated positive effects.|$|E
25|$|Women {{comprised}} {{one-third of}} the EZLN army, and {{a significant portion of}} them held commanding offices. In addition, about half of the EZLN’s support base was women. Initially, the majority of the women insurgents were in the less-organized local militias, but later decided to join the actual EZLN. The women who joined as insurgents had to renounce having a family of their own, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> difficult to care for children in the conditions they lived in. There was family planning for women insurgents, but for those who did get pregnant, they either went home or left the child with their parents. In the insurgent camps men and women share cooking and cleaning tasks equally.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1860s {{another part of}} the Sydney Common, the area west of the Garrison Ground to the then Dowling Street, was opened for public recreation. It was named Moore Park after the Mayor of Sydney, Charles Moore, who planted a number of Moreton Bay Fig trees which exist to this day. As well as the {{location}} of Sydney's first zoo, Moore Park was a regular venue for games between Sydney rugby clubs Sydney University and the Wallaroos. Sydney at the time was a small, dense city and best navigated on foot and Moore Park was on the outskirts. It was not liked so much by cricketers <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> far from the city.|$|E
