40|$|The major {{function}} of the <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> is to ensure proper operation and to keep a clean and health interior space for human’s life. Therefore, there usually exists an interior health problem from seal water losing trap in general building in Taiwan. The trap with simple structure is also preferred to set as a critical part for most of sanitary facilities because of its easy elimination of stench and vermin. This paper firstly arranged the history and development of drainage technology, and studied the theory and methodology of the performance experiment. This research will investigate the case of existing buildings drainage system in Taiwan from our previous researches. The main purpose of the research {{is to find the}} drainage issues in building through the observation and basic study of stack fluid mechanism. And create an indestructible testing method to compare the theory of air pressure distribution in stack of building. Than verify the performance of <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> The results of this research would contribute to the domestic building technology and improve the design of drainage system in building.

40|$|The {{appliance}} {{trap seal}} remains the primary defence against cross-contamination from the foul air present within the <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> As an identified vector {{in the spread}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003, trap seal failure has been confirmed as a significant, and potentially fatal, risk to public health. Prevention of trap seal failure depends upon both good design, to limit the air pressure transients propagated within the system, and good maintenance. However, current maintenance regimes rely solely on visual inspections which is time consuming and often impractical to implement in large complex buildings. This thesis documents the development of a novel approach to system maintenance whereby the threat of cross-contamination of disease is minimised by the remote monitoring of trap seal status. This was approached through the application and development of the reflected wave technique which is fundamentally based upon the characteristic reflection coefficients of system boundary conditions. An extensive programme of laboratory experiments and field trials were carried out to collect transient pressure data which, together with results from an existing mathematical model (AIRNET), developed by the Drainage Research Group at Heriot- Watt University, have been used to validate the proposed technique and to formulate a practical methodology which may be applied to any <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> Automatic system diagnosis, which would in the future allow the proposed technique to be integrated as an automated system test, was provided by the development of the trap condition evaluator (TRACER) program by this author. Incorporating a time series change detection algorithm, the TRACER program accurately detects and locates a depleted trap seal by automatically identifying the return time of the trap’s reflection. The reflected wave technique has been demonstrated as a successful approach to depleted trap identification provided that the wave propagation speed is known and the dampening influence of the junction effect (which can delay the observed reflection return time) are taken into account. The reflected wave technique offers a remote and non-invasive approach to maintaining the <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> and provides, for the first time, a diagnostic tool to help prevent cross-contamination.

40|$|A {{building}} drainage network {{is an essential}} provision of each developed city all over the world. The terminal velocity at discharging drainage stack is a crucial issue as it provides the permitted flow rate of a <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> The National Plumbing Code (NPC) of the US has specified the permitted flow rate for drainage systems. Mathematical expressions for terminal velocity were reported in research studies since the 1920 s but discrepancies among calculations remained. This study proposes an empirical approach in determining the terminal velocity in a drainage stack using the air pressure distribution mechanism. New experimental observations of the stack terminal velocity using a digital high-speed video camera were presented as a validation database. The proposed model was validated {{in terms of the}} measured terminal velocities and the locations of the maximum air pressure in a discharging stack at a steady water flow rate (1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0 and 4. 0 L/s). This article offers an empirical approach and validation for terminal velocity instead of using the existing deductive approach. Practical applications: This article proposes an empirical approach with experimental validation for terminal velocity at a drainage stack. New evidence presented would lead to a review of the terminal velocity in drainage stacks in future drainage network designs. Due to the importance of terminal velocity, it is anticipated that this result would be used to lead the new technical development of <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> List of symbols Qw Water flow rate (L/s,...|$|E

40|$|Drainage {{system is}} a basic and {{essential}} provision for all buildings. The maximum air pressure in a discharging drainage stack can deplete the appliance water trap seals that prevent the ingress of foul gases and odors into a habitable space. The control of air pressures in discharging drainage stacks {{has been identified as}} an important factor in ensuring the performance of a <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>system.</b> This study reports air pressure fluctuations at a stack at the lowest floor of a high-rise building induced by a consecutive operation of water closet flushes. Mathematical expressions proposed earlier for steady flow conditions are examined to correlate the maximum air pressure with the probability density function of the data measured. The average prediction of the absolute peak pressure is determined. The results showed that the maximum air pressure at the discharging stack with unsteady flows could be described by the probability density function of the measured data using earlier proposed mathematical expressions with a modified constant. Such outcome enhances the understanding of the characteristics of air pressure fluctuations at a drainage stack at lower floors of high-rise buildings and it is useful for further development of stochastic models for air pressure fluctuations at a drainage stack.

These field studies allow comparisons between the gas flow from the drainage system to the living accommodation, and confirm the hypothesized infection route. Finally, the authors make recommendations on the proper design and operation of high-rise building drainage systems. Practical application: Sanitary drainage systems form a critic al engineering component in maintaining hygienic conditions in buildings.

Experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out to study the wave attenuation in the following configurations encountered in drainage pipe systems: i) A simple pipe, ii) A pipe subject to one concentrated lateral inflow, iii) A pipe with gate fixed at the downstream section, generating an interaction between wave and backwater profiles. In the present study the Saint-Venant equations are derived in their general and characteristic forms. A number of numerical procedures for solution of the Saint-Venant equations are reviewed, and the rectangular grid characteristics method, diffusing scheme and Strelkoff's implicit method are chosen to solve the equations. The stability of the finite-difference methods used is investigated for free-outfall and controlled outfall boundary conditions. An experimental installation consisting of 0. 105 m diameter uPVC pipe is used to investigate the characteristics of the flow and to form test cases for the numerical methods. Comparisons between computed and observed depth hydrographs, peak depths and depth variations along the pipe are made for subcritical flow in a pipe of slope 1 / 300. The rectangular-grid characteristics method and the diffusing scheme are also applied to supercritical flow. Flow tests are undertaken for supercritical flow in a pipe of slope 1 / 200 to validate the use of these methods. The investigation revealed that the attenuation rate of peak depths is affected by the volume of the waves.

Regulatory documents exist {{to ensure that a}} <b>building's</b> roof <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> is adequate for the anticipated rainfall events experienced during the life of the building. Empirical observations that inform international design guidelines are largely attributable to a small number of investigative studies with a limited range of roof <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> configurations and flow conditions. This paper compares the observed hydraulic performance of a 600 mm wide, rectangular box gutter case study model under various flowrates to values predicted in the Australian, US and European standards. The study measured the depth of water at various locations in the box gutter over a range of flowrates from 3 L/s to 20 L/s to determine whether the gutter depths recommended by the various design guidelines were adequate. Four different gutter slopes (1 : 200; 1 : 150; 1 : 100; and 1 : 40) were tested in the study.

40|$|Fat, oil {{and grease}} (FOG) {{deposits}} {{are one of the}} leading causes of sewer system blockages, thereby increasing the risks of undesired and polluting flooding and sewer overflows. FOG accumulates throughout the entire sewer network; e. g., in public sewer pipes and lateral house connections it reduces the available discharge capacity, and in pump sumps it increases the risk of pump failures. Previous studies primarily focused on FOG deposits occurring in parts of sewer systems downstream of Food Service Establishments (FSE). It is thought, however, that domestic FOG disposal is also an important contributor to FOG deposits, and therefore warrants further investigation. Consequently, the objective of this research was to investigate the relationship between domestic FOG disposal patterns and the occurrence of FOG deposits in sewer systems. By considering both the household scale and the scale of catchments, it was possible to study the influence of individual and population disposal patterns. The first part of this study focused on the influence of individual disposal patterns; samples of FOG deposits were collected from clogged <b>building</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>systems</b> and questionnaires were conducted to reveal information about the household’s cooking and disposal habits. Only three out of the eleven households showed a link between the cooking fats and oils used and the FOG deposits collected, as their fatty acid profiles displayed similarities. The second part of this study focused on the influence of population disposal patterns on the occurrence of FOG deposits, by studying the severe accumulation of FOG at pumping stations in relation to catchment demographics and sewer system characteristics. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) procedures were used to model the probability of {{the presence or absence of}} FOG in pump sumps. The model revealed that severe accumulation of FOG in pump sumps was negatively correlated to the average income of inhabitants attached to the catchment, suggesting that individuals within an income-group shared FOG disposal patterns. Furthermore, FSE density and kinetic energy of wastewater per unit of volume per day were found to be important factors correlated with the occurrence of FOG deposits. The results provide important insights into factors that may influence the accumulation of FOG. Further research is required to obtain insights in how particular diets, cleaning habits and FOG disposal patterns may influence the accumulation of FOG.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{different}} types of repair methods for concrete slab on the ground damaged by moisture. Many of the available methods involve some kind of mechanical ventilation of the foundation. The basic principle for all these systems is the same. By establishing air movement through an air-permeable layer below or above the concrete slab, the flowing air can absorb moisture from surrounding materials. When the air has passed through the layer, it is transported out, and away from, the foundation. Three methods of this type have been examined by extensive field rneasurements in a few <b>buildings.</b> Improved <b>drainage</b> <b>system</b> constitute another type of repair method frequently used for Concrete slabs in the ground with moisture problems originating from the ground.

One of the models {{can also be used to}} predict moisture conditions in mechanically ventilated foundations. Superposition and scaling were applied in order to demonstrate a method of determining the temperature-distribution in a ventilated layer on the basis of diagrams and simple manual calculations...|$|R
50|$|When {{plans for}} {{construction}} {{were given the}} green light on the W.A.C. Bennett Dam (known as the Portage Mountain Dam during construction), clearing the soon to be reservoir {{was the first step}} in the process. It was a massive undertaking which was completed on the shoestring budget of five million dollars by the Forest Service Branch. The initial stages of construction required building a coffer dam, preparing the foundations and injecting grout into the ground to create a watertight seal, <b>building</b> a <b>drainage</b> <b>system,</b> and excavating to create a solid base for building. Over the course of construction 55 million cubic yards of rock and dirt were taken from the nearby glacial moraine by conveyor belt to create the dam relying primarily on gravity to hold it together. Upon completion, the W.A.C. Bennett Dam became one of the biggest earth filled dams in the world stretching 183 metres tall, 800 metres wide, by two kilometres long. When finished,the dam incorporated one of the largest hydroelectric generating stations. Components are located as far as 150 metres below ground and includes 10 generating units located deep underground in the powerhouse. The Main powerhouse structure is named the G.M. Shrum generating station. It was designed to resemble a giant transformer to reflect its function and modern design of the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|The last 15 {{years of}} {{research}} related to atmospheric corrosion {{and the release of}} copper to the environment are shortly summarized. Brown and green patinas with high barrier properties for corrosion are gradually evolved on copper at atmospheric conditions. The corrosion process and repeated dry and wet cycles results in a partial dissolution of corrosion products within the patina. Dissolved copper can be released and dispersed into the environment via the action of rainwater, however the major part is rearranged within the patina during drying cycles. The majority of corrosion products formed have a poor solubility, very different from water soluble copper salts. The release process is very slow and takes place independent of patina color. Its extent has only a marginal effect on the adherent patina. Released copper rapidly interacts with organic matter and in contact with different surfaces already in the close vicinity of the <b>building,</b> such as <b>drainage</b> <b>systems,</b> storm water pipes, pavements, stone materials and soil systems. These surfaces all have high capacities to retain copper in the runoff water and to reduce its concentration and chemical form to non-available and non-toxic levels for aquatic organisms...|$|R
