It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension <b>because</b> <b>now</b> the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Japanese, Okinawan, and Korean men {{traveled}} to Hawaii as cheap labor {{to work on}} the sugarcane plantations. Some continued on {{to work on the}} mainland. These men had originally planned to leave plantation work and go back home after a few years or a contract was up. Between the years of 1886 and 1924, 199,564 Japanese entered Hawaii and 113,362 returned to Japan. However, many men did not make enough money to go back home. Also, in 1907 the Gentlemen's Agreement prohibited immigration from Hawaii to the United States for laborers. <b>Because</b> <b>now</b> these men were put in situations with limited mobility, they had to make Hawaii or the United States their home, and part of that was getting married. In Hawaii, the plantation owners also wanted to see the laborers get married. Though they had originally preferred single men, when the contract labor system was abolished, the owners thought that wives would make the men more likely to settle down and stay. Also, the plantation owners hoped that wives would limit the amount of gambling and opium smoking the workers did, and act as a morale booster for the men.|$|E

It was a song he had been reluctant to record, for fear of committing himself publicly to such an overt religious message. [...] "I was sticking my neck out on the chopping block <b>because</b> <b>now</b> I would have {{to live up to}} something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but at the same time I thought 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1984, {{the film}} began {{production}} in Los Angeles. Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, {{the style of}} the film changed, explaining that [...] "the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do– scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> they were too flamboyant." [...] Most of The Terminators action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.|$|E

The adaptation was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Robert Schwentke, and stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. Filming began in September 2007 and the movie was released by Warner Bros. on 14 August 2009. When asked {{about the prospect of}} her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, [...] "I've got my little movie that runs in my head. And I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by what somebody else might do with it. And it is sort of thrilling and creepy, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> the characters have an existence apart from me." [...] In general, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews. [...] For example, The New York Times wrote that the film was an [...] "often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation".|$|E
500|$|Again appealed, {{the case}} came before a 5-judge {{panel of the}} House of Lords. They {{initially}} agreed with the Court of Appeal by a 4–1 majority. At {{the end of the}} preliminary hearing, the judges became aware that, during the Finance Act's committee stage, Financial Secretary to the Treasury Robert Sheldon remarked (in response to a question about places for the children of teachers at fee-paying schools) [...] "The removal of clause 54(4) will affect the position of a child of one of the teachers at the child's school <b>because</b> <b>now</b> the benefit will be assessed on the cost to the employer, which would be very small indeed in this case", implying that the [...] "expense" [...] is meant to be the cost to the school, not the average cost of having a pupil there. As a result of this discovery, the House of Lords chose to reconvene as a 7-judge panel, consisting of Lord Mackay, Lord Keith, Lord Bridge, Lord Griffiths, Lord Ackner, Lord Oliver and Lord Browne-Wilkinson.|$|E
500|$|The {{announcement}} of Sega's third-party transition {{was met with}} widespread enthusiasm.

[...] The staff of Newsweek remarked [...] "From Sonic to Shenmue, Sega's programmers have produced some of the most engaging experiences in the history of interactive media... Unshackled by a struggling console platform, this platoon of world-class software developers can do what they do best for any machine on the market". Rosen predicted [...] "they have the potential to catch Electronic Arts". Game Informer, commenting on Sega's tendency to produce under-appreciated cult classics, stated: [...] "Let us rejoice in the fact that Sega is making games equally among the current console crop, so that history will not repeat itself." ...|$|E

The Daily Telegraph commented [...] "Britney – presumably {{with the help}} of some serious digital remastering – has turned back the clock, looking every part the young starlet that gave us 'Oops'". Dose said [...] "shockingly, it's not that bad. Well, not that bad for everyone's favourite panty protesting, deposition skipping, weave wearing pop-tard". On August 17, 2008, it was announced that the video was nominated for Best Female Video, Best Pop Video and Video of the Year at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. The ceremony was held on September 7, 2008, and Spears won all three categories. On October 18, 2008, during a live interview with New York's Z100, she explained that she was shocked when she won, saying, [...] "It's a cool video, but I think by far I've done videos that are way better, so I was really shocked that it got [...] It was just inspiring, though, <b>because</b> <b>now,</b> going forward with the videos that I'm doing now, I can really go there and do something crazy and see what happens".|$|E
500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> she is smarter." ...|$|E

Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked {{together}} {{it was my first}} film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." [...] Ford said of Scott in 2000: [...] "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." [...] In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: [...] "What I remember more than anything else when I see Blade Runner is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." [...] Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of Total Film that Harrison Ford contributed to the Blade Runner Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, <b>because</b> <b>now</b> that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
