In this paper, a theoretical model based on mass balance and thermodynamic laws has been developed to study dynamic fast filling process of CNG <b>storage</b> <b>bank</b> to vehicle's (NGV) cylinder.

For modeling the heat transfer, the system has been treated as an adiabatic lump one. The result shows the initial pressure of <b>storage</b> <b>bank</b> has a big effect on the <b>storage</b> <b>bank</b> volume for bringing up the NGV cylinder to its target pressure (20 MPa).

For practical reasons, the leakage boundary condition is preferred. A linear leakage function represents the <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> process for the analyzed event sufficiently.

Analytical models {{have been widely used}} to estimate the impacts of <b>bank</b> <b>storage,</b> but are often based on assumptions of conditions that are rarely found in the field, such as vertical river banks and saturated flow. Numerical simulations of <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> and return flow in river-aquifer cross sections with vertical and sloping banks were undertaken using a fully-coupled, surface-subsurface flow model. Sloping river banks were found to increase the bank infiltration rates by 98 % and storage volume by 40 % for a bank slope of 3. 4 ° from horizontal, and for a slope of 8. 5 °, delay bank return flow by more than four times compared with vertical river banks and saturated flow. The results suggested that conventional analytical approximations cannot adequately be used to quantify <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> when bank slope is less than 60 ° from horizontal. Additionally, in the unconfined aquifers modeled, the analytical solutions did not accurately model <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> and return flow even in rivers with vertical banks due to a violation of the dupuit assumption. <b>Bank</b> <b>storage</b> and return flow were also modeled for more realistic cross sections and river hydrograph from the Fitzroy River, Western Australia, to indicate the importance of accurately modeling sloping river banks at a field scale.

40|$|Groundwater {{and surface}} water are often studied as {{different}} system; however, one commonly affects the other through various scenarios. <b>Bank</b> <b>storage</b> {{is an important}} hydrogeological process, which involves the temporary storage and release of stream water in adjacent aquifers. <b>Bank</b> <b>storage</b> can contribute {{a considerable amount of}} discharge to a river and can be an important process for movement of contamination downstream. Several studies document the effects of increasing stage and increasing storm duration; however, these controls are often separated. This project examines peak stage and storm duration to determine which factor is statistically more influential on the bank-storage process. The study focuses on a small reach of Little Kickapoo Creek, a third-order, perennial stream located in central Illinois. A 3 -D, transient-state numerical model (MODFLOW) was created of the study site, and 36 simulations were ran at various peak stages and storm durations. Results illustrate that peak stage and storm durations, while both influential, affect different areas of the bank-storage process. However, peak stage is statistically more influential in controlling the maximum volume of <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> (~ 3. 6 x) that occurs in the system and of the storage that remains in the system at 100 hours (~ 1. 1 x). While statistically less influential in determining storage remaining at 100 hours, increasing storm duration appears to be more effective on the retention of <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> Parafluvial exchange is important for evaluating <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> along a meandering stream, suggesting that at least 2 -D, ideally 3 -D, models are used to evaluate <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> Lastly, this study recognizes that <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> is the mechanism for road salt storage along the stream during winter months and the subsequent flushing of the chlorides back to the stream during the summer months...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of major hydrogeological {{controls}} on hyporheic exchange and <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> is essential for river water management, groundwater abstraction, restoration and ecosystem sustainability. Analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundary conditions, varying geometry of surface water–groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. To understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) <b>bank</b> <b>storage,</b> (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2 -D hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. The numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower-regulated Lule River, northern Sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long-lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. Modelling results revealed that <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. When a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river–aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> The presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity − 1 significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> The <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> return/fill time ratio {{was positively related to}} wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. Discharge oscillations with short duration and small amplitude decreased <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish-spawning locations. Based on these results, river regulation strategies can be improved by considering the effect of certain wave event configurations on hyporheic exchange to ensure harmonious hydrogeochemical functioning of the river–aquifer interfaces and related ecosystems...|$|E

During high streamflow in May 1990, alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, and metolachlor were detected at concentrations above background as distant as 20, 50, 10, and 20 m from the river’s edge, respectively.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} framework for describing, a process for identifying, and a model for evaluating misalignments in the supply chain when varying elements such as structure, processes, and management components. The developed approach {{makes it possible to}} address and improve the alignment of supply chain structures, processes, and management components. To further increase knowledge of how to improve the alignment in supply chains, two specific models were developed for choosing contract types and governance structures in the trucking service supply chain including shipper, forwarders, and carriers. These models extend the first approach with detailed insights {{that can be used to}} align incentives in the trucking service supply chain, which contributes to the overall research purpose. When studying the Swedish cash supply chain and its structure, processes, and management components, particular focus was directed on three major design changes: centralization of central <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> facilities, eliminating returns to central <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> facilities, and providing interest compensation at depots. By analyzing these changes using a network flow model, results showed that centralization from two to one central <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> facility led to unintended increases in transportation costs and risk, while eliminating returns to central <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> facilities led to increased transportation flow, larger shipment sizes, and larger risk, but reduced transportation costs. Furthermore, results showed that providing interest compensation to private depots led to reduced transportation costs as well as risk. From studying a trucking service supply chain, a performance-based contract type was found to align incentives between a large Swedish grocery retailer and its forwarders by relieving the forwarders of coordination responsibility. This meant that they could improve trucking cost utilization and thereby reduce their price to the shipper, and still improve their profitability. Further, a cooperative governance structure utilizing a profit-sharing mechanism was found to align incentives between forwarders and carriers, which meant increased service frequency, reduced service price, and increased chain profit...|$|E
40|$|Bank {{exchange}} processes within 50 m of the Tambo River, southeast Australia, {{have been}} investigated through the combined use of 3 H and 14 C. Groundwater residence times increase towards the Tambo River, which suggests the absence of significant <b>bank</b> <b>storage.</b> Major ion concentrations and δ 2 H and δ 18 O values of bank water also indicate that bank infiltration does not significantly impact groundwater chemistry under baseflow and post-flood conditions, suggesting that the gaining nature of the river may be driving the return of <b>bank</b> <b>storage</b> water back into the Tambo River within days of peak flood conditions. The covariance between 3 H and 14 C indicates the leakage and mixing between old (~ 17 200 years) groundwater from a semi-confined aquifer and younger groundwater (< 100 years) near the river, where confining layers are less prevalent. It {{is likely that the}} upward infiltration of deeper groundwater from the semi-confined aquifer during flooding limits bank infiltration. Furthermore, the more saline deeper groundwater likely controls the geochemistry of water in the river bank, minimising the chemical impact that bank infiltration has in this setting.

40|$|<b>Bank</b> <b>storage</b> {{is defined}} as a volume of water that {{periodically}} infiltrates a river's banks during increases in stream stage. It is a potentially critical variable for accurately modeling the water budget in semi-arid riparian systems, but is particularly difficult to assess and quantify. It is especially essential for understanding ground-water/surface-water interactions. In collaboration with other projects, a field-scale vadose monitoring effort took place in the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (SPRNCA), Arizona. The San Pedro River flows north from Mexico into the United States, and SPRNCA is a 60 km stretch of U. S. -protected ecosystem north of the border. In addition to a progressive climate of ecological conservation, hydrological research that leads to an improved understanding of the water budget will ultimately improve the prospects for improved water policy decisions. Soil moisture, stream stage, and soil tension data were collected for over 8 consecutive months in both 1997 and 1998, and the data were used as input into a software program called HYDRUS- 2 D (§imiinek et al. 1996), which models two-dimensional, variably saturated flow.
