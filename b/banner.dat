5|$|As the {{personal}} <b>banner</b> of the Sovereign, {{use of the}} Royal <b>Banner</b> of Scotland is restricted under the Act of the Parliament of Scotland 1672 cap. 47 and 30 & 31 Vict. cap. 17, and any unauthorised use of such is an offence under the Act. In 1978 a St Albans linen merchant, Denis Pamphilon, was fined £100 daily for usurpation of the <b>banner</b> on decorative bedspreads until he desisted, and both Rangers F.C. and the Scottish National Party have been admonished by the Court of the Lord Lyon for their improper and non-authorised use of the <b>banner.</b> Despite such action, the flag continues to feature {{on a variety of}} merchandise and souvenirs produced commercially for Scotland's economically important tourism industry.|$|E
5|$|Derived {{from early}} Slavic flag-like objects, a royal <b>banner</b> of arms dates {{as far back}} as the 11th century CE. A symbol of royal authority, it was used at coronations and in battles. In the interwar period, it was {{replaced}} with the <b>Banner</b> of the Republic of Poland, which was part of the presidential insignia. A national <b>banner</b> is not mentioned in the current (2007) regulations on Polish national symbols, although today's presidential jack is based directly on the pre-war design for the <b>Banner</b> of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), a <b>banner</b> of the Commonwealth was also used, {{combining}} the heraldic symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Commonwealth <b>banner</b> was initially plain white emblazoned with {{the arms of the}} Commonwealth which consisted of the heraldic charges of Poland (White Eagle) and Lithuania (Pursuer). Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white (Argent) charges in a red (Gules) field, these two colors started to be used for the entire <b>banner.</b> During the 17th century, the <b>banner</b> was usually divided into two, three or four horizontal, often swallow-tailed, stripes of red and white.|$|E
50|$|Vinyl <b>banners</b> {{have many}} uses and applications. They {{are most often}} used to promote a company's logo, a special promotion, event, team or school. Since vinyl is a very {{flexible}} as well as portable material you can see vinyl <b>banners</b> just about anywhere. Vinyl <b>banners</b> are commonly seen as billboards, table <b>banners,</b> trade show <b>banners,</b> building <b>banners,</b> street <b>banners,</b> festival <b>banners,</b> as well as stadium flags.|$|R
50|$|Sports fans often buy or make <b>banners</b> {{to display}} in the grandstands. Team <b>banners</b> {{typically}} contain the logo, name or nickname, motto and the team colors. <b>Banners</b> on individual competitors can contain a picture or drawing of the player. Sports <b>banners</b> may also honor notable players or hall-of-fame athletes and commemorate past championships won. These types of sports <b>banners</b> are typically hung from rafters in stadiums. The Miami Heat, an NBA Team, hangs division titles and championship <b>banners</b> {{at the top of}} the rafters in their home stadium, American Airlines Arena. Similar to other sports <b>banners,</b> they feature the color palette of the team's logo, the logo, names of players, and championship winning years.|$|R

5|$|Morenz's {{daughter}} Marlene married Bernie Geoffrion, {{who also}} {{played for the}} Canadiens and Rangers, and was later inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. When the Canadiens retired Geoffrion's number {{on the night of}} his death on March 11, 2006, the team recognized the link between the two men. As Geoffrion's <b>banner</b> was being raised to the rafters, Morenz' <b>banner</b> was lowered halfway to the ice. Once Geoffrion's <b>banner</b> reached Morenz' <b>banner,</b> the two were raised together.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1620s, the Jurchens started {{incorporating}} Mongol tribes, which they either conquered or were allied with, into the Eight <b>Banners</b> system. The Han Chinese who first joined the Eight <b>Banners</b> were replacements for Jurchen soldiers in existing <b>banners</b> {{who were killed in}} battle. However, over time, as more Han soldiers joined the <b>banners,</b> the Jurchens decided to form a separate group for them. This group, known as the [...] "Old Han Army" [...] (...) , was mainly used as infantry support. In 1631, a separate Han artillery corps was formed. Four more Han <b>banners</b> were created in 1639. By 1642, the full eight Han <b>banners</b> were established.|$|R
50|$|In 1642, the Manchu <b>banners</b> ejected their Han {{companies}} {{and placed them}} in Han <b>banners,</b> since the members were mostly not assimilated to Manchu culture. However, the <b>banners</b> continued to contain mixed units of both Han and Manchu.|$|R
5|$|When the Royal Arms are in {{the format}} of an heraldic flag, it is {{variously}} known as the Royal <b>Banner</b> of England, the <b>Banner</b> of the Royal Arms, the <b>Banner</b> of the King (Queen) of England, or by the misnomer the Royal Standard of England. This Royal <b>Banner</b> differs from England's national flag, the St George's Cross, in {{that it does not}} represent any particular area or land, but rather symbolises the sovereignty vested in the rulers thereof.|$|E

At Bell Centre, as had the Forum, only Stanley Cup championship <b>banners</b> are raised to the rafters.|$|R

2500|$|The only {{championship}} <b>banners</b> {{that are}} currently displayed within the building are for national or NCAA Championships. Unlike most schools, there are neither conference championship <b>banners</b> nor other tournament championship <b>banners</b> displayed in the building, despite the fact UCLA teams have won many tournaments and basketball championships in the Pac-12 Conference and its predecessor conferences. Former Bruin point guard, New Jersey Nets, LA native and former Los Angeles Laker player Jordan Farmar described the rationale for this during the Bruins' 2005 Final Four run, by stating, [...] "t UCLA, only national championship <b>banners</b> go up." [...] The men's <b>banners</b> are blue with gold lettering, while the women's <b>banners</b> are gold with blue lettering.|$|R

50|$|<b>Banners</b> {{in churches}} have, in the past, been used mainly for processions, {{both inside and}} outside of the church building.
