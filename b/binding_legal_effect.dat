5000|$|... 36 According to {{consistent}} case-law, {{developed in}} the context of actions for annulment brought by Member States or institutions, any measures adopted by the institutions, whatever their form, which are intended to have <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> are regarded as acts open to challenge, within the meaning of Article 263 TFEU .... The case-law further shows that a Member State, such as the applicant in Case C‑475/10 P, may admissibly bring an action for annulment of a measure producing <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> without having to demonstrate that it has an interest in bringing proceedings....37 Where the action for annulment against an act adopted by an institution is brought by a natural or legal person, the Court of Justice had repeatedly held that the action lies only if the <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> of that act are capable of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position (see, in particular, IBM v Commission, paragraph 9; Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, paragraph 29; Case C‑322/09 P NDSHT v Commission 2010 ECR I-0000, paragraph 45).38 It must, however, be emphasised that the case-law cited in the paragraph above was {{developed in the}} context of actions brought before the EU judicature by natural or legal persons against measures of which they were the addressees. Where, as in the case giving rise to the order in Deutsche Post v Commission, an action for annulment is brought by a non-privileged applicant against a measure that has not been addressed to it, the requirement that the <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> of the measure being challenged must be capable of affecting the interests of the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position overlaps with the conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU....45 It follows from the above that a decision taken pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 is intended to produce <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> within the meaning of the case-law cited in paragraph 36 of this judgment, and therefore constitutes an act open to challenge for the purposes of Article 263 TFEU....53 Next, the case-law shows that an intermediate measure is also not capable of forming the subject-matter of an action if it is established that the illegality attaching to that measure can be relied on in support of an action against the final decision for which it represents a preparatory step. In such circumstances, the action brought against the decision terminating the procedure will provide sufficient judicial protection (IBM v Commission, paragraph 12; Case 53/85 AKZO Chemie and AKZO Chemie UK v Commission 1986 ECR 1965, paragraph 19; Case C-400/99 Italy v Commission 2001 ECR I 7303, paragraph 63).54 However, if that latter condition is not satisfied, it will be considered that the intermediate measure - independently of whether the latter expresses a provisional opinion of the institution concerned - produces independent <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> and must therefore be capable of forming the subject-matter of an action for annulment....55 in this case, it must be held that an information under Article 10(3) of Regulation No 659/1999 produces independent legal effects....71 As for whether Deutsche Post is individually concerned by the act at issue, it should be recalled that, according to consistent case-law of the Court of Justice, persons other than those to whom a decision is addressed may claim to be individually concerned only if that decision affects them by reason of certain attributes which are peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons and, by virtue of those factors, distinguishes them individually just {{as in the case of}} the person addressed....73 in that respect, it should be noted that the fact that the act at issue is not addressed to Deutsche Post is irrelevant for assessing whether that undertaking is individually concerned by that measure, for the purposes of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU.74 Next, it must be noted that the information injunction refers to a procedure for examining a State aid measure from which Deutsche Post is alleged to have benefited. The information concerned by the act at issue concern only Deutsche Post. The latter is thus individually concerned by that measure for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph 71 of this judgment.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{regulation}} of sustainable development on international level. The sustainable development was defined in the middle of 1980 s and from that moment it incites discussions among lawyers about its relevance in international law. Some authors state that it is not a fully formed principle but that it is in the process of creation. The exception from this opinion is the position of the Judge Weeramantry in the Case Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros before the International Court of Justice. Since it is a principle, it does not contain clearly defined rights and duties but it is formulated generally and even vague regarding its <b>legal</b> <b>effects.</b> However, it is a legal principle which, contrary to moral or political principles, has <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effects</b> and cannot be neglected. It is contained in several international treaties and it is also a part of the European Union Law.

50|$|Originally put on {{the ballot}} by the state legislature, Proposition 49 would have been {{non-binding}} advisory question presented to voters, asking if the U.S. Congress should propose {{an amendment to the}} U.S. Constitution to overturn the U.S. Supreme Courts 2010 ruling in Citizens United v.

40|$|Beginning in 1994, {{international}} conventions {{such as the}} Convention on Biological Diversity have increasingly encouraged the use of collaborative processes {{at the local level}} to manage and protect community resources. Participation on the part of women in particular, in such decision making processes has been advanced and supported by the International Conference on Population and Development (1994), the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995), the World Summit on Sustainable Development (2002), and the 2005 World Summit. While such {{international conventions}} do not have <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effect,</b> such instruments provide a moral force acknowledging the pivotal role women play in sustainable development and decision making at the grass roots. Such processes involve stakeholders from {{the public and private sectors}} who consult together in order to arrive at shared goals regarding resource use and planning. While much scholarship has focused on the requirements and parameters of such participatory decision making processes, little systematic attention has been given to the question of how capacities for genuine participation in local decision making, consultation and collaboration are developed, and the important role of scientific understanding and empowerment in this process. This paper will explore this question through a participatory research approach...|$|E
40|$|Against {{a common}} {{perception}} of CSR being a business concept without <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effect,</b> {{this article discusses}} legitimate legal effects of private standards in public international law, using the issue of private labels as “international standards” under WTO law. WTO law shows certain openness for external transnational standards. This article argues that the references to “international standards” in the TBT Agreement can be applied for the selection between competing public or private norms that claim relevance. Thereby, the most legitimate standard for governing the problem at issue should be chosen. This is exemplified with the case of Tuna Dolphin II where the Appellate Body has emphasised the requirement of procedural legitimacy. The article argues that the requirements for legitimate standards depend on the interests at stake and that a private standard can well be more legitimate than a (competing) public standard. As the justifying effect of Article 2. 5 TBT mainly interferes with economic interests, a relevant “international standard” may well consist of a representative business standard, e. g. a private label. In contrast, an international standard {{in the terms of}} Article 2. 4 TBT which interferes with a democratic decision in favour of public interests such as environmental protection must reflect these public interests in a legitimate way. The article concludes that CSR can {{play an important role in}} defining legally valid justifying or minimum standards in public international law...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} fundamental rights and economic freedoms {{in the light of}} Article 6 TEU, in particular after the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union was given <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effect</b> equal to the one of the Treaties. The author underlines the fact that striking a balance between economic freedoms and fundamental rights is not a recent development in European Union law; on the contrary, such a delicate question is often raised before the European Court of Justice since its earliest decisions. Never the less, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, by recognizing the importance of non-economic values in the European Union, may suggest new solutions to old problems. The author distinguishes between two categories of ECJ decisions: in the first one, the protection of fundamental rights prevails over measures which are adopted by Member States and are in breach of the economic freedoms granted by the Treaties (ERT, Carpenter); on the other hand, the protection of fundamental rights is used ’as a shield’ by Member States, in order to justify restrictions to the economic freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty (Omega). Furthermore, this paper also points out that the search for a balance between economic freedoms and fundamental rights is crucial not only in the provisions of the Treaties themselves and in the decisions of the Court, but also in the process of adoption of secondary European law. Some examples are given by reference to directives adopted in different sectors falling under the competence of the E...|$|E
40|$|Federal courts disfavor {{granting}} collateral {{relief from}} final criminal judgments. This mentality is premised on {{a need for}} finality in the criminal process; the idea that, at some point, a criminal case must come to an end. Post-conviction relief is available, however, where an error in the trial court causes a miscarriage of justice that must be remedied to preserve {{the integrity of the}} criminal justice system. For example, the Seventh Circuit has granted post-conviction relief where the sentencing court miscalculated the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s prison sentence by misapplying the career offender-sentencing enhancement under the then-binding Federal Sentencing Guidelines. However, the court has declined to extend this holding to allow similar relief where the defendant was sentenced under the 2 ̆ 2 merely advisory 2 ̆ 2 Sentencing Guidelines. According to the Seventh Circuit, this sentencing error is less serious where the judge is not bound to impose a sentence within the miscalculated sentencing range, and does not give rise to a miscarriage of justice that can be remedied through post-conviction relief. In Peugh v. United States, the Supreme Court held that a misapplication of advisory Sentencing Guidelines could violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. Despite the Court 2 ̆ 7 s recognition that, while the advisory Guidelines are no longer binding on sentencing judges, the Guidelines still achieve 2 ̆ 2 <b>binding</b> <b>legal</b> <b>effect,</b> 2 ̆ 2 the Seventh Circuit, in Hawkins v.
