5|$|After Sophie's funeral Anton reveals to Emiko {{the extent}} to which he had been {{involved}} in Emiko's life. He first met her while volunteering at the hospital in which her grandfather was working. Feeling he had to make amends in some way, he ensured that Emiko was on the list of girls to get reconstructive surgery, and secretly filmed her at memorial events. He had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for her to find him.|$|E

5000|$|Circular wait: {{each process}} must <b>be</b> <b>waiting</b> for a {{resource}} {{which is being}} held by another process, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> for the first process to release the resource. In general, there {{is a set of}} waiting processes, P = {P1, P2, …, PN}, such that P1 <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> for a resource held by P2, P2 <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> for a resource held by P3 and so on until PN <b>is</b> <b>waiting</b> for a resource held by P1.|$|R
5000|$|These murals, {{of groups}} {{of men in}} various postures of waiting, {{reference}} photographs from Alexia Webster’s photographic series, Waiting for Work. The works imply different kinds of waiting particular to a contemporary South African context. As Faith47 told Wooster Collective, “Miners <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for justice. Workers <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for a living wage. People <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for service delivery. Refugees <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for assistance. Men <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for jobs. We <b>are</b> all <b>waiting</b> for an honest politician. So many people <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> for others to do things first. To take the blame. To do things for them. To take the fall. To build the country. To admit defeat. There has <b>been</b> so much <b>waiting</b> {{in this country that}} much time has been lost.” ...|$|R
5|$|In the video, Selena {{is sitting}} in a {{restaurant}} where a mariachi band is performing. A waiter offers her a glass of water. As the singer enjoys her dinner, the waiter returns with a note saying that her lover (for whom she has <b>been</b> <b>waiting)</b> has left her for another woman. Selena takes a sip of water before she leaves the restaurant, crying.|$|E
5|$|Men, I know you’ve all <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> {{to learn}} what this cruise is about, and why we’re still headed southeast. Now, at last, I {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners have dreamed of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
5|$|The story {{also reveals}} that Batman kept {{the photos of}} Barbara and Booster, and had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> until Booster came of age before confronting him. Batman thanks Booster for {{trying to stop the}} Joker and offers him his friendship.

5|$|After Whitlam left, Kerr {{called in}} Fraser, {{informed}} {{him of the}} dismissal, {{and asked if he}} would form a caretaker government, to which Fraser agreed. Fraser later stated that his overwhelming sensation at the news was relief. Fraser left to return to Parliament House, where he conferred with Coalition leaders, while Kerr joined the luncheon party that had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for him, apologising to his guests and offering the excuse that he had been busy dismissing the Government.|$|E
5|$|Antony's fleet {{sailed through}} {{the bay of}} Actium on the western coast of Greece {{in a desperate attempt}} to break free of the naval blockade. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and Gaius Sosius in the battle of Actium on 2 September 31BC. Antony and his {{remaining}} forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> nearby.|$|E
5|$|Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet {{beginning}} to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to detach several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys. This presented to Admiral Scheer {{the opportunity for}} which he had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Manga-News {{reviewed}} the story arc positively. They praised {{several aspects of}} the story arc: the plot and narration for being captivating and for including famous London settings, references to Sherlock Holmes, and the Wimbledon competition; the characterization for the antagonist Sabara Hades; and the romance between Shinichi and Ran which was described as an event readers had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for. Manga-News however criticized how Shinichi and Ran's interaction were covered by flashbacks instead of happening chronologically. AnimeLand reviewed volume 71 and called it the best since volume 59.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} the whales to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> on shore have slaughtered all the whales.|$|E
5|$|The paralyzed Hamilton, {{who knew}} {{himself to be}} mortally wounded, was ferried to the Greenwich Village home of his friend William Bayard Jr., who had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> on the dock. After final visits from {{his family and friends}} and {{considerable}} suffering, Hamilton died at two o'clock the following afternoon, July 12, 1804, at Bayard's home at what is now 80–82 Jane Street. Gouverneur Morris gave the eulogy at his funeral and secretly established a fund to support his widow and children. Hamilton was buried in the Trinity Churchyard Cemetery in Manhattan.|$|E

5|$|After the American {{defeat at}} the Battle of Queenston Heights, {{command of the}} U.S. Army of the Centre on the Niagara Frontier passed from Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer of the New York Militia to his second-in-command, Brigadier General Alexander Smyth of the Regular U.S. Army. Smyth had deeply resented being subordinated to a militia officer {{and this was the}} {{opportunity}} for which he had <b>been</b> <b>waiting.</b> He immediately planned to invade Canada with 3,000 troops. Assembling his forces at Buffalo, he directed a two-pronged attack in advance of his main invasion. Captain William King, with 220 men, was to cross the Niagara and spike the batteries at the Red House, beside Fort Erie, in order to enable Smyth’s main invasion force to land without facing artillery fire. At the same time, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Boerstler, with 200 men, was to land in Canada between Fort Erie and Chippawa and destroy the bridge over Frenchman’s Creek in order to hinder the bringing-up of British reinforcements to oppose Smyth's landing.|$|E
5|$|An Assembly of Notables (the members {{consisted}} of magistrates, mayors, nobles and clergy) was convened in February 1787 {{to ratify the}} financial reforms sought by the Controller-General of Finance Charles Alexandre de Calonne. This provided the Count of Provence, who abhorred the radical reforms proposed by Calonne, the opportunity he had long <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for to establish himself in politics. The reforms proposed a new property tax, and new elected provincial assemblies {{that would have a}} say in local taxation. Calonne's proposition was rejected outright by the notables, and, as a result, Louis XVI dismissed him. The Archbishop of Toulouse, Étienne Charles de Loménie de Brienne, acquired Calonne's ministry. Brienne attempted to salvage Calonne's reforms, but ultimately failed to convince the notables to approve them. A frustrated Louis XVI dissolved the assembly.|$|E

At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet left harbor with the intention of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys. Wireless radio traffic was kept to a minimum to prevent the British from learning of the operation. By 14:10, the convoy had still not yet been located, and so Scheer turned the High Seas Fleet back towards German waters.|$|E

5|$|Including {{the victory}} over Leeds in 1975, Bayern Munich {{had won the}} European Cup on three {{occasions}} going into the 1999 final. With three victories in a row from 1974 to 1976, they became only the third team to achieve such a feat after Real Madrid (1956 to 1960) and Ajax (1971 to 1973). They had also finished as runners-up twice: in 1982 against Aston Villa and 1987 against Porto. Although Bayern had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> 23 years for a European Cup title, Manchester United had had to wait even longer, their only victory having come in 1968. Their manager then was Matt Busby, who had been seriously injured in the Munich air disaster, which killed eight of his players {{on the way back}} from a European Cup tie in Belgrade 10 years earlier, before rebuilding the team to become European Cup winners. Busby died in 1994; the day of the 1999 Champions League final would have been his 90th birthday.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal had <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that {{she did not want to}} wait any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
