25|$|The {{earliest}} documented European {{settlement of}} the present Lakewood area was by operators of sawmills, from about 1750 forward. One such sawmill – located at {{the east end of}} the present Lake Carasaljo – was known as Three Partners Mill from at least 1789 until at least 1814. From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-smelting operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ore.</b> The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.|$|E

50|$|Vivianite is a {{secondary}} mineral {{found in a}} number of geologic environments: The oxidation zone of metal ore deposits, in granite pegmatites containing phosphate minerals, in clays and glauconitic sediments, and in recent alluvial deposits replacing organic material such as peat, lignite, <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> and forest soils (All). Bones and teeth buried in peat bogs are sometimes replaced by vivianite. Some authors say that it is particularly associated with gossan, but this is disputed by Petrov.Associated minerals include metavivianite, ludlamite, pyrite, siderite and pyrrhotite. Hydrothermal veins produce the best crystal specimens with the classic gemmy green color.|$|R
40|$|Most of the Netherlands a Quaternary delta, local {{supplies}} {{of natural stone}} suitable for building are rare. These include: Quaternary <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> used in early medieval times (until c. 1200); erratics, deposited in boulder clay during the Saalian ice age in the northern Netherlands and gravel from the river Meuse; Miocene lithified siliceous sands, Nivelstein sandstone, used in 11 th- 12 th century building {{and again in the}} early 20 th century; and Maastrichtian deposits {{in the southern part of}} Limburg province. These provide the major supply of Dutch natural stone: A chalky limestone, mergel, used since Roman times, but in the 16 th century also as far north as the central Netherlands. Maastrichtian cherts have been used very locally. Maastrichtian Kunrade limestone was also used locally and, to limited extent, outside the province of Limburg. Finally, Upper Carboniferous sandstones from the Geulle valley were used locally, mainly for farm houses. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
50|$|Goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide {{containing}} ferric iron. It is {{the main}} component of rust and <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ore.</b> Goethite's hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale, and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3. The mineral forms prismatic needle-like crystals ("needle iron ore"), but is more typically massive.|$|E
50|$|Iron {{production}} in the 1700s was done with charcoal, of which American forests could provide a seemingly endless supply. Numerous small iron mines supplied iron furnaces scattered throughout the colonies in the 1700s. <b>Bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> common around the Chesapeake Bay fed numerous iron furnaces in Maryland and Virginia set up to export to Britain.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} the geogenic source for elevated arsenic (As) concentrations recently discovered in soils of the Heubach plain, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Therefore, a catalogue of conditions that an As source has to fulfil in order to be considered as geogenic was formulated, including the source's linkage to the sink, its mineralogy, As total content, As mobilization potential, groundwater redox conditions and As output. Accordingly, mineralogical, geo- and hydrochemical investigations were carried out, including X-ray diffractometry, microscopy, ICP-OES and AAS analysis and a sequential extraction procedure. Paleo <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> (PBIOs) of Tertiary age, occurring within unconsolidated sands (Haltern-layers, Santonian-Lower Campanian), and glauconitic marlstones (Dülmen-layers, Lower Campanian) were examined. Results indicate that output from the PBIOs is responsible for the elevated As levels. Accounting their diverse mineralogy, five types of PBIOs were defined. Type-dependent, they at least partly fulfil all of the formulated requirements. The relations and behaviour of As sources and sinks in space and time could be clarified for the area of interest. The approach presented in this paper may offer a tool for identifying natural As sources worldwide. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|After carbon, {{phosphorus}} is {{the most}} commonly detected element in archaeological iron. The typical phosphoric iron range is 0. 1 wt% to 1 wt%P. The predominant source of phosphorus in <b>iron</b> is the <b>ore</b> smelted. Around 60 % of economic UK rock <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> formations contain over 0. 2 %P. Under fully reducing conditions, both in liquid-state (cast iron) and solid-state bloomery smelting (direct reduction) processes, such rock ores would be predicted to produce phosphoric <b>iron,</b> and <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> even more so. Ore-metal-slag phosphorus ratios for bloomery iron are derived here, by means of: laboratory experiments; full-scale experimental bloomery smelting; and analysis of remains from three Medieval and two Late Roman-Iron Age iron production sites in England and the Netherlands. Archaeological ore, slag, metal residues (gromps), and iron artefacts were analysed by metallography, SEM-EDS, EPMA, and XRD. The effects of forging and carburising on phosphoric iron were studied by experiment and artefact analysis. The ore to slag %P ratio for solid-state reduction was determined to range from 1 : 1. 2 to 1 : 1. 8. The ore to metal %P ratio varied from 1 : 0. 2 to 1 : 0. 7 - 1. 4, depending on furnace operating conditions. Archaeological phosphoric iron and steel microstructures resulting from non-equilibrium reduction, heat treatment, and mechanical processing are presented to define the technology of early phosphoric iron. Microstructures were identified {{by a combination of}} metallography and chemical analysis. The phosphoric iron artefacts examined appear to be fully functional objects, some cold-worked and carburised. Modern concepts of 'quality' and workability are shown to be inapplicable to the archaeological material. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The core of the industry is its sawmill, supporting a broadbase plywood industry with a plant called Zakłady Przemysłu Sklejek.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iron</b> {{smelting}} from <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> {{was invented}} during the Pre-Roman Iron Age, and most Viking era iron was smelted from <b>bog</b> <b>iron.</b> The <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> deposits of Northern and Northeastern Europe were created after the Ice Age ended, on postglacial plains. The dominant source of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> in Scandinavia and Russia into the Middle Ages was bog-ore. Even after improved smelting technology made mined ores viable during the Middle Ages, bog ore remained important, particularly to peasant iron production, into modern times. In Russia, bog ore {{was the principal}} source of iron until the 16th century, when the superior ores of Ural Mountains became available.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the colonial}} era, the Pine Barrens was the {{location}} of various industries. <b>Bog</b> <b>iron</b> was mined from bogs, streams, and waterways, and was worked in furnaces at Batsto, Lake Atsion, Ferrago, Hanover, and several other locations. Iron from these early furnaces was instrumental in supplying the American military with weapons and camp tools during the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Second Barbary War. For example, Commodore Stephen Decatur, Jr. sailed to Algiers armed with 24-pound cannons that had been cast at Hanover in 1814. [...] The <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> industry declined in the mid-19th century after the discovery that <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> could be mined more cheaply in Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|What {{initially}} interested Allaire in {{the property}} {{now known as}} Historic Allaire Village was the presence of significant quantities of <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ore.</b> This bog ore, so called because of its formation in marshes and swampy areas, was a valuable resource in America before the discovery of vast ore deposits {{in the mountains of}} Northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Unlike the latter ore, bog ore is easily accessible and requires no deep shaft or strip mining to get it.|$|E

5000|$|Iron {{manufacture}} {{before the}} 19th century required charcoal, and Britain’s once-vast forests {{could no longer}} supply enough charcoal for the nation’s increasing need for iron. By 1700, Britain was becoming increasingly dependent on iron imported from its sometimes-adversary Sweden. Britain looked to the seemingly limitless forests of its American colonies to supply Britain with iron. British investors started an iron furnace near Perryville, Maryland, which in 1718 started exporting iron back to Britain. That success prompted formation of more companies, which built numerous iron furnaces around Chesapeake Bay, supplied by <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> <b>ore,</b> which was widespread. By 1751, Virginia and Maryland were exporting 2,950 tons of pig iron to Britain each year; at the time, British iron production was about 20,000 tons per year.|$|E
