5|$|Prolactinomas {{may respond}} to {{dopamine}} agonist treatment–medication that mimics {{the action of}} dopamine on the lactrotrope cells, usually <b>bromocriptine</b> or cabergoline. This approach may improve pituitary hormone secretion {{in more than half}} the cases, and make supplementary treatment unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include <b>bromocriptine,</b> pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Hypoprolactinemia {{can result}} from hypopituitarism, {{excessive}} dopaminergic action in the tuberoinfundibular pathway and ingestion of D2 receptor agonists such as <b>bromocriptine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several medications, {{including}} verapamil and nifedipine, {{as well as}} ergot derivatives such as <b>bromocriptine</b> and pergolide, {{have been}} associated with medication-induced erythromelalgia.|$|E
25|$|A {{woman with}} a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to {{conceive}} with her physician, so she can be carefully evaluated prior to becoming pregnant. This evaluation will include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess {{the size of the}} tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields. As soon as a patient is pregnant, her doctor will usually advise that she stop taking <b>bromocriptine</b> or cabergoline, the common treatments for prolactinoma. Most endocrinologists see patients every two months throughout the pregnancy. The patient should consult her endocrinologist promptly if she develops symptoms — in particular, headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst or urination, or extreme lethargy. <b>Bromocriptine</b> or cabergoline treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if the patient develops symptoms from growth of the tumor during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|At one time, oral {{contraceptives}} {{were thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} prolactinomas. However, this is no longer thought to be true. Patients with prolactinoma treated with <b>bromocriptine</b> or cabergoline may also take {{oral contraceptives}}. Likewise, post-menopausal estrogen replacement is safe in patients with prolactinoma treated with medical therapy or surgery.|$|E
25|$|Different {{medications}} are {{tried in}} an effort to find a combination that is effective for a specific person. Not all people will respond well to the same medications. Medications that have had positive results in some include: diphenhydramine, benzatropine and atropine. anti-Parkinsons agents (such as ropinirole and <b>bromocriptine),</b> and muscle relaxants (such as diazepam).|$|E
25|$|Surgical removal is {{the usual}} {{treatment}} for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other drugs like octreotide (somatostatin agonist) and <b>bromocriptine</b> (dopamine agonist) {{can be used to}} block GH secretion because both somatostatin and dopamine negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} in {{the brain}} have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms {{with the aim of}} delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include <b>bromocriptine,</b> pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Prolactin is {{available}} commercially {{for use in}} animals, but not in humans. It is used to stimulate lactation in animals. The biological half-life of prolactin in humans is around 15–20 minutes. The D2 receptor {{is involved in the}} regulation of prolactin secretion, and agonists of the receptor such as <b>bromocriptine</b> and cabergoline decrease prolactin levels while antagonists of the receptor such as domperidone, metoclopramide, haloperidol, risperidone, and sulpiride increase prolactin levels. D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone, metoclopramide, and sulpiride are used as galactogogues to increase prolatin secretion and induce lactation in humans.|$|E
25|$|The on-off {{phenomenon}} {{is an almost}} invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction {{and the use of}} selegiline hydrochloride and <b>bromocriptine</b> may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa.|$|E
25|$|Ketamine {{has been}} found to act as a potent partial agonist of the high-affinity state of the human and rat {{dopamine}} D2 receptors in multiple studies. Its apparent potency for this action {{is similar to that of}} its NMDA receptor antagonism. However, there are also contradictory data, with studies finding an affinity of ketamine of >10,000nbsp&nM for the regular human and rat D2 receptors, and direct interactions with the D2 receptor are controversial. Moreover, whereas D2 receptor agonists like <b>bromocriptine</b> are able to rapidly and powerfully suppress prolactin secretion, subanesthetic doses of ketamine have not been found to do this in humans and in fact have been found to significantly and dose-dependently increase prolactin levels. Imaging studies have shown mixed results on inhibition of striatal raclopride binding by ketamine in humans, with some studies finding a significant decrease and others finding no such effect. However, changes in raclopride binding may be due to changes in dopamine concentrations induced by ketamine rather than binding of ketamine to the D2 receptor.|$|E
500|$|L-DOPA {{treatment}} cannot {{restore the}} dopamine cells {{that have been}} lost, but it causes the remaining cells to produce more dopamine, thereby compensating for the loss to at least some degree. In advanced stages the treatment begins to fail because the cell loss is so severe that the remaining ones cannot produce enough dopamine regardless of L-DOPA levels. [...] Other drugs that enhance dopamine function, such as <b>bromocriptine</b> and pergolide, are also sometimes used to treat Parkinsonism, {{but in most cases}} L-DOPA appears to give the best trade-off between positive effects and negative side-effects.|$|E
500|$|... poisoning, {{sympathomimetic}} toxicity, or worsening psychiatric condition. The condition {{most often}} confused with serotonin syndrome is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features {{which can make}} differentiating them difficult. In both conditions, autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status develop. However, they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction (serotonin excess vs dopamine blockade). Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity. Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine. Dopamine receptor blockade (NMS) has a slow onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a neuroleptic drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as <b>bromocriptine.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Dopamine is the {{chemical}} that normally inhibits prolactin secretion, so doctors may treat prolactinoma with <b>bromocriptine,</b> cabergoline or Quinagolide drugs that act like dopamine. This type of drug {{is called a}} dopamine agonist. [...] These drugs shrink the tumor and return prolactin levels to normal in approximately 80% of patients. [...] Both have {{been approved by the}} Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. <b>Bromocriptine</b> is associated with side-effects such as nausea and dizziness and hypotension in patients with already low blood pressure readings. [...] To avoid these side-effects, it is important for <b>bromocriptine</b> treatment to start slowly.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bromocriptine</b> {{treatment}} {{should not}} be interrupted without consulting a qualified endocrinologist. [...] Prolactin levels often rise again in most people when the drug is discontinued. In some, however, prolactin levels remain normal, so the doctor may suggest reducing or discontinuing treatment every two years on a trial basis. [...] Recent studies have shown increased success in remission of prolactin levels after discontinuation, in patients having been treated for at least 2 years prior to cessation of <b>bromocriptine</b> treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Cabergoline is also {{associated}} with side-effects such as nausea and dizziness, but these may be less common and less severe than with <b>bromocriptine.</b> However, people with low blood pressure should use caution when starting cabergoline treatment, as the long half-life of the drug (4–7 days) may inadvertently affect their ability to keep their blood pressure within normal limits, creating intense discomfort, dizziness, and even fainting upon standing and walking until the single first dose clears from their system. [...] As with <b>bromocriptine</b> therapy, side-effects may be avoided or minimized if treatment is started slowly. [...] If a patient's prolactin level remains normal for 6 months, a doctor may consider stopping treatment. [...] Cabergoline should not be interrupted without consulting a qualified endocrinologist.|$|E
2500|$|Parkinsonian tremor drug {{treatment}} involves L-DOPA and/or dopamine-like {{drugs such as}} pergolide, <b>bromocriptine</b> and ropinirole; They can be dangerous, however, as they may cause symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, clonus, and in rare instances tardive (late developing) psychosis. Other drugs used to lessen parkinsonian tremor include amantadine and anticholinergic drugs like benztropine ...|$|E
2500|$|Specific {{drugs that}} have been studied in sleep bruxism are clonazepam, levodopa, amitriptyline, [...] <b>bromocriptine,</b> [...] pergolide, clonidine, propranolol, and l-tryptophan, with some showing no effect and others appear to have {{promising}} initial results; however, {{it has been suggested}} that further safety testing is required before any evidence-based clinical recommendations can be made. When bruxism is related to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression, adding buspirone has been reported to resolve the side effect. Tricyclic antidepressants have also been suggested to be preferable to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in people with bruxism, and may help with the pain.|$|E
2500|$|Forms of {{treatment}} {{that have been}} tested with variable reports of success include prismatic adaptation, where a prism lens is worn to pull {{the vision of the}} patient towards the left, constrained movement therapy where the [...] "good" [...] limb is constrained in a sling to encourage use of the contralesional limb. Eye-patching has similarly been used, placing a patch over the [...] "good" [...] eye. Pharmaceutical treatments have mostly focused on dopaminergic therapies such as <b>bromocriptine,</b> levodopa, and amphetamines, though these tests have had mixed results, helping in some cases and accentuating hemispatial neglect in others. Caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) has been shown to bring about a brief remission in some cases. however this technique has been known to elicit unpleasant side-effects such as nystagmus, vertigo and vomiting.|$|E
