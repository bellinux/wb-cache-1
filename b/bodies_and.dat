In an online survey, 1287 Dutch women answered questions concerning dispositional mindfulness, <b>body</b> comparison, <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction. Results showed that body comparison was related negatively to both dispositional mindfulness <b>and</b> <b>body</b> satisfaction, whereas the two latter variables were related positively.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to explore how cloth, the <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement are able to communicate possible symbolic meaning in Loïe Fuller’s Serpentine Dance film and Moderat’s Rusty Nails music video. The study further attempts to establish the characteristics of fashion film to include cloth, the <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement and provide a methodology that locates fashion film as a sign system using a visual semiotic analysis framework. The films were then compared and contrasted to determine similarities and differences in their use of cloth, the <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement. The findings from the film analysis suggest that cloth, the <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement communicate symbolic meaning in the films based on their associated meanings that are generated {{both inside and outside the}} film context. By focussing on cloth, the <b>body</b> <b>and</b> movement as primary communicators (rather than secondary or supporting communicators) in film, new meanings can be interpreted from their interrelationship.
