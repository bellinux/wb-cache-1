5|$|Along {{with other}} {{mountains}} in southwestern Wyoming, Wilkins Peak {{is part of}} the Green River Formation, a formation of the intermontane Lake Gosiute environment during the Eocene epoch. Similar to its neighboring Aspen Mountain, Wilkins Peak {{is part of the}} Rock Springs Uplift, and some of the largest oil shale and trona <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> the region are located near the mountain. Wilkins Peak also has its own distinct segment of the Green River Formation, which is known as the Wilkins Peak Formation.|$|E

5|$|For {{four years}} the workmen, {{some of whom}} brought their families, lived in 300 {{temporary}} wooden bothies either in a field alongside the offices and workshops, opposite the cemetery, or elsewhere {{along the line of}} the tunnel.

5|$|In 2008, {{a private}} {{hospital}} was proposed {{to be built}} at the North Street. The Fook Kuin Medical Centre would be the largest private hospital in Sabah with 276 beds surpassing the Sabah Medical Centre with 134 <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> Kota Kinabalu once it finished in 2011. The Sandakan Regional Library {{is located in the}} town and is one of three regional libraries in Sabah, the other in Keningau and Tawau.

5|$|Mary Anning (21 May 1799– 9 March 1847) was an English fossil collector, dealer, and {{paleontologist}} {{who became}} known {{around the world}} for important finds she made in Jurassic marine fossil <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> the cliffs along the English Channel at Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset in Southwest England. Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Some bivalves, {{including}} the true oysters, the jewel boxes, the jingle shells, the thorny oysters and the kitten's paws, cement themselves to stones, rock or larger dead shells. In oysters the lower valve may be almost flat while the upper valve develops {{layer upon layer}} of thin horny material reinforced with calcium carbonate. Oysters sometimes occur in dense <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> the neritic zone and, like most bivalves, are filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills form a flat plateau {{dominated}} by hard chert bands, {{made up of}} clay with flints, of Upper Greensand with some remnants of chalk. The cretaceous rocks rest over eroded Jurassic and Triassic beds, with an outcrop of Rhaetian <b>beds.</b> <b>In</b> the western areas the Upper Greensand is devoid of calcareous material but the sands yield fossils of marine bivalves and gastropods (snails) preserved in silica.|$|E

5|$|The {{boys were}} found in their <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> their own room (formerly Sheila's room). They {{appeared}} to have been shot while in bed. The court heard that Daniel had been shot five times {{in the back of the}} head, four times with the gun held within one foot of his head, and once from over two feet away. Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots.|$|E
5|$|The limey oozes and mud {{were later}} lithified into the {{limestone}} and interbedded siltstone of the up-to-300foot (90m)-thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored monoliths {{that are found}} only at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were carved from sandstone <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> the Claron.|$|E
5|$|The walled garden, coach house, and {{dovecote}} {{were retained}} at the public's request {{when the house}} was demolished. On 6September 1974, the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status. The herb garden was planted across the four centre <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These included Artemisia, catmint, Santolina and curry plants. To keep the plants within the beds, each was lined by box in 1983.|$|E

5|$|Their {{search for}} fossils led them west to rich bone <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. From 1877 to 1892, both paleontologists used their wealth and {{influence}} {{to finance their}} own expeditions and to procure services and dinosaur bones from fossil hunters. By {{the end of the}} Bone Wars, both men had exhausted their funds in the pursuit of paleontological supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> the watershed include the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. Ridges of mine waste also {{occur in the}} creek's drainage basin. Mining {{was done in the}} watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E

5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E
5|$|Flood <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> other {{locations}} upstream of Lake Lewis such as Ninemile Creek in Montana and the Sanpoil arm of glacial Lake Columbia show a corresponding regularity of flood deposits {{as well as}} deposit grading and rhythmical repetition to those in Lake Lewis. Since Glacial Lake Columbia remained filled, annual deposits (varves) can be observed between flood deposits. The flood deposits can be distinguished from annually deposited varves by both their thickness {{and the presence of}} materials foreign to the immediate drainage. Atwater reports from 35 to 55 annual varves between flood deposits in Lake Columbia, supporting a period of 35 to 55 years between ice dam failures.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals {{at a rapid}} pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|E
