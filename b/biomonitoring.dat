5|$|The nymphs are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} predators and form an {{important}} part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the <b>biomonitoring</b> of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.|$|E

40|$|Two three-month {{sampling}} programs measuring Cd in {{the environment}} and a <b>biomonitor</b> (Balanus amphitrite) were undertaken in the austral winter of 2002 and summer of 2004 in Ross Creek, North Queensland, Australia. The objective was to test whether the burden of Cd in the <b>biomonitor</b> responded to any variation in the dissolved and particulate phase Cd concentrations in Ross Creek, caused by rainfall variation. The barnacles from the most Cd contaminated site were exposed to a total Cd concentration twice that in winter (93. 6 ng L− 1) than in summer (45. 6 ng L− 1). However, no significant variation was identified for the Cd concentration in the <b>biomonitor</b> between winter (8. 4 mg kg− 1) and summer (7. 4 mg kg− 1). A budget analysis based on a bioenergetic kinetic model indicated that Cd flux from food contributes > 80 % to the Cd concentration in B. amphitrite. A sensitivity analysis showed that physiological characteristics of the <b>biomonitor</b> are the key parameters controlling Cd accumulation in B. amphitrite, rather than the metal concentration in the dissolved or particulate phases.

The selected species {{have the necessary}} prerequisites for use as <b>biomonitors.</b> They are well distributed in all coastal areas of the Beagle Channel and other regional seas, {{they are easy to}} identify and available all year round. The first aim of this preliminary survey is to evaluate the concentrations of Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn present in soft tissues of the selected species in order to have more information on the use of these selected species as possible cosmopolitan <b>biomonitors.</b> Samples were collected in seven stations situated along 170 km of the coast in the tidal zone. The validity of these two species as bioaccumulators was tested. Significant differences between metal concentrations in molluscs from different stations were tested by ANCOVA on log 10 transformed data with body weight as covariate. Multiple comparison tests (MCT) were conducted when significant differences were detected among the stations. In M. chiloensis metal concentrations decreased in the order: Zn > Cu > Pb ≥ Cr while for Nacella metal concentrations decreased in the order: Zn > Cu > Cr > Pb showing good bioaccumulation ability. At present, they can be considered as good candidates as trace metals <b>biomonitors</b> for the studied area. From all the obtained data and statistical analysis (ANCOVA, MCT) the results showed clearly that there is no one site univocally more contaminated (with clearly high levels of metals accumulation in <b>biomonitors)</b> than any other.

[...] The Chapel Hill Consensus Statement stated that average BPA levels in people were above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments.

This is problematic because acute animal exposure studies are used to estimate daily human exposure to BPA, and no studies that had examined BPA pharmacokinetics in animal models had followed continuous low-level exposures.
