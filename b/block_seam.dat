40|$|Oxidative Hydrothermal Dissolution (OHD) is a coal {{conversion}} technique {{developed at}} SIUC that solubilizes coal by mild oxidation using molecular oxygen and hydrothermal water. Products are generally low-molecular-weight organic acids {{that could be}} used as chemical feedstocks. This project examined the influence of coal lithotype composition and pure maceral concentrates on the OHD process with a focus on reaction rate and products. Hand-picked lithotypes (vitrain, clarain, and fusain) from the Herrin, Springfield, and Murphysboro seams, as well as a cannel coal from the Brazil <b>Block</b> <b>seam</b> were subjected to OHD for 8, 16, 30, and 70 min. The 70 -min run was a completion run whereas other times were pulse (incomplete reaction) runs. No significant differences were found in the OHD products even though previous work suggested maceral composition could affect final products. Most samples produced primarily mono- and di-acids due to the rank of the coal (high volatile bituminous). Pulse runs allowed for petrographic examination of the residue. OHD preferentially reacted with vitrinites and liptinites over the inertinites. Collodetrinite generally developed vacuoles before collotelinite whereas collotelinite developed reaction rims by 8 -min. Liptinites developed reaction rims and loss of fluorescence. Semifusinites showed slight reaction rims at 8 min, though generally, inertinites did not display pronounced reaction rims until 30 min. Samples run under hydrolysis conditions revealed vacuoles and reaction rims could be produced with heat and pressure, but OHD conditions accelerate their production. Maceral concentrates produced different OHD products. Vitrinites and inertinites produced a similar suite of products with individual macerals missing a few products. Liptinite macerals (cutinite and sporinite) produced a different suite of products containing aliphatic acids as well as some products common to the vitrinites and inertinites. The cutinite suite was primarily aliphatic containing few aromatic compounds. The sporinite contained a mix of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Vitrinites and inertinites produced a mix of mono-, di-, and tri-acids. Similarities in products between the vitrinites and inertinites are likely due to their origins from similar plant tissues (mostly woody material) that have undergone varying degrees of alteration by partial combustion, oxidation, etc. These similarities suggest that high inertinite coals could potentially produce similar OHD products to coals rich in vitrinite. The different products obtained from the macerals do suggest the potential for the OHD process to be tailored to produce specific compounds by varying the feedstock...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{characteristics}} of coals of Basundhara block of Ib-valley. The {{aim of this study}} is to reconstruct the paleo-environment condition of coal formation. A large number of pillar coal samples from Basundhara block were collected and subjected to detailed petrographic and geochemical studies. The results show that the Basundhara <b>block</b> (Rampur <b>seam)</b> coals are rich in inertinite group macerals. The rank of Basundhara block coals as per ASTM system and according to the mean of random vitrinite reflectance has been found to range between sub-bituminous ‘A’ and high volatile bituminous ‘B’. The proximate analyses exhibit that coals belong to semi-coking to weakly coking range. The ultimate composition shows hydrogen ranges between 4. 87 and 6. 20 %, carbon from 78. 7 to 86. 3 % and oxygen between 7. 26 and 13. 78 %. The nitrogen ranges from 0. 71 to 0. 76 % and sulphur is between 0. 53 and 0. 96 %. The quantitative study of macerals, microlithotypes and mineral matter indicate that these coals originated from the plant communities of highly fluctuating oxic and anoxic moor to oxic (dry) moor with sudden high flooding conditions. Low value of Tissue Preservation Index (TPI) and high value of Gelification Index (GI) indicate peat formation in dry condition...|$|R
40|$|Cavity growth {{occurring}} with crack {{extension and}} coal consumption during UCG processes directly influences the gasification efficiency and the estimated subsidence and gas leakage to the surface. This report presents {{an evaluation of}} the gas energy recovery, coal consumption, and gasification cavity estimation using a proposed stoichiometric method to analyze the coal gasification reaction process. We defined the evaluation parameters of rate of energy recovery and investigated the effects of different parameters using UCG trials conducted with coal <b>blocks</b> and coal <b>seams,</b> adopting different Linking-hole methods and operational parameters. Analyses of results obtained from laboratory experiments and small-scale field trials using V-shaped and L-shaped linking holes, and Coaxial-hole UCG models show that the gasification of Linking-hole models yielded average calorific values of product gas as high as 10. 26, 11. 11 MJ/m 3 (lab.), and 14. 39 MJ/m 3 (field.). In contrast, the Coaxial-hole models under experimental conditions yielded average calorific values of product gas as: 7. 38, 4. 70 MJ/m 3 (lab.) and 6. 66 MJ/m 3 (field.). The cavity volume obtained with Coaxial models was about half of the volume obtained from Linking-hole models. Results obtained for these UCG systems show that the feed gas and linking-hole types can influence coal consumption and product gas energy. Fissure ratios were also investigated. Results confirmed major factors underpinning gasification efficiency. Linking-hole types strongly influenced the development of the oxidization surface and fracture cracks for subsequent combustion in the gasification zone. Estimated gas energy recovery results support experimental observations within an acceptable error range of about 10 %. Moreover, this stoichiometric approach is simple and useful for evaluating the underground cavity during UCG. Based on these results, we proposed a definition of the energy recovery rate, combined with the obtained volumes of gasification cavities that provide a definition of energy recovery and UCG effects. UCGにおいては，炭層内のき裂進展に伴う燃焼空洞の拡大と石炭の消費が重要であり，これがガス化効率や安全性 (地盤沈下，ガス漏洩等) に大きく影響する。本研究では，ガス化効率，回収エネルギーとガス化空洞の評価方法として，化学量論および化学平衡に基づく評価手法を検討した。生成ガス組成と求めたガス化反応式から，石炭の消費量，ガス生産量等を推定する方法である。また，エネルギー回収率を定義し，UCG室内モデル実験及び露天炭鉱の炭層で行った小規模現場実験の結果を評価し，リンキングの方式や注入ガス等のパラメータがガス化効率やガス化空洞の成長に与える影響を検討した。リンキングの方式として，L字，V字，同軸型のUCG実験を行い，ガス化効率の違いと，その原因を明らかにした。すなわち，リンキング型と同軸型モデルを比較すると，リンキング型UCGモデルの方が発熱量が高く，平均発熱量では，前者が 10. 26 / 11. 11 MJ/m 3 (室内) ， 14. 39 MJ/m 3 (現場) であった。一方，同軸型モデル試験では， 7. 38 / 4. 70 MJ/m 3 (室内) と 6. 66 MJ/m 3 (現場) と低い値であった。実験後の空洞体積の直接評価結果でも，リンキング型の方がガス化領域が拡大していることを確認した。リンキング方式の方が，炭層内にき裂を連続的に進展させやすいためと考えられる。また，エネルギー回収率の評価では，実験前後の供試体質量差から求めたエネルギー回収率と比較検討を行った。その結果，両者の誤差は約 10 ％で，検討した手法によりエネルギー回収率や燃焼ガス化領域の石炭消費量を推定できることがわかった。以上の結果より，検討した化学量論法よる回収エネルギー評価手法は簡便で，実用的であることが明らかになった。Special Edition for Coal Energy Technology; Development and Utilization of Coal Energ...|$|R
