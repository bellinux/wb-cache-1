40|$|Magellan spehrical {{harmonic}} {{gravity and}} topography models {{are used to}} estimate lithospheric properties at Alta Regio, Venus, a proposed hotspot with dynamic support from mantle plume(s). Global spherical harmonic and local representations of the gravity field share common properties in the Atla region interms of their spectral behavior over a wavelength band from approximately 2100 to approximately 700 km. The estimated free-air admittance spectrum displays a rather featureless long-wavelength portion followed by a sharp rise at wavelengths shorter than about 1000 km. This sharp rise requires significant flexural support of short-wavelength structures. The Bouguer coherence also displays {{a sharp drop in}} this wavelength band, indicating a finite flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. A simple model for lithospheric loading from above and below is introduced (D. W. Forsyth, 1985) with four parameters: f, the ratio of <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> to top loading; z(sub m), crustal thickness; z(sub l) depth to <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> source; and T(sub e) elastic lithosphere thickness. A dual-mode compensation model is introduced in which the shorter wavelengths (lambda approximately less than 1000 km) might be explained best by a predominance of top loading by the large shield volcanoes Maat Mons, Ozza Mons, and Sapas Mons, and the longer wavelengths (lambda approximately greater than 1500 km) might be explained best by a deep depth of compensation, possibly representing <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> by a dynamic source. A Monte Carlo inversion technique is introduced to thoroughly search out the four-space of the model parameters and to examine parameter correlation in the solutions.

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{exposure}} of road tanker drivers at work to gasoline and some of its components. The occupational hygiene measurements were made in two depots (one in northern Finland and the other in southern Finland) and in 11 service stations of a Finnish oil company during the loading and delivery of road tankers. Of the 21 measurements made, four were taken during top submerged loading of the road tankers and six during <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> at the depot. Eleven measurements were made during delivery at service stations. The duration of measurements varied from 10 to 44 min. The exposure of road tanker drivers to C 3 -C 11 hydrocarbons of gasoline was under 300 mg m~ 3 during <b>bottom</b> <b>loading</b> measurements and during top loading exceeded 300 mg m~ 3 two measurements (50 %). During delivery at service stations the exposure to C 3 -Cn hydrocarbons of gasoline exceeded 300 mg m~ 3 in four measurements (36 %). The exposure of road tanker drivers during delivery depended mainly on the distance between working area and the emission point of discharging vapours from the tank, vents and wind direction. The mean exposures of road tanker drivers to benzene during loading and delivery were 1. 1 - 18 mg m~ 3 in various situations. The mean exposures to «-hexane, to toluene and to xylene were 0. 7 - 6. 0, 1. 4 - 11 and 0. 8 - 4 mg m~ 3, respectively. The exposures to methyl-tert-butyl ether were between 13 and 91 mg m~ 3.
