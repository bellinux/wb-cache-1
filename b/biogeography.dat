5|$|<b>Biogeography</b> (an {{amalgamation}} {{of biology}} and geography) is the {{comparative study of}} the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of <b>Biogeography</b> was established in 1974. <b>Biogeography</b> and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island <b>biogeography,</b> published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E
5|$|<b>Biogeography</b> has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance <b>biogeography</b> and it is a sub-discipline of <b>biogeography.</b> There are also practical applications in the field of <b>biogeography</b> concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E
5|$|<b>Biogeography</b> {{studies the}} spatial {{distribution}} of organisms on the Earth, focusing on such topics as plate tectonics, climate change, dispersal and migration, and cladistics.|$|E

5|$|Biostratigraphy, {{the use of}} fossils to {{work out}} the chronological order in which rocks were formed, is useful to both paleontologists and geologists. <b>Biogeography</b> studies the spatial {{distribution}} of organisms, and is also linked to geology, which explains how Earth's geography has changed over time.|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and <b>biogeography,</b> access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), <b>biogeography</b> (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E
5|$|E. O. Wilson is an American biologist, specialising in {{the study}} of ants, social insects on which he is the world's leading expert. He is known also for his {{pioneering}} work on island <b>biogeography,</b> which relates species richness to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo-Darwinian kin selection as an explanation of co-operation in social animals.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the {{conditions}} that affect its distribution, as its <b>biogeography</b> is as yet unstudied. An assessment of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by half in the face of severe change, but unlikely to change much under less severe scenarios.|$|E
5|$|The <b>biogeography</b> {{demonstrates}} a phylogenetic association, for instance subgenus Hermione having a lowland distribution, but subgenus Narcissus section Apodanthi being montane and restricted to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The remaining sections within subgenus Narcissus include both lowland and mountain habitats. Section Pseudonarcissus, although widely naturalised is endemic to the Baetic Ranges {{of the south}} eastern Iberian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction. Gene flow is variable among coral species. According to the <b>biogeography</b> of coral species gene flow cannot {{be counted on}} as a dependable source of adaptation as they are very stationary organisms. Also, coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E
5|$|A. m. croceum:The Santa Cruz long-toed {{salamander}} (A. m. croceum) is most {{closely related to}} the 'coastal' or 'western' subspecies. This conclusion is the most parsimonious biogeographic explanation with nearest populations of A. m. macrodactylum separated by approximately 300km across the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, California. The isolated endemic populations are listed as an endangered subspecies. Based on the <b>biogeography</b> and molecular clock calibrations, this subspecies may have been separated from the remainder of the distribution since the Miocene, molecular clock calibrations estimating 13.9 million years of separation.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in <b>biogeography,</b> anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{nations are}} {{beginning}} to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study {{of the effects of}} fishing on seamount communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the <b>biogeography,</b> biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evolutionary}} theory continues to develop. Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes sense of the geologic record, <b>biogeography,</b> parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Progressively more {{sophisticated}} scientific technology has aided {{the development of}} contemporary botanical offshoots in the plant sciences, ranging from the applied fields of economic botany (notably agriculture, horticulture and forestry), to the detailed examination of the structure and function of plants and their interaction with the environment over many scales from the large-scale global significance of vegetation and plant communities (<b>biogeography</b> and ecology) through to the small scale of subjects like cell theory, molecular biology and plant biochemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early plant ecology. Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the <b>biogeography</b> and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (limnology) and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E
5|$|Wallace was a {{prolific}} author. In 2002, a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of Wallace's publications. He found that Wallace had published 22 full-length books {{and at least}} 747 shorter pieces, 508 of which were scientific papers (191 of them published in Nature). He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on <b>biogeography</b> and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology. An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{travel by}} naturalists in the early-to-mid-19th century {{resulted}} in a wealth of new information about the diversity and distribution of living organisms. Of particular importance {{was the work of}} Alexander von Humboldt, which analyzed the relationship between organisms and their environment (i.e., the domain of natural history) using the quantitative approaches of natural philosophy (i.e., physics and chemistry). Humboldt's work laid the foundations of <b>biogeography</b> and inspired several generations of scientists.|$|E
5|$|At least 1300 cicada {{species are}} {{distributed}} worldwide {{with the majority}} being in the tropics. Most genera are restricted to a single biogeographical region and many species have a very limited range. This high degree of endemism {{has been used to}} study the <b>biogeography</b> of complex island groups such as in Indonesia and the Orient. There are about 200 described species in Australia and New Zealand, around 150 in South Africa, over 170 in America north of Mexico, at least 800 in Latin America, and over 200 in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe, and a single species is in England, the New Forest cicada, Melampsalta montana, which also occurs in continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the <b>biogeography</b> of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group selection was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island <b>biogeography</b> and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of <b>biogeography</b> with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E
5|$|Many eusauropods, {{including}} Dinheirosaurus {{have been}} found in the Late Jurassic of Europe. The sauropods are from {{around the base of the}} Tithonian as based on the presence of Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. One sauropod, a diplodocid currently based on an unnamed specimen including vertebrae and some bones, is clearly different from Dinheirosaurus and Losillasaurus, confirming the presence of a least two and possibly more diplodocids in the Late Jurassic of Spain and Portugal. This is unique in the variety of diplodocoids in all Europe, with the only other genera possibly non-diplodocoid (Cetiosauriscus), or classified in Rebbachisauridae. This suggests that the <b>biogeography</b> of primitive sauropods is incomplete, with possible primitive eusauropods and diplodocids surviving in the Late Jurassic, potentially until the Berriasian.|$|E
5|$|Over the 18th and 19th centuries, {{biological}} sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began {{to connect the}} animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for <b>biogeography,</b> ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided {{a new perspective on}} the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation {{and the rise of the}} germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of plant ecology was pioneered {{in the late}} 19th century by botanists such as Eugenius Warming, who produced the hypothesis that plants form communities, and his mentor and successor Christen C. Raunkiær whose system for describing plant life forms is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as temperate broadleaf forest changes by a process of ecological succession was developed by Henry Chandler Cowles, Arthur Tansley and Frederic Clements. Clements is credited {{with the idea of}} climax vegetation as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of ecosystems to biology. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) produced accounts of the <b>biogeography,</b> centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of Alfred Wegener's (1880–1930) theory of continental drift 1912 gave additional impetus to comparative physiology {{and the study}} of <b>biogeography</b> while ecology in the 1930s contributed the important ideas of plant community, succession, community change, and energy flows. From 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as Eugene Odum (1913–2002) formulated many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, emphasising relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) as key factors in the field. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{was first}} {{described}} as Agaricus muscarius β regalis by Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum, published in 1821. In 1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo treated it as {{a variety of}} Amanitamuscaria. Edmund Michael, in 1903, became the first to consider it a distinct species. In 1941, Jean-Edouard Gilbert suggested a complete reorganization of the genus Amanita in his world monograph of the genus, and moved it to Amanitaria as A.muscaria var. regalis. In his original (1949) version of Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Rolf Singer considered it a subspecies of A.muscaria, but noted {{that it may be}} regarded as a separate species; in the fourth edition (1986), he listed it as a distinct species. A.regalis is classified in a section of Amanita within the genus, a grouping of related Amanitas that have a ring on the stem (or remnants thereof), and a bulb at the base of it. More recently, a Japanese group studied the <b>biogeography</b> of A.muscaria and related species, and, using molecular phylogenetic analysis, concluded that the taxon should be considered a grouping of A.muscaria, rather than a distinct species. However, as of 2012, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list the taxon as Amanita regalis.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with <b>biogeography</b> and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and {{the relative importance of}} genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, <b>biogeography</b> and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's {{geographic}} isolation for 80 million years and island <b>biogeography</b> has influenced {{evolution of the}} country's species of animals, fungi and plants. Physical isolation has not caused biological isolation, and this {{has resulted in a}} dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species. About 82% of New Zealand's indigenous vascular plants are endemic, covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family. The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New Zealand and 40% of these are endemic. The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps, or by southern beech in cooler climates. The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are tussock.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about the <b>biogeography</b> of the spinosaurids. Since Suchomimus was {{more closely related to}} Baryonyx (from Europe) than to Spinosaurus—although that genus also lived in Africa—the distribution of spinosaurids cannot be explained as vicariance resulting from continental rifting. Sereno et al. proposed that spinosaurids were initially distributed across the supercontinent Pangea, but split {{with the opening of the}} Tethys Sea. Spinosaurines would then have evolved in the south (Africa and South America: in Gondwanaland) and baryonychines in the north (Europe: in Laurasia), with Suchomimus the result of a single north-to-south dispersal event. It has also been suggested that baryonychines could be the ancestors of spinosaurines, which appear to have replaced the former in Africa. In 2006, it was demonstrated that Iberia was near northern Africa during the Early Cretaceous; some researchers have argued that the Iberian region was a stepping stone between Europe and Africa, which is supported by the presence of baryonychines in Iberia. The direction of the dispersal between Europe and Africa is still unknown, and subsequent discoveries of spinosaurid remains in Asia and Australia indicate that it may have been complex.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} species similar in {{appearance}} to G.maritimus: G.arenophilus, G.decipiens, G.flavus, G.fulgens and G.pseudofulgens. G.arenophilus and particularly G.fulgens {{are the most}} similar. Though G.maritimus and G.arenophilus show similarities in their <b>biogeography</b> and ecology, the typically slightly smaller G.arenophilus differs from G.maritimus morphologically. While G.maritimus has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, G.arenophilus can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with G.maritimus typically displaying larger warts. Like G.maritimus, G.fulgens has been recorded growing on sand-dune heathland; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of G.maritimus. However, G.fulgens requires soil rich in peat and must grow among moss. Moreover, {{there are a number}} of morphological differences; G.maritimus mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on G.fulgens stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on G.maritimus. G.fulgens var. luteicystis is even more distinct from G.maritimus than the nominate variety. Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different clades within Gymnopilus, suggesting ecological convergence between G.arenophilus and G.maritimus, and morphological convergence between G.fulgens and G.maritimus.|$|E
5|$|Wallace, {{following}} {{on earlier}} work by de Candolle, Humboldt and Darwin, made major contributions to zoogeography. Because of {{his interest in}} the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in South America and then in the Malay archipelago. While in the archipelago he identified the Wallace line, which runs through the Spice Islands dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a New Guinea/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote The Geographical Distribution of Animals, which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, Island Life, in 1880 that focused on island <b>biogeography.</b> He extended the six-zone system developed by Philip Sclater for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral origins {{for this}} species stem from eastern North America, where species {{richness}} of ambystomatids are highest. The following biogeographic interpretation on {{the origins of}} A.macrodactylum into western North America is based on a descriptive account of fossils, genetics, and <b>biogeography.</b> The long-toed salamander's closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America. Ambystomatidae was isolated to the southeast of the mid-Continental or Western Interior Seaway during the Cretaceous (~145.5–66 Ma). While three other species of the Ambystomatidae (A.tigrinum, A.californiense, and A.gracile) have overlapping ranges in western North America, the long-toed salamander's closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America. It has been suggested that A.macrodactylum speciated from A.laterale after the Paleocene (~66–55.8 Ma) with the loss of the Western Interior Seaway opening an access route for a common ancestor into the Western Cordillera. Once situated in the montane regions of western North America, species had to contend with a dynamic spatial and compositional ecology responding to the changes in altitude, as mountains grew and the climate changed. For example, the Pacific Northwest became cooler in the Paleocene, paving the way for temperate forest to replace the warmer tropical forest of the Cretaceous. A scenario for the splitting of A.macrodacylum and other western temperate species from their eastern counterparts involves Rocky Mountain uplift in the late Oligocene into the Miocene. The orogeny created a climatic barrier by removing moisture from the westerly air stream and dried the midcontinental area, from southern Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogeography</b> is most keenly {{observed}} on islands, {{which has led}} to the development of the subdiscipline of island <b>biogeography.</b> These habitats are often a more manageable areas of study because they are more condensed than larger ecosystems on the mainland. In 1967, Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson published The Theory of Island <b>Biogeography.</b> This showed that the species richness in an area could be predicted in terms of factors such as habitat area, immigration rate and extinction rate. The theory is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory. The application of island <b>biogeography</b> theory to habitat fragments spurred the development of the fields of conservation biology and landscape ecology.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Hubbell and Michael Rosenzweig {{combined}} {{theoretical and}} practical elements into works that extended MacArthur and Wilson's Island <b>Biogeography</b> Theory - Hubbell with his Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and <b>Biogeography</b> and Rosenzweig with his Species Diversity in Space and Time.|$|E
