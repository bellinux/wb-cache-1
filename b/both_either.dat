5|$|On April 24, Felix Schlag was {{announced}} as the winner. His design featured {{the portrayal of}} Jefferson which would be used on the nickel until 2004, closely conforming to the former president's bust by sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, {{which is to be}} found in Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. However, the model differs from the nickel that was struck for circulation because it featured a view of Monticello from an angle, and a style of lettering officials did not like; Schlag was required to change <b>both.</b> <b>Either</b> through a misunderstanding or an oversight, Schlag did not include his initials in the design; they would not be added until 1966. Production began on October 3, 1938; they were released into circulation on November 15. According to contemporary accounts, the Jefferson nickel was initially hoarded, and it was not until 1940 that it was commonly seen in circulation.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player acquires biomods, nanite-filled {{canisters}} which enhance their physical and mental attributes. There are two types of Biomod canisters in the game; standard canisters and black market versions, <b>both</b> <b>either</b> found in the environment or purchased from certain NPCs; standard and black market biomods cannot be installed in the same slot. Biomods are installed in five different slots representing different parts of the body—"Arm", [...] "Cranial", [...] "Eye", [...] "Leg" [...] and [...] "Skeletal". Each region has three enhancement options the player can activate. Some biomod enhancements are exclusive to either standard or black market Biomods. Biomod abilities range from enhancements to strength and agility to abilities linked to hacking terminals and taking control of hostile robots. Once activated, further biomod canisters can be used to upgrade existing abilities, or uninstall an ability to change it round, deleting and replacing the chosen enhancement with the new one. Biomod abilities tied to abilities such as cloaking use up the a portion of the player's energy bar when activated.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{available}} ways {{to treat people}} with PTSD, with most people resulting to psychologists as a preferred option, this is mainly {{because this is the}} most comfortable solution. Psychologists offer the option for an individual to open up, in an environment filled with positive vibes {{in order for them to}} determine the roots of their issues. There is also the option of art therapy, this was created by a man called Adrian Hill, in 1942 and is one of the earliest forms of treatment. [...] This treatment is very beneficial to those with an open mind, it involves individuals to speak to a psychologist specialising in art, and the two <b>both</b> <b>either</b> paint, sculpt or any other forms of art. Another form of treatment, is treatment through medications; these medications aim to enhance their moments of happiness and reduce their moments of stress and anxiety. Some of these medications include fluoxetine, paroxetine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), benzodiazepines and glucocorticoids. Obviously resulting to medications is a last resort, but unfortunately this type of therapy can be the matter of rehabilitating someone, meaning that the don’t have to live with these PTSD symptoms for the remainder of their life which is not a preferred way of life.|$|E

50|$|As the {{aircraft}} approaches retreating blade stall conditions, it will shudder and the nose {{will begin to}} pitch up.

Recovery involves lowering the collective pitch, relieving forward pressure on the cyclic or more commonly, <b>both.</b> <b>Either</b> of these control movements should restore the proper attached airflow over the retreating blade thus generating lift again. This is normally an automatically corrected condition if one just 'lets go' of the controls.|$|E
