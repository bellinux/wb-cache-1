50|$|A {{cylinder}} mower or reel mower carries a fixed, horizontal cutting blade at the desired height of cut. Over {{this is a}} fast-spinning reel of blades which force the grass past the cutting bar. Each blade in the <b>blade</b> <b>cylinder</b> forms a helix around the reel axis, and the set of spinning blades describes a cylinder.|$|E
50|$|The term 'boss' {{when used}} in {{engineering}} can also relate to a finishing edge around (usually) a circular opening that allows the opening to locate onto, or within another opening thus locating or joining two items together {{with a view to}} the location or joining being temporary or semi-permanent.A common everyday example of a boss is the housing of the rotation spindle in a washing machine drum, or on a cylinder lawn mower {{at the end of the}} cutting <b>blade</b> <b>cylinder</b> which may house a bearing set to allow the cylinder to rotate through one plane, but held firm in another plane.|$|E
40|$|The shape {{effect of}} {{molybdenum}} disulfide nanoparticles suspended in water-based nanofluids with mixed convection flow inside a channel filled with saturated porous medium is studied. The radiation effect is also considered. One {{of the boundary}} walls of the channel is oscillating in its own plane. Four different shapes (platelet, <b>blade,</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and brick) of molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles inside a water, chosen as a conventional base fluid are used. The partial differential equations governed the problem are solved analytically by using perturbation method. Solutions for velocity and temperature are obtained and discussed graphically. A comparison of different shapes of molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles is analyzed. Results show that, nanoparticles with platelet and cylinder shapes have the highest thermal conductivity and viscosity compared to blade and brick shapes...|$|E
50|$|A typical hole punch, {{whether a}} single or {{multiple}} hole punch, {{has a long}} lever {{which is used to}} push a <b>bladed</b> <b>cylinder</b> straight through a number of sheets of paper. As the vertical travel distance of the cylinder is only a few millimeters, it can be positioned within a centimeter of the lever fulcrum. For low volume hole punches, the resulting lever need not be more than 8 cm for sufficient force.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} keep the wear pattern as even as possible, and to help prevent any {{particles}} in the angle between <b>blade</b> and <b>cylinder,</b> all except the smallest machines use oscillating doctor blades. The entire doctor blade assembly oscillates from side to side. The oscillation, flexibility of the blade, and the various possible misalignments and problems {{due to a lack of}} stiffness may result in the failure to achieve the desired angle of contact between the <b>blade</b> and the <b>cylinder,</b> or at least a failure to consistently achieve this desired angle.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the mixer {{parametric}} {{modeling system}} software {{was developed by}} using VB which was taken as the foreground development program, and the paper combined with ANSYS software to create the finite element model of mixer <b>blade</b> and <b>cylinder</b> for the following numerical simulation of the flow field and parameter optimization of mixer. The software user interface was developed by VB and the pre-process model was created by invoking APDL of ANSYS in background. Therefore, the operation of modeling, meshing, component-building of mixer <b>blade</b> and <b>cylinder</b> were completed by using APDL and the graphic and text were outputted and displayed on the mixer parametric modeling system user interface which was developed by VB. Practice proved that it is convenient to modify the mixer solid model created by the parametric design language of ANSYS due to the similar structure...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} alumina {{nanoparticles}} on the heat transfer performance of an oscillating heat pipe (OHP) was investigated experimentally. A binary mixture of ethylene glycol (EG) and deionized water (50 / 50 by volume) {{was used as}} the base fluid for the OHP. Four types of nanoparticles with shapes of platelet, <b>blade,</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and brick were studied, respectively. Experimental results show that the alumina nanoparticles added in the OHP significantly affect the heat transfer performance and it depends on the particle shape and volume fraction. When the OHP was charged with EG and cylinder-like alumina nanoparticles, the OHP can achieve the best heat transfer performance among four types of particles investigated herein. In addition, even though previous research found that these alumina nanofluids were not beneficial in laminar or turbulent flow mode, they can enhance the heat transfer performance of an OHP.|$|E
30|$|Cavitation erosion (CE), {{which is}} the {{predominant}} cause {{for the failure of}} overflow components, can be frequently observed in fluid machinery such as ship propellers and rudder <b>blades,</b> the <b>cylinder</b> liners of marine diesel, turbine impellers and various pumps. Corrosive ocean environment will accelerate the cavitation damage of the overflow parts of ships and drilling platforms. CE has become the central technical problems of the fluid equipment, which threatens the safety of the equipment, reduces the efficiency and increases the cost [1, 2]. Therefore, improving the CE resistance of the materials in fluid machinery has significant economic benefits.|$|R
50|$|A {{cylindrical}} {{radial turbine}} resembling the <b>blades</b> of a <b>cylinder</b> mower {{is embedded in}} the upper surface of the wing with its axis parallel to the wingspan, leaving approximately 2/3 of the turbine's outer diameter exposed with the remainder being enclosed in a trough formed at the leading edge and terminating in a comma-shaped wedge.|$|R
50|$|Used in reel or <b>cylinder</b> mowers, <b>cylinder</b> <b>blades</b> are {{composed}} of three to seven helical blades welded in a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel, creating a scissor-like cutting action. Unlike other types of mower blades, reel/cylinder blades cannot be replaced; therefore, a broken blade requires replacement of the entire mower. For dull or rusty blades, cleaning and sharpening kits are available.|$|R
30|$|In {{the current}} investigation, the {{particle}} shape {{effect on the}} heat transfer performance of an OHP was investigated experimentally. Ethylene glycol (EG) {{was used as the}} base fluid. Four types of nanoparticles with shapes of platelet (9 nm), <b>blade</b> (60 nm), <b>cylinder</b> (80 nm), and brick (40 nm) were studied to determine whether the optimum particle shape exists for the maximum heat transport capability of the OHP.|$|R
50|$|While {{the press}} is in operation, the {{engraved}} cylinder is partially immersed in the ink tray, filling the recessed cells. As the cylinder rotates, it draws excess ink onto its surface and into the cells. Acting as a squeegee, the doctor <b>blade</b> scrapes the <b>cylinder</b> before it makes contact with the paper, removing the excess ink from the non-printing (non-recessed) areas and leaving in the cells {{the right amount of}} ink required. The position of the blade relative to the nip is normally variable.|$|R
5000|$|Important process {{variables}} in gravure coating & printing are the rotational position {{at which the}} blade wipes the cylinder; the angle that the blade makes with the tangent to the cylinder at the contact point; and the pressure applied to the blade. [...] Fine adjustment of in-and-out position, independently on left and right, must also be possible, in order to compensate for any misalignment between <b>blade</b> geometry and <b>cylinder</b> axis. These requirements are fulfilled by a doctor blade assembly which includes a doctor blade holder.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of several}} {{developmental}} approaches is the researchers’ major {{preoccupation with the}} DARRIEUS wind turbine. This paper presents the first approach and results of a wide computational investigation on the aerodynamics of a vertical axis DARRIEUS wind turbine based on the MAGNUS effect. Consequently, wind tunnel tests were carried out to ascertain overall performance of the turbine and two-dimensional unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were generated to help understand the aerodynamics of this new performance. Accordingly, a moving mesh technique was used where the geometry of the turbine <b>blade</b> was <b>cylinders.</b> The turbine model was created in Gambit modeling software and then read into fluent software for fluid flow analysis. Flow field characteristics are investigated for several values of tip speed ratio (TSR), in this case we generated a new rotational speed ratio between the turbine and cylinder (δ = ωC/ωT). This new concept based on the MAGNUS approach provides the best configuration for better power coefficient values. The positive results of Cp obtained {{in this study are}} used to generate energy; on the other hand, the negative values of Cp could be used in order to supply the engines with energy...|$|R
50|$|The head of {{the machine}} was 30 ft long and 7 ft wide and 8 ft high and {{weighted}} about 30 tons. The head had a plough blade for cutting the top part of the trench {{to a depth of}} about 2 ft, raising the excavated soil and pushing it to the sides of the trench. The lower part of the trench was cut to a depth of 2 ft by a cylindrical cutter superficially resembling the cutting <b>blade</b> of a <b>cylinder</b> lawnmower. Conveyors raised the excavated soil which was added to the plough's deposits {{at the side of the}} trench. The overall depth of the trench was 5 ft and the spoil provided an additional cover of about 2 ft.|$|R
40|$|Pitch {{bearings}} of {{wind turbines}} are large, grease-lubricated rolling bearings that connect the rotor blades with the rotor hub. They {{are used to}} turn the rotor blades to control the power output and/or structural loads of the turbine. Common actuators turning the <b>blades</b> are hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> or electrical motor / gearbox combinations. In order to design pitch actuator systems {{that are able to}} turn the blades reliably without imposing an excessive power demand, it is necessary to predict the friction torque of pitch bearings for different operating conditions. In this paper, the results of torque measurements under load are presented and compared to results obtained using different calculation models. The results of this comparison indicate the various sources of friction that should be taken into account for a reliable calculation model...|$|R
40|$|Measurements were {{conducted}} in an acoustic wind tunnel to determine vortex noise of nonrotating circular cylinders and NACA 0012 airfoils. Both constant-width and spanwise tapered models were tested at a low turbulence level. The constant-diameter cylinder and constant-chord airfoil also were tested in the turbulent wake generated by an upstream cylinder or airfoil. Vortex noise radiation from nonrotating circular cylinders at Reynolds numbers matching those of the rotating-blade tests {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on surface conditions and Reynolds number. Vortex noise of rotating circular <b>cylinder</b> <b>blades,</b> operating with and without the shed wake blown downstream, could be predicted using data for nonrotating circular cylinders as functions of Reynolds number.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to {{examine the effect of}} a periodic variation in the angle of attack on heat transfer at the leading edge of a gas turbine <b>blade.</b> A circular <b>cylinder</b> was used as a large-scale model of the leading edge region. The cylinder was placed in a wind tunnel and was oscillated rotationally about its axis. The incident flow Reynolds number and the Strouhal number of oscillation were chosen to model an actual turbine condition. Incident turbulence levels up to 4. 9 percent were produced by grids placed upstream of the cylinder. The transfer rate was measured using a mass transfer technique and heat transfer rates inferred from the results. A direct comparison of the unsteady and steady results indicate that the effect is dependent on the Strouhal number, turbulence level, and the turbulence length scale, but that the largest observed effect was only a 10 percent augmentation at the nominal stagnation position...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} unsteady near-wake flows on, {{and close}} to, the thick trailing edges of turbine <b>blades,</b> circular <b>cylinders</b> and similar bodies. Subsonic surface base pressures, and Eckert-Weise energy separation in the wake, are principal {{manifestations of the}} same phenomenon. Both are {{a direct result of}} von Kármán vortex shedding. The subsonic flow past a turbine blade having a thick trailing edge is still not well-predicted and this results from a lack of understanding of the flow past the trailing edge and into the wake. It is here argued that von Kármán vortex shedding is the principal cause of the subsonic base pressure deficit and the related energy separation in the wake. Parallels {{can be found in the}} behaviour of elastically-mounted circular cylinders and the caudal fin oscillation propelling fish. These should also affect supersonic flows although the physical causes are different. At supersonic speeds the trailing edge base pressure, and the energy separation in the downstream wake, exhibit different characteristics from the subsonic behavior and need to be treated differently. For supersonic flows, shock waves from a blade trailing edge may impinge on the adjacent suction surface adversely affecting the downstream boundary layer. Supersonic flows most often involve shock and expansion waves. Exotic vortex shedding also has an important role to play. In addition to experimental observation, the guidance of an analytical framework is needed. The eventual goal is accurate computational prediction for validation of computer models and prediction of flow behaviour.

40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, grit removal, septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and grit removal. Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both coarse screens and fine screens. Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of coarse screen). Coarse Screens Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of coarse screens include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} coarse screens. Fine Screens Fine screens are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for fine screens are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very fine screens with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after coarse or fine screens can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. Comminutors and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and grinding devices are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. Comminutors consist of a rotating slotted cylinder through which wastewater flow passes. Solids that are too large to pass through the slots are cut by <b>blades</b> as the <b>cylinder</b> rotates, reducing their size until they pass through the slot openings...|$|R
40|$|Suction surface flow {{visualization}} on {{turbine blades}} at subsonic and transonic speeds showed robust streamwise streaks on a lengthy time-average basis. The normal flow past a circular cylinder {{is a more}} canonical case and testing was undertaken at high speeds on a 38 mm diameter cylinder and at low speeds on a 152 mm diameter cylinder. The lateral spacing between streaks on cylinders had been predicted by Kestin and Wood and the present tests gave excellent agreement with their theory. Although their work was related to unswept circular cylinders it also provides an excellent benchmark for sweep effects on cylinders and turbomachinery blading. The observations of streaks on turbine <b>blades</b> and unswept <b>cylinders</b> provided a firm basis for referencing the influence of sweep. Experiments on a circular cylinder were performed over a range of sweep angles from zero to 61 ° giving results for lateral spacing and angular orientation of the streaks. At high-sweep angles the {{results are consistent with}} those of Poll. The introduction of sweep brings consideration {{of a wide range of}} instabilities; streamwise and crossflow structures are present on the suction surface of turbine blades. Although the available information on fine structures comes from surface flow visualization, work is now progressing on hot wire measurements away from the surface. The aim is to demonstrate the relationship between the structures and the surface traces. Analysis of the data is complemented by ongoing theoretical work. It is also hoped to provide information on the changing behavior of the vertical structures as the sweep angle is increased. The streamwise disturbance in the unswept case was found to be stationary in nature and to be resilient, often persisting from leading edge to trailing edge. Crossflow instability becomes more significant as sweep is increased. It grows aggressively and rapidly, being predominantly of a traveling nature, and has a major role to play in the transition process. The observed streaks could be of particular concern for the thermal design of turbine blades. It is hoped to give designers confidence about the flow regimes they might anticipate for a given sweep angle and particularly of when and how the aggressive crossflow instability mode is likely to be encountered.
