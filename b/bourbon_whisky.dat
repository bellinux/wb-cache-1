5000|$|The idea of {{drinking}} whisky with food is considered outré by many, {{but there is}} a growing interest in pairing whiskies with complementary foods.

Jake Wallis Simons compares <b>whiskies</b> in <b>bourbon</b> casks to white wines, due to their lighter flavor, and those in sherry casks to red wines, with their greater fruitiness.

5000|$|By {{this stage}} in his career, Welles found it nearly {{impossible}} to obtain work as a director (his last directorial credit {{to be released in}} his lifetime was a TV movie for West German television, which aired in 1978); and from the mid-1970s onwards, his only acting credits were cameos appearances, mostly in low-budget fare. Accordingly, he was heavily dependent for his income on a series of adverts, for products of variable quality. These included Carlsberg beer, Domecq sherry, Sandeman's port (playing the [...] "Sandeman Don" [...] in a TV advertisement), Jim Beam <b>bourbon</b> <b>whisky,</b> Nikka Japanese G&G whisky, Perrier mineral water, Nashua photocopiers, Vivitar instant cameras, Preview pay-per-view television, the board game Dark Tower, Eastern Air Lines, Texaco, Post's Shredded Wheat, and perhaps most infamously, Findus frozen foods. Although Welles had made adverts for his entire career, beginning when he was a well-known radio actor in the 1930s, by the late 1970s these had become his staple, and he was often (anonymously) directing them as well. John Annarino, the advertising executive handling the Paul Masson account at the time, remembered that Welles, [...] "was eager for almost any kind of work in the early 1980s, hoping to complete a film that was languishing in some European vault (The Other Side of the Wind)." [...] Welles was often highly dismissive of the work, pointing out that he tended to be hired [...] "to give a little class" [...] to such productions.|$|E

40|$|Whisky {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} beverages. There are many types of whisky, for example, Scotch, Irish, and American <b>whisky</b> (called <b>bourbon).</b> The <b>whisky</b> market is highly diversified, and, because of this, it is important to have a method which would enable rapid quality evaluation and authentication of the type of whisky. The aim of this work was to compare 3 methods: an electronic nose based on the technology of ultrafast gas chromatography (Fast-GC), comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC), and sensory evaluation. The selected whisky brands included 6 blended whiskies from Scotland, 4 blended whiskies from Ireland, and 4 bourbons produced in the USA. For data analysis, peak heights of chromatograms were used. The panelists who took part in sensory evaluations included 4 women and 4 men. The obtained data were analyzed by 2 chemometric methods: partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and discrimination function analysis (DFA). E-nose and GC × GC allowed for differentiation between whiskies by type. Sensory analysis did not allow for differentiation between whiskies by type, but it allowed giving consumer preferences...|$|R
50|$|A Manhattan is a {{cocktail}} made with whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters. Commonly used whiskeys include rye (the traditional choice), Canadian <b>whisky,</b> <b>bourbon,</b> blended whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey. The cocktail is often stirred and strained into {{a cocktail}} glass, {{where it is}} garnished with a Maraschino cherry with a stem. A Manhattan can also be served on the rocks in a lowball glass. The whiskey-based Manhattan {{is one of five}} cocktails named for one of New York City's five boroughs, but is perhaps most closely related to the Brooklyn cocktail, a mix utilizing dry vermouth and Maraschino liqueur in place of the Manhattan's sweet vermouth, as well as Amer Picon in place of the Manhattan's traditional bitters.|$|R
50|$|Traditional views {{insist that}} a Manhattan {{be made with}} American rye whiskey. However, more often than not, it is made with <b>bourbon</b> or Canadian <b>whisky.</b> The Manhattan is subject to {{considerable}} variation and innovation, and is often {{a way for the}} best bartenders to show off their creativity. Some shake the ingredients with ice in a cocktail shaker instead of stirring it, creating a froth {{on the surface of the}} drink. Angostura is the classic bitters, but orange bitters or Peychaud's Bitters may be used. Some make their own bitters and syrups, substitute comparable digestifs in place of vermouth, specialize in local or rare whiskeys, or use other exotic ingredients. A lemon peel may be used as garnish. Some add juice from the cherry jar or Maraschino liqueur to the cocktail for additional sweetness and color.|$|R
