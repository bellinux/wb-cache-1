50|$|The <b>black-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> {{belongs to}} the order Passeriformes and the family Turdidae. The species is a {{monotypic}} taxon - it has been hypothesized that it forms {{part of a larger}} superspecies, classified together with Tickell's thrush (T. unicolor) and the grey-backed thrush (T. hortulorum). It was previously thought to have conspecificity with the latter species of thrush. The <b>black-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> was first described by Edward Blyth in 1847 and was found in the lower Bengal region.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus dissimilis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Turdidae. It is found from {{north-eastern}} India to northern Vietnam. Although {{both male and female}} birds have the same colour on their lower parts, the upper section of males is mostly black in colour, while females are mostly grey-brown. Thus, the bird's common name refers to the colour of the male bird's breast. They tend to live in forests located at high altitude.|$|E
5000|$|The {{call of the}} <b>black-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "sweet mellow" [...] and [...] "melodious", with their musical phrases spanning 3-8 notes. They consume insects, molluscs and berries. The food they gather is usually from the ground, although they occasionally fly to fruit trees. Their time of breeding differs depending on the country in which they are situated. Black-breasted thrushes in India reproduce from April to July; those in Myanmar do so from April to June; in China, these birds mate from May until June.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> {{has been}} placed on the Least Concern {{category}} of the IUCN Red List, even though its population has been decreasing throughout the last ten years. This is because the reduction in the estimated population is not swift enough to merit Vulnerable status under the IUCN criterion for population trend, which is a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations The population decline has been attributed to continuing [...] "destruction and degradation" [...] of the bird's natural habitat. The size of its distribution range is over 752000 km2.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black-breasted</b> <b>thrush</b> is 22 cm to 23.5 cm long in total, {{including}} its tail. Whereas the lower parts {{are the same}} colour for both genders, the upper and middle parts are where they differ. For males, the section spanning from their head {{to the back of}} their neck and breast area is black, and the remaining areas at the top are slate gray. On the other hand, females are gray-brown from their eyes to their tail, and the section from their throat to their breast is a [...] "diffused" [...] shade of buff.|$|E
40|$|We report our {{inventories}} of birds observed and collected at three field sites from {{the province of}} Guizhou, southeastern China. Our findings detailed herein complement our previous ornithological surveys from Guangxi province, {{as part of a}} comprehensive biotic survey of the region. Of 153 total bird species recorded, 17 were new for the province, among which several taxa of conservational importance, such as: Golden Pheasant Crysolophus pictus, Tawny Fish-Owl Ketupa flavipes, <b>Black-breasted</b> <b>Thrush</b> Turdus dissimilis, Fujian Flycatcher Niltava davidii, Red-tailed Laughingthrush Garrulax milnei, and Slaty Bunting Latoucheornis siemsseni. These records provide the most recent insight into the current status of the habitats and the avian biodiversity of an important, yet sparsely surveyed and reported biogeographic region...|$|E
