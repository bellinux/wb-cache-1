50|$|The <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> is a tick-borne Phlebovirus first {{discovered}} in a tick (Haemaphysalis intermedia) taken from a paralyzed goat in Bhanjanagar, India in 1954. <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> in humans was first documented in 1974 when Charles Calisher was working with the virus in a lab and contracted it himself. His experience with the virus was mild and included symptoms of mild aching in muscles and joints, moderate headache, slight photophobia. The <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> {{is a member of}} the <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> serocomplex and {{is a member of the}} Bunyaviridae family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> is {{transmitted}} from ticks and has furthermore mainly been isolated from the ticks of the genera Dermacentor and Haemaphysalis, although it can be transmitted by any Ixodidae ticks. <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> is not known to be transmitted between humans.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> {{produces}} febrile {{illness in}} humans with symptoms including photophobia, vomiting, meningoencephalitis, and slight or partial paralysis.|$|E
50|$|The Lone Star {{virus is}} a highly {{divergent}} Bunyavirus, which is carried and transmitted by the Lone Star Tick, Amblyomma americanum. This is the same vector that transmits the SFTS virus, and the newly discovered <b>Bhanja</b> and Heartland <b>virus.</b>|$|R
50|$|The SFTS {{virus is}} a tick-borne {{phlebovirus}} {{in the family}} Bunyaviridae. It {{appears to be more}} closely related to the Uukuniemi virus serogroup than to the Sandfly fever group. It {{is a member of the}} <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> serocomplex.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> {{has been}} found in {{vertebrate}} animals, most commonly in sheep, goats, cattle, African hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris), and African ground squirrels (Xerus erythropus). It has been known to be pathogenic in small animals and children and can also affect adult humans.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> {{has been}} {{isolated}} in Europe, including: Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Eastern Slovakia, in Asia, including: India, Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and in Africa, including Senegal, Guinea, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central Africa, Kenya, Somali. There {{is a possibility}} that migratory birds play a role in spreading the virus by carrying infected ticks on them to new regions.|$|E
50|$|The Heartland virus (HRTV) is a tick-borne {{phlebovirus}} of the <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> serocomplex {{discovered in}} northwestern Missouri by Dr. Scott Folk of Heartland Regional Medical Center in St. Joseph, Missouri. The virus was first proven to infect humans in June 2009 when two farmers, living 60 mi apart, presented with fever, fatigue, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.The Lone Star Tick transmits {{the virus to}} people when feeding on blood.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} twelve viruses {{have been}} linked to disease in humans: Alenquer virus, <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus,</b> Candiru virus, Chagres virus, Naples virus, Punta Toro virus, Rift Valley fever, Sicilian virus, Toscana virus, Uukuniemi virus, Heartland virus (the first tick-borne phlebovirus known to cause disease in the Western Hemisphere, discovered in 2009), and the Sandfly Turkey virus (discovered in China in 2011).They cause symptoms ranging from short self-limiting fevers, such as pappataci fever, to encephalitis and fatal haemorrhagic fever.|$|E
40|$|The genomes of <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> (BHAV) and Palma virus (PALV) two tick-borne viruses {{hitherto}} {{grouped into}} the <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> antigenic complex of the Bunyaviridae {{were determined by}} pyrosequencing. Phylogenetic analysis groups all three segments of BHAV and PALV into a distinct clade of tick-borne phleboviruses together with the newly described severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus and Uukuniemi virus. The terminal signature sequences which are signatures for taxonomic grouping and important for virus replication and RNA transcription show marked differences in the L- and S-segments...|$|E
40|$|The sera of cattle, goats, {{dogs and}} crows from the Colombo area were tested for {{antibodies}} against seven arboviruses {{of the families}} Togaviridae and Bunyaviridae by a plaque-reduction neutralization microtest, using Vero cells and a stable line of pig kidney (PS) cells. The overall percentages of positive sera among the mammals were: Bhanja, 92. 5 %; Calovo (Batai), 30. 6 %; Sindbis, 13. 8 %; Langat, 4. 8 %; Tahyna, 3. 9 %; West Nile, 1. 6 %. Among the birds, 23. 8 % had antibodies to <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> and 9. 5 % to Sindbis. No antibodies against tick-borne encephalitis virus were found. The results show {{that at least two}} members of the Bunyaviridae family (Bhanja and Calovo) are highly endemic in Colombo...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> (BHAV) is {{pathogenic}} {{for young}} domestic ruminants {{and also for}} humans, causing fever and affections of the central nervous system. This generally neglected arbovirus of the family Bunyaviridae is transmitted by metastriate ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis, Dermacentor, Hyalomma, Rhipicephalus, Boophilus, and Amblyomma. Geographic distribution of BHAV covers southern and Central Asia, Africa, and southern (partially also central) Europe. Comparative biogeographic study of eight known natural foci of BHAV infections in Europe (in Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Slovakia) has revealed their common features. (1) submediterranean climatic pattern with dry growing season and wet mild winter (or microlimatically similar conditions, e. g., limestone karst areas in central Europe), (2) xerothermic woodland-grassland ecosystem, with plant alliances Quercetalia pubescentis, Festucetalia valesiacae, and Brometalia erecti, involving pastoral areas, (3) presence {{of at least one}} of the tick species Haemaphysalis punctata, Dermacentor marginatus, Rhipicephalus bursa, and/or Hyalomma marginatum, and (4) presence of â‰¥ 60 % of the 180 BHAV bioindicator (157 plant, 4 ixodid tick, and 19 vertebrate spp.). On that basis, Greece, France (southern, including Corsica), Albania, Spain, Hungary, European Turkey, Ukraine (southern), Switzerland (southern), Austria (southeastern), Germany (southern), Moldova, and European Russia (southern) have been predicted as additional European regions where BHAV might occur...|$|E
40|$|Viruses in {{the family}} Bunyaviridae infect {{a wide range of}} plant, insect, and animal hosts. Tick-borne bunyaviruses in the Phlebovirus genus, {{including}} Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus (SFTSV) in China, Heartland virus (HRTV) in the United States, and <b>Bhanja</b> <b>virus</b> in Eurasia and Africa have been associated with acute febrile illness in humans. Here we sought to characterize the growth characteristics and genome of Lone Star virus (LSV), an unclassified bunyavirus originally isolated from the lone star tick Amblyomma americanum. LSV was able to infect both human (HeLa) and monkey (Vero) cells. Cytopathic effects were seen within 72 h in both cell lines; vacuolization was observed in infected Vero, but not HeLa, cells. Viral culture supernatants were examined by unbiased deep sequencing and analysis using an in-house developed rapid computational pipeline for viral discovery, which definitively identified LSV as a phlebovirus. De novo assembly of the full genome revealed that LSV is highly divergent, sharing < 61 % overall amino acid identity with any other bunyavirus. Despite this sequence diversity, LSV was found by phylogenetic analysis {{to be part of a}} well-supported clade that includes members of the Bhanja group viruses, which are most closely related to SFSTV/HRTV. The genome sequencing of LSV is a critical first step in developing diagnostic tools to determine the risk of arbovirus transmission by A. americanum, a tick of growing importance given its expanding geographic range and competence as a disease vector. This study also underscores the power of deep sequencing analysis in rapidly identifying and sequencing the genomes of viruses of potential clinical and public health significance...|$|E
