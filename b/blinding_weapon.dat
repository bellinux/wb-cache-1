50|$|Russian {{military}} doctrine refers to new physical principles weapons, while describing {{the main features}} of these weapons as comparable in effect to nuclear weapons but more acceptable in political terms. It was reported in October 2016 that Russia had tested a new electronic weapon, based on new physical principles, that uses directed-energy to neutralize on-board aircraft equipment, unmanned combat aerial vehicles, and precision weapons. In 2015, it announced a <b>blinding</b> <b>weapon,</b> Rook, that creates a disabling light interference, {{which can be used}} against night-vision equipment. It uses ultraviolet, infrared, and visible regions of the spectrum and can change the width and direction of the beam to target specific objects. In November 2016, Putin states that the new physical principles weapons comply with all of the country's international obligations.|$|E

50|$|The {{aim of the}} Convention and its Protocols is {{to provide}} new rules for the {{protection}} of civilians from injury by weapons that are used in armed conflicts and also to protect combatants from unnecessary suffering. The convention covers fragments that are undetectable in the human body by X-rays, landmines and booby traps, and incendiary <b>weapons,</b> <b>blinding</b> laser <b>weapons</b> and the clearance of explosive remnants of war.

5000|$|Peter Herby, head of {{the legal}} {{division}} of the [...] "mines-arms unit" [...] at the International Committee of the Red Cross, suggests that such a device may raise {{many of the same}} issues as have arisen with laser-based <b>blinding</b> <b>weapons,</b> known as [...] "dazzlers" [...] because of the intense light with which they temporarily or permanently blind people.

[...] Herby states that he is not familiar with this specific device.|$|R
50|$|Weapons {{designed}} to cause permanent blindness are {{banned by the}} 1995 United Nations Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> Laser <b>Weapons.</b> The dazzler is a non-lethal weapon intended to cause temporary blindness or disorientation and therefore falls outside this protocol.|$|R
50|$|The United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW or CCWC), {{concluded}} at Geneva on October 10, 1980, {{and entered}} into force in December 1983, seeks to prohibit or restrict {{the use of}} certain conventional weapons which are considered excessively injurious or whose effects are indiscriminate. The full title is Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects.

25|$|After the Korean War, North Korea {{maintained}} a powerful, but smaller military force {{than that of}} South Korea. In 1967 the KPA forces of about 345,000 were {{much smaller than the}} South Korean ground forces of about 585,000. North Korea's relative isolation and economic plight starting from the 1980s has now tipped the balance of military power {{into the hands of the}} better-equipped South Korean military. In response to this predicament, North Korea relies on asymmetric warfare techniques and unconventional weaponry to achieve parity against high-tech enemy forces. North Korea is reported to have developed a wide range of technologies towards this end, such as stealth paint to conceal ground targets, midget submarines and human torpedoes, <b>blinding</b> laser <b>weapons,</b> and probably has a chemical weapons program and is likely to possess a stockpile of chemical weapons. The Korean People's Army operates ZM-87 anti-personnel lasers, which are banned under the United Nations Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> Laser <b>Weapons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ZM-87 Portable Laser Disturber is a Chinese {{electro-optic}} countermeasure {{neodymium laser}} device.

Laser <b>weapons</b> intended to <b>blind</b> combatants have also been developed, but are currently banned by the Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> Laser <b>Weapons,</b> although low-power versions designed to dazzle rather than blind have been developed experimentally.

50|$|Development of the ZM-87 {{began in}} the late 1980s. The device was first {{publicly}} revealed at a defense exhibition in the Philippines in May 1995 and, soon after, in Abu Dhabi, where the weapon gained publicity. In October 1995, during the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, Protocol IV, banning <b>blinding</b> laser <b>weapons,</b> was passed, making the ZM-87 illegal. In April 1997 a United States Naval officer sustained a retinal injury consistent with exposure to this sort of laser fired from the Russian freighter Kapitan Man at a Canadian Forces helicopter in which he was a passenger. This became known as the Strait of Juan de Fuca laser incident. By December 2000, known production of ZM-87 has ceased. However, in 2003 North Korea is reported to have used the ZM-87 to illuminate two United States Army Apache helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Lasers {{of all but}} {{the lowest}} powers can {{potentially}} be used as incapacitating weapons, through their ability to produce temporary or permanent vision loss in varying degrees when aimed at the eyes. The degree, character, and duration of vision impairment caused by eye exposure to laser light varies {{with the power of}} the laser, the wavelength(s), the collimation of the beam, the exact orientation of the beam, and the duration of exposure. Lasers of even a fraction of a watt in power can produce immediate, permanent vision loss under certain conditions, making such lasers potential non-lethal but incapacitating weapons. The extreme handicap that laser-induced blindness represents makes the use of lasers even as non-lethal weapons morally controversial, and weapons designed to cause blindness have been banned by the Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> Laser <b>Weapons.</b> Incidents of pilots being exposed to lasers while flying have prompted aviation authorities to implement special procedures to deal with such hazards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract While {{a number}} of {{significant}} campaigns since the early 1990 s have resulted in bans of particular weapons, at least as many equivalent systems have gone unscrutinized and uncondemned by transnational campaigners+ How can this variation be explained? Focusing on the issue area of arms control advocacy, this article argues that an important influence on the advocacy agenda within transnational networks is the decision-making process not of norm entrepreneurs nor of states but of highly connected organizations within a given network+ The argument is illustrated through a comparison between existing norms against landmines and <b>blinding</b> laser <b>weapons,</b> and the absence of serious current consideration of such norms against depleted uranium and autonomous weapons+ Thus, the process of organizational issue selection within nongovernmental organizations ~NGOs! and international organizations ~IOs! most central to particular advocacy networks, rather than the existence of transnational networks around an issue per se, should be a closer focus of attention for scholars interested in norm creation in world politics+ A number of transnational advocacy campaigns have emerged in recent years ben...|$|R

60|$|It was a {{singular}} irony that my Lady Castlemaine should be {{largely responsible for}} the existence of that party. In her hatred for Clarendon, and her <b>blind</b> search for <b>weapons</b> that would slay the Chancellor, she had, if not actually invented, at least helped to give currency to the silly slander that Clarendon had deliberately chosen for Charles a barren queen, so as to ensure the ultimate succession of his own daughter's children. But she had never thought to see that slander recoil upon her as it now did; she had never thought that a party would come to rise up in consequence that would urge divorce upon the King at the very moment when he was consumed by passion for the unattainable, artlessly artful Frances Stewart.|$|R
50|$|The CCW is a {{framework}} convention with five protocols, which ban or restrict {{the use of}} various types of weapons that are deemed to cause unnecessary suffering, or affect either soldiers or civilians indiscriminately. The weapons covered include: weapons that leave undetectable fragments in the body (Protocol I - 1980); mines, booby-traps and other devices (Protocol II - 1980, amended in 1996); incendiary weapons (Protocol III - 1980); <b>blinding</b> laser <b>weapons</b> (Protocol IV - 1995); and explosive remnants of war (Protocol V - 2003). As of 1 February 2011, 113 States had joined the Convention. The GICHD has observer status at the High Contracting Parties meetings {{taking place in the}} framework of the CCW.The Centre has an observer status and assists High Contracting Parties, at their request, in their efforts to minimise human suffering caused by landmines, booby traps and other devices, explosive remnants of war and cluster munitions, which are covered by the ongoing work of the CCW and its Group of Governmental Experts. Since 1999, the GICHD has supported the CCW, primarily by providing expert advice in order to promote the development of, and compliance with, the obligations contained in CCW. In addition, the GICHD is administering the CCW Sponsorship Programme, as mandated by the High Contracting Parties at the CCW Third Review Conference in November 2006.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of nanotechnology {{has provided a}} variety of noble metal nanostructures with unique optical properties that are useful for different application fields. Metal nanoparticles present strongly enhanced optical properties associated with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) : here, {{the effect on the}} optical properties of metal nanostructures is investigated by different techniques. The large AuNPs absorption cross section coupled with fast nonradiative decay rate and low radiative decay efficiency make them perfect converter of light into heat: the high temperatures reached can be used for photothermal terapy, light conversion in thermal and photovoltaic devices, but our interest has been focused on optical limiting application against cw laser. The study of the thermal conversion of incoming light could be useful {{for the protection of the}} human eye from accidental or intentional damage. A good protection device should be a “smart material” able to activate the protection at high energy with a large dynamic range and in a wide wavelength interval. The last property is especially required in the case of military use, for protection against laser pointing devices or <b>blinding</b> <b>weapons</b> of unpredictable emission wavelength. In this case, passive filters, commonly used for specific wavelengths, are useless because of their selectivity and lack of tuning properties. The irradiation of an optical limiting material with a focused cw laser beam induces energy absorption rapidly converted into a local heating and a temperature gradient corresponding to a refractivity index variation across the sample. In this way, even a flat sample acts as a focusing or defocusing lens and spreads the laser beam. We have studied different aspects of the phenomenon, as described below, to achieve the application in a solid state device with a broadband range of activity and a fast response time. In the first experimental part of this thesis different nanostructures have been synthesized, starting from gold nanoparticles, nanoshells and nanorods with different aspect ratio, in order to obtain plasmonic resonances in a wide range of the visible spectrum. Nanostructures has been then manipulated for the functionalization with a thiolated-fulleropyrrolidine (FULP-SH) to combine the thermal relaxation process with a faster one. A useful material for protection devices should preferably be in the solid state, so a thorough study has been centered on polycarbonate (PC) as matrix because of its good optical qualities. Film production and nanoparticles embedding require a specific study of the functionalization and transfer of nanostructures synthesized in aqueous solvent. We characterized the morphology and their linear optical properties with conventional techniques: transmission electron microscopy (TEM) gives information about the dimension of nanostructures to implement the synthesis, UV-Vis spectroscopy correlates structures with extinction properties and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of the nanosystems defines the correct functionalization with organic molecules. In the second part of the project we studied and tried to improve the nonlinear optical response of these promising systems in order to obtain different characteristics. Using z-scan technique we define the nature of the defocusing mechanism, confirming the self-defocusing behavior and giving nonlinear efficiency parameters to compare different systems. Optical power limiting measurements give direct information on the protection ability of these systems. Thanks to the easy functionalization of nanostructures we figured out promising properties for a solid state protection device. First we have studied the optical limiting properties of gold nanoparticle solutions identifying a thermal response as the main mechanism. We have then compared these results with those obtained by coupling gold nanoparticles with a thiolated-fulleropyrrolidine. In this way we wanted to combine the thermal process with a faster one, to permit a stronger reduction of transmittance and a better limiting efficiency. Such a strategy has been proved to be effective for improving OL through a quite different mechanism that is activated in a much shorter time. Optical limiting measurements have been conducted on gold nanoparticles embedded in polycarbonate with good results that have been compared to the colloidal solutions. The study of a different matrix for optical limiting studies has been attempt: silk fibroin. This matrix has been selected because of the easier nanoparticles embedding. Furthermore it can be applied for instance in controlled release of drugs, thanks to the biocompatibility and gradual solubility of silk matrix. Preliminary studies discourage the use of this system for optical limiting but different application could be considered. The fibroin-nanoparticles solution can be easily transform to obtain a porous structure: the idea is to employ this matrix as a sensor for liquid samples with SERS characterization, taking advantage of the high porosity and the presence of plasmonic structures. In the last part we tried to compare thermal properties revealed by our systems through cw laser excitation to nonlinear optical properties classically expressed by pulsed laser excitation. Optical limiting related to photoacoustic measurements allow us to discriminate the contribution of the absorption and to choose the best system with higher linear transmittance and lower threshold for nonlinear behavio...|$|R
