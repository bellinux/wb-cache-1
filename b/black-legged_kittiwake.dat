5|$|As an {{isolated}} island on major migration routes, Lundy has a rich bird life {{and is a}} popular site for birdwatching. Large numbers of <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwake</b> (Rissa tridactyla) nest on the cliffs, as do razorbill (Alca torda), guillemot (Uria aalge), herring gull (Larus argentatus), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis), common blackbird (Turdus merula), robin (Erithacus rubecula) and linnet (Carduelis cannabina). There are also smaller populations of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and raven (Corvus corax).|$|E
25|$|The {{spectacular}} sea cliffs around Noup Head {{are home}} to thousands of seabirds including 60,000 common guillemot and <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwake,</b> 30,000 razorbill and numerous Atlantic puffin and black guillemot. During the 1990s the black rat (Rattus rattus) may have been present although {{they have not been}} recorded since. mice, and the Orkney vole are present however, as are European otters.|$|E
25|$|Some {{birds are}} {{permanent}} residents; northern birds migrate south to open waters near New England, southern California, Japan, Korea {{and the western}} Mediterranean. Common murres rest on {{the water in the}} winter and this may have consequences for their metabolism. In the <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwake</b> (which shares this winter habit) resting metabolism is 40% higher on water than it is in air.|$|E

25|$|The furry-legged rock {{ptarmigan}} {{is a widespread}} bird in this region. Typical birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and snowy owl. Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwake,</b> ruddy turnstone, red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary redpoll, common redpoll, snow bunting, and Lapland longspur. The snow goose, common and king eider, and red-throated loon are some species of waterfowl {{that live in the}} region.|$|E
500|$|About thirty {{species of}} bird are found on Svalbard, {{most of which}} are migratory. The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabirds, with about 20 million {{individuals}} during late summer. The most common are little auk, northern fulmar, thick-billed murre and <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwake.</b> Sixteen species are on the IUCN Red List. Particularly Bjørnøya, Storfjorden, Nordvest-Spitsbergen and Hopen are important breeding ground for seabirds. The Arctic tern has the furthest migration, all the way to Antarctica. Only two songbirds migrate to Svalbard to breed: the snow bunting and the wheatear. Rock ptarmigan is the only bird to overwinter. Remains of Predator X from the Jurassic period have been found; it is the largest dinosaur-era marine reptile ever found—a pliosaur estimated to have been almost [...] long.|$|E

40|$|During the 2002 season, weather {{conditions}} on the Isle of May were poor, with much more rain than usual, and strong westerly and easterly winds. Common guillemots, razorbills, Atlantic puffins and <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwakes</b> experienced lower breeding success relative to the long-term average, although common guillemots and razorbills did better than in 2001. In contrast, northern fulmars had their best season since 1995, and European shags had their best season ever. Timing of breeding for all species was normal, although European shags and <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwakes</b> started breeding earlier than in 2001. Return rates for razorbills and Atlantic puffins were close to the long-term average, whereas those for common guillemots and <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwakes</b> were around 6...|$|R

5000|$|The {{kittiwake}}s (genus Rissa) are two {{closely related}} seabird {{species in the}} gull family Laridae, the <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwake</b> (R. tridactyla) and the red-legged kittiwake (R. brevirostris). The epithets [...] "black-legged" [...] and [...] "red-legged" [...] are used to distinguish the two species in North America, but in Europe, where R. brevirostris is not found, the <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwake</b> is often known simply as kittiwake, or more colloquially in some areas as tickleass or tickleace. The name is derived from its call, a shrill 'kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake'. The genus name Rissa is from the Icelandic name Rita for the <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwake.</b>|$|E

40|$|Organochlorines can {{possibly}} cause toxic effects in birds. In this thesis, levels and relationships between health parameters, organochlorine contaminants (OCs) and body condition index (BCI) in <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwakes</b> and common eiders were assessed. Immunoglobulin Y (IgY) levels and Oxidative stress (OSI) were measured in plasma of birds, {{and served as}} health parameters. OCs were measured in pectoral muscle of birds and served as explanatory variables. In addition, BCI, {{as a measure of}} the physiological state in individual birds were examined. Variations in IgY, OSI, OCs and BCI were also assessed between years, months and two locations (Liefdefjorden and Kongsfjorden) on Svalbard. Organochlorine pesticides explained a significant amount of variation in plasma IgY in <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwakes,</b> while polychlorinated biphenyls explained a significant amount of variation in plasma IgY in common eiders. OSI was only explained by polychlorinated biphenyls in <b>black-legged</b> <b>kittiwakes.</b> Regarding variations in IgY, OSI, OCs and BCI between years, months and locations no clear conclusions were made. However, a pattern of no increase of bioavailable OCs were suggested for Kongsfjorden. Also, higher concentrations of some OCs were seen in Kongsfjorden compared to Liefdefjorden...|$|R
