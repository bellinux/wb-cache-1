40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the current state}} and trends of bipolar and <b>BIMOS</b> high power devices and their packages. At the highest power and voltage levels the GCT/IGCT is consolidating its position and is gradually substituting the GTO. The maximum GCT ratings in terms of current and voltage are more deter-mined by market forces than by device physics. Improved plasma engineering in high voltage IGBTs will lead to further reduction of losses. The ma-jor tools for plasma engineering are discussed. Modern simulation tools allow to determine the performance limits of a Si diode at a given voltage. Today's best diodes are not very far from this limit. The diode is a performance limiting element in many high voltage circuits. Recent progress in SiC technology makes hybrid solutions consisting of Si switches and SiC diodes feasible. Module packages for traction applications still need some derating due to extreme power cycling reli-ability requirements. Better thermo-mechanical matching has lead to major improvements.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis describes a novel 4 -quadrant DC-DC converter, supplied by a 28 V DC voltage source, with an output voltage which may be continuously varied between + 180 V and - 180 V DC. A prototype 1. 2 kW DC-DC converter was designed and built, with emphasis given to the optimization of both the converter size and efficiency. This was achieved {{by means of a}} computer-based simulation study, which determined the optimal switching frequency {{and the size of the}} inductors and capacitors while maintaining a high unit efficiency. Mos-Gated <b>Bimos</b> switches, which feature the advantages of both mosfets and bipolar transistors, were developed to achieve high switching speed during high power operation. A digital-controlled DC servo system based on a 16 -bit Intel 8086 microprocessor was designed, to provide both motor speed and position control. Speed and position detection circuits and the structure and the interfacing arrangement of the microprocessor system were designed and constructed. Several control algorithms were developed, including PID Control Algorithm and Current-Limit Control Algorithm. Based on open loop transfer function of the system, derived through mathematical modelling using the State-Space Averaging Method, the constants for the control algorithms were obtained to meet the dynamic performance specified for the system. Computer simulation was carried out to assist with the design of the converter and the control system. It is expected that drives into which the novel converter is incorporated will find many applications in situations where accurate positional control is required, particularly in battery-operated DC-servo system, such as satellite system, robots and some military vehicles...|$|E
