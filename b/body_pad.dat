50|$|The {{chest and}} arm {{protector}} or arm and <b>body</b> <b>pad</b> {{is designed to}} protect the chest, shoulders, arms, and collarbone area from the impact of pucks and is worn under the hockey jersey. The chest and arm protector has continually become more protective in recent years. In the early days of goaltending, it was much smaller and less protective, consisting mostly of thick felt. In effect, these pads were little better than what baseball catchers wear today. With the advent of better materials such as high density plastics and foams, chest protectors can be made to protect the body from injury. However, even with modern chest protectors, goaltenders still receive bruises and other minor injuries from pucks that hit them in the torso.|$|E
50|$|The <b>body</b> bolster <b>pads</b> {{and front}} sill pads are {{attached}} to the tank with fillet welds. At the rear edge of the front sill pad, a butt weld attaches the front sill <b>pad</b> to the <b>body</b> bolster <b>pad</b> and to the fillet weld attaching the <b>body</b> bolster <b>pad</b> to the tank shell. Fillet welds at the interior and exterior sides of the head brace attach the head brace to the front sill pad, and an exterior fillet weld attaches the head brace to the draft sill. To the rear of the head brace, the draft sill is welded to the front sill <b>pad,</b> <b>body</b> bolster <b>pad,</b> and reinforcing bars.|$|R

2500|$|Because the Fox {{network was}} new {{to the world of}} {{television}} production, a bureaucracy had not yet been established. This enabled the show to take risks and the freedom to try things that the major networks would never permit. The series landed an initial twenty-six episode commitment deal, unheard of for a television comedy. The Tracey Ullman Show debuted on 5 April 1987. Describing the show proved difficult. Creator Ken Estin dubbed it a [...] "skitcom". A variety of diverse original characters were created for her to perform. Extensive makeup, wigs, teeth, and <b>body</b> <b>padding</b> were utilised, sometimes rendering her unrecognisable. One original character created by Ullman back in Britain was uprooted for the series: long-suffering British spinster Kay Clark.|$|R

5000|$|A fatsuit is a bodysuit-like {{undergarment}} used {{to thicken}} {{the appearance of}} an actress or actor of light to medium build into a heavy-set or obese character, in conjunction with prosthetic makeup. Other spellings include fat suit and fat-suit. Fatsuits worn by characters are either deliberately visible or mainly concealed. Most are intended as unseen <b>body</b> <b>padding</b> beneath a costume (e.g., Rosemary Shanahan in Shallow Hal, and Sherman Klump in The Nutty Professor), others appear as realistic flesh and are viewed directly (e.g., Fat Bastard in Austin Powers, and Les Grossman's hands in Tropic Thunder). A fatsuit {{is often used to}} provide comedic effect, as in [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic's music video, [...] "Fat" [...] and the video [...] "Keine Lust" [...] by the German band Rammstein.|$|R

40|$|Lacrosse is a fast-paced {{team sport}} in which players use sticks to pass, catch, {{and run with}} a ball to score goals. The men’s and women’s games are among the fastest growing sports in the United States. A US Lacrosse 2003 participa-tion survey {{estimate}} cited approximately 115 000 players at the youth level, 119 000 {{at the high school}} level, and 24 000 at the college level. 16 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) data show that the number of NCAA teams sponsoring men’s lacrosse increased 24 %, from 170 to 211, between 1993 - 1994 and 2003 - 2004. The increase is even more noteworthy in the women’s game, in which the number of teams almost doubled, from 133 to 258, over the same 11 -year time period. 13 The men’s game is a high-speed, high-collision sport with mandatory helmets, face masks, mouth guards, gloves, and upper <b>body</b> <b>padding</b> required for all field players (Figure 1). The stick, or crosse, is made of wood or synthetic materia...|$|R
50|$|One {{format of}} full contact karate {{competition}} is full contact point karate. It {{is similar to}} non full contact competition karate; the only difference from light contact and semi contact karate bouts {{is that if the}} opponent is knocked out, it is a win instead of a disqualification for excessive contact. Points are scored for clean hits to the specified target zones, and unless there is an evident knockout or knockdown, the referee breaks the bout after each exchange to score the hits. The blows are delivered with full contact, although gloves, foot-pads, and in some cases <b>body</b> <b>padding,</b> are worn. This form of full contact karate competition is mainly found in North America where it originated, although it has a minor following in Europe. It is also similar to the competition format used in Taekwondo, and the sport karate competitions using this format often blur the line between these two related arts.|$|R

Though he has a very active sex life, he is more sexually {{satisfied}} by viewing pornography and masturbating, which enables him to [...] "lose himself".|$|R
50|$|Jamune (Jamune) is a boxer with {{expensive}} upper <b>body</b> <b>padding.</b> In battle, he can launch his boxing glove-shaped fists at his opponents. In Episode 8, he is Barlock's lackey, helping him retrieve the scientist hostage that the Neros Empire had taken. He appears in episode 14, falsely attacking Madonna so that Metalder {{would come to}} her rescue and fall into a trap, and sneaks an attack on Metalder later. He also appears alongside Chuubo in Episode 19. In Episode 21, he battles Metalder one-on-one. Metalder defeats him by discovering his weak spot in his legs and knees. Metalder defeats Jamune with his Metal Tornado move, which knocks Jamune into a lake {{and out of the}} battle. He was restored to full function in Episode 33, but was defeated by Top Gunder during an interrupted training exercise. In Episode 37, he was restored again and made his final appearance while searching the Kirihara building for Metalder and Top Gunder. He was destroyed for good by a fatal shot from Top Gunder.|$|R

5000|$|The five teddybears in {{the series}} are William, Sara, Louise, Robert, and Charles. They wear [...] "brightly-coloured furry suits" [...] and live at No. 8 Green Street, Bearbridge. According to actress Louise Conran, who played Sara, she had to [...] "wear a lycra <b>body</b> suit, <b>padding</b> {{on top of that}} and then the costumes which are about half an inch thick". Since the teddybear masks were {{fastened}} to their faces with glue, the teddybear actors had to keep the masks on the entire day, even when eating dinner.|$|R
50|$|Neutral fats are {{produced}} by the dehydration synthesis {{of one or more}} fatty acids with an alcohol like glycerol. Many types of neutral fats are possible both because of the number and variety of fatty acids that could form part of it and because of the different bonding locations for the fatty acids. An example is a monoglyceride that has one fatty acid combined with glycerol, a diglyceride which has two fatty acids combined with glycerol or a triglyceride which has three fatty acids combined with glycerol. Neutral fats are usually found in the thigh and torso area of the <b>body</b> as <b>padding</b> and insulation to keep warm.|$|R
50|$|There are however {{mechanisms}} in the bulls {{that keep the}} risk of injury much lower. Many of the bulls have continuous pressure airbags, rounded <b>padded</b> <b>body</b> designs and also controls that will control the speed and bucking motion of the mechanical bulls. Also operator training on safety is also provided {{through some of the}} insurance companies that insure mechanical bulls.|$|R
500|$|The writers {{ensured that}} {{although}} they were changing the storyline circumstances, the characters remained the same with minimal changes to their personalities. According to series writer Matt Berry, the time jump allowed the writers {{to work with the}} characters [...] "without most of the baggage they’d accumulated in the earlier years, and put them into starting places so we could move them forward and build in new story arcs." [...] For this reason, the writers treated the season premiere as a pilot, in which, according to Daily, they [...] "could give the women a new drive." [...] Daily identified the Susan character as having undergone the greatest change, stating that she has given up on looking for a [...] "fairy-tale romance" [...] and is emotionally distant in her new relationship. He also stated that the character of Gabrielle has dealt with the biggest change in terms of her circumstances, as she continues to deal with her husband's blindness and their financial problems. Actress Eva Longoria had to gain weight and wear additional <b>body</b> <b>padding</b> for her character's new storyline. Dana Delany stated that her character, Katherine, who was portrayed as an antiheroine in the previous season, is more relaxed following the time jump. However, Delany clarified that while Katherine is now friends with the other characters, she and Bree would become frenemies {{as a result of their}} business partnership. Nicollette Sheridan, commented that Edie, who played an integral role in the season's mystery story arch, is [...] "a lot more conscientious about things , without losing her comedic edge." ...|$|R
50|$|Pain {{medications}} {{often provide}} some reduction of pain, but not complete relief of pain, for those affected by central pain syndrome. Tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline or anticonvulsants such as neurontin (gabapentin) can be useful. Lowering stress levels appears to reduce pain. For regular treatment some people prefer <b>body</b> length heating <b>pads</b> while others rely on warm baths, and most any normal 'hot or cold' help.|$|R
5000|$|Not a [...] "stand-up" [...] goalie, Cheevers could {{often be}} found on his knees or even his side. He perfected this [...] "flopping" [...] style while playing for Rochester during the 1962-63 season. Americans' coach Rudy Migay had Cheevers {{practice}} without his stick, thus requiring him to rely more on using his <b>body</b> and his <b>pads.</b> From that point on Cheevers became one of hockey's best goaltenders.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the time}} of Aeschylus, the boots or buskins worn by the actors were flat. The actors had the same “status” as the chorus. In the 3rd Century BCE, the actors were raised {{to the status of}} heroes and “platform” soles began to be used, {{together}} with a head-dress called an onkos. The raised soles may have induced a stylised way of walking, suited to the rhythm of tragic verse, and the onkos made the actors taller, enhancing visibility. Their <b>bodies</b> were <b>padded</b> so that they did not look too slim. However, some authors believe that this happened later than the 3rd Century BCE. It is also thought that the “teetering gait” is a misapprehension.|$|R
50|$|The goalkeeper {{equipment}} {{has followed}} the same trend, {{becoming more and more}} able to resist to strength of the balls hit by these new generation sticks. Helmets have become compulsory, padding is thicker and of more shock-absorbing (and reflecting) foam material and more areas of the <b>body</b> are <b>padded.</b> The new equipment is very expensive and is often a considerable burden for clubs or individual goalkeepers to purchase. The composition of the hockey ball has also changed, from a leather ball with a seam similar to a cricket ball, to a seamless, usually dimpled hard plastic ball. These plastic balls are cheaper, more durable, more consistent in their behaviour, and are unaffected by water; a key requirement in water-moderated synthetic fields used in elite-level hockey.|$|R
5000|$|Raschel knits do not stretch {{significantly}} {{and are often}} bulky; consequently, they are often used as an unlined material for coats, jackets, straight skirts and dresses. These fabrics can be made out of conventional or novelty yarns which allows for interesting textures and designs to be created. [...] The qualities of these fabrics range from [...] "dense and compact to open and lofty and can be either stable or stretchy, and single-faced or reversible. [...] The largest outlet for the Raschel warp knitting machine is for lace fabric and trimmings. Raschel knitting is also used in outdoors and military fabrics for products such as backpacks.

Fat is the fundamental type of the body's vitality stockpiling. It is important to have a healthy amount of body fat. Overabundance of fat quotient can build danger of genuine wellbeing issues. Anthropometry is a broadly accessible and basic strategy for the appraisal of body composition. Anthropometry measures are weight, height, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist, boundary, biceps, skinfold etc. The human fat percentage is figured by taking anthropometric variables. We proposed a methodology to determine the body fat percentage using R programming and regression formula. We analyzed 10 anthropometric variables and 3 demographic variables. Our study shows that the impact of certain variables has an edge over other in predicting body fat percentage...|$|R
50|$|The Hovercraft Development team quickly {{picked up}} on the LIM concept as well. Their initial {{solution}} was a track shaped like an upside-down T, with the vertical portion consisting of a central concrete section with aluminium stator plates fixed on either side. Their first design concept looked like the fuselage of an airliner with two decks, riding above the stator beam, with the LIM centred {{in the middle of the}} <b>body.</b> Four <b>pads</b> provided lift, arranged two on a side fore and aft and riding on the horizontal surface of the guideway. Four more pads, above the lift pads, were rotated vertically to press against the centre beam and kept the craft centred. A test rig of this layout was built at Hythe, which was filmed in operation by British Pathé in 1963, which also showed a model of the proposed full-sized version.|$|R

5000|$|The DOT-111 tank {{cars are}} {{constructed}} with a draft sill design. Draft sills incorporate the draft gear behind each coupler {{that is designed}} to transfer longitudinal draft (tension) and buff (compression) forces throughout the length of a train. The draft sills are attached to steel pads that are attached to the tank. If the cars do not incorporate a continuous center sill extending {{the entire length of the}} car, the two draft sills at each end are referred to as stub sills, and the tank carries draft forces between couplers. In this case, reinforcing bars may be extended underneath the tank between the draft sills. Body bolsters and their associated <b>body</b> bolster <b>pads</b> centered above the railcar trucks support the tank and protect it against lateral forces. The draft sill center plate serves as the attachment point between the tank car body and the truck assembly. (See schematic cutaway at right.) ...|$|R

She practices body art, but works in different media, including performance art, installation art, sculpture, and film. [...] She also writes poetry. Sometimes her poetry is influenced by her work, and on many occasions it has inspired her work. When Horn returned to the Hamburg academy she continued to make cocoon-like things.

5000|$|Tute Bianche was {{a militant}} Italian social movement, active from 1994 to 2001. Activists covered their <b>bodies</b> with <b>padding</b> {{so as to}} resist the blows of police, to push through police lines, and to march {{together}} in large blocks for mutual protection during demonstrations. The tute bianche movement reached its apex during the anti-G8 protests in Genoa, in July 2001, with a turn-out of an estimated 10,000 protesters in a single [...] "padded block", ironically after a collective decision to go without the white overalls. Shortly after Genoa the Ya Basta Association disbanded, with certain segments reforming into the [...] "Disobbedienti" [...] which literally means [...] "Disobedients". This philosophy includes the occupation and creation of squatted self-managed social centers, anti-sexist activism, support for immigrant's rights and refugees seeking political asylum, {{as well as the}} process of walking together in large formations during demonstrations held in the streets, by force if necessary in case of clashes with police.|$|R

40|$|Obesity is a {{risk factor}} for {{metabolic}} disorders, with its prevalence being increased in the world over the past several decades. Therapeutical interventions for obesity are thus urgently needed. In the present study, we investigated the ef fect of long-term treatment (0. 51 and 5. 1 g/kg/day, 5 days per week for a total of 40 doses) with an herbal formula MCC [which comprises the fruit of Momordica charantia (MC), the pericarpium of Citri reticulata and L-carnitine] in normal diet (ND) and high fat diet (HFD) -fed female ICR mice. Body weight change was monitored {{during the course of the}} experiment. Fat pad indices, plasma glucose and lipid contents, as well as metabolic enzyme activities and mitochon drial coupling efficiency in skeletal muscle were measured at 24 hours after the last dosing. Results showed that HFD increased the <b>body</b> weight, fat <b>pad</b> indices, plasma glucose and lipid contents as well as β -hydroxyacyl-Co A dehydro genase (β -HAD) and carnitine palmitoyl CoA transferase (CPT) activities in skeletal muscle. However, the phos phofructokinase (PFK) activity was decreased in skeletal muscle. MCC treatment reduced the HFD-induced increases in <b>body</b> weight, fat <b>pad</b> indices and plasma lipid contents. MCC treatment only partially reversed the HFD-induced changes in β -HAD and CPT activities, but did not restore the HFD-induced decrease in PFK activity. MCC did not alter the plasma glucose level and mitochondrial coupling efficiency in skeletal muscle of ND and HFD-fed mice. Since MCC formula did not increase activities of energy metabolic enzymes or induce mitochondrial uncoupling, the weight loss effect of MCC is likely related to the reduction of intestinal lipid absorption in HFD-fed mice. </p...|$|R
